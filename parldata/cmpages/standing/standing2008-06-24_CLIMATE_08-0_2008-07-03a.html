discussing the following: Government amendments Nos. 19 and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000509"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Joan Ruddock):</b> It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr.
Atkinson.</div><a name="08070375000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was endeavouring to answer&#151;clearly not successfully &#151;some
questions asked by the hon. Member for Cheltenham. I shall now, once
again, try to clarify just why some of the adaptation
sub-committee&#146;s functions in subsection (5) are to be
deleted.</div><a name="08070375000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, our objection is to the policy role. That was agreed in
the other place. We do believe that the Committee on Climate Change,
through the sub-committee, should be given not the job of commenting on
the adequacy of the Government&#146;s adaptation programme, as under
subsection (5)(a), but rather functions relating to the progress of
implementation. We will come to that when we debate the next clause. We
consider the adaptation programme to be a policy matter and, therefore,
that is ruled out by what I said about policy matters
earlier.</div><a name="08070375000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
we believe should happen is what we have already made provision for in
clause 63, under which the Secretary of State must publish a strategy
for the use of his powers to issue guidance and directions to reporting
authorities. That is a policy issue as well. For that reason, we are
removing subsection (5)(d). I hope that the hon. Member for Cheltenham
will see that there is a coherent theme and that we are removing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>consistently what we regard as policy matters. In
the subsequent clause, there are other functions in which he is
interested.</div><a name="08070375000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070375000510"></a><b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): It is good to be serving under
your chairmanship this afternoon, Mr.
Atkinson.</div><a name="08070375000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the Minister for her comments and her permission for me
to talk to her officials during the break. However, I am afraid that
both her remarks and those conversations reinforced my belief that
while subsection (5), which gives the adaptation sub-committee the duty
to provide expert advice, is being removed, nothing equivalent is being
substituted. Government new clause 4, to which the Minister referred,
puts in place a scrutiny duty subsequent to a Government programme for
adaptation being developed, but I am afraid that I cannot see any
equivalent to the core function of the adaptation sub-committee
described in subsection (5) being replaced. I am afraid that I have to
remain opposed to Government amendment No.
12.</div><a name="08070375000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has not addressed amendment No. 20 a great deal, but I shall
comment on it in passing. During the recent debate in the Chamber on
detention without charge or trial for 42 days, new clauses to the
Counter-Terrorism Bill were moved allowing the Secretary of State, on
making an order under powers to declare reserved power exercisable,
to</div><a name="08070375000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;forthwith
notify...the chairman of the Home Affairs Committee of the House
of Commons...the chairman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights,
and...the chairman of the Intelligence and Security
Committee&#148;,</div><a name="08070375000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">thereby
giving statutory functions to Select Committees. There is a precedent
for including Select Committees in statute and it should be followed in
this
case.</div><a name="08070375000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000511"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> On that latter point, the issue is not at all
comparable. That was a notification process, including a whole range of
Committees. We are talking about one Select Committee being in the
Bill, when we believe that other Select
Committees&#151;indeed, many&#151;would be
relevant.</div><a name="08070375000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman and I differ on the matter, I will say one more
thing to him: new clause 3 will be added to the Bill after clause 55.
That means that when we come to debate clause 55 in part 4, it will be
clear that that part of the Bill deals with adaptation. Therefore, the
new clause and what it tells us about the duties falling within that
section make it clear that this is advice on risk assessment, which is
related to
adaptation.</div><a name="08070375000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000525"></a>The

new clause 4&#151;<i class="I">Reporting on progress in connection with
adaptation.</i></div><a name="08070375000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000526"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b><b class="B"> </b>We have already discussed how the second
aspect of the sub-committee&#146;s role would be to provide scrutiny
of the implementation of the adaptation programme. We set out that
function in new clause 4. I should clarify that the scrutiny of the
programme would be for England and reserved matters only, as the
devolved Administrations have their own adaptation programmes. That new
function of the committee will ensure that Parliament receives regular,
independent reports on the progress that is being made on the
implementation of the objectives, proposals and policies in the
adaptation programme.</div>
<a name="08070375000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The committee
will consider how much is being done by the UK Government, their
agencies and everyone else involved in ensuring that we are adapting to
a changing climate. The committee will report to Parliament every two
years, at the same time as every second report on progress on
mitigation issues under clause 35.</div>
<a name="08070375000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
listened carefully to the calls that have been made for annual progress
reporting, but we do not think that that is justified in the case of
adaptation. Adaptation to a changing climate is a long-term issue. It
takes time for many of the benefits of the programme to be realised and
to be measured against our assessment of the changing climate. Those
assessments are being undertaken on a five-yearly
basis.</div><a name="08070375000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will use our annual public service agreement reporting to highlight any
significant changes and provide a full report under the Bill every
other year. We think that that arrangement is a better use of resources
as it allows us to focus more effort on delivery of the programme.
However, we have introduced a provision that will allow us to bring
forward annual reporting, should that prove to be both practically
worth while and necessary at a later time.</div>
<a name="08070375000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 35(3)
currently requires the Committee on Climate Change to comment on the
Government&#146;s adaptation programme. However, that is now
superseded by new clause 4, so Government amendment No. 13 will remove
those sections. As we are giving the committee a formal role in
providing independent progress reports on the adaptation programme, we
propose, through Government amendment No. 21, to remove the Secretary
of State&#146;s functions under clause 36(3). As we will discuss
later, we have also tabled Government amendment No. 22, which proposes
removing clause 57, which requires the Secretary of State to produce
regular progress reports on
adaptation.</div><a name="08070375000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments will remove the requirements for the Government to produce
regular reports on adaptation as they are no longer necessary. The
Secretary of State will instead respond to the committee&#146;s
progress reports on the adaptation programme at the same time as he
responds in relation to mitigation, which will be by 15
October in the reporting year.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div><a name="08070375000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
existing provisions under clause 36, alongside new clause 4, will
ensure that the reports of the Committee on Climate Change include
advice on progress on adaptation, and the Government will have a duty
to respond to those reports. Government amendment No. 21
thus simply removes duplication from the
Bill.</div><a name="08070375000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
reporting process will improve existing arrangements and ensure
compatibility with the new role of the adaptation sub-committee. It
will ensure that Parliament receives regular independent assessments of
how well the Government are doing in delivering the adaptation
programme, and will require the Government to respond to those. It will
also join up reporting on adaptation and mitigation, which is really
important, and it will provide flexibility for the future if more
frequent reporting is needed.</div>
<a name="08070375000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070375000527"></a><b class="B">Gregory
Barker</b> (Bexhill and Battle) (Con): I will be brief. My
comments on this set of amendments will be similar to those that I made
on the previous group, on which I appreciate that the Minister went
some way to assuage our concerns. Although I recognise that some
tidying up of the Bill is required, we must be careful and judicious
and note what powers we may be diluting in the
process.</div><a name="08070375000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has alluded to this in her comments, but will she say whether
it is the Government&#146;s wish to remove the requirement for the
independent committee to report to Parliament on the
Government&#146;s progress on the adaptation programme? Why is it
necessary to remove the Secretary of State&#146;s duty to give an
assessment to Parliament on the progress that the Government of the day
have made towards meeting their adaptation policies specifically? Will
the Minister assure the Committee that new clause 4 is in no way
inferior in its demands on the Government to the clauses that it will
replace? We would appreciate a degree of clarity on
that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000528"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I have similar concerns about the amendments.
Government amendment No. 13 is a rather strange dilution of the
reporting requirement on adaptation, in that it will no longer be
annual. The Minister argued that mitigation and the associated
long-term strategies justify an annual report by the Secretary of
State, but that somehow adaptation should be excluded from annual
reporting. Adaptation is a matter of current Government policy on flood
budgets, health strategies and transport infrastructure, which, as we
all know, changes from month to month, let alone from year to year, so
I find her argument rather strange. Perhaps she would reiterate exactly
why she thinks that adaptation, in particular, is not a matter for
immediate annual reporting concern.</div>
<a name="08070375000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that Government amendment No. 21 would remove simple
duplication, but that is not quite the case. Clause 56(3), which would
be removed, refers specifically not only to reporting on adaptation,
but</div><a name="08070375000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
progress made towards implementing the objectives, proposals and
policies set out in earlier
programmes.&#148;</div><a name="08070375000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no such wording under new clause 4 or any of the other Government
amendments so, in a sense, the proposal seems to be yet another wriggly
amendment designed to remove the immediate responsibility of the
Government to report on something specific. In this case, it would be
whether they were actually meeting the targets and objectives that they
had set out in previous adaptation programmes. That is important
reporting, and it should stay in the Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000529"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I turn first to what was said by the hon. Member
for Bexhill and Battle. I need to reiterate that we are in no sense
diluting matters. We are removing requirements that existed for the
Government before we decided to give the power to the committee. The
committee will be asked to make an independent assessment of progress
on the Government&#146;s adaptation programme. It will be giving
advice on the progress that is made. There is no way in which such
action will dilute things. Indeed, we would have expected the hon.
Gentleman to understand that an independent committee undertaking such
work is likely to strengthen provisions rather than dilute
them.</div><a name="08070375000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
progress reports will cover all adaptation programmes, past and
present. That is shown by the reference under new clause 4 to
&#147;programmes&#148;. We believe that adaptation requires more
time in respect of the progress that is made. The subject is enormous.
It covers every aspect of our society, country, people and economy in
their adaptation to climate change. We have non-statutory programmes at
present, and we believe that annual reporting is unlikely to give a
proper analysis of what is happening and of the
Government&#146;s
progress.</div><a name="08070375000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am talking about an analysis of the progress made against the programme
that the Government have set. The hon. Member for Cheltenham suggested
that we should retain clause 56(3), but the issues that it covers are
more concerned with policies than progress. I stress that there is no
point in duplication. We need the Government to have an adaptation
programme and for proper scrutiny to be made of its progress.

want to press the Minister on trading schemes. Much of the detail that
we will consider will be set out in regulations. Clause 43 defines the
trading schemes, but does not specify which trading schemes will be
introduced using the enabling powers in later clauses. The Minister
will be aware that the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee
picked up on that and we were disappointed that more detail was not
given at this stage.</div>
<a name="08070375000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point is that the clause could have gone a little further by stating
how the national trading scheme for England will relate to the devolved
trading schemes, and especially how the UK trading scheme will relate
to the EU emissions trading scheme. Who is to rule on the compatibility
of the two trading schemes? Will it be the Secretary of State? A little
more meat on the bones would be very

make a similar point to that of the hon. Member for Vale of York. The
clause seems to give all national authorities the power to begin their
own trading schemes, but it is not clear how they will interact with
each other and, more crucially, the EU ETS. As the Minister will know,
one of the early problems with the EU ETS was a fall in the price of
carbon to a very low level. It is not clear how the carbon price would
be dealt with in the various sub-national and UK-wide schemes, as
opposed to the EU scheme. I am concerned that we might arrive at a
situation in which the various schemes cover the same industry, but the
price of carbon in each one may be different. That could cause problems
for both the UK scheme and the EU scheme as a whole, and I would like
some reassurances about how that will be dealt with. Obviously, the
price of carbon will be crucial in making the EU&#151;or any
other&#151;scheme work.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000532"></a>The
Minister for the Environment (Mr. Phil Woolas):</b>
Thank you, Mr. Atkinson, and welcome to the sitting. It is a
pleasure to be
here.</div><a name="08070375000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members have asked important questions. Carbon trading schemes, on
which there is consensus, lie at the heart of the Bill, and their
success should be judged on not just the EU scheme, but on similar
arrangements, such as the previous scheme for sulphur dioxide and the
very successful Montreal convention, which we recently celebrated 20
years
of.</div><a name="08070375000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
answer to questions raised, it is important that carbon trading schemes
are compatible and that there is an exchange mechanism so that we can
roll out such schemes across the globe. Our long-term aim is to see the
expansion of the ETS to cover more sectors and gases, but some sectors
might not be appropriate for inclusion. The enabling powers in the Bill
will provide the Government or devolved Administrations of the day with
additional options to take domestic action in sectors that are
unsuitable at the time for inclusion in the ETS. They will also allow
them to take domestic action ahead of the EU when that is
cost-effective and necessary to reduce UK emissions. We believe that
that approach might also help sectors to prepare for inclusion. Any
decision on the best policy instrument will take account of the UK
Government&#146;s objectives in the round. For example, we might wish
to supplement the EU-level action and introduce our own policies to
uncover inefficiencies and to support clean technologies. The powers
here will provide them and the devolved Administrations with the
opportunity to do
that.</div><a name="08070375000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am trying to create an architecture for carbon trading schemes that
allows inter-exchange. It might be that prices will differ, in which
case we would have exchange rates, would we
not?</div><a name="08070375000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000533"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> The Minister said that the schemes are meant for
industries that are not appropriate for inclusion in the EU ETS, but it
seems to me that the definitions would allow a national scheme to
include industries that are in the ETS. In such a situation, would the
ETS take precedence, or could industries find themselves operating in
both
schemes?</div><a name="08070375000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000534"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I see the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. It would
be a question not of preference, but of a scheme&#146;s operability.
For the sake of argument, let us say that one established a scheme for
bus companies to trade carbon credits and that a European bus trading
scheme&#151;for example, a sectoral scheme&#151;was also in place.
Those two schemes would have a relationship through, for example,
independent auditing and buying and selling. At any one time, the price
of carbon in the different scheme might be different.</div>
<a name="08070375000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I
interpreted the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question correctly, he is
worried that a Scottish bus carbon trading scheme, for example, might
undermine the European ETS, if not set up correctly. That would not be
possible because, as we were reminded by the hon. Member for Northavon,
the architecture of the European ETS is based on units, not on
countries. It would not be subservient any more or less than the pound
in Scotland is subservient to the
euro.</div><a name="08070375000122"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000536"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> In answer to the hon. Member for Vale of York,
clause 43 on its own provides for the enabling power for the Government
or devolved Administrations to establish trading schemes. Powers to
establish those schemes are provided later within the rules. At
present, neither the Secretary of State nor Welsh Ministers have the
power to establish such trading schemes through legislation. The
Scottish Parliament can make trading schemes within
its competence in Scotland. Interestingly, the Northern Ireland
Assembly can make trading schemes within its competence in Northern
Ireland.</div><a name="08070375000469"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30

<a name="08070375000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our aim is
for each national authority to have the same set of powers without
changing or upsetting the devolution settlements that are already in
place. As the hon. Member for Angus said, the idea is to enable joint
trading schemes to be made in secondary legislation, and that cannot be
done at

Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): As we are dealing with a new part
of the Bill and a clause on trading schemes, I want to ask the Minister
a question about the philosophy and principle underlying the creation
of trading schemes. To what extent do the Government think that
sectoral schemes are a good idea over and above what one might loosely
call aggregate schemes? By analogy with the argument that has been used
elsewhere in our deliberations, one could say that carbon is carbon is
carbon. In that case all we need to do is set overall caps. If we
create sectoral schemes within those caps, or alongside them, we may
create a new bureaucracy and a new infrastructure, but not add a great
deal.</div><a name="08070375000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other hand, just as we have argued that a tonne of carbon saved in
the UK has a different meaning and value to that saved elsewhere
because of the leadership role, one might argue that a sectoral trading
scheme has value quite apart from the aggregate effect, because we want
to create innovation in transport or in industry. As clause 44 is about
the activities to which trading schemes may apply, what are the
principles that will guide the Government in deciding when it is
appropriate to establish a sectoral scheme and when it is appropriate
to let the carbon price, the ETS or some aggregate scheme that is not
sector specific be the dominant approach?</div>
<a name="08070375000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000538"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman poses an important question.
The issue is widely debated in the international forum, so it is useful
to have the opportunity to
respond.</div><a name="08070375000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
word &#147;sectoral&#148; is used by different people in different
ways. Sometimes it refers directly to a particular industrial sector.
Ceramics comes to mind, for reasons that are evident on the Labour
Benches, but we could also use the example of steel or aluminium. Some
people use the word &#147;sectors&#148; to mean energy production
or transport. Clearly, it is important that we answer the question
posed by the hon. Member for Northavon.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div><a name="08070375000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000540"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Indeed. To achieve the balance that we discussed,
we require such powers. Let me explain. The first application of the
new powers will be to support the carbon reduction commitment&#151;a
new UK cap-and-trade scheme that will apply to large
non-energy-intensive organisations in the public and private sectors,
including, we anticipate, Government Departments. That is a progressive
step.</div>
<a name="08070375000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The powers
may also be used to introduce a household energy supplier obligation to
succeed the carbon emissions reduction target that ends in 2011. The
principles underlying any additional scheme would be its
interoperability with other schemes, specifically the ETS, its
interoperability through that mechanism with other global or worldwide
schemes, and, just as importantly, whether it would achieve further
reductions in emissions than would existing participation in the ETS or
the other two schemes that I mentioned. Given that we are legislating
for a long period, it is possible that the ETS will not exist, in which
case we would need those powers. We are simply taking powers that
Northern Ireland and Scotland already have to set up such
schemes.</div><a name="08070375000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000541"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Will the Minister clarify whether the provisions
apply only to sectors, broadly defined, that are outside the ETS? If
they applied to people within the ETS, what would happen if they traded
in the sectoral scheme, did well and built up credits? I want to know
about that interaction.</div>
<a name="08070375000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
takes us back to the debate about the domestic effort as against the
international effort. Having a national cap or target means that if we
do well domestically, we simply sell our surplus credit to somewhere
else, so the aggregate across the EU will not fall. That seems to run
counter to what we are trying to achieve through the sectoral scheme.
Perhaps sectoral schemes should be non-EU ETS
schemes.</div><a name="08070375000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000542"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I see the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. Sectoral
schemes could be within the ETS, but they probably will not be. One can
envisage circumstances involving international industries that are not
predominantly European-based. I hesitate to offer an example because
trade associations will write to me about it, but let us say that the
international widget manufacturing association wanted to propose a
scheme, and that a lot of widgets were produced in a
place&#151;again, I shall not mention a particular
country&#151;that is east of Berlin.</div>
<a name="08070375000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suppose a
judgment was made that one could preserve UK competitiveness and
encourage a reduction in emissions across a European geographical area.
One might want to do that within the ETS, so we have not ruled it out. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 302</div>We are trying to provide flexibility. In practice,
we can identify steel, aluminium and, perhaps, food processing, as well
as other sectors as they grow from the grass roots upwards. My example
of bus operation is not fanciful;. One could envisage such a scheme as
we embed carbon budgets. I hope I have answered the
question.</div><a name="08070375000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000545"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The amendments follow on from our previous
debate, with a similar theme of interoperability. They seek to replace
the rather vague wording in paragraph 3(5)(b) with more specific
wording specifying that not only should regulations be introduced to
set out the method by which the amount of reductions are to be measured
and calculated, but they should bear</div>
<a name="08070375000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as close a
relationship as possible to the actual emissions of the activities to
the which the trading scheme
applies.&#148;</div><a name="08070375000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
would hope that that would be an unnecessary measure, but practice
tells us otherwise.</div>
<a name="08070375000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">A wonderful
variety of carbon and energy reduction schemes is developing. We have
the ETS, climate change agreements and the carbon reduction commitment,
and in another context there are renewables obligation certificates.
However, the problem with that complexity is that perverse results
start to emerge. The interplay between the last two schemes that I
mentioned&#151;renewables obligation certificates and carbon
reduction commitment &#151;is causing a few problems in the
commercial, private sector.</div>
<a name="08070375000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The carbon
reduction commitment is rather a misnomer, as it incentivises not the
reduction of carbon, but the reduction of energy use. It is valuable as
an energy efficiency measure, but it has one serious flaw as it assumes
that all energy coming into an enterprise is at the grid average, and
that there is an equal need to reduce energy across all of a
company&#146;s activities, no matter what the power source.</div>
<a name="08070375000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some cases
it is difficult to pin down the source of energy, but in other cases it
is rather easy. I cite a domestic example. I have a solar-powered radio
in my flat in London. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;Hear, hear.&#148;]. Very sound, I know. I
never plug it in and it is powered entirely by the solar panel on top
of the radio. I leave it on all day&#151;discreetly, so as not to
disturb my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 303</div>neighbours&#151;and it is a useful security measure, especially if our
addresses get published. It quietly plays all day while the sun is
shining. There is no reason for me to practice energy efficiency, turn
it off and reduce the amount of energy that I use, as it is powered
from an entirely renewable source that does not compete with any other
energy source and is completely carbon free.</div>
<a name="08070375000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
exact parallel in commercial enterprises where companies have on-site
renewables, which, in some companies, are becoming highly significant.
BT is, I think, the biggest and most impressive example so far,
although an hon. Member quoted Lily Allen&#146;s recording studio as
another, and BT gets 30 per cent. of its energy from its own on-site
renewable energy generation. The carbon reduction commitment treats
that in the same way as energy coming from Drax or Kingsnorth or any
other of those fossil-fuel intensive energy sources.</div>
<a name="08070375000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Renewable
Energy Association, BT and others would love to claim renewable
obligation certificates for that renewable energy. That produces a
problem of double counting or even double subsidy, whereby the same
carbon reduction gains credit in the ROCs scheme and in the carbon
reduction commitment. I acknowledge that there is a problem, and I
would not entirely endorse the Renewable Energy Association&#146;s
optimistic lobbying on that front. However, it is clearly unfair that
enterprises cannot at least exclude the energy generated entirely from
a renewable source from the carbon reduction commitment scheme, so that
it would effectively be neutralised and at least would not count as
coming from a dirty source.</div>
<a name="08070375000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
it is important that the scheme design is changed or the rules amended
so that in future, as in the clause, schemes are designed to pay close
attention to carbon emissions. They should not be simply plucked out of
a broader agenda such as energy efficiency, as that may not be
appropriate. Various companies have raised that serious point about
what is clearly an anomaly in the current scheme, which the amendment
is designed to
tackle.</div><a name="08070375000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000546"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> The amendments are intended to enhance levels of

<a name="08070375000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000547"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The point that the hon. Member for Cheltenham made
is right: perhaps carbon reduction commitment is a misnomer. It is
intended primarily as an energy efficiency measure because it measures
energy use, rather than direct emissions&#151;it is a proxy for
emissions. Conceptually, the carbon reduction commitment lies
underneath the climate change agreements and brings in the mid-ranging
organisations. Fifty per cent. of emissions in the UK are covered by
the ETS and we are trying to bring in other organisations, such as
large energy users. Increasing energy prices may change the
relationship.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div><a name="08070375000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty, however, and the answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question, philosophically, is double counting. One must ensure that the
mother scheme&#151;if I may use that phrase; I think I can&#151;or
the parent scheme that caps emissions is not undermined by the carbon
reduction commitment that lies underneath it. To follow the logic of
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument, if there was a way of measuring
direct emissions from the use of energy by mid-ranking organisations,
one could have a subservient direct emissions cap and trading scheme,
but there remains the issue of double counting. I shall give him the
technical explanation in a minute, but bearing in mind his point about
needing to take account of where we get our energy from within the
carbon reduction commitment, we are trying to provide an incentive to
energy efficiency, which I know he
supports.</div>
<a name="08070375000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000548"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister and he is making
perfectly valid points. As regards one scheme undermining another, does
he not accept that at the moment, an enterprise taking all its energy
from a dirty source has no incentive under the scheme to develop
on-site renewables, even though that would clearly be a good thing to
do, because that energy would be treated exactly the same as the dirty
energy? Surely, the key is accountability for the energy that is coming
from outside, measurement of it, and the transparency of the process.
As that is something the Government are working on, they should be
happy to accept the amendment.</div>
<a name="08070375000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000549"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I will come to why I should not be happy to accept
the amendment in a moment, but the hon. Gentleman&#146;s policy point
is right. Indeed, I hear the echo of many meetings with my colleagues
in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. The
carbon reduction commitment will take into account the source of the
energy and will incentivise use away from dirty energy by the
renewables obligation and, indirectly, through the
ETS.</div>
<a name="08070375000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000550"></a>Martin

<a name="08070375000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000551"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Let me explain, and then the hon. Gentleman will
stop shaking his head and start nodding it, I hope. We want to
encourage the uptake of renewable energy. However, where the carbon
savings from renewables are already counted by supplier schemes, such
as renewable obligation certificates, it would result in double
counting if the same units of renewable electricity could count towards
the carbon reduction commitment. The proposed approach for the carbon
reduction commitment is, therefore, simply to ensure that there is no
double counting. However, we propose that participants may count
renewable electricity generated on site if it is not counted against
targets in the renewables obligation. That approach demonstrates the
commitment to ensuring that the carbon reduction commitment delivers
additional carbon savings over and above those that suppliers are
required to deliver through the renewables obligation certificates
scheme, and will help to encourage it further.</div>
<a name="08070375000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 73 and 74 would alter a provision of the trading scheme powers
with regard to how the greenhouse emissions from activities covered by
trading schemes may be calculated. The amendments make specific
provision on how energy from biomass should be treated under future
trading schemes. As currently 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div>drafted, under paragraph 3 of schedule 2, trading
scheme regulations must identify the activities covered by the trading
scheme, and</div>
<a name="08070375000163"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;specify the
units of measurement of the activities for the purposes of the
scheme&#148;.</div>
<a name="08070375000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further, paragraph
(5)(a) ensures that the activities covered by a scheme can be
calculated with</div>
<a name="08070375000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reference to
the amount (in tonnes of carbon dioxide
equivalent)&#148;</div><a name="08070375000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">for
which they are responsible, and paragraph (5)(b), which amendment No.
73 would remove, ensures that the regulations may specify how that
amount is calculated. In philosophical terms, that exactly meets the
point that the hon. Gentleman is rightly making.</div>
<a name="08070375000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">To explain
further the whole debate about alternative sources, if one looks at
electric cars, they do not in and of themselves reduce emissions; it
depends on where the electricity comes from. That is what counts. The
hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that the CRC must incentivise not
just energy efficiency but emissions
reductions.</div><a name="08070375000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two likely situations. First, let us take it as read that it is
often difficult, expensive and sometimes frankly impossible, to measure
the volume of greenhouse gases emitted at a site, so it is common that
emissions in a trading scheme are derived by taking the volume of fuel
consumed and applying co-efficients to calculate the volume of
greenhouse gases that result. It is the calculation of that
co-efficient that a scheme must do&#151;to meet the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div><a name="08070375000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
these powers apply equally to direct and indirect emissions, as set out
in clause 43. Indirect emissions are sometimes measured by taking
electricity use at, say, the office building in question, and then
applying the same co-efficients to work out the volume of greenhouse
gases when the electricity was produced back at the power
station&#151;to meet the point that the hon. Gentleman makes.
Alternatively, by taking the volume of fuel sold for combustion and
applying co-efficients, it could be possible to calculate the volume of
emissions that result.</div>
<a name="08070375000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
CRC, for example, it is proposed that emissions from
participants&#146; energy use will be calculated using a grid
electricity emissions factor. That will be based on the five-year
rolling average emissions factor, which is currently 0.523 kg of
CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>per kWh. That shows how the provisions in paragraph
(5)(b) may be
applied.</div><a name="08070375000170"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000553"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I have confused the hon. Gentleman. Let me
reassure him, and then he will not need to intervene. Paragraph (5)(b)
ensures greater flexibility in the calculation of emissions from a
trading scheme. My figure is the co-efficient around which that is
calculated; it is the baseline, which is taken up or down depending on
the individual participant. One should remember that my officials and
others will be discussing with each participant in the CRC their
particular circumstances. That is necessary. It is not intended that
paragraph (5) will allow the Government or a national authority to
fudge the figures. I must cover things from the other point of view as
well, or the hon. Gentleman will press me as to whether the provision
is too flexible, and he would be right to do so.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div><a name="08070375000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
(5)(b) ensures that the methodology for measuring emissions may be set
out in the regulations, which gives the hon. Gentleman the guarantee he
is looking for. Removing that sub-paragraph would therefore have the
effect of reducing the transparency of the trading scheme. The hon.
Gentleman is right, and I have added powers to make regulations to meet
the points he makes. I agree with him that CRC is a
misnomer.</div><a name="08070375000173"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000554"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> For once, I am reassured by the Minister&#146;s
comments. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Maybe I am going soft,
at this late stage in the Committee. His comments about what is
possible under the new clauses are encouraging. If he is true to his
word, that will be a positive step. I was slightly worried that
nevertheless he went on to talk about schemes based on grid averages,
although I accept what he also said, that they could be varied for
individual participants. The use of grid averages as the baseline is
part of the problem. Once we have proper accounting for the source of
energy, it is difficult to see why we need the grid average baseline at
all.</div><a name="08070375000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000555"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> If I used &#147;reference points&#148;, rather
than &#147;baseline&#148;, perhaps that would
help.</div><a name="08070375000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000556"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister but, again, if we
are accounting accurately for energy, that should in time remove the
need even for a reference point. Furthermore, if each energy statement
to a particular enterprise specified, from the energy company&#146;s
side, what the source of that energy was, there would be a double
benefit, by preventing energy companies from claiming double credit for
green-tariff electricity, as we have discussed before. We will be able
to account for each unit of electricity coming in, and its source.
However, the intention behind the Minister&#146;s comments is clear.
I am glad that he appears to be accepting that the carbon reduction
commitment has an anomaly at the moment and that, under the provisions
of the Bill, Ministers will be able to change or remove that anomaly,
to tighten up the scheme, which will be warmly welcomed in industry. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08070375000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000557"></a>Mr.

<a name="08070413000003"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;or other persons authorised to
trade in allowances, credits or
certificates&#146;.</div><a name="08070375000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment makes a small change to the trading scheme powers in schedule
2 by ensuring that trading scheme regulations may make provision to
levy charges on third parties, as well as on participants, for the cost
of operating the trading schemes. As currently drafted, the Bill does
not allow us to do that. We need that power in order to operate such a
scheme. I hope that the amendment is accepted as a technical
one.</div><a name="08070375000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000558"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Any amendment that judiciously enhances both the
role and the efficiency of the carbon markets will have our support.
The amendment appears to do just that. I am content to give it our
support.</div><a name="08070375000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Bill stands, administration of national-level trading schemes can
only be conducted by participants, such as devolved authorities or
central Government. Under the amendment, powers to run and charge for a

<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div>national levy scheme could be administered by a
group other than a national authority; a scheme could be run
by</div><a name="08070375000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;other
persons authorised to trade in allowances, credits or
certificates&#148;.</div><a name="08070375000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
presumably means that banks, brokers or local authorities could run a
scheme on behalf of or under contract to national
authorities.</div>
<a name="08070375000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
may be technical, but potentially it is a big little amendment. We are,
therefore, taking an awful lot on trust. Could the Minister clarify in
a little more detail which authorised persons he would envisage
carrying out such duties on behalf of national authorities? We see no
reason why the Government should run something when it could just as
easily be done, or done better, at local level or by the private
sector. I would welcome the Minister taking the opportunity to clarify
who the other authorised persons are intended to
be.</div><a name="08070375000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000559"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question
is, predominantly, the Environment Agency. Let me clarify. The issue is
about who can trade within the scheme, not who can run the scheme.
Perhaps I should have made myself even clearer. If people trade within
the scheme, but a third party is not allowed to pay into it, we would
inadvertently be taking away a big United Kingdom industry growth area.
The type of organisation that we envisage being able to run the trading
schemes is the Environment Agency or a similar
body.</div><a name="08070375000471"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000560"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am now slightly puzzled, because I had assumed
that the amendment was rather innocuous and that it would simply extend
the scope of those who can run the schemes to commercial organisations.
Like the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle, I had considered that to
be a positive step. However, I am now confused, given that the
Government have in mind yet another of their agencies. Does the
Minister imagine that profit-making organisations could be involved in
convenient
circumstances?</div><a name="08070375000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000561"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Once again, I have learned the lesson that reading
out the next paragraph in the brief saves time in the debate. I am
sorry, I should have made matters
clear.</div><a name="08070375000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
drafted, paragraphs 9 and 19 of schedule 2 allow for third parties to
trade in allowances or certificates under a trading scheme. We believe
that that is necessary, so that a deeper and more liquid market can
develop as a result of the scheme than would be the case if only the
participants&#151;the actual organisations and companies, whether
public or private, that were members of the scheme&#151;were allowed
to trade. Those paragraphs make a distinction between third parties and
participants, and that is not replicated under paragraph 26 in
connection with the power to levy charges towards a trading
scheme.</div><a name="08070375000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Participants
are those who have an obligation under the scheme, such as the company,
the Department or the supermarket, that are typically there to
surrender a particular number of allowances equal to their
emissions&#151;indirect emissions, in some cases&#151;to acquire a
certain number of certificates. Third parties are those who have no
obligations, but decide voluntarily as a business to trade in the
scheme&#146;s allowances or certificates. I should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div>have explained that I am taking the provision under
paragraphs 9 and 19 and putting it under paragraph 26. If the hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000562"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> In their own words, the Government admit that
the devolution settlement on climate change policy is complex. Elements
of energy policy and international relations are reserve matters,
although generally energy policy is not reserved to Northern Ireland.
Environmental policy is devolved to varying degrees, and the devolution
settlement reflects that. The provisions in the Bill will be backed up
by a concordat that will set out the rules and responsibilities of the
different Administrations in more detail. If the concordat is not
finalised until the Bill has finished its passage through Parliament,
will we therefore not have the opportunity to scrutinise it? A climate
change Bill will be presented to the Scottish Parliament in the autumn,
so would it be a good idea to submit the concordat to the House for our
consideration?</div>
<a name="08070375000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000563"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Lady asks a fair question. We are trying
to define the national authorities that may make trading schemes under
the powers in the Bill. We are looking at future schemes, 30 years
ahead, and the clause sets out the scope of each authority, reflecting
the devolution settlements of each legislature. As the Bill&#146;s
scope is UK-wide, it is right for each UK Administration to have the
power to introduce trading schemes, reduce emissions or encourage
activities that reduce emissions. That will ensure that contributions
towards meeting the targets and budgets in the Bill can be made by each
of the UK&#146;s territorial authorities, and as the hon. Lady says,
that should be done in a way that does not cut across the devolution
settlements.</div><a name="08070375000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
48 and schedule 3&#151;the other side of the coin with regard to
clause 46&#151;will allow the national authorities to establish
trading schemes jointly. That is our preference over a single-country
scheme, as it provides for an increased number of participants, which
will give a deeper and more liquid market.</div>
<a name="08070375000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
interest of transparency and continued constructive relations between
the UK Government and the devolved Administrations, we expect to
publish the concordat when it is finalised. That is consistent with the
approach taken, for example, in the case of the bilateral memorandum of
understanding on fisheries between the Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs and the Scottish Executive, which, I am told, is
publicly available. However, as the precise detail of the concordat
depends on the final provisions included in what, we hope, will become
the Climate Change Act, it is not appropriate to publish the draft
concordat ahead of Royal Assent. The answer to the question is yes, but
we can do it only after Royal Assent.</div>

<a name="08070375000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000564"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Schedule 3 goes into some detail. Not in the
Bill or in primary legislation, but in secondary legislation, enormous
powers will be given to the Secretary of State. The Government and the
Minister ask us to take a great deal on trust, and I wonder whether the
Orders in Council will cover such matters. For example, if the
Secretary of State proceeds with personal carbon accounts, will that be
subject to Orders in Council? If we proceed down the path of personal
carbon accounts for England, will they therefore also exist in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?</div>
<a name="08070375000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make this
point in every Committee that I attend, but the point of standing for
Parliament and serving on Committees is that we are given the
opportunity carefully to scrutinise the enabling powers. When such
far-reaching, wide powers are placed on trust in the Secretary of
State, we have effectively devolved responsibility to the Secretary of
State without the opportunity to scrutinise the Orders in Council and
the powers therein.</div>
<a name="08070375000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the Minister said earlier that such measures will be subject to
affirmative procedures and resolution, but if that scenario was to
appear in relation to personal carbon accounts, would such accounts
apply, by Orders in Council, to the whole United Kingdom? I am
personally slightly sceptical about personalised carbon accounts, but
industry, the CBI and a number of other bodies have spoken on a number
of occasions about their concerns that business will be asked to take
the lion&#146;s share of pollution and emissions-reducing measures.
My question is a probing one about the enabling
legislation.</div><a name="08070375000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000565"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I share the hon. Lady&#146;s views. &#147;An
idea ahead of their time&#148; was the response of my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State. Let me reassure the hon. Lady in two
ways. First, we do not consider that the Bill would be the appropriate
framework to introduce such a personal carbon-trading scheme, given the
robust scrutiny by Parliament that such a scheme would rightly
require.</div><a name="08070375000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall give the hon. Lady further assurance. Part 1 of the schedule sets
out the procedure to be followed where regulations are made by a single
national authority. It sets out the procedures for both Parliament and
the devolved legislatures, in which support for the regulations is
required. Part 2 sets out the process for regulation jointly made by
the Secretary of State and/or Welsh Ministers and/or the relevant
Northern Ireland Department. A separate arrangement applies to trading
schemes that involve Scotland, which is covered by part 3 of the
schedule.</div>
<a name="08070375000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where the
affirmative procedure applies, if either House of Parliament or a
relevant devolved legislature does not approve the instrument, it
cannot be made. That should cover the hon. Lady&#146;s point. If the
negative procedure applies, again if either House of Parliament or the
relevant devolved legislature resolves that the regulation should be
annulled, the instrument has no further effect and may be revoked by
Order in Council. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>For those two reasons&#151;common sense and procedural&#151;the
provisions satisfy her point. I asked for that point to be made as

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000566"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I would like to revert to my earlier comments,
without expanding too much on them. Reading schedule 4, it seems to
assume and set out certain types of trading schemes&#151;relating in
particular to electricity suppliers and electricity distributors. The
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee&#146;s conclusions
questioned the EU emissions trading scheme already covering a large
proportion of heavy industries and representing about half of UK
emissions. Also, perhaps within that scheme, the Government propose to
introduce a new carbon reduction commitment scheme under the enabling
powers of the Bill. That raises an issue in addition to that of
personal carbon allowances, which might be introduced.</div>
<a name="08070375000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
could take this opportunity to answer the question of which sectors
might remain that would be suitable for an emissions trading scheme
established by secondary legislation. Can he think of any other
possibilities? As I alluded to earlier, the Select Committee went on to
conclude that the enabling powers perhaps should not be within the
legislation if there were no other trading schemes or if the Government
were unable to say which other trading schemes there might be. Without
further elucidation from the Government at this stage, it seems an
open-ended power. I would be grateful to the Minister for some
clarification.</div><a name="08070375000472"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000567"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The schedule is designed to facilitate the carbon
reduction commitment and applies to that. The difficulty is that this
is legislation for a long time, so the hon. Lady is right to ask the
question. We envisage that the new powers will support the introduction
of the CRC, a cap-and-trace scheme, as I said, that will apply to large
non-energy-intensive organisations in the public and private sectors.
As I think I mentioned before, the powers may also be used to introduce
a household energy supplier obligation to succeed the carbon emissions
reduction target scheme, which ends in 2011. It is difficult, if not
impossible, to specify at this stage how the powers may be used beyond
that, as their purpose is to maintain flexibility in supporting
activities that will enable us to meet the targets set out in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08070375000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill sets
out the framework for 2050, so we take the view that it is important
that the powers to introduce further trading schemes exist, even if at
this point it is not known how exactly they may be applied in the
future. I hope that the procedural points that I made in answer to the
hon. Lady&#146;s question on the previous clause also apply here. In
layperson&#146;s terms, we do not know yet.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000568"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 69, in
clause 55, page 25, line 35, at
end insert</div> <a name="08070413000004"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;including in
particular the risks of harm
to&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) the well-being of the
population,</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) the
environment, including natural resources, biodiversity, living
organisms and ecological systems of which they form part,
and</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(c) the
economy.&#146;.</div><a name="08070375000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
of the committee will have heard me speak on more than one occasion
over the past few sittings. Colleagues on the Opposition Benches have
echoed my concern that the Bill does not give sustainability,
particularly protection of the natural environment, the prominence that
it deserves in decision making. Clause 55 requires the Government to
prepare risk assessments and adaptation programmes in response to the
dangers of climate change.</div>
<a name="08070375000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
clause 55(2) requires programmes of action to further sustainable
development, that duty as currently drafted will not secure adequate
protection or enhancement for our natural environment, nor will it
guarantee that the poor and vulnerable in society do not suffer
disproportionately from the impacts of climate change. That is why we
feel it necessary to state those requirements specifically in clause
55.</div>
<a name="08070375000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Precedent
shows that stand-alone sustainable development duties unfortunately
rarely delivered a step change in the sustainability of policies and
practices on the ground, without additional legal underpinning. The
Sustainable Development Commission recognised that fact in a recent
review of sustainable development duties, of which there are now over
100 in law. We cannot afford to risk applying a meaningless or
toothless duty to the Government in the case of adaptation policy.
There are important decisions to be made in all sectors, which, if we
get them wrong, will further erode our natural environment and resource
base, but if we get them right, could help to protect and enhance those
vital assets for the future.</div>
<a name="08070375000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The water
sector provides a good illustration of that point. To be truly
sustainable, responses to droughts and floods must work with and
benefit from healthy wetland ecosystems and the services they provide,
such as flood storage and water purification. Responses focused wholly
on new hard floor flood defences can damage the environment further and
reduce its ability to support human needs in the future, and will
ultimately cost society more.</div>
<a name="08070375000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present,
while lip service is paid to sustainable approaches to adaptation of
the water sector, there is no clear obligation on any part of the
Government to ensure that they are put into place. To drive truly
sustainable adaptation, the Bill needs to ensure that the Government
take full account of the natural environment and the services that it
provides, both when undertaking their risk assessments and designing
their adaptation programme. We should also take full account of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div>risks posed to the poor when securing justice. The amendment would place
a duty on the Secretary of State to report to Parliament on particular
risks of harm to our population, our environment, biodiversity and the
health of our economy from the impacts of climate
change.</div><a name="08070375000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000569"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I shall not detain the Committee for long. My
only criticism of the amendment is that it is a bit of gold-plating.
Surely the impact of climate change will be judged by a competent
committee to include its impact on the well-being of the population and
on the environment, including natural resources. However, there is no
harm in specifying that in the Bill so I welcome the
amendment.</div>
<a name="08070375000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
paragraph (b), in particular, specifies the importance of natural
resources,</div><a name="08070375000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;biodiversity,
living organisms and ecological systems of which they form
part&#148;.</div><a name="08070375000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is well-worded, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Bexhill and
Battle on the phraseology used. The wider impact on ecosystems of our
plans to respond to and adapt to climate change is important. It is not
simply a process of reducing carbon emissions, but consideration of
their total impact on our natural environment. That is a welcome
clarification and would reinforce what might already be in the
Bill.</div><a name="08070375000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000570"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am sorry that I shall have to resist the
amendment, as I have been advised to do. I do not disagree with
anything that the hon. Members for Bexhill and Battle and for
Cheltenham said. We all know that sustainable development is crucial to
our
work.</div><a name="08070375000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000571"></a>Joan
Walley:</b> In view of what my hon. Friend is saying about
sustainable development, will she clarify what difference the world
summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg made so that we can
ensure that we are doing everything we can to protect our natural
resources and ecosystems not only in the United Kingdom, but
globally?</div>
<a name="08070375000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000572"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> My hon. Friend is right to refer to the
extraordinary meeting in Johannesburg. I was fortunate to be present,
and it has made an enormous difference to the world, particularly to
some developed nations, such as our own, which, in our rush towards
development, have so often neglected our natural environment. However,
the lessons have been learned and, as she knows, they have been learned
throughout the
Government.</div><a name="08070375000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment contains a list. Although it has the virtue of being shorter
than some of the other lists included in the Bill and proposed in the
other place, there is still a problem with it. All the factors listed
would easily be included in any understanding of sustainable
development. I know that it is boring repetition, but we have defined
sustainable development as living within environmental limits that
clearly cover biodiversity and ecosystems, and the achievement of a
just society. That clearly includes realising the impacts on the most
vulnerable and the poorest people, and we do that by means of a
sustainable economy, good governance and sound science.</div>
<a name="08070375000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why,
as the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle acknowledged, clause 56(2)
already requires the adaptation programme to contribute to sustainable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div>development. My argument is that the amendment is
unnecessary. It might seem to be harmless and benign, but it is
unnecessary because we have in the Bill all the means for covering the
aspects that the hon. Gentleman outlined.</div>
<a name="08070375000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would insert into the Bill a reference to particular factors in respect
of the climate change risk report. Clause 55(1) already requires an
assessment of the risks to the UK arising from climate change.
Obviously, that means all risks, so potential climate risks would be
covered, including the factors that the hon. Gentleman proposes. In a
sense, by putting in a short list, the scope is reduced. Also, some
issues, possibly including the built environment, would not easily fall
under the list as currently worded.</div>
<a name="08070375000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000573"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Does the Minister not believe that the built
environment is covered by the reference to the
environment?</div>
<a name="08070375000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000574"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> There is a problem of understanding. Many people
understand &#147;the environment&#148; to mean the green
environment. In speaking to his own amendment about biodiversity and
ecosystems, the hon. Gentleman was alluding primarily to the green
environment, as distinct from the built environment. We want to ensure
that the drafting of the Bill takes all possible factors into
account.</div>
<a name="08070375000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will, I
hope, give the hon. Gentleman some comfort to know that we have already
appointed our statutory advisers on the environment&#151;Natural
England, the Environment Agency and the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds. They will be part of the steering group for the
work to ensure that sustainable development, especially the environment
in the way that the hon. Gentleman intends it, is given due regard. I
cannot accept amendment No. 69.</div>
<a name="08070375000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000575"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I am sorry to hear the Minister&#146;s response.
This is not a central feature of the legislation but it is important
for the legislation to be clear to the layman. It should not require or
presume a specialist knowledge of the jargon or the vocabulary of the
environmental industry. People out there, our constituents, should be
able to pick up any part of the Bill and understand it as much as
possible on a stand-alone basis.</div>
<a name="08070375000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The inclusive
list&#151;which does not exclude anything, although I am sure we
could tweak it to improve it&#151;would contribute to the general
understanding of the Bill. It is a welcome reminder that climate change
embraces disparate topics from the well-being of the population through
to the economy. It is important to remind people of that and not fall
back on a rather ghastly piece of jargon, however well intended and
well defined it may be. Sustainable development means many different
things to many different people, however it is defined in the
legislation. It is worth reiterating that we are concerned not only
with the well-being of the population or our economy, but with
biodiversity, living organisms and ecological systems. I am wearing my
biodiversity tie today, just to prove the
point.</div>
<a name="08070375000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000576"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> For the record, we are indeed concerned about all
the issues that the hon. Gentleman
mentions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div><a name="08070375000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000577"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I do not doubt that the Minister is concerned
about those aspects, and I welcome her comments about the contribution
that Natural England and the RSPB will make. However, I am talking
about being clear in the Bill and ensuring that it makes sense as a
stand-alone piece of legislation that the layman&#151;our
constituents&#151;will readily understand. For that reason, I shall
press the amendment to a vote.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000594"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> We have already discussed in the debates on
clause 35 and new clause 4 our proposals for a new role for the
adaptation sub-committee in providing scrutiny of the implementation of
the adaptation programme. In accordance with new clause 4, the
Committee on Climate Change will look at progress on adaptation, as I
have stressed before, as part of every second progress report under
clause 35. Clause 36 will require the Government to respond to the
Committee&#146;s progress reports under clause
35. The effect of our package of amendments is to ensure that that
reporting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div>will happen more frequently than under the present clause 57. Now, the
reporting will take place every 24 months, rather than every 30
months.</div>
<a name="08070375000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reports
on progress will now be conducted by independent experts, rather than
by the Government, as I have previously explained. Given that the
committee will now have that important role in scrutinising progress
and adaptation and that the Government will be required to respond to
every report, it is not necessary for the Government to produce
separately their own report on progress on adaptation. That is, of
course, what clause 57 presently provides. I therefore propose that
clause 57 be deleted from the

amendment is on a similar theme to some of the other amendments that we
have discussed, so I will not trouble the Committee for long. The
amendment would make a correction in relation to a pretty clear
requirement for the reporting authorities, as well as the Government,
to pay attention to the concept of sustainable development. Clause
56(2), which is part of the Secretary of State&#146;s programme for
adaptation to climate change, contains a clear and admirable subsection
that the Government have not tried to
delete:</div><a name="08070375000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
objectives, proposals and policies must be such as to contribute to
sustainable
development.&#148;</div><a name="08070375000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is admirable, but there is no equivalent obligation on the reporting
authorities.</div>
<a name="08070375000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
instructions given in clause 59, the Secretary of State will simply ask
the reporting authorities to prepare proposals and policies. That may
seem somewhat like dancing on the head of a pin, but there are
important parallels. As I mentioned before, a good example is flooding.
An authority&#151;for instance, one with responsibility for water,
such as the Environment Agency with its flood risk analysis role, or
water companies&#151;could create a plan that adapted to climate
change but not in a sustainable
way.</div><a name="08070375000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall quote the RSPB, which, for example, said in response to droughts
and
floods:</div><a name="08070375000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
be truly sustainable, responses to droughts and floods must work with,
and benefit from, healthy wetland ecosystems and the services they
provide, such as flood storage and water purification. Responses
focussed wholly on new hard flood defences and increased &#145;end of
pipe&#146; treatment will damage the environment further, reduce its
ability to support human needs in the future, and cost society
more.&#148;</div><a name="08070375000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know from conversations that we have had only this week that the
Minister accepts many of the arguments made by the RSPB and the
Blueprint for Water coalition that we must take a holistic approach to
issues such as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div>flood defence, flood response and drought. Given
that the Minister is not unsympathetic to that point of view and that
we have an anomaly in the Bill&#151;the Minister points to his hon.
Friend&#151;I hope that both Ministers are therefore equally
sympathetic to the point of view advocated by the Blueprint for Water
coalition and the RSPB and that they will embrace the amendment with
open arms. I am sure that the Minister would not wish to refuse every
reasonable amendment that the Opposition move in
Committee.</div><a name="08070375000275"></a>

and moving the amendment. The Committee will note that my hon. Friend
the Member for Bexhill and Battle has made sustainable development a
priority in his remarks in Committee. He spoke eloquently of its
importance in his words on clause 55 and, more specifically, clause 13.
Without wishing to pre-empt remarks on clause 60, we consider the topic
of local co-operation and consideration in drawing up adaptation

happy to support the

hon. Friend made the case earlier in his discussion on amendment No.
55. When the Government or local government are drawing up plans for
adaptation to climate change, they must be mindful of the need for
sustainable development. The long-term view&#151;the big
picture&#151;is what we are all looking towards. It is not just a

smashing eggs.&#148; We believe that that would be a derogation of
our responsibility as political leaders and policy makers, so I support
my hon. Friend&#146;s remarks on clause 55. When it comes to
preparing for local adaptation issues, such as flooding, responses
focused wholly on new hard flood defences can damage the environment
further and reduce its ability to support human needs in the future and
will ultimately cost society more.</div>
<a name="08070375000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to make a personal plea to the Minister. The title of my
constituency&#151;Vale of York&#151;suggests that I represent the
low-lying areas around and north of York. In fact, it is probably about
a 65 per cent. functional and an occasional flood plane. I am sad to
say that following the next election, I shall no longer be able to
speak for Vale of York. Despite its many mentions on the
&#147;Today&#148; programme for its climate and weather conditions,
Vale of York will be no more. I hope that she will look favourably on
the amendment, because I believe that the way forward has to be local
and small alleviation schemes such as the one that I propose. Through
the good offices of the Environment Agency, the scheme is preventing
Thirsk from flooding again by allowing the land upstream to flood and
rewarding the landowner for letting it do so. I conclude by saying that
there must be a responsibility on local policy makers to make
decisions, while still considering the requirements of sustainable
development and the long-term view.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000597"></a>Joan

hard to tempt me into accepting the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000599"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Yes. First, let me respond to the good arguments
that the hon. Member for Cheltenham made about the fact that we cannot
take a simplistic approach 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div>to adaptation and that many forms of adaptation may not be sustainable.
One of the important things that we are doing through the Committee on
Climate Change is to look at adaptation and mitigation, because a means
of adaptation that creates greater quantities of emissions would
interfere with our aims on mitigation. We agree with what he has said.
It is true to say that, whereas hard defences were perhaps thought to
be the only way forward for flood prevention and were often the
preferred request of local people, we now know that there are more
sophisticated ways in which we can try to protect areas and enable them
to adapt to climate change. That means using the natural environment
and working with it, rather than trying to resist, as in the case of
rising sea levels. We are minded to take a holistic approach, and I am
quite sure that my hon. Friend the Minister with responsibility for
floods would reiterate that.</div>
<a name="08070375000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000600"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her reassuring
comments, but the purpose of the amendment is not about the Secretary
of State or Ministers taking a holistic approach; it is about asking
the reporting authorities to take a holistic approach as well. In that
sense, it is a purely innocuous amendment, but one that might be useful
to Ministers in trying to get the right result from their reporting
authorities.</div>
<a name="08070375000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000601"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I think that
he knows that many of the reporting authorities are guided by the
Government&#146;s strategy and are in receipt of considerable funds
to carry out their plans, so the connection between the Government and
the reporting authorities is
important.</div><a name="08070375000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have repeated ad nauseam, adapting in ways that reinforce and deliver
sustainable development is already well covered by the fact that the
objectives, proposals and policy of the adaptation programme under
clause 56 must contribute to sustainable development. A number of key
reporting authorities, such as regional development agencies, Ofwat and
Ofgem, are covered by the guidance and already have a duty to have
regard to sustainable
development.</div><a name="08070375000474"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="08070375000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
offer my assurances to the Committee that the statutory guidance for
public bodies will provide guiding principles on sustainable ways in
which to address climate risks. It will help public bodies and
statutory undertakers to demonstrate that their adaptation plans
consider sustainable development. That was set out in the briefing of
my noble Friend Lord Rooker, which gave the key headings that we
propose for the guidance. We will develop the guidance following the
usual consultation processes so that it will reflect accurately the
needs of
stakeholders.</div><a name="08070375000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stakeholders
who represent a range of sustainable development issues will also be
involved in the development of the guidance. When we have a fuller
picture of the content of the guidance, we can decide more accurately
how sustainable development will be reflected in it. We are also
working closely with our statutory advisers&#151;Natural England and
the Environment Agency, members of which sit on the working group on
developing the guidance&#151;to ensure that we pay full regard to
sustainable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div>development. The challenges and opportunities raised
by the need to adapt to climate change also encourage people to think
about the interaction among the environment, society and the
economy.</div><a name="08070375000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
forthcoming &#147;adapting to climate change&#148; website, and the
summary document that will accompany it, will set out the
Government&#146;s adaptation programme and expand on how the five
principles of sustainable development are interpreted with respect to
adaptation. I must oppose the amendment, but I hope that my explanation
has reassured the hon. Members for Vale of York and for
Cheltenham.</div><a name="08070375000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000602"></a>Martin

rejecting a series of Opposition amendments that would strengthen the
hand of DEFRA in respect of other authorities. They are apparently so
completely in line with the Government&#146;s policy that Ministers
think that they are unnecessary. I would have thought that there was no
harm, but great advantage, in the Government accepting them. However,
on the understanding that they will not support the proposal, I beg to

amendment No. 79, in clause 68, page 31, line 16, leave out paragraph
(a).</div><a name="08070375000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000605"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Amendment No. 78 reflects the worry that we have
expressed at other stages during the Bill&#146;s passage that the
relative importance of DEFRA within the Government as a whole perhaps
means that not all agencies and public bodies will have grasped what
needs to be done. DEFRA has clearly had to cope with some of the
impacts of climate change; arguably, the bluetongue epidemic would not
have been possible had the average temperature of the country not been
rising, because the infection would not have been able to thrive.
Moreover, I am well aware of DEFRA&#146;s role in the Gloucestershire
floods last year and the importance of emergency planning on a
cross-disciplinary basis, yet some of the agencies listed in the
amendment might not have grasped the
implications.</div><a name="08070375000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of amendment No. 78 is to put those agencies on notice that
change will be required and that the provision will affect their work
in a major way. It would make it clear, under the Bill, that they need
to start working now on adaptation policy. I suppose that
its one weakness compared with some of the other
amendments that have been tabled is that the names of agencies tend to
change every five minutes, and that many subsidiary amendments might be
required each 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 319</div>time the Government reorganise them. Nevertheless,
it is important to be specific, and that was why we tabled the
amendment.</div>
<a name="08070375000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
79 picks up on something rather peculiar in the Bill. Buried away on
page 31, there is a list of bodies that do not count as reporting
authorities. Some of those are straightforward: &#147;either House of
Parliament&#148;&#151;we can accept that&#151;and devolved
authorities and legislatures, which are dealt with in other ways in the
Bill and form part of the whole structure. However, the list also
exempts Ministers of the Crown, and we would like to remove that
exemption. DEFRA is not the whole Government, and it seems reasonable
that other Ministers should, from time to time, be asked by the
Secretary of State to prepare a report on how they are adapting to
climate change.</div>
<a name="08070375000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
looked at some Departments that govern areas that are responsible for
higher emissions than DEFRA. In terms of the impact on people&#146;s
well-being, it is again clear that DEFRA will not be responsible for
many areas of government that will have to face the main impacts of
climate change. The most obvious example is, of course, the Department
of Health, where a repetition of the flood events would certainly
involve public health issues&#151;I declare a personal interest in
that as my wife was the director of public health in Gloucestershire
during the floods, and she and her NHS team worked hard to safeguard
public health during that emergency. If such emergencies take place
much more regularly, that will have a considerable impact on primary
care trusts, foundation trusts and other NHS bodies.</div>
<a name="08070375000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the model
of bluetongue on the agricultural side is repeated for human beings,
and what were previously tropical diseases start to invade these
shores, the Department of Health will have to start planning for
adaptation on a major scale. The Department for Transport will also
have a major role to play. It might think that one way of adapting to
climate change would be to provide plane flights in and out of Heathrow
for people affected by climate change in other countries, but that
would not be particularly appropriate. The Department for Communities
and Local Government will be affected because of the impact of
temperature change on existing housing stock and the necessity for
local authorities to manage environmental health. There are major
impacts with which other Government Departments will have to deal. Why
should the Ministers in those Departments be exempt from the Secretary
of State&#146;s instructions to prepare policies and report back to
Parliament on adaptation? That is a very strange exemption to have in
the Bill, and I would like Ministers to justify
it.</div>
<a name="08070375000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000606"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> It seems sensible for the Secretary of State to
issue guidance on the impact of climate change to all those authorities
that are vital to the national effort to mitigate the effects of, and
to adapt to, climate change. In particular, the involvement of the
Health Protection Agency is very appropriate. I have a question for the
hon. Member for Cheltenham. The amendment does not strike me as
exhaustive. For example, why has the Environment Agency been left out?
That is the most appropriate agency, as it is the body that would
co-ordinate most recovery efforts and cleaning after a
flood.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 320</div><a name="08070375000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000607"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Lady&#146;s
comments. I would welcome specific additions to the list, but the
Environment Agency already reports to
DEFRA.</div>
<a name="08070375000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000608"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> There are others, such as English Heritage,
which is a statutory body that is responsible for many of the most
precious and valuable buildings. I was just making a comment.</div>
<a name="08070375000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">Climate
change would significantly affect human health, and hotter summers will
particularly badly afflict the elderly and infirm. The Committee will
recall that the 2003 summer heat wave caused an estimated 35,000 deaths
across Europe. Thankfully, we do not have too many heat waves in
northern Britain, but if such incidents become more frequent, we must
ensure that there is optimum communication between our health
authorities and the Government. Clearly, Natural England, the Marine
and Fisheries Agency, the Water Services Regulation Authority and the
other agencies listed in the amendment have a vital role to play in our
efforts to mitigate and
adapt.</div><a name="08070375000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 79, I would like to ask why a Minister of the Crown
should be exempt from being considered a reporting authority for the
purposes of clauses 59 to 67? Although I agree that the Secretary of
State should not be empowered to issue guidance to or give direction to
any reporting authorities that are devolved, or to Parliament as a
whole, there does not appear to be any reason why the Secretary of
State should not be able to issue advice or give direction to a fellow
Government Minister. Will the Minister explain why she wishes to retain
such a requirement in the
Bill?</div><a name="08070375000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000609"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I have already explained that the statutory
guidance on adaptation will help reporting authorities to understand
how to assess the risks of climate change and plan any related
action.</div>
<a name="08070375000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cheltenham offers us a list, but makes a rather good
argument for why there should not be a list, given the changing names.
That goes to the heart of the issue: there can be a problem whenever
there are lists in legislation. He needs to be assured that all
reporting authorities will be covered. There was a short exchange about
why the Environment Agency was not included, and the reason that he
gave was that it reports to DEFRA. However, Natural England and British
Waterways also report to DEFRA and they have been included. That
illustrates the difficulties. We understand perfectly well the good
reasons behind the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, but the
difficulties of drawing up such lists have also been
illustrated.</div><a name="08070375000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
propose issuing guidance to all reporting authorities, and any other
organisation should be able to access that guidance freely. That will
help to ensure greater consistency and robustness in the approach taken
by reporting authorities. The guidance will also be publicly available,
which we hope will mean that other organisations will have some
interest in the guidance, even those that are not required and are not
reporting authorities. That makes a specific list of organisations
completely
unnecessary.</div><a name="08070375000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
specifying such a list in the Bill would send out the wrong signal to
other crucial bodies that are not involved in adaptation by suggesting
that they might not be as important as others in our efforts to try 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 321</div>to become a well adapted United Kingdom. In trying to identify key
bodies for adaptation, amendment No. 78 misses out important
organisations, such as other parts of the health service, local
authorities, infrastructure providers and so on. The amendment also
includes some organisations that, although not unimportant&#151;they
are very important&#151;do not have responsibility for delivering
adaptation. I cite the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution in
that context.</div>
<a name="08070375000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
committed to producing a strategy for the use of the reporting power in
clause 60 within a year of Royal Assent, and will set out what we think
are the priority bodies at that time. That will be done in consultation
with those bodies and through a study of the existing capacity and
tools to address adaptation. We believe that that is a better approach
than simply listing bodies. We plan to consult on the guidance,
alongside our strategy for use of the adaptation reporting power, early
next year. Perhaps those comments make it clear why we need to resist
that particular
listing.</div><a name="08070375000475"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="08070375000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me turn to amendment No. 79. As we discussed on earlier clauses,
climate change is an issue for not just DEFRA, but the whole of
Government, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said and as has been echoed
elsewhere in the Committee. That is even more the case with adaptation,
because all sectors of the economy and society are likely to be
affected to some degree by the physical impacts of climate change. The
definition of reporting authorities that we have adopted in the Bill is
therefore intentionally wide to capture all relevant bodies that need
to take action. Both hon. Gentlemen referred to the question of
Ministers of the Crown not being included in the definition of
reporting authorities. Amendment No. 79 suggests altering the Bill so
that they are included, so I must look at what that would
do.</div><a name="08070375000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that the amendment is both unnecessary and constitutionally
peculiar. It is unnecessary because the Government already have express
duties under clauses 55 and 56 to assess the risks from climate change
and to draw up programmes of action, which would encompass action
across all areas of central UK Government activity. The amendment
simply duplicates those fundamental requirements of the Bill. Frankly,
there is little point in giving the Secretary of State a power to ask
himself to do what he is already required to do. We will resist the
amendments, which would ensure that all Ministers and Departments
across Government were listed as the hon. Gentleman suggests, because
we believe that we have the working mechanisms within Cabinet
government to deliver what is required. Cabinet government is an
effective way of ensuring that such policy issues are addressed in a
joined-up manner and that decisions can be taken
collectively.</div><a name="08070375000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just
for the information of the Committee, all Departments already work on
adapting to climate change&#151;we are not waiting for the Bill to
provide for that. Ministers in every Department are doing such work. I
am the Minister with responsibility for adaptation in DEFRA and I have
bilaterals with my colleagues. I can assure the Committee that the
Department of Health, the Department for Transport and the Department
for Communities and Local Government&#151;I think that that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 322</div>Department was mentioned&#151;are working on that issue. They have
much to tell us, not least of their proposals, which I can assure hon.
Members are
sustainable.</div><a name="08070375000309"></a>

Horwood:</b> On the specific issue of the Department of
Health&#151;I again refer the Committee to the personal interest that
I declared earlier&#151;there are highly developed action and
contingency plans in every primary care trust across the country for
the human variant of avian flu, which is a potential catastrophe. Whole
conferences have been held. Can the Minister give one example of
equivalent planning that has been attached to anything to do with
adaptation to climate
change?</div><a name="08070375000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000611"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> My hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment
helpfully suggests to me that he believes that our plans on flooding
have progressed in that direction. I would also say to the hon.
Gentleman that adaptation is something of a new science. To apply it in
a sustainable way, which is what we are all concerned about, will
require a great deal of research, effort and learning by everyone in
government. We cannot expect adaptation to have already been sorted;
there would then be no point in having the Bill and all that goes with
it. Adaptation is something that we will have to work on consistently
over many years into the foreseeable future. It is not something that
is done and dusted, and on which we get a report and that is the end of
it. The work will continue for many years across the Government. We
would not expect to have complete packages at this
stage.</div><a name="08070375000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are saying clearly that the adaptation sub-committee of the Climate
Change Committee will examine the Government&#146;s progress on
delivering adaptation, provide independent and expert advice on what
further action the Government need to take, and deliver that advice. As
I have said, Departments are already working closely together and will
soon be launching the adaptation website to communicate the
Government&#146;s overall approach to responding to the impact of
climate change, and to provide a useful framework for developing the
programme, including a practical toolkit for use by organisations to
help them to adapt to climate change. That will include future
priorities for each Department. I was reminded that the Department of
Health undertook work in response to the heat waves in 2003, which led
to about 2,000 deaths. It has carried out a great deal of planning to
deal with the health effects of heat waves that might
occur.</div><a name="08070375000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
shall include future priorities for each Department and demonstrate the
joined-up approach that is taken. We will also publish an accompanying
document summarising the cross-Government programme. I hope that I have
satisfied the hon. Member for Cheltenham that all Departments will be
engaged in the normal way and that there is no need for the
amendment.</div><a name="08070375000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000612"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister&#146;s critique of amendment No.
78 was well informed, as I would expect. I accept that the list is not
perfect and that it might contain inconsistencies. However, the fact
that it is not as comprehensive as it could be is not an argument
against having a list. Some complex and diverse organisations in the
further reaches of the Government might think that, in some way, this
is not their problem.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 323</div><a name="08070375000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am less reassured and convinced by the hon. Lady&#146;s critique of
amendment No. 79. We are trying to construct a framework for the
Government&#146;s policy that will be resilient to short-term
political storms and calculations. She said that the plans for
adaptation would encompass actions by other Ministers and that the
Secretary of State for EFRA could report on them. However, encompassing
other people&#146;s plans is not the same as issuing guidance and
using all the expertise and resources at DEFRA&#146;s disposal to
encourage, or even to direct, other Ministers to get a move on and
develop
plans.</div><a name="08070375000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department of Health provides a salutary lesson in such matters. We are
all starting to talk about adaptation on a grand scale. We would assume
that everyone had dealt with mitigation long ago and had been thinking
about it for many years, yet the Department of Health issued its first
consultation on the response of the NHS to climate change mitigation
issues only in the past month. That was a slow
response.</div><a name="08070375000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000613"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> The Minister did not raise the matter, so my
understanding might be out of date, but the Crown is indivisible. One
Secretary of State cannot prosecute another Secretary of State because
they are all part of the Crown. Our constitution is based on the
concept of a collective Government. We cannot have a position in which
one Secretary of State is trundling off to the High Court to sue
another Secretary of State. The proceedings would be struck up as the
Crown suing the Crown, but perhaps I have misunderstood the basic
principles of constitutional law.</div>
<a name="08070375000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000614"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
learned intervention. The clause does not refer to anyone taking legal
action against anyone else, but to issuing guidance. If Ministers are
not allowed to issue guidance to each other, that must be news to the
Chief Secretary to the
Treasury.</div><a name="08070375000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000615"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> The sanction in any legislation is ultimately
judicial review, and that works only if there is a sanction. This would
necessitate one Secretary of State seeking a sanction against another
Secretary of State if one believes that the other has not issued
suitable guidance or complied with the terms of the
Act.</div><a name="08070375000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000616"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Again, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
his well-informed intervention. I understand his point, but it is an
unduly pessimistic scenario in which one can issue guidance only if it
is backed up by a legal sanction. However, given the Minister&#146;s
comments and her uncharacteristic reluctance to accept our positive
suggestions once again, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000618"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> If I may refresh the Committee&#146;s memory,
the amendment would place a duty on local authorities to co-operate on
adaptation. That is important because there is a gap in the Bill
whereby councils may be substantially deficient in their ability to
prepare for the effects of climate change if they do not have access to
information from other reporting authorities. The amendment seeks to
bridge that gap by facilitating the pooling of information between
public bodies and ensuring their co-operation with councils so that
local areas are adequately prepared for the effects of climate change
planning.</div><a name="08070375000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">Councils
are unique in that they have close access to local information on
infrastructures and the ability to produce comprehensive, detailed and
accurate reports that will be greatly beneficial to central Government.
While local government has the capacity to report on its estates and
services under its direct control, it is not in a position to chase and
collate information from non-council public authorities, by which I
mean former public utilities such as water, electricity or gas supply
companies.</div>
<a name="08070375000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover, if
councils are required to make a report, they need the power to require
relevant, reliable and timely co-operation from non-council public
authorities. The prevention of flooding is a key example of an area in
which the amendment would be mutually beneficial to both public bodies
and local councils.</div>
<a name="08070375000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">As was
demonstrated by last summer&#146;s floods, a number of public bodies
are involved in operations to deal with the consequences of floods and
with flood prevention. To achieve that, it is essential that the
relevant bodies are able to impart information and collaborate in
investigations to root out the causes of the floods. However, to
resolve the problem successfully in all cases, it is necessary that
they explain their actions and work with local authorities to make
improvements.</div>
<a name="08070375000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ineffectiveness of the current process was demonstrated last summer in
Leeds, when the city council was able to access Yorkshire
Water&#146;s sewer records only on a stand-alone basis. It was not
permitted to superimpose that data against its own information to gain
a fuller picture of surface water drainage. Unsurprisingly, it is
difficult to investigate drainage problems holistically when the
various records can be seen only in isolation. That strikes me as an
inefficient use of data, when sharing information at no real expense to
either third party would have had distinct benefits for tackling
flooding.</div>
<a name="08070375000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
that there is a need for those who have a statutory duty to keep
drainage records to also have a duty to share such records with other
related organisations. For example, the effective maintenance and
upkeep of drainage infrastructure requires those bodies responsible to
maintain adequate records to highlight any risks. By
sharing and collating that information, all the
facts required would be in place to make an accurate assessment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 325</div>of how such infrastructure should be maintained and
by whom. The experience of Hull city council, in an area that suffered
severely from floods last summer, is a prime example. The draining
system was overwhelmed and an independent report investigating the
floods subsequently highlighted that the lack of information on the
ownership of watercourses and their maintenance regimes resulted in
there being no sole agency or combined body in control.</div>
<a name="08070375000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
enough simply to assume that non-council reporting authorities, through
central guidance, will in all cases take reasonable steps to co-operate
and respond effectively with councils. It is thus necessary to underpin
effective action with statutory obligations. As we remember the
appalling floods that damaged parts of the country so badly on two
occasions last year, and we are mindful of the fact that much of the
human misery caused was preventable through better co-operation between
public bodies and councils, I hope that the Minister will accept the
amendment.</div>
<a name="08070375000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000619"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Amendment No. 105 recognises and highlights the
importance of co-operation in producing adaptation reports. In that
sense, we agree with what the hon. Gentleman has said in support of his
amendment. There is a need for co-operation. When it is essential for a
successful approach to adapting to climate change, we have already put
a number of measures into the Bill to ensure co-operation between
relevant reporting authorities. Our approach is measured and
proportionate to the
task.</div><a name="08070375000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State&#146;s and Welsh Ministers&#146; guidance to
reporting authorities will include co-operation, as set out in clause
59(1)(c). Additionally, clause 60(2) already provides for the power to
request joint reports from reporting authorities. When considering
which public bodies should be subject to directions to prepare
adaptation reports, we will consider which other bodies should be
subject to similar directions to ensure that each sector is undertaking
adequate assessments of climate risk and that particular areas of the
country are covered properly in a joined-up way.</div>
<a name="08070375000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have sought
advice on the issue that the hon. Gentleman raised about the floods. I
am told that the powers in the Bill require reporting authorities to
co-operate, and that will specifically include sharing information. It
is clear that what I am saying in general would cover the case that he
has raised because of the specific requirement to share information.
With that duty to co-operate and share information, and the power to
direct authorities to produce joint reports, which would require them
to bring their information together, I believe that we already have in
the Bill a set of measures that provides a strong framework and offers
a more proportionate response to ensuring that there is appropriate
co-operation between reporting authorities in producing the adaptation
report.</div><a name="08070375000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the amendment was well meant and the purpose behind it.
I hope that I have satisfied the hon. Gentleman that the Bill provides
what he
seeks.</div><a name="08070375000478"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000620"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I appreciate the Minister&#146;s words about the
amendment. Given that this is an important area and that there have
been practical examples of where a lack of co-operation has had a bad
effect on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div>local ability to deal with severe weather, which
will only increase with the onset of climate change, we would have
liked the Bill to contain a more clearly stated obligation on local
authorities to co-operate on adaptation. However, I heard what the
Minister said about the obligations being diffused elsewhere in the
legislation. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08070375000338"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000621"></a>Miss

this part of the Bill, but they also have relevance to other measures
in the
Bill.</div><a name="08070375000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government stated in their command paper on the draft Bill that the
legislation places a legal duty on the Government to ensure that the UK
meets its targets and stays within the limits of its carbon budgets.
Clause 61 gives the Secretary of State a duty

the Minister explain how the Government could be required to take
remedial action by order of a court? Will the directions of the
Secretary of State be justiciable and legally enforceable? Will they be
subject to judicial
review?</div><a name="08070375000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Bill&#151;particularly clause 61 and, indeed, the whole part on
adaptation&#151;is to have legal effect at all, it is important that
there should be a possibility of a challenge. This relates to some of
the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury. In its
report on the draft Bill, the Select Committee said that if what the
Government seek to achieve is to mean anything at all, there should be
legal sanctions and the possibility for a case to be taken before a
court of
law.</div><a name="08070375000346"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000622"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I hope that I can satisfy the hon. Lady by giving
her a very direct answer: yes, the directions will be legally
enforceable. It may be helpful to the Committee if I say that the
clause means that a reporting authority that has been given directions
to produce a report by the Secretary of State is under a duty to comply
with those
directions.</div><a name="08070375000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the clause requires that reporting authorities must have regard, as far
as is relevant, to the Government&#146;s reports under clause 55,
which deals with the national climate change assessment, and under
clause 56, which deals with the UK adaptation programme. That will
ensure that reporting authorities factor in the latest information
about climate impacts in the UK and take into consideration Government
priorities and policies on adaptation. I hope that the hon. Lady is
satisfied with the
clause.</div><a name="08070375000348"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Ruddock:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 103, in
clause 69, page 32, line 40, leave
out &#145;may only be brought&#146; and insert
&#145;come&#146;.</div><a name="08070375000352"></a>

Government amendment No.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000625"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I assure the Committee that the amendments are
small and technical. Perhaps it is unfortunate that we have not yet had
the debate on waste incentives as it might not be entirely clear why we
have tabled these amendments. We have done so to remove the link that
exists between regulation-making powers relating to waste reduction
schemes and the orders that will designate authorities as pilot areas.
Within the proposals of this part of the Bill, we wish to see pilots
undertaken by local authorities on waste reduction incentive schemes.
For example, the regulations might be needed to allow local authorities
to show waste charges and rebates on the council tax bill, or to enable
them to collect outstanding charges more effectively through the county
court and in relation to appeals processes. Under the existing
drafting, the legislation prevents any such regulations being laid in
Parliament until orders are made designating pilot
authorities.</div>
<a name="08070375000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments will allow the Secretary of State to make regulations using
the relevant powers before the pilot authorities are formally
designated. That will ensure that authorities interested in piloting a
waste reduction scheme can be provided with a clear legislative
framework by the time they are formally designated as pilots. As is the
position at the moment, the regulations will not have any effect until
the pilots are designated, and the amendments do not change the scope
of the existing regulation-making powers set out in schedule
5.</div>
<a name="08070375000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
can assure the Committee that these are minor and technical amendments
that will ensure that the Government can provide certainty for the
pilot authorities, rather than them having to wait for the making of
the designation orders.</div>
<a name="08070375000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000626"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I have taken what the Minister said on board.
These are tidying-up amendments and they are relevant only in light of
our debate on the Government and Opposition amendments that follow. I
do not propose to delay our discussion. We will deal with the more
substantive changes to schedule 5 in the next group of amendments.

Bill.</div>
<a name="08070375000359"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000627"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> It is good to note, Mr. Atkinson,
that even those in the highest echelons can sometimes be caught
unawares by electronic
devices.</div><a name="08070375000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is our first opportunity to discuss this part of the Bill. I do not
wish to take issue with what the Government are proposing, but this is
a Bill on climate change. It is interesting to see that this part has
been added to the Bill, so I wonder whether the Minister will explain
why that has happened. This part of the Bill&#151;clause 69
onwards&#151;does not seem relevant to climate change. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 328</div>That does not mean that matters to do with waste
disposal and energy from waste cannot help to reduce emissions, but the
measure seems very heavily geared towards the domestic
household.</div>
<a name="08070375000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a few
moments we will move on to schedule 5, but the issue is more about what
is not in clause 69. I would like to have seen some review and emphasis
of the EU packaging directive to show that the Government are on course
to reduce packaging. I am concerned that, in respect of Government
approaches to things, we seem to penalise the end user every time yet,
in many instances, the end user has no control over the packaging,
particularly in respect of supermarkets and food. I should like to have
seen some reference in clause 69 and related clauses to other waste
issues, including food waste and anaerobic digestion. Many other issues
could have been dealt with under this part of the Bill, especially in
clause 69, so why did the Government not do
so?</div><a name="08070375000362"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000628"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I agree with what the hon. Member for Vale of York
says. Inevitably, as we discuss the succeeding clauses, we will dwell
in great detail on the sorts of schemes that local authorities might
run with regard to residual domestic waste, incentives on householders,
and the things that councils can do to penalise or reward people. This
is probably the right place, under the general heading of waste
reduction schemes, to probe the Minister on the thing that our
constituents say to all hon. Members: &#147;We&#146;d throw less
away if, when we left the supermarket, there was less in our trolleys
and shopping
bags.&#148;</div><a name="08070375000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is unfortunate that the scope of the waste reduction schemes covered by
clause 69 is limited, under schedule 5, to just domestic schemes.
Householders have limited control over a lot of the residual waste that
we will be talking about. They can do something about it, but are often
lumbered with it. We should now be asking the Government what their
part of the bargain is regarding the duties that they are
placing on manufacturers and retailers to minimise packaging and waste
generally.</div><a name="08070375000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will be focusing overwhelmingly on what the householder can do and what
sticks and carrots councils can apply to them, but this is the right
point in the Bill to ask the Government what they are going to do to
make it easier for householders to avoid the sticks and to benefit from
the
carrots.</div><a name="08070375000365"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070375000629"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Hurd</b> (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con): I add my voice to
those expressing disappointment that the Government have chosen to bolt
this on to the Bill. This is an enormously important and groundbreaking
Bill. It only has one value and that is as a framework Bill designed to
put in place a much better process for setting targets for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, revising those targets and holding the
Government of the day to account for performance on meeting those
targets. We hope that the Bill will be scrutinised around the world. It
would have been much better to have kept it pure in purpose, but the
Government have not been able to resist the urge to add a few more
baubles on to the Christmas tree, which dilutes the value of the
Bill.</div><a name="08070375000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am interested in why it was necessary to add this provision to the Bill
and whether there was consideration of other mechanisms to introduce
legislation that would have enabled what are, in effect, some pilot
projects in local authority areas. The measures dilute the Bill, so why
were they necessary?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 329</div><a name="08070375000367"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000630"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I shall respond to the last point first. I am
asked why it is necessary to add to the Bill. I am surprised that
Opposition Members do not see the connection between reducing waste and
climate change. Waste in this country has, historically, gone to
landfill, thus causing an immense problem with the production of
methane, which Committee members have drawn to our attention as a more
potent gas than even
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>.</div><a name="08070375000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem involving huge quantities of waste and methane is of enormous
concern in relation to mitigation. There is an absolute necessity to
reduce what goes into landfill, and that is why the proposals are in
the
Bill.</div><a name="08070375000479"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="08070375000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000631"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> With the greatest respect, I do not think that my
hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood doubted that for a minute.
He was simply saying, &#147;Why pick on waste?&#148; Why is there
no provision in the Bill for carbon capture and storage? Why is there
no provision in the Bill for microgeneration and feed-in tariffs? Why
is there nothing in the Bill to promote combined heat and power? Why
does the Bill not address the expansion of Heathrow airport? Why does
the Bill not address energy efficiency? The list goes on and on, so my
hon. Friend made a good point.</div>
<a name="08070375000370"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000632"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Gentleman has just given a list of all
the things that are bound to be considered when the Government seek to
mitigate emissions from the various sectors that he has just described.
The measure is being proposed because it does not exist elsewhere. We
are the only country in the EU15 that does not allow local authorities
to charge for some aspects of waste removal. There is a strong reason
behind the measure. It comes before us because local government asked
central Government to make such powers available to local
government.</div><a name="08070375000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Conservative Members know, their party controls a significant number of
local authorities, and the Local Government Association, which is
Conservative-controlled, has an environment committee, the chair of
which is Paul Bettison, who is well known to us all. He said in
response to a Communities and Local Government Committee
report:</div>
<a name="08070375000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
report rightly points out that it is only councils, in consultation
with local people, who can decide the best system for collecting waste
and boosting recycling rates. Although pilot schemes are a step in the
right direction, the power should be there for all councillors to
reward hard working families who do their bit for the
environment...The Government should bring forward amendments to
the Climate Change Bill to give councils the power to introduce
incentive schemes as the Committee has
recommended.&#148;</div><a name="08070375000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems that the chair of the Local Government Association&#146;s
environment committee is enthusiastic that such measures should be in
the
Bill.</div><a name="08070375000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said at the outset, waste in landfill is a major problem. It is not
sustainable, and 3 per cent. of all UK greenhouse gas emissions come
from methane from biodegradable waste in landfill. Waste reduction
schemes may have an important role to play in encouraging people to
throw away less and to recycle
more.</div><a name="08070375000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Vale of York asked why there was concentration on
domestic households and what the Government were doing to try to
persuade those who produce so much packaging waste to produce less 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 330</div>and to decrease what I acknowledge is enormous frustration among
householders about the packaging waste issue. First, she mentioned the
EU packaging directive. As she is aware, there are two: one is
concerned with the recycling of the waste that is produced, and the
other is concerned with minimisation of waste. In Brussels, we have
pressed very hard for more to be done on the minimisation of waste. We
do not believe that that directive has worked well, and we have pressed
for action on it. That has not been forthcoming to date, but we always
hope.</div>
<a name="08070375000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
meantime, we have tried to agree voluntary arrangements with major
retailers, and I am pleased to record that those who have entered into
the voluntary Courtauld agreement have done so on the basis that there
will be at least an end to the growth in packaging waste by the end of
this year, and a reduction by 2010. In the meantime, on the advice of
the Waste and Resources Action Programme, which is funded by the
Government, there has been the lightweighting of packaging and a
reduction in its amount in ways that, unfortunately, consumers often
cannot see. In defence of retailers, some packaging is necessary, and
some good work has been done, but there is a great deal more to do. We
are pursuing that in every
way.</div><a name="08070375000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Vale of York also asked about food waste, which is one
of the most extraordinary aspects of our society. We throw into the
waste stream a third of all the food that we purchase, and that is
costing UK citizens &#163;10 billion a year. That is a horrific waste
at this time. We want to do more about that across Government. We are
making considerable inroads with the &#147;Love Food Hate
Waste&#148; programme, which was launched by myself and the Waste and
Resources Action Programme. We are aware that the public are
particularly sensitive to the issue at this time, and they are
receiving these messages about reducing food waste and the necessity of
doing so.</div>
<a name="08070375000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
dealt with all the questions, I will return to what we are trying to do
in the Bill. Local authorities asked for such opportunities. We know
that they have made progress, but they want to do more, and we need
them to do more. Over the past 10 years, recycling rates have
quadrupled and they now stand at around 33 per cent. As hon. Members
will know, we still lag far behind much of Europe and that is why we
need to do more. Householders have a vital role to play. Municipal
waste accounts for more than a quarter of the waste sent to landfill in
England, and household waste forms a large part of that.</div>
<a name="08070375000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">To enable us
to do more, we need to try out new possibilities. We cannot afford to
sit back and say that things will never work, especially when research
shows that waste reduction schemes really help. We know that from other
countries. A particularly good example is Sweden where, in one of its
municipalities, residual waste as a result of such schemes fell by 45
per cent. in the first year of the scheme, and waste separated for
recycling or composting rose by 49 per cent.</div>
<a name="08070375000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">Likewise, in
Seattle, where householders pay according to the size of their bin,
recycling tonnages have increased by 60 per cent., and participation in
recycling has increased by 80 per cent. That is undoubtedly why local
authorities have proposed to Government that they should have the
opportunity to incentivise householders to reduce the amount of waste
that they produce and to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>recycle more. The Bill proposes that we allow up to five local
authorities to pilot schemes. However, those schemes will not have been
tried in this country before, which is why this is a very modest
proposal.</div><a name="08070375000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to learn from the pilots and from the response of both the
authorities and the public. Once we have evaluated the impact of the
pilots, we will be in a position to decide whether or not to roll out
the powers more
widely.</div><a name="08070375000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
69 introduces schedule 5, which provides the legislative framework for
waste collection authorities to set up a waste reduction&#151;or a
waste incentive&#151;scheme. Householders who throw away the least
will receive a rebate from the local authority and, under some schemes,
but not necessarily all, householders who throw away the most will pay
more.</div><a name="08070375000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the schemes, many people will be better off. That is because any money
that is received by the councils in charges will have to be paid back
to residents. That is on the basis of the condition called
revenue-neutrality. Overall, residents do not pay any more to the
authority.</div><a name="08070375000383"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070375000633"></a><b class="B">Gordon
Banks</b> (Ochil and South Perthshire) (Lab): I wonder whether
the Minister will explain her point about some householders paying more
and some paying less. Is it based on how many people inhabit a house? A
house with two occupants would have a different &#147;budget&#148;
to houses with four or five
occupants.</div><a name="08070375000384"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000634"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his
intervention. The whole point of having pilots is to try to work out a
fair system. Concern has been expressed that larger households will
produce more waste than smaller ones. Strangely enough, research shows
that proportionately, smaller households produce as much waste, and
occasionally more. It is quite complicated, because we have a lot of
research under way, which WRAP has undertaken. In the case of those
schemes, the pilot authorities must have regard to vulnerable
households, which could include larger households. It is quite
possible, whatever the design of the scheme, that there would be an
allowance for larger
households.</div><a name="08070375000385"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000635"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am not arguing against permissive powers, and
in general we favour the freedom of local authorities to experiment
with the consent of their electors. As well as larger
households&#151;in other words, families with children&#151;there
is also the issue of small households that might not have the space to
compost organic waste or put it in relatively smelly wormeries. In one
case, they do not have sufficient space in a small flat, and in the
other they would almost certainly break their tenancy agreement and act
against the interests of public health. Does she accept that that is
also an issue and that the guidelines on social justice in that respect
need to be drawn pretty broadly?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000636"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Indeed; the hon. Gentleman has made a sensible
comment. We know that the schemes are operating in many other countries
that clearly have a spectrum of household composition and home types,
just as we have in this country. It would be for the local authority
that sought to pilot the scheme to look at all of that and at their own
demographics. It would perhaps 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div>choose one part of the authority where it would do the pilot and decide
that other parts were not suitable. All of that is possible, and we
expect the authorities that come forward to take all those issues into
account.</div><a name="08070375000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to complete what I was saying on revenue neutrality. A further
protection for residents exists, as authorities will need to keep a
separate account of charges and rebates under the scheme, which will
allow residents to assure themselves that the revenue neutrality
requirement is being kept, which is enormously important. A huge amount
of hostile press has been generated, I am sorry to say, by the hon.
Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), who speaks for
the Opposition on communities and local government. He has suggested
that this is some form of stealth tax and that people could be subject
to huge payments&#151;I have ever seen a figure of &#163;1,000 a
year quoted, which is absolutely ludicrous. We have made it clear that
we want the schemes to be revenue neutral and transparent, that it is
essential that residents buy into them and that there will be a
communications strategy. That is all very clear. Also, the indicative
amounts that we have mentioned for such schemes have been of the order
of &#163;50, which is nothing like what has been suggested.</div>
<a name="08070375000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, local authorities would have to take account of groups that could
be unduly disadvantaged, provide a good kerbside recycling service,
implement a fly-tipping prevention strategy and communicate with local
people. While providing a good level of protection for householders, we
are also keen to provide authorities with flexibility and options to
ensure that schemes are efficient and effective on the ground, as I
have indicated. Local authorities will be free to design schemes that
suit local circumstances and integrate rebates or charges with the
administration of a council tax system, if they so choose.</div>
<a name="08070375000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
really gone past the point when we can simply sit back and watch
landfill sites fill up and belch out methane emissions. We have to try
new measures, and it is only responsible for us to respond to the
wishes of local authorities that have proposed, like other countries in
continental Europe, that they should have the opportunity to have such
schemes. It is a matter of extreme regret that the hon. Member for
Brentwood and Ongar has warned local authorities in a letter that
councils that introduce &#147;bin taxes&#148; will be vilified in
the popular press and punished at the polls. He
stated:</div><a name="08070375000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nationally,
we will not hesitate to criticise any supposedly-Conservative council
which collaborates with the Labour
Ministers&#148;.</div><a name="08070375000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that Opposition Front Benchers in Committee will disassociate
themselves from that threat to local authorities, which is nothing but
bullying and undermining democratic
accountability.</div><a name="08070375000480"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="08070375000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">Piloting
is a sensible way of trying out these new measures and testing them in
a UK context, as it will add to our understanding and that of the
public and local authorities. After the pilots, we will be able to make
a well-founded decision on whether to make the powers available to more
local authorities.</div>
<a name="08070375000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thought I
had answered all the questions, but it has been suggested that perhaps
I have not&#151;helpful notes are being passed to me, but I think I
have dealt with the matter. However, I am told&#151;this is a useful
point&#151;that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 333</div>the packaging directive targets will save more than
8 million tonnes of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> this year alone. I should
also say something that I did not mention before: earlier this year, I
increased the recovery rates from forms of packaging in this
country.</div><a name="08070375000393"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000637"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> As my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and
Battle has just said from a sedentary position, this is a technical
amendment&#151;unless I am confusing it with an earlier one. This has
been a timely and helpful debate. The Government got it
wrong&#151;not in signing up to the EU landfill directive, but in
signing up and committing the United Kingdom to the landfill directive
before we had alternative waste disposal schemes in place. That is
something that is going to cost all of us
dearly.</div><a name="08070375000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s response to the debate is a little bit unfair and
disingenuous on the householder, because the householder is not in
control of how products reach them&#151;I accept that they are in
control of the amount of food that they waste. However, when a consumer
is shopping in a supermarket, they do not have control over the
packaging or what will ultimately be waste. Let us consider unsolicited
mail, which is a growing curse. Of course, I do not mean our election
leaflets, but, for example, the free newspaper that comes around or
other things that one does not wish to see cross one&#146;s
door.</div><a name="08070375000395"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000638"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I assure the hon. Lady that we are trying to work
across every front on that issue. She is right, and we are discussing
that matter with the direct mail organisation. We hope to have new
agreements on that, and we are trying to discourage the proliferation
of material. The householder does have some control. Some people choose
to shop and buy loose goods rather than heavily packaged goods.
Clearly, we should boycott those goods that are most heavily
packaged.</div>
<a name="08070375000396"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000639"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> To a large extent, we are in broad agreement. I
remember visiting a direct mail factory during one of my election
campaigns, which caused some consternation apropos my earlier remarks.
We all want less waste to go to landfill, but the Government have
wasted an opportunity, because they could have educated the public on
alternative means of waste disposal, particularly incineration, energy
from waste, combined heat and power, or anaerobic digestion&#151;I do
not care what we call it. The public seem to go into freefall whenever
a local council comes out with a policy that involves smoke or burning,
whether it is in Guildford, where bizarrely the Liberal Democrats
opposed an incinerator, or in Sheffield, where they proposed
one.</div><a name="08070375000397"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000640"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Lady is right; there is a need for
public education. It is now accepted that no serious health effects
result from incineration. That has been dealt with&#151;not least, by
Government. In addition, &#163;2 billion of PFI credits
are available for waste infrastructure and there is no prohibition on
any form of scheme. Some are coming forward as incinerators, and
&#163;10 million is available for anaerobic
digesters.</div><a name="08070375000398"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000641"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I have recently received a briefing from North
Yorkshire county council, and councils seem to be well apprised. The
Minister has referred to the need to guard against fly-tipping, which
causes great concern in rural areas.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 334</div><a name="08070375000399"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000642"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I remind the Committee that we are
talking about waste reduction, not waste disposal, either through
incineration or
fly-tipping.</div><a name="08070375000400"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000643"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I hate to say, &#147;I told you so&#148;, to
the Minister. There were two warnings about the problems that clause 60
could bring, which the Government do not seem to have heeded. One
warning was in the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government
report on refuse collection, which was issued on 16 July 2007. The
Committee
was</div><a name="08070375000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not
convinced that enough work has been done or guidance given to local
authorities on how to prevent such risks from blighting areas and
causing
disputes.&#148;</div><a name="08070375000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
same Committee&#146;s second special report on &#147;Refuse
Collection: Waste Reduction Pilots&#148; in February this year
recommended
that</div><a name="08070375000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Government withdraw its financial incentive pilot proposals from the
Climate Change Bill and reconsider devolving the power to introduce
schemes to local authorities
themselves.&#148;</div><a name="08070375000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would
the Minister like to comment on why she did not follow their
advice?</div><a name="08070375000403"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000644"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> What we saw in the CLG Committee reports was far
greater ambition than has come from local government. The suggestion
that there should be a specific waste-charging system, analogous to a
utility, is not one that has found favour with local government. That
is why local government, in presenting suggestions to central
Government about what might be done, has looked to do something that is
clearly much more of a halfway house than the CLG Committee would have
wished.</div><a name="08070375000404"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000645"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Finally, just for the record, I believe that the
Government&#146;s approach of having a limited trial and a limited
pilot project&#151;I think that five are ongoing&#151;for which the
Government have been criticised, has allowed hostile media
coverage.</div><a name="08070375000405"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000646"></a>Joan
Walley:</b> Despite the recommendations in the CLG Committee
report, is there not a real sense of urgency about not only carbon but
the availability of landfill sites? It is important that we make a
start and see how those pilots can inform what is
needed.</div><a name="08070375000406"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000647"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> That is a helpful intervention. As I said at the
outset, the problem is that the Government signed up to impossible
targets. I am in total agreement about reducing waste going to
landfill, but it is impossible to ask councils to meet those targets,
if there are not alternative sites. If we look at what is happening in
Naples, I can only assume that the Italian Government are having
exactly the same difficulty as our
own.</div><a name="08070375000407"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000648"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> We are on target for the reduction in waste going
to landfill from households for 2010, and we are entirely optimistic
about 2013. The reason why we are making so much money available to
encourage much greater provision of waste disposal infrastructure is
because the 2020 target is challenging. However, we are content that we
know what we are doing, and we certainly have no expectation of ending
up in a Naples situation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 335</div><a name="08070375000408"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000649"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> The Minister will be aware that my colleague,
whom I now refer to as David Davis, called his by-election, which will
take place on Thursday one week hence, precisely on issues such as
intrusion by inspectors, which relates to these proposals. I hope that
the powers given to local council inspectors for policing the
arrangement will not come back to haunt the
Government.</div><a name="08070375000409"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000650"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> There is no suggestion that this scheme will be a
massive intrusion into people&#146;s lives. There is no suggestion
that this scheme will be a massive intrusion into people&#146;s
lives. As I have stressed, it has been done across Europe and north
America. Residents have accepted such schemes perfectly well in other
countries. When the proposals were put to people in a poll, we found
that about 60 per cent. of people felt them to be entirely
fair.</div><a name="08070375000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
bring the hon. Lady back to the purpose of this measure: people who do
their duty by recycling and reducing their residual waste should be
rewarded, and those who do not subscribe to the law could have a charge
placed on them, if the local authority so
chooses.</div><a name="08070375000411"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000651"></a>Miss

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000655"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> My right hon. Friend has been delayed in the main
Chamber, but this is an issue that he feels strongly about. I am sure
that he would want some discussion of it in the
Committee.</div><a name="08070375000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is little doubt outside the Committee that waste is an issue that
always seizes the public interest&#151;my constituents certainly talk
about it. Locally, there is still concern about the regularity of
collections, about what one can and cannot put in the recycling bin and
about the ever-increasing amount of waste that our homes seem to
produce. Overall, I am always struck by how genuinely enthusiastic most
people are about recycling. People like to do it. Parents enjoy showing
their children what they can put in the compost, the recycling bin and
the waste bin. There is a certain generation that never lost the
recycling habit, having grown up in the thrifty post-war years. It
makes people feel that they can do something tangible and practical to
lead towards a greener lifestyle. They feel that recycling is an
inherently good thing, leaving aside the climate change
agenda.</div><a name="08070375000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
enthusiasm for recycling is something that we must encourage and
nurture in every way we can. We must help people to do the right thing,
because it is the right thing to do. Additionally, as the Minister has
said, we still send far too much waste to landfill. The UK currently
produces 28 million tonnes of municipal waste every year, a whopping 83
per cent. of which ends up in landfill. We signed up to the EU landfill
directive to try to get that figure down, and it sets targets for the
reduction of biodegradable waste sent to landfill. We must achieve 75
per cent. of the 1995 level by 2010, 50 per cent. of that
level by 2013 and 35 per cent. of it by 2020. We have some considerable
work yet to do in this country, which is why we need a clear
collaboration between Government, local government and the
public.</div><a name="08070375000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
that spirit, I welcome the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Penrith and The Border. His proposals go right to the heart
of many of the issues that my constituents find most frustrating about
waste. They say that they want to recycle as much as they can, but not
if it means that their residual domestic waste will be collected less
frequently than once a week. They are happy to recycle, but they ask
why they cannot add so many plastics and waste products. For example,
only in a few places, and none that I know of, can one recycle Tetra
Pak cartons. So many of the juices and liquids that we buy are packaged
in such containers, and they all go to landfill. Why is it that so many
people cannot include polystyrene and other kinds of plastics in their
recycling bins?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 337</div><a name="08070375000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are
going to ask people to increase their recycling rates and, more
importantly, if we are going to threaten them with financial penalties
if they do not do so, we must make it as easy as possible to recycle,
which is the objective of amendments Nos. 108 and 109. In the interests
of public participation and acceptance, we must not threaten to
criminalise people who do not yet have the recycling habit or fail to
comply with their

Webb:</b> As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment No. 108 would prevent authorities that do not have weekly
residual waste schemes from running pilots. Although the boundary of
pilots is that they must be revenue-neutral, they could be net
give-aways. A council could run a scheme that did not penalise anybody
but just rewarded people, but his amendment prohibits authorities that
do not have weekly collections from running such pilots, which I
thought he would approve
of.</div><a name="08070375000425"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000657"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I should point out that the amendments are not
mine but those of my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The
Border. However, I wanted to put them before the Committee so that they
could be properly discussed. The hon. Gentleman raises a sensible
point, but the amendments&#146; main purpose is clear&#151;to allow
the Committee a full discussion of the issues. I shall speak clearly to
my own
amendment.</div><a name="08070375000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not think that it is in the interest of the recycling agenda to talk
about criminalising people who simply fail to change their waste habits
sufficiently. I cannot imagine a better way to get people&#146;s
backs up against something that they are naturally predisposed to do
than to tell them that if they do not do it, the Government will regard
them as criminals. There is a lot of merit in amendment No.
107.</div><a name="08070375000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
vital issue of public support and engagement leads me to new clause 18.
I have spoken to the Committee about the public suspicion that stealth
taxes are being dressed up as green taxes, and the danger that that
poses of putting an otherwise enthusiastic public off greening our
country. We must tread carefully around the issue of pay-as-you-throw
bin taxes. My party agrees totally with the Government that if we are
to reduce the amount of domestic waste that we produce, it must first
be measured&#151;we cannot reduce something unless we know how much
of it we are dealing with&#151;but how to incentivise the reduction
of waste to landfill is where we part company.</div>
<a name="08070375000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">By all means,
we should offer people incentives: &#147;Yes, you will pay less on
your council tax if you send less waste to landfill.&#148; That is
our common aspiration and the ambition of new clause 18. However, my
party does not wish to shake a stick at the public and say in the same
breath, &#147;But if you don&#146;t comply with this regulation,
we&#146;ll fine you through an additional charge on your council
tax.&#148; There are a number of reasons for our opposition to such a
penalty
system.</div><a name="08070375000429"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070375000658"></a><b class="B">Ms
Karen Buck</b> (Regent's Park and Kensington, North) (Lab):
Will the hon. Gentleman explain how the incentive is to be funded
without a corresponding mechanism for raising
income?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 338</div><a name="08070375000430"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000659"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> From the council tax. If somebody produces less
waste and instead produces recyclates, which have an economic value,
that should generate income. Currently, we have a standard tariff for
council tax. Encouraging more people to recycle will result in
over-achievement of targets. It should be revenue-positive.</div>
<a name="08070375000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
different sort of cash planning that assumes all the differentials and
incorporates into forward revenue planning and penalties for
non-recyclables. We think that that is the wrong way to go. If more
people recycle and reduce their waste, that will in itself create
surplus value, which should be retained. We should not create surplus
value by penalising and fining people at this stage. If we are to get
people into the recycling habit, we should be talking about carrots,
not
sticks.</div><a name="08070375000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, the Government&#146;s approach is a good way to turn
people off doing the right thing. The cost of living has already risen
dramatically in the past year, so we must be careful that the measures
are not seen as another way for this Government to extract money from
the public, as they have done in so many other
matters.</div><a name="08070375000433"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070375000660"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Chaytor</b> (Bury, North) (Lab): I agree completely with
the hon. Gentleman about the need for public reassurance that the new
and innovative schemes are genuinely about waste reduction. He made the
point about more carrots and no sticks, and said simultaneously that
the scheme would be funded entirely from a council&#146;s own budget,
but surely the incentives to those who increase their recycling will be
paid for by a significant increase in everyone else&#146;s council
tax. The stick will be a disproportionately higher increase in council
tax.</div><a name="08070375000434"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000661"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I do not agree. If we were saying that there was
no economic value to recycling and no benefit to be gained from
reducing the amount of rubbish that is collected, the hon. Gentleman
would have a point. However, as is recognised with benefit incentive
systems that operate in north America and in some parts of
Europe&#151;certainly in the United States&#151;there is an
economic value to people recycling. Someone will reap the benefit. By
and large, recyclates have an economic value, and if the council has to
collect, through its contractor, less rubbish as a result of people
recycling more, an economic surplus should be generated in the system.
We are saying that that surplus should be distributed back to those who
helped to generate it. It is not the zero-sum game that the hon.
Gentleman and the Minister have
implied.</div><a name="08070375000435"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000662"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> I appreciate the logic of what the hon. Gentleman
is saying. In time, with a mature and fully developed recycling
industry, that might happen, but at this stage in Britain&#146;s
recycling process, the flaw in his argument is that he is assuming that
the value of the recyclate that is created is equivalent to the level
of incentive needed to encourage more people to recycle. Given the
legacy of the low levels of recycling that the Government inherited,
that is just not the case. He is describing an ideal model, but one
that is completely unrelated to
reality.</div><a name="08070375000436"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000663"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Absolutely not. If the hon. Member for Bury, North
wants to talk about the low levels of recycling that the Government
inherited, let us examine the levels of recycling that the previous
Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column339" />Column number: 339</div>inherited from the Government before them. We must start looking
forward. Historical parallels and analogies do not get us
anywhere.</div><a name="08070375000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is knowledgeable in such matters and, as a member of the
Environmental Audit Committee, he does a lot of work. I encourage him
to consider some of the recycle bank work in north America. Dramatic
results have been achieved, simply by the use of incentives. That was
pioneered not by public money, but private finance. Within one
financial year, it has been possible to generate significant amounts of
value, which have been returned to the local residents. If the will is
there, such results are possible. If we do not allow councils to have a
fall-back in the first instance of large sticks as well as carrots, we
will end up devising a much more entrepreneurial, incentive-driven
system.</div><a name="08070375000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not arguing that we would rule out a philosophical moratorium
whereby, if the process did not work, we would not go down the road of
financial penalties. However, given where we are today in 2008 with a
sceptical public, with people uncertain about how they view the
Government and local government when it comes to imposing additional
burdens, it is really important that we take the public with us and do
not accept underperforming councils or those local authorities that are
more likely to rely on the additional revenue raised from sticks and do
not concentrate on extracting the value that the carrots would produce.
To win the day, we must first go down the road of
incentives.</div><a name="08070375000439"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000664"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman about
incentive schemes and their potential. It is much more important to
concentrate on carrots, not sticks. However, I am having difficulty
relating his argument to the amendments. I am trying to work out where
it is that a scheme that focused on incentives rather than penalties is
actually prevented in the Bill. Is the hon. Gentleman arguing against
the permissive powers to run the pilots that might test these
incentives in the United
Kingdom?</div><a name="08070375000440"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000665"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> That is exactly what I am doing. I am saying that
I am against permissive powers that would allow councils to penalise
those who do not recycle; that is exactly what I am doing. I thought
that I had made that
clear.</div><a name="08070375000441"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000666"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am sorry, but that is not my question. My
question is where does it say in the Bill that incentive schemes are
prevented.</div><a name="08070375000442"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070375000667"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I did not say that the Bill is preventing
incentive schemes. I am in favour of incentive schemes, and I am not
discussing an amendment on incentive schemes, but I am against
financial penalties. Amendment No. 107 states that the
Bill</div><a name="08070375000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;does
not include a power to create a criminal penalty on any householder for
non-compliance with any aspect of a waste reduction
scheme.&#146;.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 340</div><a name="08070375000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is my
point.</div>
<a name="08070375000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 18
would remove the ability to levy penalties charged on waste and instead
encourages positive public engagement through the offer of rewards for
waste reduction through council taxes.</div>
<a name="08070375000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a
couple of other points that I want to make very briefly. Variable
charging can be regressive, and it is easy to forget the impact that it
can have on larger families who have to produce more waste than a
childless couple. Also, it is not as easy for people living in flats
and apartments to recycle as much as those living in houses, who have
plenty of storage and access to multiple separate bins.</div>
<a name="08070375000446"></a><div class="hs_Para">These issues
must be carefully considered, and I do not think that anybody has come
up with a really satisfactory answer as to how we encourage recycling
in buildings of multiple occupation and large blocks of flats. Before
the Government race off down the track of giving councils the power to
levy penalties, we ought to think through solutions to those problems
first&#151;those problems are largely responsible for the very poor
performance of our largest metropolitan areas in recycling tables. So I
would appreciate the Minister&#146;s assurance that the Government
are working hard on researching solutions to those problems, as well as
falling back on financial penalties.</div>
<a name="08070375000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, there
is worrying evidence that imposing waste charges may in fact have a
detrimental effect on the local environment, due to an increase in
fly-tipping as people move to avoid the new financial penalties. We
have all spoken about the dangers of fly-tipping and how it is totally
unacceptable; the Minister herself spoke with particular passion on the
subject on Tuesday. Since variable charging was introduced in the
Republic of Ireland, 40 per cent. of households now admit to burning
some of their own rubbish, which has a significant effect on local
dioxin emissions.</div>
<a name="08070375000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">So we must be
certain that, if we were to introduce such a charging scheme in the UK,
we would not be indirectly either increasing the cost of living for
certain families, unintentionally damaging the local environment or
generally putting the public off recycling, which is a project that I
believe the vast majority of British people are positively predisposed
towards. However, if we jump in and dominate the recycling agenda, as
it will be given the media&#146;s interest in the issue, with
financial penalties and fines, we will be sending out the wrong
messages to a public who are otherwise predisposed towards being
constructive and working with us.</div>
<a name="08070375000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
new clause 18 would remove the ability to levy penalty charges on waste
and instead encourages positive public engagement through the offer of
rewards for waste reduction through council tax.</div>
