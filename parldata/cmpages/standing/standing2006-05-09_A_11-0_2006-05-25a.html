have a constructive, well-informed debate, it will be genuinely helpful

to have those regulations as soon as possible. Have you had any

is in his place. Perhaps he might be in a position to update the

Rayleigh(Mr. Francois) for giving me advance notice of his

point of order. It is my intention to fulfil the commitment made by my

predecessor, and I assure him that officials are working flat out to

produce the regulations. As my predecessor made clear, it is the

Government&#146;s intention to publish the draft regulations much

earlier than the night before. We hope to have 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 364</div>them all published by Thursday 3 June at the latest, although we might

be able to publish some parts before that. That will of course happen

during the recess, but the regulations will be available for Members to

access on the HMRC

website.</div><a name="06052529000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can also

tell the hon. Member for Rayleigh that a significant amount of detail

on the regulations&#146; intentions for the UK REITs regime was set

out in the commentary published alongside the Budget, which is also

available on the HMRC website. I remind him that they will be draft,

illustrative regulations and that there will be further time for

consultation with industry experts during the summer. Final regulations

will be laid in September or October, in advance of the regime&#146;s

1 January start date.</div>

<a name="06052529000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">If possible, all the

regulations will be published by or before next Thursday. That should

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000220"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> Before turning to the amendments, I include a

few brief words to put into context the subject that we are discussing.

We face the important task of scrutinising an entirely new framework

for the taxation of leasing transactions.</div>

<a name="06052529000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new structure for taxation

of leases was triggered by two considerations. Section 109 of the

Capital Allowances Act 2001 was felt to breach EU law because it gave

less favourable treatment to persons resident in other member states,

and I gather that the Revenue believes that some structured leases were

really finance leases dressed up to look like operating leases in order

to avoid tax. Responding to those two concerns, the Government have

introduced the concept of the long funding lease, which is at the heart

of the structure that we are examining. If a lease falls within the

definition of a long funding lease set out in the schedule, capital

allowances will be transferred from the lessor of the equipment to the

lessee, or lost if the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 365</div>lessee is not eligible for them&#151;a point that is particularly

relevant to the public sector and that I will address

later.</div><a name="06052529000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government

have built around that concept the highly complex and detailed regime

set out in schedules 8 and 9, and linked anti-avoidance provisions are

included in schedule 10 on the sale of lessor companies. I have tabled

the amendments in response to concerns expressed about new sections

70C, 70S and 70V of the 2001 Act, proposed in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the

schedule. They reflect points made by the Law Society that are of

sufficient gravity to merit consideration. Its concerns are similar to

those expressed earlier in the week on another part of the Bill, but it

is appropriate to put them again in this context because of their

significance.</div><a name="06052529000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new

provisions will restrict the availability of capital allowance

where</div><a name="06052529000159"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the circumstances

are such that it would not be unreasonable to conclude from them that

the purpose, or one of the main

purposes&#148;</div><a name="06052529000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">of entering

into a transaction is to gain capital allowances in the circumstances

prescribed. The Law Society points out that that contrasts with the

formulation normally adopted in anti-avoidance legislation, which

simply asks whether the purpose, or one of the main purposes, of

entering into a relevant transaction is to obtain a tax advantage. As I

have said, the matter was raised earlier in the week, and I imagine

that the Financial Secretary will be as unmoved by the concerns as his

colleague was then.</div>

<a name="06052529000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the traditional

formulation the Revenue must prove in court, on the balance of

probabilities, that obtaining tax advantages was one of the main

purposes for entering into a transaction. The parts of the schedule

that I seek to delete would alter that requirement; the Revenue would

no longer have to provide such proof. Under the new sections, it would

have to show only that it was not unreasonable for the inspector to

reach the conclusion that tax avoidance was a primary motivation. That

seems to allow for the possibility that the Revenue might succeed in a

case despite failing to show on the balance of probabilities that the

purpose was to obtain a tax advantage, if it could show that it was not

unreasonable to conclude that there was such a motivation. It would

then be up to the taxpayer to show that the tax inspector&#146;s

decision was unreasonable. That alters the ordinary onus of proof and

therefore gives rise to constitutional problems. I hope that the

Government will reconsider the inclusion of the new

formulation.</div><a name="06052529000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06052529000221"></a><b class="B">Mr.

David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): Further to

the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet

(Mrs. Villiers) on the main purpose test, I shall mention that we

debatedthat test earlier in the week on an amendment moved by

my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe(Mr. Goodman) in an

attempt to alter the test in a slightly different context. We all hang

closely on the words of the Paymaster General, who stated last Tuesday

morning:</div>

<a name="06052529000160"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There are many examples

of the main purpose test in UK tax avoidance

legislation&#148;.</div>

said:</div><a name="06052529000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The test

is well used, and HMRC has issued detailed guidance, which it continues

to update, to provide as much certainty as possible to business. The

system is working. The main purpose test is included not only in

clauses 69 to 71 but in a lot of other places. The phrase is well

understood by business and its advisers, and guidance and support is

given by HMRC.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee

324-325.]</div><a name="06052529000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those of us

who were here earlier this week found those comments extremely

persuasive and therefore one has to ask why in this context the

drafting does not pursue the main purpose test as is customarily the

case, but applies a very different test that seems somewhat lacking in

certainty and may create some difficulties as a

consequence.</div><a name="06052529000171"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000222"></a>The

Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):</b> I

welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I look forward to progress

on this next set of clauses. The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet made a

few useful general comments on this part of the Bill and, in

particular, on how schedules 8 and 9 introduce effectively the new

regime for tax treatment of leasing. It may therefore be helpful if I

make one or two general comments and then deal with her specific

amendments to which the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr.

Gauke) has just

spoken.</div><a name="06052529000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure

that we are considering in schedules 8 and 9 introduces a new and

improved structure for the taxation of leased plant and machinery, the

basic principles of which were announced in the pre-Budget report in

2004. Since then the new regime has been the subject of extensive and

constructive consultation. The Government are particularly grateful for

the significant input we have had from the leasing industry. I am also

pleased that the CBI went out of its way to describe that consultation

as an example of good, responsive Government policy making.</div>

<a name="06052529000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may help the

Committee&#146;s consideration of these and the next groups of

amendments if I make it clear that the reforms we are putting in place

have four main objectives. I will also pick up the hon. Lady&#146;s

point about the EU. First, under the existing tax regime, the taxation

of plant and machinery purchased with a loan differs widely from the

taxation of the acquisition of the same assets using lease finance. Yet

the commercial results are very similar. The difference in tax

treatment therefore potentially distorts the choice of finance,

particularly in connection with longer leases.</div>

<a name="06052529000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">It should be

a principle that is widely accepted, and accepted on both sides of the

Committee, that wherever possible, business decisions should be

motivated by commercial and economic considerations, not simply tax

treatment. This new regime ensures that tax-motivated distortions in

the choice of finance are minimised. Secondly, the existing rules mean

that UK lessors are usually able to undertake the advantages and

opportunities of leasing abroad. This new regime therefore allows us to

remove these restrictive rules and open up new opportunities by

increasing the market for overseas leasing from the UK.</div>

<a name="06052529000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, in the past the

financial sector has had significant success in exploiting the leasing

rules to benefit lessees in ways that were not consistent with 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 367</div>Government policy. Previously, as the hon. Lady will know, we have been

required to tackle these issues on a case-by-case basis. The new regime

and the reforms we are proposing here give us a sounder basis for the

taxation of leasing. It will allow us to counter exploitation more

effectively and to do so without inhibiting genuine business

transactions.</div>

<a name="06052529000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly, and this is the point

that the hon. Lady was making, the current regime has been the subject

of some commentary by academics and professionals about the

compatibility of the current leasing regime with EU law. Generally this

is speculation and we remain confident of the legality of the previous

regime. But what I would accept is that such commentary and questioning

creates a degree of uncertainty. The fourth objective of the new regime

is to enable us to remove that uncertainty. The provisions that we are

examining have all been drafted to be fully compliant with EU law and

to provide a stable and more certain basis for the taxation of leasing

in the future.</div> <a name="06052529000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

three amendments Nos. 187 to 189 relate, as the hon. Lady rightly said,

to the main purpose test. As the hon. Member for South-West

Hertfordshire pointed out, we have discussed the main purpose tests in

previous proceedings of the Committee. The concept of schedules 8 and 9

is indeed that the relevant rules apply

where</div><a name="06052529000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it would not be

unreasonable to

conclude&#148;</div><a name="06052529000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">that the main

purpose, or one of the main purposes of a particular type of

transaction is to avoid

tax.</div><a name="06052529000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady is

right in saying that the Law Society has raised that point with us, as

part of its representations on the Bill. However, its concerns do not

appear to be shared by the leasing community. I am told that we

received only one other comment on that question, which was simply to

note what was, and is, a novel formulation in the provisions of the

clause. However, in our view the test is similar. It still relies on

the main purpose test, although it is intended, if one wants, to lower

the bar and make it easier to apply the anti-avoidance rules. It will

still be challengeable, including legally, as is the main purpose test

in other parts of

legislation.</div><a name="06052529000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,

given the points that the hon. Lady has underlined and those that the

Law Society has submitted as part of its representations, I shall look

again at the formulation under the Bill. I hope, on that basis, that

she will not press the amendments to a

Division.</div><a name="06052529000044"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000223"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> It is welcome that the new framework will

provide new opportunities for leasing overseas. I acknowledge that the

consultation has been lengthy and expensive. While there are certain

points that the Government have not taken up as a result of the

consultation, as I will make clear later on, they have been extremely

responsive, in a constructive and welcome way, to the concerns of those

affected by the legislation. I was interested to note in the Financial

Secretary&#146;s statement that he believes that the current rules

are compatible with EU law, but that the new framework simply seeks to

put that beyond doubt. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 368</div>That is a useful clarification of the Government&#146;s approach to

the framework of the existing

rules.</div><a name="06052529000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is fair of

the Financial Secretary to acknowledge that the new formulation, which

is the focus of the amendments and concerns the primary motivation

test, is intended to lower the bar. It will have an effect on the

standards that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue has to show to demonstrate

that one of the primary motivations was avoidance. As my hon. Friend

the Member for South-West Hertfordshire pointed out, we are worried

that it is inconsistent with most of the other similar provisions under

the Bill. I welcome the Financial Secretary&#146;s commitment to look

again at how those tests will work in practice. In the light of that, I

should be happy if the Committee will permit me to withdraw the

amendments.</div><a name="06052529000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000224"></a>John

Healey:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 112, in page 214 [Vol

I], leave out lines 4 and

5.</div><a name="06052529000048"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000225"></a>The

Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss

Government amendment No.

190.</div><a name="06052529000049"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000226"></a>John

Healey:</b> I hope that the Committee will consider that

amendments No. 112 and 190 are constructive additions to the Bill.

Proposed new section 70R of the Capital Allowances Act 2001 excludes

what is referred to as &#147;background plant or machinery&#148;

from the scope of the reform. The statutory definition of background

plant or machinery is set out in proposed new section 70R(4). As is

suggested by the description, &#147;background plant or

machinery&#148; contributes to the background functionality of a

building, and includes assets such as lifts, central heating and air

conditioning systems. The exclusion&#146;s primary effect is that the

reform will only rarely affect the property leasing industry. We think

that that is the right approach, because property leases rarely have

the characteristics of financing transactions, with which we are

concerned in the reforms proposed in the new

regime.</div><a name="06052529000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the

main definition of &#147;background plant or machinery&#148; is in

the primary legislation, we propose supplementing it by a Treasury

order that will provide further details. A draft of the additional

material to be included in that order was published before the new

regime came into effect. The two amendments will make the Treasury

order effective from 1 April 2006, as was intended, thereby ensuring

consistency of approach from the start of the new regime. The

amendments also ensure that in future it will only be possible to make

further Treasury orders necessary to respond to building design and

construction changes with prospective effect. I hope that the Committee

will welcome and support the

proposal.</div><a name="06052529000051"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000227"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> Both amendments in the group are to be welcomed.

As we have heard, they relate to proposed new section 70T of the

Capital Allowances Act 2001. The proposed new section deals with the

legislative carve-out of leases of plant and machinery that are

incidental to the lease of a building. I particularly welcome amendment

No. 112 because the provision that it seeks to delete&#151;section

70T(3)(a)&#151;posed a particular problem of retrospective effect, as



<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 369</div>the Financial Secretary has acknowledged. For instance, it would have

permitted orders containing provisions effective up to 15 months before

the making of the order. As was observed in the Law Society&#146;s

helpful briefing, that would have constituted a retrospective tax,

because it would have been possible for such an order to remove

categories of plant and machinery from qualification for capital

allowances in the hands of the lessor or the lessee, depending on

whether they fell within the new framework or within the carve-out for

property-related leases. I welcome the fact that the Government have

chosen to think again about paragraph (a).</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000230"></a>John

Healey:</b> I shall briefly explain the Government amendments

and then say a few words about the four Opposition amendments.

Amendments Nos. 113 and 114 define the term &#147;the new

lease&#148; in certain sections of the Capital Allowances Act 2001.

They are designed merely to add clarity to the legislation. Amendment

No. 115 proposes removing an unintended interaction within the

commencement rules. As they stand, they could allow lessors to move to

the UK and exploit its capital allowance regime, which was never

intended. The amendment ensures that that cannot happen and that

lessors who move to the UK do so in a way that is fair and does not

bring with it the risk of exploitation.

</div><a name="06052529000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 116

and 118 correct a minor technical defect that has become apparent and

which would deny some leases the benefit of the transitional

provisions. Amendment No. 117 corrects a second minor technical

drafting error in the commencement provisions, in paragraph 15 of

schedule

8.</div><a name="06052529000172"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

am</div><a name="06052529000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also

debating amendments Nos. 163, 164, 166 and 167, which were tabled by

the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet and other Conservative

Members,so perhaps I could say a word about them. The 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 370</div>amendments would change the new regime&#146;s start date, but I am

confident that that is neither appropriate nor necessary for the

following reasons. Details of the core of the new regime were first

announced in December 2004 and the start date of 1 April was announced

in July 2005. Businesses have therefore been able to plan for that

start date for some time, and it has not come as a surprise to them. In

fact, the Government&#146;s open and consultative approach to the

legislation, which the hon. Lady, the CBI and others have acknowledged,

has given businesses a great deal of certainty about the new

arrangements. Changing the start date at this late stage, however,

would undermine the reforms that we are looking to put in

place.</div><a name="06052529000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware that

administering a new scheme brings certain challenges for businesses,

and we have made great efforts to ensure that businesses are as well

supported as possible over this period, but simply pushing back the

start date is not the solution. If the hon. Lady thinks about it, she

will see that such an approach would create practical issues,

particularly for businesses that have already put in place systems to

cater for the new regime. Furthermore, many businesses have already

written business in the expectation that the new regime will come into

effect on 1 April, as we announced last year. We are trying to bring

greater stability and certainty to the taxation of leasing, and

changing the treatment of existing leases would entirely undermine that

objective. Delaying the start date will delay the implementation of the

new and, according to most commentators and those involved, improved

regime. I therefore urge the hon. Lady not to press the amendments, but

if she does, I shall have to ask my hon. Friends to oppose

them.</div>

<a name="06052529000067"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000231"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> The Government amendments all provide useful

remedies for minor defects in the original drafting. I therefore

welcome them, and the Opposition will make no objection to their being

incorporated into the Bill.</div>

<a name="06052529000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Financial Secretary

said, amendments Nos. 163, 164, 166 and 167, which my hon. Friends and

I tabled, would postpone the start date for the new rules until 1

September. Shortly before he sat down, he indicated that the industry

broadly welcomed the new framework, but that is not really the

impression that I have received. Indeed, there is great concern about

the complexity and structure of the new rules, although there is also a

degree of resignation about the fact that they will nevertheless be

implemented. Therefore, the welcome for the overall new framework is

not as uniform as the Financial Secretary suggested.</div>

<a name="06052529000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge that the

Financial Secretary made an important point about those businesses that

have already planned for the 1 April start date, but in light of the

significant challenges of meeting that target date, I shall still speak

to my amendments on the subject, because it is an important issue for

the Committee to discuss. They are essentially probing amendments to

allow this discussion to take

place.</div><a name="06052529000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee

should note that the postponement date does not give rise to avoidance

opportunities as, because of the way in which the Government structured

the Bill, only contracts that were well under way or finally concluded

before 21 July 2005 can continue to operate under the old rules.

Contracts 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 371</div>concluded since that date will be governed by the transitional

provisions, although those provisions are not without problems

themselves; in particular, there is the so-called &#147;under

construction&#148; test to determine whether work under the contract

is sufficiently advanced to fall within the transitional

provisions.</div><a name="06052529000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The delay

that I propose in my amendments will simply give market participants

more time to prepare for the new regime. That is needed for a number of

reasons. As we heard, the provisions in schedules 8 and 9 compose an

entirely new framework for the taxation of leases. They introduce

highly complex new provisions and concepts, a number of which are

unknown in any tax and accounting systems anywhere else in the

world.</div> <a name="06052529000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the Bill

as drafted, the provisions for new deals took effect on 1 April this

year, before the final version of the rules was known. I acknowledge

that the impact is mitigated by the extensive and lengthy consultation

that the Government carried out, including circulation of earlier

drafts of the rules. However, the full draft of the new rules was

published only about 24 hours before the 1 April implementation date.

Furthermore, as we see today, the final form of the Bill is still

subject to change, as there are Government amendments on the table

before us. The new regime will require all lessors to carry out

extensive work in reviewing their range of products and services.

Clearly, significant IT changes and upgrades, and extensive staff

training programmes, will be necessary, and of course it will be

important to take time to ensure that customers know the impact of all

the changes. All that will take considerable time and effort on the

part of those affected by the changes.</div>

<a name="06052529000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee and the

Government should consider giving that extra time because of the

enormously significant role that the leasing industry plays in our

economy. The tax treatment of leasing transactions may seem like the

driest of dry Finance Bill backwaters, and many Members may feel that

it simply the barrier between us and the Whitsun recess, but a thriving

leasing industry is crucial to two of the key drivers of economic

prosperity in this country, namely business investment and

productivity. To support that statement, I rely on a 2004 paper

produced by Oxford Economic Forecasting for the Finance and Leasing

Association entitled &#147;The economic impact of proposed changes in

the corporation tax treatment of finance leases.&#148; That is not

completely up to date, as it was prepared in response to the initial

August 2003 consultation document on the new regime, but it is still

usefulin highlighting the important role that leasing plays

in making the capital market operate more

efficiently.</div><a name="06052529000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leasing

helps to bridge the information divide between firms and their

financiers by linking finance to specific assets over which the lessor

retains ownership. That can make it easier for firms to obtain finance

for investment, because the specialist knowledge that lessors build up

about the equipment that they lease means that they may be more willing

to provide finance than more generalist operators. Leasing can be

enormously useful to start-up firms, which may be temporarily

unprofitable and so may find finance 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 372</div>difficult. It also helps business to respond to economic shocks that

cause periods of lack of profitability. Leasing is heavily used by

small businesses, particularly when they have short-term cash-flow

constraints, and leasing provides important additional competition for

business finance in a market. That is particularly significant for

small and medium-sized enterprises, and the Competition Commission has

in the past expressed concern about the limited degree of competition

in the finance market.</div>

<a name="06052529000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the most striking

point made by Oxford Economic Forecasting is about the degree to which

leasing facilitates investment. Leasing is used to fund a significant

proportion of investment by business. According to the figures provided

in the paper, finance leases made up to 8 to 9 per cent. of UK gross

fixed capital formation, when one excludes buildings. When operating

leases, hire purchase and other asset and lease-related transactions

are taken into account, the proportion was about 30 to 35 per cent. of

UK gross fixed capital formation. The Finance and Leasing Association

reports its members as achieving&#163;93 billion in new

business in 2004, representing more than a quarter of all fixed capital

investment in the UK in

2004.</div><a name="06052529000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,

leasing finance plays a highly significant role in relation to business

investment inthe UK, which is vital for improving

productivity. The Chancellor once described productivity growth as the

fundamental yardstick of economic performance. In the light of poor

productivity growth in recent years, we should be making every effort

to facilitate a thriving leasing industry, which plays such a

significant part in enabling business to make the necessary investment

to improve productivity.</div>

<a name="06052529000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Government will

respond to the concerns of the leasing industry and provide as much

flexibility as possible in the transition to the new rules. As Martin

Hall, chairman of the Finance and Leasing Association, said, these new

rules are</div><a name="06052529000163"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the biggest

change in leasing taxation for a

generation.&#148;</div><a name="06052529000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like him and

the FLA, I hope that the Government will at least consider postponing

the implementationof such a radical new change to enable an

importantand successful UK industry, which is vital to our

competitiveness, to prepare properly for the

changeover.</div><a name="06052529000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000232"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> I shall continue with some general remarks about

the framework, as there are several matters that relate to schedule 8

that it would be useful for the Government to consider and for the

Committee to be aware of. First, I acknowledge that some sensible

changes were made to schedule 8 and the draft legislation during the

consultation process. For example, the new rules cover only leases of

five years or 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 374</div>more, which will exclude a significant proportion of SME business, since

their transactions are often less than five years. That is a welcome

change. The Government have also given ground in some technical

areas&#151;for example, the definitions and concepts surrounding net

present value, economic life and the lease payments test have all been

improved, reducing risks that commercial transactions will be treated

in an inappropriate way by the new

rules.</div><a name="06052529000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The definition

of &#147;funding lease&#148; no longer includes the problematic

specialist use test, which could have led to many legal disputes and

would have been good for the lawyers but not much good for anyone else.

Allowing businesses to opt into the new rules when that makes sense is

also very useful. That is also very welcome, as it should reduce

compliance costs; I am told that it is particularly welcomed by the IT

industry, which for various reasons would find it very difficult to run

leases according to the two parallel

structures.</div>

<a name="06052529000173"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

am</div><a name="06052529000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of

concerns remain: first, the structure is very complex, as anyone who

has grappled with the three schedules we are discussing will be aware.

Secondly, in that context there are some difficult questions related to

the interaction with EU law. As with other aspects of the Bill, one

reason for the introduction of new rules is to ensure compliance with

EU law; and alongside film tax, group relief and a number of other

aspects of the Bill, we now have a further example of the increasing

impact of EU rules on our tax

system.</div>

<a name="06052529000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the Financial

Secretary&#146;s response to the suggestion by some people that the

new framework may still cause problems in relation to EU law. I refer

to proposed new section 70V of the Capital Allowances Act 2001. The

Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales highlighted the

concern that in cross-border leasing, when a British company leases

equipment to an overseas company, no allowances will be available for

the UK lessor or the foreign lessor, but that in UK-UK leasing, the

lessee will be able to claim the allowance. The Chartered Institute of

Taxation expresses similar concerns. The comparison between the

UK-foreign lease and the UK-UK lease indicates that there might be less

favourable treatment in the UK-foreign lease.</div>

<a name="06052529000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Financial

Secretary can reassure the Committee that in that specific context

there is no problem with EU law&#151;expanding on his overall

comments that there is nothing in the new framework that will cause a

problem when it interacts with EU law.

</div><a name="06052529000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have received a

number of representations from people who are anxious that the new

framework could disadvantage business start-ups and impact negatively

on inward investment in the UK. They include comments from the Finance

and Leasing Association and the ICAEW. The old rules provided business

start-ups with an advantage. As they might not have been generating

profits in the early years, the rules enabled them to use their capital

allowances on the equipment that they were using. It therefore made

sense for businesses to use leasing, which would be cheaper because the

lessor would receive the capital allowance benefit that the lessee

could not. The ICAEW acknowledges in its briefing that the impact 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column374" />Column number: 375</div>on start-ups will not cause a major problem, presumably because many

start-ups will prefer to go for leasing arrangements of less than five

years, which are excluded from the new rules, and therefore mitigate

that concern.</div>

<a name="06052529000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, that does not deal

with the concern about the impact on inward investment in the UK. Many

inward investors might not be able to make significant profits in their

early years, and they will therefore benefit from cheaper leasing

costs, because the lessor gets the benefit of capital

allowances.</div> <a name="06052529000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlike

indigenous small business start-ups, large inward investors will

certainly be interested in longer-term leases. The 2004 Oxford Economic

Forecasting paper, to which I referred the Committee earlier,

highlighted the popularity of leasing as an option for inward

investors. I believe that the Government have themselves in the past

highlighted the old leasing rules as an important incentive to inward

investment. Will the Government outline the research that they have

conducted into the economic impact of those measures? Are they

confident that the measures will not impact negatively on inward

investment?</div> <a name="06052529000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is

a third, horizontal concern about the new rules&#146; impact on the

public sector. It is difficult to find figures about leasing

transactions and the public sector, but some people have estimated that

the leasing contracts in public sector and private finance initiative

projects are worth up to &#163;500 billion. NHS trusts have made

increasing use of leasing arrangements in recent years, as local

authorities have made use of them for school equipment in

particular.</div> <a name="06052529000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

current rules&#151;the old ones to which we are saying goodbye over

the next few weeks&#151;have been a big advantage to the public

sector. The lessor, not the lessee, of the equipment had the benefit of

the capital allowances. A public sector body such as an NHS trust could

never use the capital allowance anyway, because it does not pay any

tax. Its lease costs were effectively discounted because of the

allowance that the lessor company could claim and the public sector

body could not. The new rules abolish that advantage. As we well know,

NHS trusts already have difficulties balancing their books, and there

can be no doubt that the rule changes will make that process more of a

challenge. Those changes are likely also to put further pressure on

council tax payers as local authorities find it more expensive to lease

equipment, for the reasons that I have outlined.</div>

<a name="06052529000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the extra revenue

raised by the Exchequer as a consequence might offset the costs paid by

public sector institutions, there is no guarantee that the extra money

will find its way back into the departmental budgets of the

institutions subjected to the extra leasing costs or, for example, to

the specific local authorities and NHS trusts that will face the

increased costs. Again, I would be interested to hear the Financial

Secretary&#146;s thoughts on the research that the Treasury has done

on the financial impact that those changes will have on the public

sector, and whether there will be any qualifying reallocation of

departmental budgets in consequence of the

changes.</div><a name="06052529000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall now

turn to a concern highlighted by the Law Society, which has raised a

number of interesting points on the new regime. One point relates to

proposed new section 70Q(2)(d) of the Capital 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 376</div>Allowances Act 2001. Under the new rules, whether a lease counts as a

long funding lease can vary between lessor and lessee; the test is

applied differently between the two parties. Theoretically, a lease

might count as a long funding lease for one party, but not for the

other, and therefore both the lessor and the lessee might be entitled

under the rules to claim the relevant capital

allowance.</div><a name="06052529000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">New section

70Q has been included to prevent that from happening by not allowing

the lessee to claim the allowance in certain circumstances, for

example, where the lessor is entitled to reliefs at the commencement of

the term of the lease. The overall goal of new section 70Q is of course

welcome because we will not have the lessor and the lessee claiming the

same allowances. However, paragraph (d) causes a problem. It prevents

the lessee from claiming the allowance where the lessor would have been

entitled to the relief if they had been subject to UK income or

corporation tax.</div> <a name="06052529000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

seems an odd provision to include in a section designed to prevent a

double claim for allowance. It relates to lessors not in the UK income

or corporation tax regimes. By definition, those parties are unable to

claim the allowance so there seems no sensible reason why the lessee

should not be able to claim it. If the proposed new section is designed

to prevent double counting, and the lessor is outside the UK tax regime

and therefore cannot claim the allowance anyway, there is no danger of

double counting.</div><a name="06052529000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

compliance cost of paragraph (d) is of even more serious concern. In

order to claim the allowance, the lessee will have to establish the tax

position of their immediate lessors and all superior lessors in the

leasing chain. The burden will be particularly heavy because we are

talking largely about lessors that are overseas companies outside the

scope of UK corporation tax, as I have said. The lessee will have to

identify all lessors in the chain, their tax status and their

hypothetical tax position were they liable for UK corporation tax. It

will be necessary therefore to establish whether the lessor would have

been able to claim the capital allowance if they fell hypothetically in

the UK tax net and accounted hypothetically the lease under

international financial reporting standards, not their local accounting

system.</div><a name="06052529000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be honest,

few lessors will be keen to undertake that exercise, and even if they

were, they would presumably expect the lessee to meet the costs of the

expensive accounting and tax advice needed to answer those hypothetical

questions. As pointed out by the Law Society, that seems to oppose the

compliance burden which is disproportionate to any benefit provided by

the enactment of paragraph

(d).</div><a name="06052529000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next concern

about schedule 8 relates to property. The Opposition welcome the

Treasury&#146;s move to exclude from the new framework leases that

are primarily focused on land and buildings. Clearly, leases of real

property might often contain terms relating to plant or machinery as an

add-on to the main purpose of the contract. Typical examples are where

the lease of a building also covers the lease of air conditioning

units, and heating and lighting systems.</div>

<a name="06052529000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s

carve-out is achieved via three different parts of schedule 8.

Background plant and machinery is excluded from the definition. As we

have heard in respect of earlier amendments, a list of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 377</div>different types of property-connected plant is provided for and designed

to be updated by Treasury rules as and when necessary.</div>

<a name="06052529000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last of all, new section 70U(4)

introduces a de minimis limit to sweep up leases of minor value that

are clearly not the Government&#146;s target and should not fall

within the definition of long funding leases. It provides that leases

of plant and machinery will be considered as de minimis, and therefore

fall outside the new framework, when they constitute no more

than10 per cent. of the value of the background plant and

machinery or 5 per cent. of the market value of the relevant land and

buildings. The British Property Federation

said:</div><a name="06052529000105"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This

measure is welcome, but there are concerns that the limit may have been

drawn too narrowly and perhaps does not meet its objectives of ensuring

that unintended background plant and machinery leases are outside the

scope of the new long term funding lease

provisions&#148;.</div><a name="06052529000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be

useful to hear from the Financial Secretary why those particular value

limits have been chosen. What research has been carried out to ensure

that they meet the Government&#146;s stated objectives of keeping

leases that primarily concern real property out of the new framework?

There is a case for arguing that the limits have been drawn too

narrowly and that leases that should be treated as de minimis and

incidental to the real property transactions to which they are linked

will fall within the definition of long funding

leases.</div><a name="06052529000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06052529000233"></a><b class="B">Rob

Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): Will the hon.

Lady explain whether her argument would be the same if she had read new

section 70U(4) correctly? In fact, 70U(4)(a) uses a

conjunction&#151;&#147;and&#148;; she said &#147;or&#148; in

respect of the two limits. There have to be both; there is no

either/or.</div><a name="06052529000108"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000234"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> Yes, I did not express that clearly. However,

either way there is concern that the de minimis exception has not been

drawn sufficiently widely, and I should be interested in the Financial

Secretary&#146;s response on that.</div>

<a name="06052529000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two brief final points

to make on schedule 8. The finance lease test in new section 70N

introduces an unfortunate element of subjectivity, as the borderline

between a finance lease and operating lease is often blurred and

subject to conflicting interpretations in different cases. Finally, the

Chartered Institute of Taxation has expressed concern that the

definition of the term of the lease set out in new section 70YF of the

Capital Allowances Act 2001 is insufficiently clear. It has particular

concerns about the approach taken to break clauses in the new

section.</div><a name="06052529000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those

reasons, the Opposition have a number of reservations about schedule 8,

on which we would welcome the reassurance of the Financial

Secretary.</div>

<a name="06052529000111"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000235"></a>John

Healey:</b> I hope that I can give the hon. Lady reassurance

on her main points. She began, quite rightly, by making a couple of

general comments about the importance of the leasing industry. It is

indeed an important part of our economy, accounting for almost

&#163;14 billion of investment each year.</div>

<a name="06052529000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">As one would expect, we have

looked carefully at the potential impact of the new regime on such

investment, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 378</div>and our analysis shows that the overall effect on investment in the UK

economy will be very small&#151;we estimate a reduction of about

&#163;80 million per annum. When we put that into the context of the

total annual business investment in the UK economy,

about&#163;110 billion, we see that that reduction is very

small, at roughly 0.07 per

cent.</div><a name="06052529000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady

was particularly concerned about small companies, but in a sense she

provided the answer to her own concerns. Most leases of up to seven

years will not be affected by the reform. Our analysis and feedback

consistently suggest that, partly for the reasons suggested by the hon.

Lady, very few leases to small companies exceed seven years. The effect

of excluding short leases from the regime is to exclude the vast

majority of leases to small firms. I explained earlier the four

principal objectives of the reforms that we propose, including our

belief that the new regime is fully compliant with European Union law.

She pressed a particular concern about section 70V, the purpose of

which is to prevent cross-border tax avoidance schemes that otherwise

could lead to a significant cost to the Exchequer without any economic

benefit to the UK. We believe that this specific provision of the

regime&#151;rather than the general provisions&#151;is

proportionate, appropriate and compliant with EU

law.</div><a name="06052529000174"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

am</div><a name="06052529000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady

was concerned about the potential effect on inward investors. Our

conclusion, drawn from explicitly encouraging, during the consultation

process&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> During the consultation,

officials were not given any evidence that the availability of lease

finance significantly affects decisions to invest in the UK. Even where

it is used, our assessment, based on the discussions and the evidence

that we have gathered through the consultation, is that any loss of tax

benefit is unlikely to be significant enough to affect the choice of

the UK as a location for significant inward

investment.</div><a name="06052529000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06052529000236"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): If I may indulge the

Financial Secretary for a moment, it would be helpful to explain

something. I thought that my hon. Friend made a valid point with

respect to proposed new section 70V. The Financial Secretary has said

that he believes that it is compliant within EU law. I am curious about

what discussions he had with the Chartered Institute of Taxation, which

I respect&#151;it is well respected&#151;which raised a valid issue

with respect to new section 70V, as did my hon. Friend. I should be

interested to hear a little bit more detail about why the Financial

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000237"></a>John

Healey:</b> I also respect the Chartered Institute of

Taxation; it has been active in its contributions to the development of

our thinking on this new regime and has, as it generally does, made a

useful contribution during the consultation period. The long and the

short of it is that our judgment, as I have explained to the Committee,

is that this part of the new regime&#151;as with the generality of

it&#151;is appropriate and proportionate and, specifically to answer

the hon. Lady, compliant with EU law. That is the legal assessment that

we have made in drafting its provisions.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 379</div><a name="06052529000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady also asked a

series of questions and was concerned, quite reasonably, about

compliance costs. HMRC is doing important work in that area at the

moment with business to try to assess where we can reduce the

compliance costs. If the hon. Lady has had representations on this

matter from bodies that fear the level of compliance costs, I encourage

her to encourage them to contact us directly, because that area of work

is live at the moment and is important to us and we welcome any further

contributions.</div><a name="06052529000118"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000238"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> On that last point, there may be a particular

problem where it becomes necessary fora lessee to know the

hypothetical tax status of its lessor, and the chain of lessors. There

may be a number of extra-statutory methods that the Revenue could use

to lighten the compliance burden. I will be urging those concerned

about this point to be in contact with the Treasury and the Revenue,

but I urge the Financial Secretary to ensure that there are ways to

reduce the compliance costs, because the situation could potentially be

complicated, as I have outlined. If a pragmatic approach is taken, we

can, hopefully, get to a point where the compliance burdens are not

significant.</div><a name="06052529000119"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000239"></a>John

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000240"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 185, in page 258,

line 1 [Vol I], leave out from beginning to end of line 17 on page

259.</div><a name="06052529000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment

concerns the tonnage tax exclusion from the new leasing framework. It

seeks to delete new paragraph 91D of schedule 22 to the Finance Act

2000. As we have discussed, ships that are leased into tonnage tax

companies are generally excluded from the new framework set out in

schedules 8 and 9. Concern has nevertheless been expressed that

elements of schedule 9 will make it more difficult to finance large

assets such as ships and aircraft, and will interact negatively with

the tonnage tax regime.</div>

<a name="06052529000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">In particular, I have received

a number of representations concerning paragraph 10 of schedule 9 and

new paragraphs 91B, 91C, 91D and 91E of schedule 22 to the Finance Act

2000, which it introduces. Those paragraphs place restrictions on the

breadth of the exclusion for tonnage tax companies. The Chamber of

Shipping was reported in the <i class="I">Financial Times</i> as having said that

the proposed new rules had already led to the cancellation of plans to

base a significant number of additional ships in Britain. David

Astbury, head of shipping policy at the chamber, said of the new

rules:</div> <a name="06052529000164"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For

international groups which are thinking of coming to the UK, it is a

turn off. It is an indication that...the rules...are not as

stable as they might be.&#148;</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 380</div><a name="06052529000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The paragraph that the amendment

seeks to delete, new paragraph 91D, provides that the exemption from

the new rules applies only where certain conditions relating to

chartering the tonnage tax leased vessel are met. In particular, with a

few limited exceptions, such charters must not exceed seven years. That

imposes significant commercial constraints on how companies manage

their vessels. I am sure that the Financial Secretary will immediately

respond that most such charters are for less than seven years. That is

true, but there is no guarantee that that is how the market will

continue to be structured, and concern has been expressed that a

seven-year limit will fetter the business flexibility of the companies

affected. Those constraints are likely to have an impact on the

competitiveness of UK tonnage tax companies by comparison with their

non-UK tonnage tax operator

rivals.</div><a name="06052529000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Revenue has indicated that it considers that the measure is needed to

prevent UK tonnage tax regime advantages from subsidising international

operators, and I can understand that concern. However, shipping is, by

definition, an international business&#151;surely almost all shipping

companies are international operators. The whole point of a low-cost

tax regime is to reduce costs in order to attract international

operators and enable services to be provided at competitive

rates.</div><a name="06052529000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Commenting on

the seven-year restriction, solicitor Louise Higginbottom of Norton

Rose told a national newspaper<i class="I"> </i>that the new provisions gave rise

to</div><a name="06052529000165"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a serious risk that

the UK shipping sector will decline...There is Revenue paranoia that

the benefits of the new regime were enjoyed by companies

internationally. But what&#146;s the point of a low cost regime if

you don&#146;t pass savings on to your

customers?&#148;</div><a name="06052529000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given

the importance of the tonnage tax regime, I hope that the Government

will reconsider some of the restrictions that they have placed on the

carve-out for tonnage tax, particularly the one relating to the

duration of charters.</div>

<a name="06052529000129"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000241"></a>John

Healey:</b> The tonnage tax, as hon. Members will be aware, is

an especially generous regime, which was introduced by this Government

in 2000 specifically for shipping and which has had significant success

in reinvigorating the UK shipping sector. I assure the Committee that

the reforms set out in the Bill will not undermine the success of that

regime. To ensure that they do not, we have introduced in these

provisions a very generous carve-out for tonnage tax companies from the

leasing regime reforms. We have taken that decision in recognition of

the special circumstances facing the shipping sector and the benefits

that that shipping brings to the UK. I am aware of the representations

from the Chamber of Shipping about the matter, and its concerns about

it, but I do not accept them because I believe that the Bill contains

the appropriate balance of provisions.</div>

<a name="06052529000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have ensured that the

carve-out for leasing into tonnage tax is not open to exploitation. The

reforms ensure that the leases are excluded from the reform only where

the significant cost to the UK Exchequer and the public purse is

commensurate with the returns. It has become clear, since the

introduction of the tonnage tax in 2000, that some firms come into the

UK 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 381</div>not to benefit from the tonnage tax regime itself but to benefit solely

from the arrangements that they can make for leasing within the regime.

That was never the Government&#146;s intention in introducing the

tonnage tax; I hope that the hon. Lady will accept that. Therefore the

Bill introduces three conditions that must be met before the carve-out

from the new regime will

apply.</div><a name="06052529000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said

and as the hon. Lady has, I think, recognised, the tonnage tax and the

ability to lease into the tonnage tax are extremely generous

provisions. It is therefore right that the Government should ensure

that the UK taxpayer will get value for money from the cost and the

arrangements. The rule will affect only a small minority of leased

ships. It does not affect all long-term charters. It does not affect

long-term charters where the rate is reset to the market rate at least

once every seven years and it also has no impact, of course, if the

ship is not leased. It affects only long-term charters of leased ships

that are chartered out at a fixed rate.</div>

<a name="06052529000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I dwelt on the third of the

three rules, because that is what the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet

did, but in summary the issue is that long-term charters are attractive

because of the combination of lower rentals under a UK lease and fixed

income under a long-term charter guarantee&#151;a net amount of

income with which to meet running costs and make a profit. It is a

low-risk strategy, which makes the UK an attractive place to base

ships&#151;which may have little or no contact with the UK for their

entire working life, thus bringing little if any economic benefit to

the UK.</div> <a name="06052529000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The result

can be a significant cost to the public and the Exchequer for such

transactions, which correspond to little economic benefit to the UK. In

effect, therefore, the UK Exchequer and the public provide a subsidy in

those cases to the international shipping communities, and we cannot

allow that. I hope that that helps to explain why we have set up not

just the carve-out to benefit shipping but the rules to prevent it from

being exploited. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Lady will not press

her amendment, as that would undermine our ability to act in that

way.</div>

Budget. It was he himself who introduced the scheme in 2001 and, only a

few weeks ago in New York, he addressed the United Nations

ambassador&#146;s honest commitment to tackle climate change. He

outlined his ideas on how to protect our environment, secure our planet

and safeguard our future for our children and generations to

come.</div><a name="06052529000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the scheme

was extended in 2002, the Financial Secretary told the

House:</div><a name="06052529000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are

now satisfied that extending those special allowances to

&#145;green&#146; equipment for leasing will ensure the widest

assistance to the uptake of those technologies, for increasing

environmental gain. That is the key aim of the &#145;green&#146;

technology

allowances.</div><a name="06052529000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">The change

will encourage all businesses to look towards &#145;green&#146;

alternatives when they make their equipment investment decisions. That

choice may be made by the user of the equipment, but it might also be

made by the person who will lease, let or hire the

equipment.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee

F,</i> 11 June 2002; c. 269.]</div><a name="06052529000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">A

little later on the same day, the hon. Gentleman also

said:</div><a name="06052529000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">The clause will

ensure that such schemes reach the widest number of businesses and

encourage the highest uptake of technologies for the widest possible

environmental gain.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee

F,</i> 11 June 2002; c.

271.]</div><a name="06052529000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather than abolishing the

scheme, if the Chancellor really does want to prove his green

credentials, surely the Government should be promoting its

uptake.</div><a name="06052529000144"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000246"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> Has the hon. Lady read explanatory note 54a to the

schedule? It provides an exception for energy saving and

environmentally beneficial plant or machinery, but I may have misread

it. The hon. Lady is right: the area is

complex.</div><a name="06052529000145"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000247"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> I found the explanatory notes puzzling, too. I

consulted the experts, but I should have consulted the hon. Member for

Wolverhampton, South-West. That was why I prefaced my remarks by saying

that I hoped the Financial Secretary would tell me that my

understanding of the clause was wrong. The explanatory notes refer to

the retention of the accelerated allowance when we buy the equipment,

but the Bill does not save the allowance when the equipment is leased.

However, like the hon. Gentleman I shall await clarification from the

Financial Secretary. I hope that the way in which I have read the

clausewas wrong.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 383</div><a name="06052529000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is true that, to date, the

uptake of the scheme has been limited. However, if it were relaunched

and promoted, the measure could play a useful role in tackling climate

change. We should have thought that leasing will be a particularly

attractive option in relation to the environmentally friendly equipment

area because of the swift pace of change in such matters. We could go

for rather shorter-term arrangements than necessarily having to buy

outright. Given that technology is moving so fast, people might not

want to make such long-term

commitments.</div><a name="06052529000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

informed that the Revenue believes that the clause could amount to a

tax loophole, but I find it difficult to see how that could be the

case, especially in light of the fact that the allowances have not been

used much so far. We have heard a lot from those on the Government

Front Bench about the industriousness of the tax avoidance industry.

The scheme has been around since 2001 and, if it were such a great

loophole, surely someone would have been seeking to exploit

it.</div><a name="06052529000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Responding to the

Revenue&#146;s request for information on the uptake of the scheme,

the Finance and Leasing Association

said:</div><a name="06052529000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

understand that the authorities wanted this data because they were

considering abolishing the enhanced capital allowances on the grounds

that they could be a significant source of leakage from the new

regime...We do not think our survey supports those fears...On

the contrary, this looks like an example of a relief that has been

underpublicised...Given the level of oil prices currently and the

need for the UK to respect the Kyoto Agreement, it would seem very odd

to abandon a policy that encourages a more economical use of

energy...The FLA would gladly work with HMRC and the Treasury to

publicise this relief in the industry and the lessee

community.&#148;</div><a name="06052529000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather

than abolishing the scheme, I very much hope that the Government might

consider taking up the FLA&#146;s offer to help relaunch it, perhaps

in the same way as the home computing initiative was successfully

repackaged and relaunched a couple of years ago. I hope that they will

reconsider the decision to abolish the scheme that is designed to

tackle climate

change.</div><a name="06052529000150"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06052529000248"></a>John

Healey:</b> Government amendment No. 119 is technical and

helps to clarify the meaning of proposed new section 67(2B) of the

Capital Allowances Act 2001. On amendment No. 165, I remind the hon.

Lady of one of the main purposes of the provisions, which is to open up

the new market of overseas leasing from the UK. As we have discussed,

that will bring significant new opportunities for the leasing industry

in the UK, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 384</div>but also requires a review of the costs and the implications for the UK

of other elements of the regime.</div>

<a name="06052529000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that the hon. Lady

understands how things work and will appreciate how the workings of the

enhanced capital allowance are different from those of the mainstream

capital allowance, as they incentivise investment by giving a 100 per

cent. allowance, instead of the normal 25 per cent. for writing down.

That means that even short leases can carry a significant tax timing

benefit.</div> <a name="06052529000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the

old regime, we could confidently grant such allowances to lessors in

the knowledge that any additional cost to the UK Exchequer would equate

with environmental benefits for the UK. However, under the new rules,

with the new opportunities for overseas leasing, that is not

necessarily the case. Without the restriction that we are introducing,

the UK Exchequer could be forced to subsidise investment across the

world. Potential additional costs could not be justified and would be

significant, whereas the benefits to the UK would not be

commensurate.</div><a name="06052529000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have

also carefully considered the effect of the reform on the

Government&#146;s environmental goals. The impact of the reform will

be minimal. Our research has shown that lessors rarely claim the

allowances in the environmental field. In other words, the impact on

the levels of investment in certain types of technologies is likely to

be minimal, because the device is not used in that field.</div>

<a name="06052529000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have also sought to retain

the present treatment wherever possible, to minimise the effect on

environmental objectives. The ECAs will continue to be available to

lessors with cars with low carbon dioxide emissions and for background

plant or machinery leased with property. Let me be clear to the hon.

Lady and my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West:

generous enhanced capital allowances for environmentally friendly

assets will continue to be available to businesses that purchase such

assets directly.</div> <a name="06052529000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

hope on that basis that the hon. Lady will notpress the

amendment to a Division. I welcome her commitment to environmental

concerns. I especially look forward to seeing that carried through into

her interest in and commitment to the climate change levy, when the

Committee discusses that

later.</div><a name="06052529000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Debate

adjourned.&#151;<i class="I">[</i> <i class="I">Mr. John

Heppell.]</i></div><a name="06052529000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Adjourned

accordingly at twenty-four minutes past Ten o&#146;clock till Tuesday
