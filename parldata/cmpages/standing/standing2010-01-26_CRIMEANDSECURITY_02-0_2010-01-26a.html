<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7272</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000339"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I welcome our witnesses to this
afternoon&#146;s sitting. I welcome in particular Sir Hugh Orde,
president of the Association of Police Officers and Gary Pugh, director
of forensic services in the Metropolitan Police Service, on behalf of
the Association of Chief Police Officers.</div>
<a name="10012687000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir Hugh, you
and Gary Pugh will have studied the Bill. If in two minutes you could
give us your introductory views, that would be helpful. I was going to
ask you to introduce yourselves, but as there are just two of you and I
have mentioned your names and everybody knows you and, I suspect,
Mr. Pugh too, that would be a waste of time. Could you, Sir
Hugh, give us your general run-down of the
Bill?</div><a name="10012687000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I bring apologies
from my colleague Chris Sims, who is a real expert on DNA at the ACPO
level. Gary, of course, has done a huge amount of detailed work. I will
leave him to do the detail and I will just give a broad overview of
what I see to be the key issues around this Bill, mindful of the
European Court judgment. From an ACPO perspective, we are very keen to
see the Government lay down some clear guidelines, as articulated by
Chief Constable Sims at the Home Affairs Committee, that give absolute
clarity about what is and what is not acceptable in relation to the
retention of deeply sensitive personal
data.</div><a name="10012687000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
fully understand the concerns of the public about that retention. The
key points for me are as follows. First, I continue to stress that the
retention of DNA is critical for serious crime investigation&#151;I
emphasise &#147;serious&#148;. On the successes, one case in the
press only yesterday&#151;an historical case solved through the use
of DNA&#151;describes better and more articulately than I can the
reason why we need to use this proportionately, carefully and
sensitively, and within some clear guidelines about what is acceptable
in terms of retention, particularly in relation to unconvicted
individuals.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div><a name="10012687000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress from
a professional police perspective, however, that just because someone
is not convicted of an offence, there are still good professional
reasons why we need that information when dealing with serious crime.
In my previous world, in Northern Ireland, some very dangerous people
were entirely innocent in law&#151;as in, they were never
convicted&#151;but I was greatly reassured that I had a better
position in terms of keeping the public safe by knowing that I had some
information, which, if crimes were committed by those individuals, I
could use to deliver an effective investigation, certainly in
accordance of article 2 of the Human Rights
Act.</div><a name="10012687000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will keep my comments as brief as that, because I am mindful that this
is a Bill Committee, not the Home Affairs Committee. I shall hand over
to Gary, who may want to touch on some key changes and proposals in the
Bill, which we support
fully.</div><a name="10012687000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
73</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000340"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you, Sir Hugh. I ask Gary Pugh to give his
overview.</div><a name="10012687000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I am here today in the
capacity of chair of the National DNA Database Strategy Board, which is
relevant to the Bill in terms of the governance arrangements for the
database. I hold that post as the nominee of
ACPO.</div><a name="10012687000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with Sir Hugh&#146;s comments, to which I shall add my own from
a police perspective, and certainly from the perspective of the
National DNA Database Strategy Board. It is imperative that we get some
guidance from Parliament and the Committee on retention periods in
relation to those arrested and not convicted. This is a live and
sensitive debate and I deal with this on a daily basis. There is a risk
that if we do not deal with the issue, it could undermine confidence in
police investigations
generally.</div><a name="10012687000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to mention three things. First, on the performance of and
contribution to the database, there is an element of trading statistics
here. There are two issues for me. I reinforce Sir Hugh&#146;s points
on violent crime and sexually motivated crime. You have only to think
about the nature of those crimes to understand the potential for DNA to
be transferred from the perpetrator to the victim or the crime scene,
and therein lies the value of DNA. What we have done in the UK is much
broader than that, however. We use DNA profiling in a much wider range
of crime, particularly burglary and acquisitive crime. There is a
different set of evidence for the value of that, in terms of the number
of matches that are made from the national DNA database.</div>
<a name="10012687000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The majority
of the output from the database is, in volume crime, in identifying
potential offenders. I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the
study in the States&#151;I think it is one of the most rigorous
studies&#151;that looked at what difference DNA makes. It found that
twice as many people were arrested when DNA was involved and twice as
many people were put into the criminal justice system. That was a
Department of Justice
study.</div><a name="10012687000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second broad area for us is the mechanics of the Bill and the
proposals. Clearly, the retention periods are a matter for Parliament.
Our plea is for simplicity in being able to administer the Bill and its
implications when it becomes law. We want to be confident that the
proposals can be implemented through what I would describe as a systems
approach, rather than through police officers managing individual
records. There is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>potential here for us to be managing 5 million
individual records. That would draw on a lot of police resources that
would be better used
elsewhere.</div><a name="10012687000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
on the deletion process, we strongly support a centrally managed,
transparent process and clear guidance on that set out in regulations.
We support that and feel that we need it in light of the recent media
interest.</div><a name="10012687000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are the points that I would like to highlight in my opening statement.
I shall close
there.</div><a name="10012687000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000341"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you very much, Mr. Pugh. The
first question will be put by Alison
Seabeck.</div><a name="10012687000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
74</b><a name="10012687000342"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): What percentage of
the 33,000 crimes detected using the national DNA database were direct
detections, as opposed to indirect detections, where somebody
subsequently confessed to multiple crimes? That does not link into your
comment about volume, but I will come back to that in a minute. Do you
have figures to hand to show how convictions and crimes solved are
split between the two
categories?</div><a name="10012687000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> The simple answer is no. There is a point here
about the contribution that DNA profiling makes and, in a sense, we are
looking for a causal link. We can identify those cases in which there
was a DNA match and a detection, but the precise input provided by that
the DNA match would almost require a case-by-case study. That is not to
duck the issue, but to say that that is the way that DNA works in
policing. DNA does not convict anyone; it provides a starting point for
an investigation. I can go and look at the 33,000 detections in more
detail, but I will come up against that
problem.</div>
<a name="10012687000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
75</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000343"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> It is just that you can see the potential
criticism here. There are 33,000 detections, but only a small minority
might have been direct detections, as opposed to people confessing to
15 burglaries. We are trying to work out the value of profiling, so
this is quite an important issue.</div>
<a name="10012687000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> I can say from my experience in the
Metropolitan police&#151;I must reinforce that this is about the role
of DNA profiling and the databases in identifying a potential offender,
giving us a name to start an investigation&#151;that there are many
cases where we already have a potential suspect, so we are talking
about making a one-to-one comparison, rather than a search of the
database. Thirty to 40 per cent. of detections result from identifying
the offender in the Metropolitan police fingerprint and DNA databases.
Therefore, by providing a name, DNA profiling and fingerprints make a
powerful contribution in what is a difficult situation today, because
people move around and our knowledge of communities, and even criminal
communities, is not as it was many years ago.</div>
<a name="10012687000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I can
add another point, which relates to the evidence that we gave to the
Home Affairs Committee. It was widely reported that only 0.67 per cent.
of crimes were solved using DNA. That is perhaps unfair, in that in the
vast majority of crime, we do not look for and we do not find DNA. You
therefore need to look at the proportion of crimes in which we look for
and find DNA. Many crimes, such as shoplifting and fraud, do not
provide the opportunity to find DNA to compare with samples on the
database. The 0.67 per cent perhaps undervalues the contribution of DNA
profiling.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div><a name="10012687000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
76</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000344"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Do you have an assessment of the percentages
based on what you have just described?</div>
<a name="10012687000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> I have the figures, for example, for rape and
other crimes. In the last year, there were 160 DNA matches in rape
cases. I do not have a detailed breakdown, but I can provide you with
more detail.</div>
<a name="10012687000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
77</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000345"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> It is just that to understand your argument, the
Committee probably needs to have a look at those
figures.</div><a name="10012687000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> May I just add to that, Sir Nicholas? The
issue of the complexity in policing is one that I have been trying to
articulate since I took up my present job. It is hard to say that DNA
was the decisive thing in a particular case, although with some rapes,
you can pretty much say that the overwhelming evidence was provided by
DNA because of the nature of its recovery; but DNA is part of the
critical mass that gets you to the point where the prosecution can be
mounted and it is part of the interview plan that allows officers to
put a suspect in a place so that they have to give an explanation that
the officers can then deconstruct and use to prove a point through
different investigative means. We are talking about DNA being used in
the holistic sense of an investigation, rather than saying precisely,
&#147;DNA can solve this.&#148; A fingerprint is exactly the same;
it puts a person in a place, and they then have to explain that.
Without trying to be over-detailed, DNA profiling is just one
technique, but we would argue that is a very important one, and there
are many anecdotal cases. I fully understand that anecdotes make bad
law.</div>
<a name="10012687000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
78</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000346"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> I assume that the figures are based on DNA and
fingerprints being part of the primary tranche of evidence, rather than
anything else.</div>
<a name="10012687000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> If you read some background papers on
murders in London last year, you find that senior investigating
officers say that DNA was important in about 80 per cent. of those
crimes, but they could not properly say that it was the reason for
solving the
crime.</div><a name="10012687000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000347"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Can I say to both our witnesses that if you are
asked questions and you do not have the detailed answers, we will be
very pleased to receive that information later, and of course it can be
included in our papers as a memorandum or as a supplement to any
evidence that you have already
submitted?</div><a name="10012687000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
79</b><a name="10012687000348"></a><b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): We may get a sense
of d√(c)j√  vu with these questions, having gone through a
similar set of questions with the Home Affairs Committee. Nevertheless,
I want to come back to this question of the cost-effectiveness of DNA,
because I think that in both of your statements you have stated that
DNA is effective in tackling crime. Clearly it is effective, but we
also now know and have received written confirmation that there is no
independent assessment of the cost-effectiveness of DNA techniques.
Therefore, it may well be that training officers in how to deal with
rape cases, such as the Warboys case, is more effective at solving
crime than DNA is.</div>
<a name="10012687000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Home
Affairs Committee, we have had Greg Hands giving evidence in which DNA
was taken from him as a Member of Parliament and from his extended
family, including his elderly aunts, with police officers travelling
the length and breadth of the country to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>collect that information. I would like some
guarantee from you that there is actually something that can
demonstrate that DNA is an effective use of taxpayers&#146; money, in
preference to using that money to recruit more officers, provide more
training or in another way, because we do not need the Bill to
concentrate on DNA if, in fact, there are more effective ways of
tackling crime.</div>
<a name="10012687000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> As I have just described, DNA is one of
the techniques. That does not detract from the fact that there are
individual cases where we have not got it right. We fully accept that,
on occasion, police officers do not get it right, and training has a
critical part to play in effective police
investigation.</div><a name="10012687000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I want to step back from saying that, by taking away the money from
investing in DNA, we could do something that is likely to be more
effective. Frankly, the reason for that is that, in serious crime,
where the costs of an extended investigation are likely to be
exponentially higher than in the routine of the business&#151;we do
not use DNA for that anyway, so it is not part of the argument&#151;I
would be deeply nervous if we lost the technique. I think it is
essential.</div>
<a name="10012687000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to
keep ahead. We need the technology. As technology has got better, as we
have advanced the processes and the methods by which we capture DNA and
develop it, the use of DNA has become more effective. The value is
huge, but it is very hard to put a value on it and say, &#147;This
costs x-thousand pounds and if I shifted that to something else, I
could be more effective.&#148; It is how you carve up the police
cake.</div>
<a name="10012687000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where there
is some value is not in that end of the business, but in having
clarity&#151;not about the cost, but the confidence. Where the Bill
goes a substantial way post the judgment is hopefully to give the
confidence that DNA will be properly managed and that it is Parliament
that has decided what is acceptable and not police officers dealing
with this flaky idea of what is an &#147;exceptional
circumstance&#148;. I think that&#146;s the real thing. It is an
opportunity-cost, but I think it is very important.</div>
<a name="10012687000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> I would add to that. We have had the dialogue.
There is not an underlying business case, if you like, for the use of
DNA profiling but, as I have said before in other forums, there is not
an underlying business case for other aspects of policing.</div>
<a name="10012687000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I would
say is that we do not use DNA in dealing with a lot of relatively minor
crime. Perhaps to add to my comments earlier, I should say that there
is a forensic intervention&#151;a scene examination&#151;only in
about 17 per cent. of recorded crimes. So we are focused on using DNA
profiling on those crimes where we are likely to recover DNA,
particularly serious acquisitive crime and violent crime, and on those
crimes where a search of the database may, as Sir Hugh said, provide a
name that is a starting point for the investigation.</div>
<a name="10012687000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many of
those instances, we would not have got that name by any other route. So
an investment in other aspects of policing would not have given us the
name of that suspect to start an investigation. Therein lies some of
the value of DNA profiling and the
database.</div>

82</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000351"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> I do not think anyone is seriously suggesting that
you should have the opportunity of anything other than being able to
use DNA. Is not the issue public concern about innocent people having
their DNA retained?</div>
<a name="10012687000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think, Sir
Hugh, you put it rather well, really, because it seemed to me as a
defence counsel that you got it absolutely right. So far as the police
are concerned, there are three kinds of people. There are those who are
guilty; there are those who are not guilty; and there are those who the
police think, know and feel are guilty but they just have not managed
to get enough evidence to convict them.</div>
<a name="10012687000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is there not
a suspicion among large numbers of members of the general
public that even though you may not actually have managed to bring a
prosecution, sod it, you are jolly well going to keep their DNA, as
much as anything to say to them, &#147;We think you&#146;re guilty;
we think there&#146;s something untoward about you, and this is a way
we&#146;re going to retain that information.&#148; Is not that a
concern that many people
have?</div><a name="10012687000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> I think it is slightly more sophisticated
than a sort of &#147;Sod it, we&#146;ll keep it&#148; approach.
The reality of policing&#151;I can talk about the real world in which
I and my officers operate&#151;is not black and white. You are
absolutely right; it is the grey area that we are talking about. People
who are guilty, we understand. The people we are talking about are
those who are lawfully arrested but not convicted.</div>
<a name="10012687000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Within that
spectrum, you have people who are entirely innocent in law at one end,
and people who in our judgment and based on our intelligence are
extremely dangerous people who have been acquitted, or who have never
been through a court, because, for example, the witnesses are so
terrified they will not give evidence. They are people who are then
back out in communities committing serious damage. We think we need a
proper system, subject to Parliament&#146;s rules, to retain their
DNA for the safety of the wider community. You are absolutely right.
That is the judgment call that we are saying, and my colleague Chris
Sims said, we need guidance on.</div>

<a name="10012687000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir

know about Damian 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>Green&#146;s offices being raided and his being
arrested for terrorism. If you are telling this Committee that you do
not know about that, I am extremely surprised
.</div><a name="10012687000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> I did not know where he worked from, and I
was fairly busy in Northern Ireland at the time, keeping my officers
and my community alive. It was not my
business.</div><a name="10012687000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point you make is a good one, however. There are individual cases that,
for whatever reason, are deemed exceptional. There is an issue of chief
officers having to consider whether they can deal with that within the
current guidelines. What we are saying is that we want clearer
guidelines around the routine of the business, not the exceptions. I am
happy to accept, and I accept absolutely, that there are exceptional
cases. In exceptional cases I do think that we can get more consistency
between chief constables. I have looked at the numbers. There is a
variety of interpretations of what is exceptional, but in that case the
DNA database issue was dealt with by a chief and the material was
removed&#151;unless you are going to tell me
otherwise.</div>

justification or reason why it should be
retained?</div><a name="10012687000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir

who retains and owns the data, not for the president of the Association
of Chief Police Officers.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
86</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000355"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> No. You very kindly gave the Committee a spectrum
of people, from those who are truly innocent onwards. By what possible
justification, using that spectrum, could Damien Green&#146;s DNA be
retained?</div>
<a name="10012687000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> That is a matter for the chief officer
involved in that case. That is something that we have made very clear.
We do feel that it is the right way for that to be. We are held to
account, or the individual chiefs are held to account. When I gave
evidence to the Home Affairs Committee, when I took over this job, I
made the point&#151;it is in the evidence&#151;that I no longer
have a command. I am not responsible for, and we fiercely defend the
operational independence of, chief officers. I understand the question
and I&#146;m happy to refer it to the relevant chief officer to give
you an
answer.</div><a name="10012687000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000356"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Can I say to Tony Baldry that I think we have
taken that specific issue far enough? Can I also say to Sir Hugh I
fully understand why you did not appreciate to whom Mr.
Baldry was referring when he talked about the hon. Member for Ashford.
I am confident that if Mr. Baldry had said &#147;Damian
Green&#148; you would have known immediately of this case.</div>
<a name="10012687000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir

87</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000358"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> With respect, my point is this. I hope, Sir Hugh,
that you will understand that large numbers of our constituents see no
conceivable justification or reason why someone in those circumstances
should have their DNA retained on the record. They infer a degree of
spitefulness, and thus feel it reflected on them when their DNA is
taken by the police. That, it seems to me, is one of the issues that
you must consider.</div>
<a name="10012687000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">If chief
constables act in different ways and consider that they are not acting
unreasonably, do we not need to move to the sort of system that the
Chairman of the Select Committee on Home Affairs suggested on Second
Reading&#151;an independent arbiter to determine what DNA should be
retained and what DNA should be deleted?</div>
<a name="10012687000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> I think it is exceptional. As we said in
our opening remarks, we are very keen for this to be codified by
Parliament, to the point where you remove 90 per cent. or even 99 per
cent. of these issues, because there will be absolute clarity on what
can be retained and for how long. I still think that there will be some
cases where we would need the flexibility for chief officers to make
the decision&#151;it could be a malicious allegation, or the sample
was volunteered. Although there are plans for people who volunteer to
have their DNA taken&#151;perhaps they are now outside the
loop&#151;but in cases of mistaken identity or something like that,
where it is absolutely clear that it should not be on the database, it
is not right, we should be able to make those decisions.</div>
<a name="10012687000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The more we
narrow that, the more I can deliver consistency across the current
structure of policing, which as you know is 44 forces with 44 chiefs.
You have to look at each case, and if one looks at refusals to date,
they vary from 0 per cent. to 50 per cent. granted. Of course, there is
a huge disparity of numbers in that, and some forces had only two
requests. I am not surprised; others had many
more.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000359"></a>The
Chairman:</b> May I say to the Committee, and our witnesses,
that the Minister has indicated to me that Damian Green&#146;s name
has been taken off the DNA database&#151;as far as the Minister is
aware. No doubt, Mr. Baldry, you can check that. No doubt,
the Minister will himself check and advise us accordingly, if what I
have said is inaccurate. I have no doubt that Sir Hugh, in his elevated
position, and Gary Pugh, will also make
inquiries.</div>
<a name="10012687000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012687000360"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Flello</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab): Are there not
two possible issues? The first is the confidence of knowing that if
your DNA is taken and recorded, you will not be wrongly accused of
something at a later date because of a problem with that DNA evidence.
Is that not the underlying reason why many people are a little
concerned about having their DNA retained in the circumstances that we
have
described?</div><a name="10012687000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second issue is the knowledge that one&#146;s DNA details are
recorded. A person might know that his neighbour had had a visit from
the police at a certain time in the morning&#151;he saw the cars
pulling up and the officers hammering on the door&#151;but he will
not necessarily know, unless the neighbour decides to tell everyone,
that his neighbour&#146;s DNA had been retained and was on record.
May I have your comments on those two
possibilities?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div><a name="10012687000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> In terms of wrongful conviction or accusation,
I am confident that the DNA profiling method that we use is very
robust; it is controlled and accredited. We in the UK have invested
heavily in setting scientific standards that the rest of the world has
adopted.</div>
<a name="10012687000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
the results, I am entirely confident of their reliability. I think,
though, that I would make the point that if we find DNA that we believe
to be from the perpetrator on the victim or at the crime scene, that is
one of the strongest safeguards against a false accusation or wrongful
conviction. A lot of what we do is elimination. Finding DNA or
fingerprints is, I believe, a safeguard for the criminal justice
system.</div>
<a name="10012687000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the
sensitivities around DNA and its retention, I understand that. People
have written to me and they are very concerned. I think that that
relates to the debate about DNA as the blueprint of life, and members
of the public are very concerned about what we will do with the
samples. The legislation contains proposals for the destruction of the
samples, and therefore of the cellular material. Some of the
concerns&#151;that we might sell the cellular samples to insurance
companies, for example&#151;will be removed by that destruction.
However, we have been very firm in resisting access to those samples
for any purpose other than investigating crime, and we have taken cases
all the way to the High Court on that, so we have put some safeguards
in there.</div>
<a name="10012687000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
point on sensitivity is that there is a legitimate debate about the use
of genetic testing. That is not an issue about the DNA database. There
is a DNA ethics group that Ministers have set up, and the chair of that
group and I are looking at that debate. It is potentially
possible&#151;I stress the word &#147;potentially&#148;&#151;to
test some unidentified body fluid at a crime scene for medical
conditions and so on, which takes us into a highly sensitive area. The
chair of the ethics committee, who sits on the board, and I are clear
that we need to deal with the ethics of that first, before we fall into
doing it. That is not a database issue, but one about information from
the crime scene that might help us to identify the perpetrator. I draw
that clear
distinction.</div><a name="10012687000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
88</b><a name="10012687000361"></a><b class="B">Shona
McIsaac</b> (Cleethorpes) (Lab): There are people on the
database who have been convicted of more minor crimes. That obviously
might assist in the future, as you have suggested, in detecting a more
serious crime that might be committed, but I would like some idea of
how likely it is that someone who commits a minor offence will go on to
commit a more serious one, with regard to the population as a
whole.</div><a name="10012687000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> Some interesting work by the Jill Dando
Institute suggests that criminals do not keep to one sort of crime, so
we would argue that if someone has been arrested for a fairly minor
offence, it does not necessarily mean they will not go on to commit
more serious offences. On the other side, one could argue that many
murderers commit only one offence of murder, perhaps in a domestic
environment. It is one of the most serious crimes, but it does not
necessarily follow that they will have committed more minor crimes. Our
preferred choice of keeping it simple and straightforward recognises
that for a substantive conviction for an offence, the sample would stay
on the database to cover
that.</div><a name="10012687000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also some evidence from cases of sex offenders&#151;I go back into
the mists of time to when I ran the murder teams in south-west London.
An example 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>is the case of Robert Black and the Maxwell, Hogg
and Harper murders, which took place across the country many years ago.
There is evidence, if you go back into criminal histories, that people
start with low-level offences, certainly with sex crimes. It can start
with indecent exposure and slowly escalate over time to far more
serious crimes. I would be nervous about a system in which we tried to
say that criminal damage is different from an assault or something
else. The simpler we keep it, the more likely we are to have a database
with some added value. I do not know whether Gary has the same
view.</div><a name="10012687000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> From the point of view of evidence, our view is
that we need some base of evidence&#151;that relates to the debate
about confidence in the database&#151;and, therefore, the retention
of samples from those who are arrested but not convicted. The Jill
Dando Institute did some initial work for the consultation. I have
since seen in the Government&#146;s proposals the base of evidence
that shows that in a period of six years after an arrest, the risk of
being arrested again is higher than for the population at large, which
provides some of the basis for the current proposals on retention. That
is where we need to look, in a sense, for the evidence that supports
retention periods.</div>
<a name="10012687000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
89</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000362"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> If the database is so vital in solving serious
crime, should we actually try to get more people on it? Some people
have even suggested that the whole population should be on the
database. If the whole population was on the database, would there then
be a civil liberties
issue?</div><a name="10012687000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> I think there is. I do not think that
there is any desire within policing to expand it in that way at all. I
certainly have not sensed that from my colleagues. We think the current
system is about right. We fully understand the ruling of the European
Court, so we are now looking for some clarity on what is reasonable. I
very much believe that is not a judgment we should make; it is a
judgment that Parliament should make&#151;it is that important. That
is the reason for our support for the proposals on a clearly defined
period of time that we think is reasonable and proportionate and
balanced against the greater good in terms of protecting the public. We
have been very clear: this is not a science. I am sure that if we had
everybody on the database, we would probably solve more crime, but that
would be grossly disproportionate to what we are trying to deal with,
which is getting the balance right in an imprecise
science&#151;investigation, rather than the specifics of DNA. DNA
adds huge value. That is my professional judgment and, indeed, the
evidence based on convictions, but I would be nervous about stepping
too far, because you then lose the confidence of the wider community
because they see this as a Big Brother state. What we are asking for is
clarity about what is
reasonable.</div><a name="10012687000087"></a>

93</b><a name="10012687000366"></a><b class="B">Andrew
Rosindell</b> (Romford) (Con): Clearly, the issue is finding
the right balance between retaining data on people&#146;s DNA and
ensuring that we do not go so far that it infringes people&#146;s
rights, freedoms and civil liberties. What Parliament clearly has to
decide in this legislation is where that balance lies. Will you tell us
where you think the balance lies? Is it as proposed in the Bill? Do you
think that it goes too far or not far enough? What do you think of the
Scottish system? Perhaps you can enlighten us on your own
view.</div><a name="10012687000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> Broadly, we are where the Bill is. The
initial response from ACPO, you will remember, was a 10-year period,
but mindful of the comments Gary has already made on the science of a
six-year cut-off, I think we are persuaded. That gives us confidence
that we can do our job, the public can be protected and the public can
have reassurance that a very careful balance is being struck by
Parliament and this is the right way to
go.</div><a name="10012687000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the Scottish system, I shall make a couple of brief points. Gary may
have some more detail. Gary&#146;s plea at the beginning was to keep
it simple. Of course, the Scottish DNA contribution to the database is
about 4.5 per cent., and it is quite a complex system. To
multiply that to the tune of 19 times would be very difficult
administratively. For the unconvicted data in the Scottish system,
which as you know are linked to sex crimes or crimes of a sexual
nature, the period is three years, followed by potential appeals to a
sheriff every two years. That is a complicated system in a different
judicial structure, where the fiscal, of course, has a major role to
play. Gary may want to add to
that.</div><a name="10012687000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> The Scottish model is based on three years and,
as Sir Hugh described, applies to sexually motivated crime. I will just
reinforce the two comments. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>It is a different system, which, from what we have
seen of it, requires quite a high degree of manual input to manage all
those records. As I said, the scale of doing so in England and Wales
would be significant, and it would take up an inordinate amount of
police resources to manage the Scottish
system.</div><a name="10012687000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the retention period adopted in Scotland&#151;it was reviewed by
Professor Fraser&#151;my understanding is that there is not the same
base of evidence behind it as there is behind the system in England and
Wales, which arrives at six years rather than three. From our
perspective, we need a view from Parliament&#151;although I do not
wish to push it back on you&#151;that decides on the basis of
the information what that retention period should
be.</div>
<a name="10012687000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
94</b><a name="10012687000367"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Simon Burns</b> (West Chelmsford) (Con): Can I press you on
the answer you gave my colleague, Mr. Rosindell? You both
said that you were broadly content, or in agreement, with the
provisions in the Bill for six years. That basically means that you
concede that DNA should be destroyed or not held after a time period.
What I do not understand is that if you have conceded the principle,
why six years? Why should it be such a long period? What, in your mind,
is so good about six years, apart from the fact that it is in a Bill
produced by the Government?</div>
<a name="10012687000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> I will ask Gary, but it very much
involves, as you said, the suggestion that the evidence of reoffending
after six years is something to hang the six years on. Maybe he will be
able to give a bit more
detail.</div><a name="10012687000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> We very much want something rooted in evidence
or some analysis of the risk. The information produced in support of
the Bill certainly persuades us that six years is right in terms of
minimising that risk. From our perspective, if an individual with a

that after six years, they are no more likely to be arrested than the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
95</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000368"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b> Hang on a minute. There are cases in this
country&#151;I suspect quite a lot of them&#151;when people are
arrested completely wrongly. They are totally innocent of the crime
with which they are charged, they have a blameless life
vis-√ -vis committing crimes before that point and they are found
innocent, or it is decided not to proceed with the court case, yet the
DNA is on record. Why do you need six years to keep that DNA in order
to check, because of other statistics on known criminals who have
committed offences, whether they will reoffend?</div>
<a name="10012687000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> My answer is that the process for dealing with
that is the deletion process, or the exceptional case procedure as it
is now called. If we strengthen that, making it more consistent and
transparent, the individual you described who poses no risk should be
removed via that
process.</div><a name="10012687000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
96</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000369"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b> At the moment, in my county of Essex, previous
chief constables&#151;I do not know about the current one; there has
just been a change&#151;refused every request in every case I have
had involving a constituent who made representations to the chief
constable. Those people had never in their life committed an offence.
One person was never charged with any offence when their DNA was taken.
Another was actually the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>victim of crime. It then transpired that the court
case collapsed, and the magistrates expressed amazement that any
prosecution was made, as he was the victim of the crime, not the
perpetrator. Yet the chief constable would not remove the
DNA.</div>
<a name="10012687000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">You can
argue&#151;it is a cop-out in one way&#151;that the Bill will,
hopefully, redress such situations and that Parliament should express
its view in a uniform way. But it does not get around the original
point of the question: why should someone who has no record of
committing a crime, who is never charged with or convicted of a crime,
have their DNA held for six
years?</div><a name="10012687000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> If I could find a case where I was
absolutely satisfied that the person was completely
innocent&#151;well, life is not like that. There may be individual
cases exactly like that. The exceptional case may&#151;I understand
your point about consistency&#151;cover some of those cases. If we
can deal the majority out into a routine system, then perhaps those
that are truly exceptional can still come to the attention of chief
constables.</div>
<a name="10012687000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I absolutely
undertake to try to develop some consistency across the country because
there is, as you say, an inconsistent approach. I am unsurprised by
that. We have a structure of 44 chiefs who have different views on what
is exceptional and on each case on its merits. Equally, the
counter-argument is that there are some people who are equally innocent
in law but who are extremely dangerous. I do not have the skill to
distil one from the other. None of us does, which is why we are asking
for clarity&#151;where Parliament says, &#147;In our view, this is
the best balance we can strike.&#148; I accept that it will not be
perfect in any way, shape or
form.</div><a name="10012687000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
97</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000370"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Can we talk a little about the practicalities of
how that retention and deletion will work? Clearly it is quite
complicated in terms of who has their DNA retained&#151;whether they
are adults or under-18s, whether the DNA is retained for six, five or
three years and whether they are exceptional cases. What prospect is
there of that process operating with anything like 90 per cent.
effectiveness in all the different police forces that presumably are
all using different systems? Perhaps they are not; they may all be
using identical systems and so can be calibrated to do this
automatically. At a glance, my impression is that whether things happen
at the time that anyone expects will be very hit and
miss.</div><a name="10012687000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> I shall ask Gary to do the detail, but if
we take the date of arrest as a starting point, we think there is a
technical
solution.</div><a name="10012687000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> It is about the police national computer and
the database on it of information linked to the fingerprint database
and to the DNA database. There is an existing system that manages this
process. The proposed approach allows us effectively to develop an
algorithm so that when we start from the point of arrest we know the
point at which something should be deleted. It is possible that someone
is rearrested and the clock restarts. The current system does not
propose a human intervention to make an assessment, which is where we
would get into a heavy resource requirement on the police service. I am
reassured that it should be able to be done by the system, by designing
an algorithm that highlights the records that will need to be destroyed
at the appropriate point.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div><a name="10012687000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
98</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000371"></a>Tom

or will it
vary?</div><a name="10012687000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> It is the police national computer which is
UK-wide effectively, but certainly England and Wales come within it.
All the records are managed
centrally.</div><a name="10012687000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
99</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000372"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> While I understand that an algorithm is the perfect
solution, have you already identified circumstances in which the
algorithm will not work, based on some of the categories we have
listed? Will it require a manual intervention? If not, what solution do
you propose to deal with exceptions where the algorithm does not
work?</div><a name="10012687000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> No, because it is a set of rules for which an
algorithm can be written. I am confident that although it may be a
complex algorithm, it can be written and it can be done. I also draw
some comfort from the fact that there is a system in the PNC for
weeding criminal records, although not for addressing this issue. So it
has been done before&#151;in terms of how we weed records based on
previous legislation and the way we operated the PNC. My confidence is
high that an algorithm can be written that will flag up records that
need to be deleted.</div>
<a name="10012687000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
communication link between the relevant databases that will give an
alert for the need for deletion. The system will still need to be
managed, developed and implemented but it is a lot easier than
requiring, as the Scottish system does, a human
intervention.</div>
<a name="10012687000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
100</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000373"></a>Tom

<a name="10012687000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> To be honest, I cannot recall. I think we are
trying to avoid that approach. I apologise, I cannot remember exactly
what is in the Bill, but certainly the idea of individually notifying
people is clearly not something that we would want because it requires
more resources, but I cannot actually remember.</div>
<a name="10012687000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> I would not be keen on that. Provided it
is made explicit that the rules are strictly adhered to and are
enshrined in primary legislation, I am comfortable. I would not want to
have to send letters out. I am sure it could be done but there is a
cost implication that you would have to think seriously about. It would
increase the human effort in what we think is an IT
solution.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
102</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000375"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b> On that point, if someone is very unhappy that
their DNA is on a database when they have committed no offences, surely
they have to be told, if only to reassure them that it has been
removed, regardless of the fact that it might cost some money. Given
the money that public bodies and Governments spend in other areas that
one could question, surely the least one could do is send written
confirmation to the individual to put their mind at rest that they are
no longer on the database. It seems odd that you think that you should
not send out confirmation letters just on cost grounds. What happens if
people write to get an assurance? There are some people&#151;it may
seem extraordinary&#151;who are deeply suspicious of the state and
want that assurance.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div><a name="10012687000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> My understanding is that as far as the removal
process goes, there has to be personal communication, because the
individual will have made an application and they need to know the
outcome. How we manage what will become an automated deletion process,
not requiring an intervention from someone, has some practical issues.
I am sorry, but I do not know the detail of how we might deal with
that. I think it is an implementation issue, as well as an issue of how
we notify the individual that there has been deletion, or reassure them
that it has taken place.</div>
<a name="10012687000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> A practical issue is knowing where those
people are six years down the line. If they have had no other
interaction with the police, we may not even know where they are. My
concern is that it may create a huge administrative

out that, at a time of huge cutbacks in the public sector, if you want
me to divert resources, there is a cost and a consequence in terms of
what my colleagues with operational responsibility can deliver. I am
not saying that you cannot do it, I am saying that it may take some

103</b><a name="10012687000377"></a><b class="B">Mr.

at the moment? Did Damian Green, for example, get a letter or
certificate saying that he had been removed? Is there current practice
for doing that? There must be, so can we not replicate that practice? I
am sure that I read somewhere in all the piles of paper that there was
some system for individuals to request and be given a certificate to
prove that their DNA had been removed. People are nodding at the back
of the room. Clearly someone has thought about it and there is
provision in the Bill for it to happen. I am surprised that people do
not know about that.</div>
<a name="10012687000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> Under exceptional circumstances there is a
communication so that they know the outcome of the decision. That is
because the individual has proactively sought a response from the
police. That is different from someone who six years ago was put into a

criminal contact with the police, otherwise they would be back on the

107</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000384"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Alan Campbell):</b> It is a matter of
clarification for me, Sir Nicholas. Going back to Mr.
Burns&#146; point about what is most contentious about retaining
DNA&#151;that is, the issue of innocence&#151;let us say that
someone is arrested but found to be innocent and does not go on to
offend at a later date, and that someone else is innocent initially but
does go on to offend later. Is it not a fact that they are both part of
the same group, which, according to research, is more likely than the
general population to be arrested again? Is it not the case that the
time scale for that is beyond six years, though for the purpose of the
Bill the Government have chosen six years as a cautious cut-off point?
Is that not the
case?</div><a name="10012687000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary
Pugh:</b></i> The simple answer is yes. There is a tail and
there is a risk. The risk lies in the individual who is arrested, not
convicted, and after six years commits a crime&#151;possibly a
violent one&#151;and we would not then detect that individual. That
is the risk we are balancing against
retention.</div><a name="10012687000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
108</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000385"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> If that is the evidential base for the system
that is being proposed, what is the evidential base for another

system?</div><a name="10012687000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gary

<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div><a name="10012687000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">One final
point, if I may, Sir Nicholas, is a question to Sir Hugh. I am not
asking you to speak for your colleagues north of the border, but if at
some point you had found yourself as a chief police officer north of
the border&#151;and if the system that we are proposing was in place,
as opposed to the Scottish model&#151;some 23 serious
crimes would have been detected, whereas with the Scottish model they
would not. Have I explained that
properly?</div><a name="10012687000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> I understand your point. They are
different systems and one could make a hypothetical case where we would
get a result in England and Wales but not under the Scottish system. As
for the notion of me going to Scotland, I suspect they are rebuilding
Hadrian&#146;s wall as we speak. That is not something I plan to do.
There are differences. Although the judgment refers to the Scottish
system as one that would fulfil the criteria that they were looking
for, the big complexity that concerns us is that the Scottish
legislation is 4.5 per cent. of the total database and it is a
bureaucratic system. There is real potential for searching the database
and, by the time the bureaucracy has been dealt with, finding that a
search is unlawful because people just have not managed to get through
the system and it should have been deleted. I am not sure what the law
is when that happens. It is a complicated system and requires a lot of
human
effort.</div><a name="10012687000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have already said, I know my colleagues and can speak with authority
on this. We are spending a lot of time trying to focus on the front
end&#151;the operational end&#151;of policing. They would be
nervous about a system that meant they had to take more resources from
front-end service delivery to deal with a system that is, by
definition, far more complicated and
bureaucratic.</div><a name="10012687000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
110</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000387"></a>Mr.

to the one that they
have?</div><a name="10012687000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> I have not asked them. The point I am
making is to do with our assessment of what works in Scotland, which is
a different jurisdiction. I am delighted to say that I do not speak for
ACPO (Scotland). It is a different legal system with different
requirements and they came up with a different set of rules. We are
saying, on behalf of our colleagues in England and Wales who have 95.5
per cent. of the system, that it would be complicated, and part of that
is scale rather than the way it is
done.</div><a name="10012687000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000388"></a>The

because he knows what your organisation thinks and knew that if he
asked questions in such a way as to seek clarification he would get

DNA is a vital part of the fight against crime. I am mindful that
Committee members represent constituents who have a right to be
protected. The tricky bit, on which we seek your help, guidance and
support, is coming up with a system that has the authority of
Parliament, rather than being based on local decision making by
disparate chief constables. I fully understand that the balance will
not be perfect: it is complicated, difficult and sensitive and I am

refreshing&#151;I can say that as somebody who has been in Parliament
for quite a long time&#151;that a Minister is actually prepared to
ask a question of a professional police officer. Ministers are not
infallible and neither are Members of Parliament, although Ministers

naive?</div><a name="10012687000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000395"></a>The
Chairman:</b> From the Chair, I would not comment on that
matter. The Minister saw fit to ask a question and he has every right
to do so, because it is important that during the witness sessions we
flush out as much information as possible, including the thoughts and
views of the police on this issue, because they are, in some instances,
able to convict people who have been found guilty of an offence who
otherwise would have been found
innocent.</div><a name="10012687000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are
there any further questions from Committee
members?</div><a name="10012687000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
113</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000396"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> Would Sir Hugh or Mr. Pugh tell us
what they think is a reasonable period&#151;if any period at
all&#151;to retain someone&#146;s DNA, if they are proved innocent
having been charged but found not guilty? How long would you consider
is reasonable to keep that DNA
data?</div><a name="10012687000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> I go back to the six-year suggestion. As I
tried to articulate at the beginning, just because someone is found not
guilty does not mean that they have not committed a crime; it means
that we have failed to achieve the very high standard, quite properly,
of proof beyond reasonable doubt to convict. That is where the
complexity lies and it is the grey area of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>policing that we are talking about. We have to make decisions day in,
day out around handling some of these people, who are in your
communities and who are dangerous. It is a great reassurance to me as
chief, and to many of my investigators, to know that we have some
handle on these
people.</div><a name="10012687000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have not raised the issue to date&#151;I think it is worth
mentioning, although it is very hard to quantify&#151;of the
deterrent effect when one of the players knows that we have their DNA
on the database if they are considering continuing their criminal
career, having been acquitted of a potentially serious crime. This is
exactly the grey area of policing that we are talking about. We think
that six years strikes the balance. I am not a lawyer, but I also hope
that it will satisfy the European Court that it is no longer a blanket
policy and that it is now compliant with Strasbourg
law.</div><a name="10012687000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
114</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000397"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> How about somebody who is not even charged
where their DNA is taken, the case is dropped and they walk away?
Damian Green, for example, was arrested but not charged in the end. How
long would you say is reasonable to keep DNA in that
circumstance?</div><a name="10012687000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> We have, on the grounds of simplicity and
professional judgment, gone for the same type. Just because somebody is
not charged does not mean that they are not potentially very
dangerous.</div><a name="10012687000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
115</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000398"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b> Damian
Green?</div><a name="10012687000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> Individual cases are difficult. I could
cite some examples from my previous life&#151;I will not for obvious
reasons&#151;where I had some extremely dangerous people who were
arrested and released without charge and, trust me, I needed their DNA.
I have it and I can live with
that.</div><a name="10012687000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
116</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000399"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> So if you go for six years, what difference
would seven years
make?</div><a name="10012687000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hugh Orde:</b></i> It would increase our opportunities for
those who decide to step across the line between year six and year
seven. I make no apology for putting it that way. It is a matter for
Parliament to decide. As I have said, our initial submission was 10
years, because, as one would expect of professional officers, we like
to keep every opportunity that we can, but, on reflection and on the
drafting of the Bill, we were happy with six. That was the professional
judgment of my senior colleagues and we are happy with six years. You
can make an argument for any number of years&#151;for ever would
increase the chances again. The balance has to be between being
reasonable and proportionate and being mindful of current Strasbourg
law and the judgment of the European Court, which has generated some of
this debate. What I am saying on behalf of my chief officers is that we
think that six years is
okay.</div><a name="10012687000169"></a>

Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism (Mr.
David Hanson):</b> If it helps the Committee, in 2008-09
alone, the Association of Chief Police Officers criminal record office
found that 79 rape, murder and manslaughter cases in England and Wales
matched the DNA database. Of that number, 36 were found to have direct
or specific value to the investigation, and 23 victims of
serious crime would not have had justice under the Scottish model.
Between three and six years is the Bill remit that we are currently
talking about and last year alone, 23 individuals were convicted
between three and six years for a serious
crime.</div><a name="10012687000179"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
122</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000411"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I welcome our new witnesses. We can go on if
necessary, but perhaps it will not be necessary. Because of the
Division that took place earlier, we can go on a little bit beyond 7
o&#146;clock, which is normally zero hour. We welcome Isabella
Sankey, director of policy at Liberty, and Dr. Helen Wallace, the
executive director of GeneWatch UK. May I ask you, as I did the
previous witnesses, to each make a very brief introductory statement on
your view&#151;positive and, if necessary, negative&#151;of the
Bill, the objectives and purpose of which we will debate? Isabella
Sankey, may I ask you first to indicate your overview of the
Bill?</div><a name="10012687000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> Thank you, Chair. The first thing to say is
that at Liberty, we are not critical of absolutely everything in the
Bill, which makes a very nice change. For example, we are very pleased
to welcome the scaling down of reporting requirements with
stop-and-search. We are glad that the proposals intend to allow
ethnicity to continue to be recorded, as that is extremely important
for monitoring purposes. We think that scaling back the bureaucracy of
stop-and-search will be a useful way of freeing up more police time for
the very important community engagement role that they have. Sadly, the
proposals to continue to retain innocents&#146; DNA, in a blanket and
indiscriminate way, have really overshadowed the positive elements of
the Bill. It is on those proposals that we will focus as the Bill makes
its way through Parliament.</div>
<a name="10012687000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000412"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you very much indeed. That is very direct
and very
positive.</div><a name="10012687000314"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> We have a very similar position to
Liberty. First, we very much welcome the provision to destroy the
samples, which we have been very concerned about in the past. However,
on the retention of innocent people&#146;s DNA profiles, we prefer
something along the lines of the Scottish system. We have also
highlighted the failure to delete the police national computer records,
which we see as significant in terms of the individuals who contact us
with concern about the DNA database. We have some other concerns about
the provisions to expand the collection of DNA. We do not necessarily
disagree in principle with some of the intentions behind those
provisions, but we think that they are too widely drawn and that there
could be some practical problems with them that have not been properly
thought through.</div>
<a name="10012687000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
123</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000413"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> This will help to frame the debate. We have had to
wrestle with this issue as Ministers and as parliamentarians, and we
will have to wrestle with it during the next few weeks and months.
However, I would like to start at the beginning.</div>
<a name="10012687000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our figures
show that, if we adopted the Scottish model as opposed to the model in
the Bill, last year alone, there would have been 23 families of victims
of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>rape, murder or manslaughter who would not have seen
the individuals who committed those crimes brought to justice. That
gives us the nub of our argument and, in a sense, I just want to clear
the desk straight away, so I can get your view as to what we should do
in that circumstance, when faced with potential evidence that brings 23
individuals to court and is proportionate, but we could not do that if
we adopted the Scottish model. I think that ultimately that
issue will frame our debate, in terms of the opposition to the
Bill.</div>
<a name="10012687000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> I have not seen the report on which
those figures are based. I have asked for a copy of
it.</div>
<a name="10012687000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000414"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I will send it to you.</div>
<a name="10012687000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> I have looked at previous reports.
However, my understanding of that research, where it has been cited
elsewhere and from what the National Policing Improvement Agency and
others have said about it, is that that is not what that research has
found. That research has found a number of matches with innocent
people&#146;s DNA and senior police officers and senior detectives
were asked whether they thought that those matches played an important
role in those cases.</div>
<a name="10012687000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">What that
does not tell you is the extent to which those matches were necessary
to solve those crimes&#151;in other words what role that matching
played, as you heard from previous witnesses, in identifying those
individuals to the extent that they might not otherwise have been
identified. Until we see that information with regard to those cases, I
am not prepared to say that that is true.</div>
<a name="10012687000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
124</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000415"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I will happily look at what information we can put
into the public domain during the passage of the Bill.</div>
<a name="10012687000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
purposes of conjecture, however, let me just say something else. If we
could prove that there was simply one case that was between three years
and six years old and that DNA retention of innocent persons&#146;
initial DNA led to a conviction in that case, would you still oppose
the Bill? If we could prove that, would you still oppose the
Bill?</div><a name="10012687000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> May I answer that question, because I take
exactly the same position as Dr. Wallace on the issue of retention and
we at Liberty would much prefer the Scottish
system?</div><a name="10012687000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is useful to hear the evidence that you have just cited although, as
Dr. Wallace said, we have yet to see that evidence and we have found it
very difficult to get hold of. As far as we are concerned, the evidence
that has been published does absolutely nothing to demonstrate any
statistical reason why retention for six years is necessary. The
evidence that has been published by the Home Office demonstrates that
it has only been able to extrapolate from three years of data that six
years might be a useful figure. It is not actually based on an analysis
of six years of data.</div>
<a name="10012687000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, and
most importantly in our mind, there is the idea that you are comparing
the likelihood of future arrest of those previously arrested with the
future arrest of the rest of the population, not with the potential for
future conviction. Equating arrest and conviction is an extremely
dangerous road to go down in a free society and we were quite frankly
shocked by the evidence when it was produced and we understand that it
has been entirely written off in the scientific
community.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div><a name="10012687000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
125</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000416"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I just wanted to frame the debate, in the sense
that this is a debate that we will be having, because all of us want to
see people who are guilty being brought to conviction and justice given
to families. Our point is what is the maximum period, within European
regulations and the judgment that has been made, for which we can
retain DNA, which respects rights and has an evidential base but which
at the same time maximises the potential for convictions? I simply say
that if the debate shows that there is within that period a
reasonableness and that there are individuals who are ultimately
convicted of crimes between three and six years old under this system,
because their DNA has been retained, would you still oppose the Bill,
because that system seems to me to be bringing justice to individuals?
That is the debate&#151;I do not want to frame it. Colleagues will
ask questions. But I think that is the nub of our
debate.</div>
<a name="10012687000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000417"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Dr. Wallace, do you wish to come in again,
because your colleague responded to a question that was put to
you?</div>
<a name="10012687000203"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> Yes. I think that the question is one
of proportionality; that is what the legal question is. But I think
that is also how I view the way that you make the decision. We need the
information on the likely number of cases, to help us to weigh up the
pros and cons. There are pros and there are cons, because there is a
rights issue. Of course, it is not for GeneWatch to say what the policy
is&#151;it is your decision&#151;but we need to be clear on what
those figures are, to inform that decision.</div>
<a name="10012687000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
126</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000418"></a>Shona

individual to each of us?</div>
<a name="10012687000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> Yes.</div>
<a name="10012687000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
127</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000419"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> So why do you believe that people are more
worried about that individual profile being kept than about other forms
of evidence? Surely, if DNA is so individual, false matches and so on
are less likely than with other types of evidence. Why do you think
people are so
worried?</div><a name="10012687000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> There are a range of worries. We get
phone calls from people all the time, so I have talked to a lot of
people about it. There is obviously concern about the samples which
will be dealt with. They contain personal health information. Your DNA
sequence can be used to track you or your relatives; your DNA is on the
glass that you have been drinking from. People are concerned about
potential surveillance. People are concerned about their names being on
what is essentially a permanent list of suspects, which is what happens
now that your record is retained on the police national computer saying
that you have been arrested and your DNA has been taken. That can have
practical implications, such as being shown to your
employer.</div><a name="10012687000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of false matches, you have to be careful. DNA is unique to
you, probably, unless you have an identical twin, but the profile that
is kept on the database is not unique to you. It contains only 10
numbers, which are based on parts of your DNA sequence, so there is a
probability of a match entirely by chance. It is quite a low
probability&#151;as Mr. Pugh explained, it is about one in
1 billion&#151;but it increases if the crime scene DNA is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>partial, which is very often the case. It is often a degraded sample and
not a full profile. You get more false matches the more comparisons you
do, so there is genuine concern among forensic scientists that once you
share matches across Europe, which will happen from 2011, more false
matches will occur by
chance.</div><a name="10012687000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
128</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000420"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> We are moving to 15 points of comparison, which
means that there will be fewer false
matches.</div><a name="10012687000210"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> If you compare across Europe, the
concern is that the German crime scene-stored samples have fewer points
of comparison. If you are going to compare with those samples, you will
get false
matches.</div><a name="10012687000211"></a>

this country, their profile will be compared across Europe within two
years&#146; time, so they will be at risk of a false

<a name="10012687000216"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> But it does not address the real
causes of problems. I am not saying that it is a bad thing to move to
more points of comparison, but a lot of problems occur when the crime
scene sample does not even have the existing 10 points because it is
too degraded. Those crime scene samples are still used for matches,
which might lead someone to be implicated in a crime. It is not
foolproof.</div><a name="10012687000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not saying that there is a big risk; I am just saying that it is not
foolproof. DNA evidence can also be planted at crime scenes so as to
provide a perfect match when the person was not
there.</div><a name="10012687000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
132</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000424"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> Nobody is actually convicted purely on a genetic
match.</div><a name="10012687000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> The Crown Prosecution Service
guidelines say that yes, there should be additional evidence in order
to secure a conviction, but that does not necessarily mean that the
person will not have a difficult time being investigated due to a match
or that they will necessarily avoid any miscarriage of
justice.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
133</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000425"></a>Shona
McIsaac:</b> Obviously, I appreciate concerns about the DNA of
people who have not been convicted being kept on the database, but can
I put this scenario to you? Suppose that somebody has been arrested for
rape, the DNA is there and it goes to court, but the person is not
found guilty. What is your view in that particular situation? Some
people argue that those people are therefore innocent, so the DNA
should not be
retained.</div><a name="10012687000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> We have supported the compromise, if
you like, that is in place in Scotland. It is something similar along
those lines that allows the police to say, &#147;We want to keep
profiles in certain cases that have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>been proceeded against for serious violent or sexual crimes for a
time-limited period.&#148; The reason that policy was adopted was
specifically because of the poor conviction rate in the context of
those kinds of crime. It is not perfect, but it is a compromise that
might allow you to detect some of those serious crimes without
requiring you to keep en masse the DNA profiles even of children of the
age of 10 who have been accused of scratching their names on a park
bench.</div>

guilty?</div><a name="10012687000223"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> In Scotland, they would keep that
child&#146;s profile.</div>
<a name="10012687000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
135</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000427"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I want to pursue a little the question of false
matches. I am not sure whether you were here earlier and heard our
discussions about the cost-effectiveness or otherwise of DNA. If I
understand you correctly, if more people go on the DNA database,
especially following its extension as a result of European co-operation
whereby DNA matches will be pan-European, it would inevitably lead to a
greater number of false matches. That could lead to the police pursuing
many red herrings. I presume that you are advocating a proper
assessment of whether an extension of the DNA database would be helpful
for the police?</div>
<a name="10012687000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> That is right, yes. That is a
potential downside. It is not the only one, in terms of people&#146;s
concern about being on the database, but certainly it is
one.</div>
<a name="10012687000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
136</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000428"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Purely in terms of police effectiveness, is that an
area that you think requires further
investigation?</div><a name="10012687000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="10012687000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
137</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000429"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Secondly, you referred to the failure to delete
from the police national computer database. Again, does that refer to
the earlier discussion about retention and deletion, and whether a flag
is maintained on the PNC to confirm that at some point someone&#146;s
DNA had been collected but has since been deleted? If someone carries
out a Criminal Records Bureau check, would it show up that they had
been on the DNA database at some point? If so, potential employers
could use that information for their own
purposes.</div><a name="10012687000229"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> That is correct. Basically, what
happened was that the administrative decision was taken to keep all the
police national computer records, in order to be able to see whether or
not a person had had their DNA taken, and also to trace them if there
was a match. That was a decision that followed the changes in
legislation. If you&#146;re removed now, under the exceptional cases
procedure, Mr. Green being an example, he would have had his
police national computer record deleted, as well as his DNA profile and
his fingerprints.</div>
<a name="10012687000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
proposals in the Bill, there is no automatic process to delete the
police national computer record. We think that is not going to help
restore public trust, because individuals on the database will still
have those records kept, and they can be used to refuse a visa or a
job; that information can be released. Further, it means that the
police will also be able to see, if they arrest you 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>again, that you were on the database before and might act differently
towards you; they might simply re-arrest you and put you back on the
database. It leaves a loophole where you could be indefinitely on the
database simply as a result of being
re-arrested.</div>
<a name="10012687000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
138</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000430"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Have GeneWatch or Liberty taken the matter up with
the Government, asking whether they are aware of its impact, perhaps on
people seeking employment? If so, what was the Government&#146;s
response?</div><a name="10012687000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> We have continually raised the issue
of the police computer records being kept as well as the DNA, but we
have not specifically raised the matter with the Government in relation
to the Bill, basically because it has taken us some time to go through
it and see all the implications.</div>
<a name="10012687000233"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> We haven&#146;t specifically taken up the
issue of the PNC record at present, mainly because we are focused, as I
said at the beginning, on the retention of profiles for six years. I
understand, however, that the Home Office might be in the course of
looking at the PNC more generally, in terms of its retention and
disclosure regimes. We would certainly hope that this would form part
of that consultation.</div>
<a name="10012687000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000431"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> This, Sir Nicholas, may be an opportunity for the
Minister to intervene on the point of clarification, and to make clear
the Government&#146;s position.</div>
<a name="10012687000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
139</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000432"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> My understanding, which I am pleased to have
clarified, is that at the moment there is no PNC access for the
database. No one would know that the DNA database was retained on the
PNC. Similarly, no CRB check would reflect that because the two are
entirely separate. There is no connection between the two at all. No
officer would know that someone was on the DNA database when they
accessed the PNC; access to the PNC is strictly restricted and nobody
else would know, and it is not recorded on the
PNC.</div><a name="10012687000236"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> Whether you have your profile taken is
indeed recorded on the PNC. The reason is to stop officers retaking a
profile from someone they have arrested, which costs unnecessary public
money. It is recorded in the record. I can send the Committee a
list.</div><a name="10012687000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000433"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I suggest, Sir Nicholas, that as our understanding
on these points is very different, we will clarify that point in the
evidence session on
Thursday.</div><a name="10012687000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000434"></a>The
Chairman:</b> There appears to be some dispute, so it is
helpful of the Minister to say that the matter will be clarified on
Thursday.</div><a name="10012687000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
140</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000435"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> Do either of the two ladies consider that it is
justified in any circumstance to keep an innocent person&#146;s DNA
on the
database?</div><a name="10012687000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> At Liberty we think that in exceptional
circumstances it would be justified to keep an innocent person&#146;s
DNA on the database. We have never taken an absolutist approach
to the retention of DNA. We understand and endorse its uses in
detecting and preventing crime, as well as in clearing innocent people.
For us, any retention regime has to be informed by principles and most
importantly by human rights principles&#151;both 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>those of potential victims and those who might be subjected to crimes,
but also of those who might have their DNA retained.</div>
<a name="10012687000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our position
on DNA retention would be one very similar to the Scottish system,
whereby it applies to those individuals who have been charged or taken
to court where proceedings have been commenced and then stopped for
whatever reason&#151;whether that was because there was not enough
evidence or somebody was acquitted in court. It would be those
individuals charged with serious, violent or sexual offences who would
have their DNA retained for a limited period.</div>
<a name="10012687000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would not
endorse an application procedure as you have in Scotland, mainly
because the Scottish system is different and they have different
verdicts in Scotland, one of which is the verdict of not proven. We do
not have that verdict in England and Wales, and we think that having an
application process where you are asking a court to determine whether
an individual&#146;s DNA should be retained, although they have not
been found guilty, would be tantamount to creating a new form of
verdict in the English common law system. Our position would be the
Scottish system&#151;three years&#146; retention for those
individuals charged with sexual or violent
offences.</div><a name="10012687000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
141</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000436"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> How about those who are charged but the case
against them is then dropped? Would you keep them in the same
category?</div><a name="10012687000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> Yes, exactly. So whether proceedings were
stopped before they reached the courtroom or because they were
acquitted in the courtroom, this would apply to all those individuals
against whom criminal proceedings are begun. That is the reason that
Dr. Wallace highlighted earlier: we recognise that low conviction
rates, particularly for sexual
offences&#151;</div><a name="10012687000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
142</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000437"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> Would you apply that only to serious offences,
or to any
offence?</div><a name="10012687000246"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> Serious offences, as with the Scottish
system. So serious offences of a sexual or violent nature&#151;those
offences where DNA evidence is most relevant and where it would be
appropriate to retain it for a limited
period.</div><a name="10012687000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
143</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000438"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> So you feel that the Bill goes too
far?</div><a name="10012687000248"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> We believe that the Bill does not go far
enough in terms of deleting innocent people&#146;s
DNA.</div><a name="10012687000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
144</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000439"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> But too far in retaining the
DNA?</div><a name="10012687000250"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> Exactly&#151;too far in retaining DNA. We
do not think that any kind of principled engagement has taken place;
more that it is an attempt to do as little as necessary to comply with
the S and Marper judgment in which we intervened. Incidentally, when
the Council of Ministers met last September and considered the Home
Office consultation proposals of a 12-year and a six-year retention
period, it was noted that the six-year retention period would not be
proportionate and would not comply with the Marper judgment. So it is
our view that the six-year period would be unlawful as well as
unprincipled.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div><a name="10012687000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
145</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000440"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> But what do you say to the counter-argument
that there are those who have been convicted because of those
additional
years?</div><a name="10012687000252"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> We have yet to see any statistics on the
percentage of crimes that have been cleared up purely as a result of an
innocent person remaining on the database. The test for those
statistics would be that somebody was arrested, was never charged with
or convicted of an offence, had their DNA retained on the national
database and was later convicted purely as a result of
retention&#151;that there was no other possible evidence that would
have led the police to arrest that person and take their DNA. Remember
that DNA can always be taken on arrest. That would be the test for
exactly how statistically useful retaining
innocents&#146; DNA
is.</div><a name="10012687000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
146</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000441"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Would this example pass your test? Matthew Fagan,
who was sacked from a London company in 2006, did not receive any
conviction. His DNA was taken when he appeared before the police and
ultimately he was charged with and convicted of the murder in January
2007 of Cathy Marlow when his DNA was retrieved from under her
fingernails. That material matched his DNA. Does that pass your
test?</div><a name="10012687000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> That is a horrific case, but just
arguing that more DNA retention will lead to the pick-up of more crimes
is an argument for a universal DNA database. It is not an argument for
retaining innocent people&#146;s
DNA.</div><a name="10012687000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
147</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000442"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> This is the nub of the argument, which is why we
need to test it from your perspective as well as from that of
colleagues here. We are trying to agree with the verdict of S and
Marper, to be proportional about this and to look at the evidence base
that we have, but in that particular case, if I accepted the evidence
that you have put to us today, Mr. Matthew Fagan would not
now be in prison in the United Kingdom. He would not be convicted of
the murder of Cathy Marlow. The match of the DNA after a
non-conviction, after the three-year period in the Scottish system, has
ensured that that individual is now serving that sentence. Should we
ignore
that?</div><a name="10012687000256"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> It is entirely logical that additional DNA
retention will lead to the solving of additional crimes. It is
impossible to object to that argument, but as I said, it is an argument
for a universal DNA database, not a proportionate
one.</div><a name="10012687000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000443"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Can Dr. Helen Wallace give her view on
this?</div><a name="10012687000258"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> I have some specific points about this
case. The murderer was known to the victim, so it is correct that it is
a case where the match was the first lead to that perpetrator, but I do
not think I will accept it as a case where the perpetrator would have
walked free had they not been on the database. They were a disgruntled
former employee who had been sacked from that workplace. They had gone
back to burgle the workplace and the victim disturbed them. It was a
very horrible case, but it is quite implausible that the police would
not have started looking for disgruntled former employees who knew the
victim, and later made that match. It is a case that might have been
delayed. We do 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>have to take that into account. That is serious, but it is not a case
where you can say that the perpetrator was very likely to have walked
away.</div><a name="10012687000259"></a>

148</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000445"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> We are all here because of Strasbourg. I imagine
that this whole Bill is because of Strasbourg: because the Home Office
had to respond to the Strasbourg judgment and then cast around within
the Department for other pieces that people would like to put in the
Bill, from domestic violence to wheel-clamping&#151;there must have
been a great miscellany of assistant secretaries assembled. Did I
understand you to say that it is your view that if the Bill was passed

Yes.</div><a name="10012687000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
149</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000446"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> What is the basis for your making that suggestion?
As a lawyer, I am always very keen at the prospect of any litigation,
particularly in Strasbourg, because it is always very well paid. What
is your basis for that
suggestion?</div><a name="10012687000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> First, the fact that nothing in the Bill
distinguishes between those innocent people who will be retained.
Rather than taking a proportionate approach&#151;looking at the crime
for which they have been arrested, the relevance of DNA in solving that
crime and other factors like that&#151;all the Bill does is set a
blanket, automatic period of six years. When the Council of Ministers
considered the six-year period, they said that it would not comply with
the judgment or be proportionate. There is a report about the meeting
they had which confirms that
view.</div><a name="10012687000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been a lack of willingness to look at the principles laid down in
Marper about what a proportionate DNA retention period is. That is the
nub of why the current proposals would, we believe, be
unlawful.</div><a name="10012687000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
150</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000447"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> That point did not come up on Second Reading. It
would be helpful if you shared that extract with the
Committee&#151;that excerpt from the Council of Ministers
meeting&#151;because I have not seen it in any of the other papers we

proportionate in your view, but not six?</div>
<a name="10012687000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> The difference, of course, is that it is not
an automatic three-year retention period for all innocent people.
Unless you accept the presumption of innocence and allow for the fact
that in any case, the presumption is going to be that somebody comes
off the database unless the circumstances are exceptional&#151;for
example, if they have been charged with a serious violent or sexual
offence&#151;your proposals will always be disproportionate, because
they will apply a blanket suspicion and retention on a criminal
database to innocents per se, regardless of the suspected crime for
which they have been arrested and the relevance of DNA to that
crime.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000448"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Would Dr. Helen Wallace like to add anything to
what Isabella Sankey has
said?</div><a name="10012687000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> Only, perhaps, some information
regarding the origin of the Scottish model, which did not come
completely out of the blue. I was involved in giving evidence
to the Justice Committee up there at the
time.</div><a name="10012687000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
origin of the idea was from the retention guidelines that the
Association of Chief Police Officers had in 2000 for criminal records,
which were also supposed to apply to DNA profiles at that time.
People&#146;s records were supposed to be deleted after 42 days if
they were innocent, but there was an
exception:</div><a name="10012687000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Details
may be retained for a period of five years of offences where a sexual
offence is alleged, but the subject is acquitted, or the case is
discontinued because of lack of corroboration or allegation of consent
by the victim&#148;.</div>
<a name="10012687000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was looking at that
specific category of offences where ACPO had argued at the time that
there might be people who were not being convicted but for whom
proceedings should nevertheless be treated as some kind of warning
sign.</div><a name="10012687000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
it is not true to say that it is a completely evidence-free policy; it
comes from looking at types of offences where DNA might play a role and
where there might be people who are risky in some
sense.</div><a name="10012687000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
151</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000449"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> Thank you very much. To go back to what I was
about to ask, is the issue partly that how the system works at present
is that it is inferred that if your DNA is taken, you are by definition
a suspect, there is an implication that you have a propensity to offend
and some sort of stigma is attached? Would you object less if, a bit
like line-ups, ID parades and so forth, there was more random taking of
DNA among bystanders and members of the general public who did not
necessarily come within that category? In other words, that you tried
to reduce or remove any scintilla of a suggestion of stigma by saying,
&#147;This is a random sample&#148;. Those people might be
included, but by and large, it would be a much more random
sample.</div>
<a name="10012687000274"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> The stigma that you have identified is
certainly a huge part of the objections to the current DNA database and
as it would stand according to the Bill, but that is only one part.
Random sampling of individuals who had done absolutely nothing wrong
would be similarly disproportionate and an unlawful invasion of their
right to a private life, remembering, of course, how intimate DNA is.
Interestingly though, if you are taking a purely statistical approach
to DNA retention, which seems to be the road that the Government are
going down at the moment, barring the idea that they have incorporated
proportionality with the six-year cut-off period, you would retain the
DNA of all young men between the ages of 16 and 24, who are more likely
to be convicted than those of other ages and those of the other gender.
Statistically, if that was all that was informing your DNA retention
regime, it would probably be more effective than retaining the DNA of
people arrested but not convicted, which is why we say that statistics
can form only part of the assessment, and that principles should form
another, bigger,
part.</div><a name="10012687000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
stigma that you identified is one principle that needs to be looked at,
as does the discrimination issue. There are many more young black men
on the DNA database than any other group.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
152</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000450"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> Can I bring you back to a point that was raised by
a Labour colleague? I do not quite understand why certain parts of
identity are, in your grounds, more sensitive than others. We are
moving to a system whereby if we do not have a compulsory ID card
system, increasingly we shall need to show our passports to prove
identity. Our passports will be microchipped and the microchip will
contain increasingly personal data about us&#151;data entirely
related to me. Why should I be more concerned about a nine-digit or
15-digit number that describes my DNA than about a microchip on a
passport or an extended national insurance
number?</div><a name="10012687000277"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> It is all context and purpose-specific. In
the example that you give of a passport, you choose to use that
passport to enter and leave the country. You decide to do that by
consent and you use the passport to enable you to do so. In my view,
that is a different circumstance from the state telling you that it
will automatically retain your DNA against your consent for a six-year
period because you have been arrested for a suspected offence, but
nothing further has happened to
you.</div><a name="10012687000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
any piece of personal information, a human rights approach to assessing
how it should be used and how it can be used would say that you need to
look at how sensitive it is. For example, a DNA sample is probably a
lot more sensitive than any other piece of personal information. It can
tell you about your familial background, your life expectancy and the
chance of diseases in later life. It is the most intimate, sensitive
piece of information that you have. That is why it is imperative that
it is destroyed as soon as
possible.</div><a name="10012687000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
photograph is less sensitive and other identifiers are less sensitive
again. You need to look at how sensitive the information is, the
purposes for which it is being used, and whether consent has been
given. That is how you make a human rights judgment about whether it is
appropriate for the state to hold the
data.</div><a name="10012687000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000451"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Could Dr. Wallace also respond? There are two
different
organisations.</div><a name="10012687000281"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> To add to that, there is a particular
point about the Big Brother state and the role that DNA can play in
tracking individuals&#151;DNA as a form of bio-surveillance. If you
were living in a police state&#151;if we were having an illegal
political meeting in this room&#151;the state could come in and test
the DNA from your glass, check whether you are on the database and
track you and your relatives. Similarly, if the state fails to keep
that information safe and a criminal gang manages to infiltrate the
system&#151;there has been some concern in Italy about whether the
mafia could do that&#151;it could track down potential victims or
people under witness protection schemes, rather than the bad guys. If
the bad guys are on the database and the good guys are looking after
it, it is great. But there is real concern about the good guys being on
the database with the bad guys looking after it or getting access to
it.</div><a name="10012687000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
153</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000452"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> So how about if everyone is on the database? We
require national insurance numbers and, increasingly, we require
passports for ID purposes. So what if everyone is on the database? What
is the problem
then?</div><a name="10012687000283"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> Uzbekistan has recently proposed
putting everyone on the database. It gives the state incredible power
to track individuals or their relatives, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>including, potentially, political opponents, if the state is not
friendly.</div><a name="10012687000284"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> A universal DNA database would get rid of the
issue of discrimination. That would be one advantage of a universal DNA
database, but, again, it would be wholly disproportionate, most
definitely unlawful and would infringe the right to private life on a
scale we have never seen in this
country.</div><a name="10012687000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
154</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000453"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> Presumably, other EU member states, and other
states subject to Strasbourg, also have DNA databases, so what is the
longest period of time that any other EU member state retains DNA data
for?</div><a name="10012687000286"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> My understanding is that no other European
country holds the DNA of innocent people indefinitely, as we currently
do, and that most have adopted a system similar to the Scottish system,
so for certain violent or sexual offences it can be retained for a
limited period. I do not believe that any other European country
retains all innocents&#146; DNA for a fixed period, regardless of
offence, but I can certainly clarify that point for the
Committee.</div><a name="10012687000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
155</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000454"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> On the Scottish system, you say you believe that
DNA should be held if people are charged but the case does not
necessarily
proceed.</div><a name="10012687000288"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> For serious offences only, not minor
offences.</div>
<a name="10012687000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000455"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> I understand that. I started practising law before
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, so there are bits of me that
are fairly cynical. You heard what Sir Hugh had to say, and clearly one
of the issues one has with the administration of justice is that often
police officers become totally convinced from their own perspective
that although an individual is guilty of an offence, they simply do not
have sufficient evidence for a conviction. That is why before PACE so
many immaculate confessions purportedly took place in the police car
between the point of arrest and arriving at the police station. With
regard to the Scottish system, do you not see a risk of police in those
circumstances simply charging individuals, even if they do not have
sufficient evidence, so as to get their DNA and then simply drop the
charges
afterwards?</div><a name="10012687000290"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> I do not think that you can eliminate risk
from the dispensation of criminal justice, which is another very good
reason why we would not support the system in Scotland, where there can
be indefinite applications for DNA to be retained. In those
circumstances, if someone had been charged unlawfully purely so that
their DNA could be kept on the database, it could be kept for a period
of only three years. That is certainly not ideal if the individual was
charged purely in the way you described, but it would be for only three
years and no longer.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
156</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000458"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Are there any questions the witnesses think we
should have asked that we did not? Perhaps they could answer the
question we have not asked. Is there any critical point that we have
failed to pick up on in relation to DNA retention, deletion or any
other aspect that we should raise with the
Minister?</div><a name="10012687000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000459"></a>The
Chairman:</b> To give the witnesses a moment or two to think,
I have to say that Tom Brake has stolen my thunder, because I normally
finish by asking witnesses whether there is anything else they would
like to add to the evidence they have given that has not been brought
out in the questions put to
them.</div><a name="10012687000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000460"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> It might be a point of order, Sir Nicholas, but it
strikes me that the suggestion that the Government&#146;s proposals
could be at risk of being struck down is pretty serious, because if so
we might all sit here and go through a pointless exercise. I wonder
whether we can put the Minister on notice so that on Thursday he can
respond to that point and set out advice the Home Office has received
that it will not be struck down. Otherwise, things will be rather
boring.</div>
<a name="10012687000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000461"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> While our two witnesses are pondering the helpful
question put by Mr. Brake, pending your question, Sir
Nicholas, I am happy to confirm to Mr. Baldry that I will
certainly address that issue on Thursday, because we have obviously
considered the judgment and how far we can push the boundary of the
judgment in relation to our wish to have protection for the public. I
will address the issue on Thursday and, if need be, supply a note to
the
Committee.</div><a name="10012687000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000462"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Will the Minister also respond on Thursday to the
serious issue raised by Dr. Wallace, about the potential for an
increasing number of false matches, with the potential for significant
waste of police time pursuing suspects who are not suspects but have
shown up as a false
match?</div><a name="10012687000299"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000463"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It would be helpful if Isabella Sankey, as she
suggested, could offer the data and information on how our DNA rules
compare with those of other countries within the European Union. I ask
that as Chairman, totally impartially, to help the Committee when we
come to debate the Bill. Another Minister wishes to
participate.</div>

157</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000464"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> This is a genuine point of clarification. I am
not sure whether I heard Isabella Sankey correctly. When you talked
about the Scottish model, you said that you would do away with the
possible extension after three years. Is that
correct?</div><a name="10012687000301"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> Absolutely,
yes.</div><a name="10012687000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
158</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000465"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> And that clearly includes people who have been
arrested but not convicted of serious
offences?</div><a name="10012687000303"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> Yes, we consider that the three-year
retention period is an exemption to the principle that innocents do not
stay on the database, remembering of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>course that the police can always rearrest somebody at any point and
take their DNA again, regardless of whether their DNA has previously
been on the database. That is the real
safeguard.</div><a name="10012687000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
159</b><b class="B"><a name="10012687000466"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> That presumes the police have grounds for
arrest, of course. Regarding that three-year period, are you making
that judgment from an evidential
base?</div><a name="10012687000305"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Isabella
Sankey:</b></i> That judgment is based on the Scottish
system, which was, of course, cited with approval in Marper, but also
on the well-known fact that there are particularly low conviction rates
for sexual and violent offences. It is a principled and practical
exception to the rule that you should not retain innocent people on a
criminal
database.</div><a name="10012687000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could
I quickly add one answer to the question whether there was anything we
have not been asked about? We are particularly concerned about the
national security exception, as that would allow indefinite retention,
via the back door, based on something that would be very difficult to
challenge by judicial review. Of course, DNA retention is very
difficult to challenge anyway by judicial review, but particularly when
national security is cited as a reason for retention.</div>
<a name="10012687000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a point of
clarification, I understand that there has been a little confusion
about offences for which that exception can be used to retain. It could
be used if someone is arrested for any offence. It is not linked in any
way to arrest for a terror offence or for a particularly violent one.
Somebody could be arrested for the most trivial offence and have their
DNA indefinitely retained, because of the national security
exception&#151;because the police cite national security. At the very
least, we urge parliamentarians to tighten that up, if not get rid of
it
altogether.</div><a name="10012687000308"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Helen Wallace:</b></i> I have two points: not questions you
should have asked me but on questions you asked previous witnesses. One
related to figures about people on the database, matches with innocent
people and so on. I have prepared a submission that includes all those
figures for the Home Affairs Committee, which I would be happy to send
also to this Committee.</div>
<a name="10012687000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point is that the witnesses were rather reluctant to answer the
question about their Scottish colleagues&#146; opinion of the system
in Scotland. My understanding is that the police in Scotland responded
to the Fraser review, for example, and the police liaison officer for
the Scottish DNA database in fact consistently argued for the Scottish
model and not for the model now being proposed in England and
Wales.</div><a name="10012687000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012687000467"></a>The

our two witnesses for the extremely positive, frank and full way in
which they have dealt with all the questions that have been put to
them. I thank them on behalf of the Committee for coming to give
evidence.</div>
