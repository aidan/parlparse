                           </span> Many members of the
Committee will no doubt wish to comment on what are quite technical
matters, and your forbearance in the Chair would be most appreciated,

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 5
facilitates the introduction of schedule 2 on venture capital schemes.
As hon. Members know, venture capital trusts give tax breaks to
individuals investing in small unlisted trading companies. They offer a
set of tax advantages, including, for instance, 30% income tax relief
on the costs of investment up to about £200,000, a capital gains
tax exemption on disposals and tax-free dividend payments. The typical
venture capital trust involves a group of between 20 and 40
companies.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Currently,
all venture capital trusts are companies listed on the main market of
the London stock exchange. Government Members will be particularly
pleased to hear that the provisions in the Bill appear to be largely
driven by the need to align UK legislation with wider European Union
regulations on venture capital trusts. No doubt Government Members are
all good pro-Europeans, and it is healthy to see that they are taking a
harmonising approach in their legislation. In particular, the
regulations concern shares in venture capital trusts and the markets in
which they are listed.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At present,
regulations under the Income Tax Act 2007 require that the ordinary
share capital be included in the official UK list. Clearly, and quite
rightly, that can, to a degree, be construed as a barrier to the free
movement of capital. Accordingly, the clause changes arrangements so
that shares can instead be admitted for trading on any European Union
regulated market. As I said, that is commendably pro-European. By
allowing listing on any European Union market, and indeed any European
economic area market, as set out in the Official Journal of the
European Union notices annually, the new rules will, I hope, ensure the
greater transparency and interoperability of schemes across national
boundaries.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The schedule
makes a number of other technical changes to venture capital schemes.
It includes changes that regulate the composition of venture capital
trusts’ eligible shareholdings and it redefines the minimum
criteria required. In particular, the clause introduces a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 38<a class="bkMark" name="Column38">&#160;</a>
                           </div>financial health check to ensure that tax reliefs
would be granted only if there was a good prospect of the business
remaining a going concern. That applies to shares in companies that it
would be reasonable to classify as being in difficulty, which would
exclude them from qualifying. That is quite an interesting innovation
in policy and tax law. Obviously, it will probably be the focus of much
comment and debate today.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Opposition agree that it is necessary to align and harmonise the
regulatory arrangements for venture capital trusts and enterprise
incentive schemes in the wider European Union context. We also concede
that it is a sensible and rational change to have a financial health
check; that is certainly worth while. However, I want to probe the
Minister on several aspects of the operation of the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First, the
Bill
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
issuing company is ‘in difficulty’ if it is reasonable to
assume that it would be regarded as a firm in difficulty for the
purposes of the Community Guidelines on State
Aid”,<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000229">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>which
were listed under the reference 2004/C 244/02. However, I am told that
the Institute of Chartered Accountants pointed out that those
guidelines appear no longer to have effect—a point that I think
came up on Second Reading. Therefore, there could be an anomaly in the
Bill, in that the particular reference to the community guidelines on
state aids may be otiose and create a situation in which the guidelines
have lapsed. I would be grateful if the Minister clarified whether
those guidelines are still
effective.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister also precisely define the financial health check? Will it
be applied, for instance, to a group of companies, and perhaps a newly
created subsidiary of firms? Many hon. Members will know that corporate
law is complicated. Many companies and firms are quite creative in how
they can spur a series of enterprises and roll operations within
various groupings of undertakings. I am concerned; if one part of a
firm or group does not pass the financial “firm in
difficulty” test but the larger part does, or vice versa, how
will the operation of the test work? It is not clearly defined in the
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
particular, I am intrigued by the steps in the Bill that allow Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to apply the financial health
check rule retrospectively, or at least in hindsight to withdraw the
relief, possibly after a difficulty has occurred, potentially
compounding the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises that
otherwise might well have been able to make ends meet and continue as a
going concern. I am anxious that the rules should not magnify the
financial difficulties of a company if it is just getting by on or
above the border line, especially if there is retrospective operation
of the rules. I would be grateful if the Minister walked the Committee
through the process of the judgment taken by regulators, companies and
investors in applying that financial health check.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A recent
guide by Chancery chartered accountants stated that, as is
self-evident, within the cluster of 20, 30 or 40 companies often
grouped in venture capital trusts, one or two selected by that venture
capital trust manager will typically fold, while others will prosper.
If it is part and parcel of the normal chain of events in venture
capital trusts for firms to be in difficulty, I would like to learn a
little more from the Minister about how the whole tax relief
arrangements for that venture capital trust might be treated.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 39<a class="bkMark" name="Column39">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">As a
subsidiary to a set of technical questions, I am also interested to
know whether the Minister can say how the rules will apply to overseas
holding companies—for instance, companies resident in tax
havens. In those circumstances, how will information about the
financial health and viability of those firms be discerned, gathered
and communicated? Clearly, there is often less transparency in those
overseas holding arrangements than in the UK.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I refer the
Minister to paragraph 2 of schedule 2, where a set of threshold changes
is suggested, with a 70% threshold for eligible shareholders. As the

                           </strong> It
is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once again, Mr
Caton. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Nottingham East for setting
out some of the background to the clause, and I hope to respond to his

                        <p class="tabbed">As we heard,
clause 5 introduces schedule 2, which makes changes to the enterprise
investment scheme and venture capital trusts, the two taxpayers’
venture capital schemes. The previous Administration agreed the changes
with the European Commission in order to obtain state aid approval for
the schemes.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It might be
helpful to provide some background to the schemes. They were introduced
in 1994 and 1995 respectively to give investors a range of tax reliefs
in return for investing in small, higher-risk companies, and they have
been successful, supporting investment of £10 billion
or so to date. The schemes help such companies, which face particular
difficulties in raising finance, to start up and grow by encouraging
investment in them. Such companies have never been more essential to
the UK’s growth and jobs than they are now.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To make the
schemes comply with new state aid rules, various changes have already
been made. The previous Government engaged in a two-year process to
ensure compatibility with the new rules. Clause 2 introduces four final
changes to the conditions that companies must meet. Those changes are
set out in the schedule in detail, but briefly, they are as follows:
companies benefiting from the reliefs will no longer have to carry on
their trade wholly or mainly in the UK, they will have to meet an
“in difficulty” test, venture capital trusts may be
listed elsewhere in Europe and, although VCTs will have to hold higher
amounts of equity, the definition of what constitutes equity will be
slightly
wider.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked several questions, including whether the
“in difficulty” test for enterprises had expired,
rendering the provisions otiose. I can inform the Committee that the
guidelines were extended for a further three years by a Commission
communication of 9 July 2009. Therefore, the “in
difficulty” test for companies continues to apply.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the
context of enterprises in difficulty, he also asked what happens in
relation to the other group companies if a company in a group is in
difficulties. Essentially, the company to which the rule applies is the

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 40<a class="bkMark" name="Column40">&#160;</a>
                           </div>company issuing the shares. The position of other
group companies will not generally be relevant. I hope that that
provides
clarification.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman also asked whether a retrospective change could be made,
as it might exacerbate the position of a company moving into difficulty
if the test were applied. The test applies when the shares are issued.
HMRC will not seek to withdraw relief where formal approval has been
given and a company subsequently moves into difficulty.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman asked about companies resident abroad, in particular those in
tax havens. The schemes have always allowed money to be used overseas
to some degree. The UK should still get a return on its investment when
a UK company reaps the benefit of its overseas investment and, within
EU rules restricting foreign investment, is liable to run into problems
with the fundamental freedoms. That is why some of the provisions had
to be relaxed. HMRC will still look at cases where companies are in
difficulty, and at the rules that apply to companies resident abroad
and how we get the information. I believe that guidance has been
published on how that will be done.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about the threshold change from 30% to 70%, and
where the ratio came from. That is required under EU state aid rules,
and it was discussed with the European Commission as part of the
approval process. The figure of 70% is an EU requirement in such
circumstances. I hope that that is helpful and provides the hon.
Gentleman with some clarification on the fair questions that he
raised.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
was put out for consultation and a number of comments were received. As
a result, changes have been made to some points of detail. Clause 5
provides certainty for business by ensuring compliance with venture
capitalist schemes while allowing flexibility within the
rules.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000046">&#160;</a>

for the first time on this Committee under your chairmanship, Mr Caton.
I wanted to ask the Minister a couple of additional questions about the
clause. The enterprise investment scheme was designed to help smaller,
high-risk trading companies to offer relief to investors and it is a
measure that could be particularly crucial at this time.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000047">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Creative and
high-tech companies, especially smaller creative or high-tech
science-led companies, could be crucial to our future. That is
especially true in my part of the world in Merseyside and the
north-west, where we have particular expertise and a creative,
science-led economy. I wanted to ask more about proposed new section
180A, which introduces the requirement that was referred to and
concerns companies

more about the representations that he mentioned and whether any of
them covered that point? It would be helpful for the Committee to be
made aware of the scale of the companies that we are dealing with, and
to know how far that has been tracked by the Department.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000050">&#160;</a>

Minister also mentioned negotiations with the European Commission. Have
any discussions involved the expertise of colleagues in the Department

responsibility for the kind of companies that I am concerned about.
Will the Minister clarify for the Committee what discussions have taken

apposite to the position that companies find themselves in. Will the
Minister indicate the number of companies in the UK that could be
affected by the measure? It would be helpful to have a sense of size
and scale, and to know what discussions have taken place so far on how
the provisions might impact on those specific
companies.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000052">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to follow up on a point made by the
Minister, and I echo many of the reasonable questions asked by my hon.
Friend the Member for Wirral South. The Minister answered my point
about whether the reference to the community guidelines on state aid
had expired, and he said that there was an extension for a further
three years. I am always concerned that legislation should be as
permanent and everlasting as we can frame it to be, but if there is a
continual need for the updating of references, I presume that the
Minister will have the power to bring forward reference changes
in the consequential supplemental clause at the end of the
Bill, if necessary. Alternatively, is there a risk that the clause will
be in force for only three years, and that we shall then have to return
to the matter in a future Finance Bill? That is, again, a minor
drafting
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister mentioned that the financial health check applies only to the
parent company, which issues the shares. I am still not quite clear in
my mind about how often a parent company can be essentially a shell
vehicle for a number of other activities within it. Clearly, the test
is—or I presume it is—more of a voluntary requirement on
all the participants, either in the company or in the purchase of the
shares, and not just a requirement on the investigators and regulators
in Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to impose the test.
Therefore the disclosure burden must surely rest on those involved in
the company; that might be the way of getting round the problem of
disclosure, where there is a difficulty. If I am wrong, perhaps
the Minister will tell me.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is good to
hear that guidance is to be issued about the overseas holding company
arrangements and, I think the Minister was implying, on the operation
of the scheme and the financial assets generally. If he gave the
Committee a sense of when the guidance is likely to be forthcoming from
HMRC, that would be useful. If it is to be in the near future, it would
be a useful insight if he could circulate it, or a draft of it, to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I wonder
whether the Minister’s officials know—again, this is more
for context—the cost to the Exchequer of providing the tax
relief arrangements for venture capital trusts more generally. We would
like to get a sense of what amounts of money—what
flows—we are talking about, even if it is a broad estimate
figure. A sense of the revenue implications would give us a flavour of
whether the change is massively significant or quite technical. It
would be useful to know the
scale.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
gather that in tomorrow’s spending review, issues about the
green investment bank may crop up. I know 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 42<a class="bkMark" name="Column42">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that the Minister has various individuals scaling
the walls of the Treasury as we speak; I do not know whether they have
been peeled off. There are questions about the trend of availability of
venture capital generally to small and medium-sized enterprises, and
particularly those firms that are forging away on innovations in
low-carbon technologies and so forth. If the Minister shares any
insight he has into whether the green investment bank will provide some
of the capital that perhaps would otherwise have come from venture
capital schemes, that may give us a sense of what we are talking
about.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
perhaps the Minister can also provide some illumination for the
Committee as to a commitment that I understand the Lord Chancellor and
Secretary of State for Justice gave when he was shadow Business
Secretary, before the general election. He indicated that the
Conservatives wanted to reform venture capital trusts to encourage
investment in technology-based manufacturing, specifically. Yet I have
not seen any of those commitments in the schedule or the Bill. If not
now, when will the Government bring forward the changes that would
fulfil the commitment made by the right hon. and learned
Gentleman?<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000058">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to hon. Members for those further
questions and shall try to deal with them all. The point was raised
about how many companies will be affected, in particular by the
relaxation of the definition in relation to a permanent establishment
test. It is not possible to give an exact number, but we believe that a
relatively small number of companies will benefit from that, largely
because, under the enterprise investment scheme, investors often want
to invest in businesses close to them. It is not therefore likely to
have a big
impact.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
might help the Committee, and partly respond to some of the other
questions, if I highlight the impact of the clause as a whole. The cost
is £20 million in 2011-12, rising to £30 million in
2012-13, and £40 million in 2013-14 and 2014-15. That gives an
idea of the scale involved. That relates to all aspects of the clause,
and I hope that it provides a useful idea of the overall cost of the
measures. We should consider it in the context of the cost of the EIS
to the Exchequer of £180 million, and the cost of the VCT scheme
of £80 million in 2009-10.

                           </strong> The overall cost of the EIS is £180 million
for 2007-08, and the Exchequer cost of the VCT regime in 2009-10 is
£80 million. I hope that that is useful. On the overall position
on venture capital funding and the relationship with the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills, BIS produced a Green Paper,
“Financing a private sector recovery”, which raised
questions about how we can be most effective in supporting venture
capital investments, including EIS and VCT. I therefore reassure the
Committee that BIS is heavily involved in the discussions, and that the
Treasury and HMRC work closely with
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000062">&#160;</a>

                           </div>and I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify my

                        <p class="tabbed">The
issue of how tax relief for a group will operate in practice when one
company is in difficulty was also raised. As I said earlier, the rules
apply only to the company issuing shares, not to other group companies.
If the company issuing shares can raise equity capital from existing
shareholders or the market—that is to say, new
shareholders—the company will qualify for the
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000064">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the drafting of the European Union
guidelines on state aid. All EU guidelines on state aid are time
limited. The Government will feed into any review or renewal of those
guidelines and we will take into account any changes when and if
necessary. If it is necessary to update legislation, we will have to
look at that. We do not, however, envisage that it is necessary given

useful information has been given to the Committee. I think that the

4 relates to paragraph 1(5) of schedule 2 and appears to the untrained
eye to be a pedantic technical amendment to change the terminology of a
small element of the Bill—in many ways, that might be a
reasonable interpretation. It is a probing amendment that follows on
from points raised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales, which, in its submission, pointed out that there could be an
anomaly in the use of the term that defines the commercial activities
related to that sub-paragraph, particularly the use of the phrase
“enter into contracts” rather than “do
business”.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000070">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am told that drafts of this sub-paragraph have raised a few eyebrows
among those legal eagles who understand such questions. In particular,
difficulties could arise when there are groups with a holding company
because the draft legislation required that the issuing
company—the holding company—would require a permanent
establishment, and not the subsidiary company that had the trading
operation in which the venture capital trust or the enterprise
investment scheme funds would be employed. In many groups, the holding
company is just that and does not carry on any activity other than the
holding of shares in its subsidiaries—this is similar

of parent companies, which can often be relatively dormant operations
that contain other firms that are active. I am making a specific point
about whether we should use the phrase “enter into

                           </strong> I understand that point and the hon. Gentleman
might understand it as well. We are, I hope, both individuals who take
a common-sense view of such things. Unfortunately, that is often not
what the courts do when looking at the technical definitions that we
enshrine within our statute. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has
highlighted a perceived risk, which is not necessarily born from my own
line-by-line scrutiny of the Bill. It suggests that if we append the
notion of entering into contracts to the activity of a group company
that is essentially a shell parent arrangement, that might well be an
imprecise definition of what that parent company actually undertakes.
Such an approach might not capture the true spirit of the Bill, which
is something on which he and I agree. Consequently, requiring the
company to have a permanent establishment through which the business is
carried out—indeed, maintaining the existing definition of to
“enter into contracts”—could be seen to run
counter to commercial realities. If existing practice in law is based
on the term “do business”, and if that has worked
successfully since the Finance Act 2003, it might be more prudent to
retain that
wording.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000077">&#160;</a>

hesitation and embarrassment, said that he was asking about a small,
pedantic point, but if he cannot do so in a Public Bill Committee
considering a Finance Bill, when can he? There is no reason why he
should be in any way apologetic for raising such a useful
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000079">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
tabled by the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues would replace the
phrase “enter into contracts” with the words “do
business” in reference to the agent acting for the permanent
establishment. While the amendment would follow the normal UK
definition of “permanent establishment” more closely, the
definition is not meant to be the same as the normal UK
one.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
put it bluntly, the normal UK definition is about allocating taxing
rights, so a wide definition makes some sense. However, the version
being used for the VC schemes is about determining what companies may
benefit from financing that is subsidised by the UK taxpayer.
Consequently, because the existing rule, which requires most of the
trade to take place in the UK, is being removed, it is right that we
put in its place something whereby the company raising the funds must
have a substantial UK presence to ensure value for money for the UK
taxpayer. Of course, in doing so, we must ensure that we comply with EU
state aid rules, but that is the balance that we are trying to
strike.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
is not a fundamental matter of principle. The draft legislation, which
is substantially as proposed by the previous Government, aims to secure
the future of the schemes by making them compliant with state aid
rules, while retaining some benefit for the UK. We think that the
balance as set out in the schedule is correct. Consequently, I urge the
hon. Member for Nottingham East to withdraw his amendment. He makes a
fair point, but I hope that my explanation helps him. If we were to
move in the direction set out in his amendment, we could make it rather
too easy for businesses with only a slight UK connection to benefit
from the reliefs, which I do not think is the intention of any member
of the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000082">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This clause, as a relative of other clauses in the
Bill, is rooted in the European Union’s drive to ensure that any
tax concessions or reliefs given to firms that might be construed as a
state aid are compliant and consistent throughout the European Union
and therefore are drawn up fairly. The technical shift in the
definition of a firm qualifying for enterprise management incentive
options moves from the notion of a “wholly or mainly” UK
basis to a “permanent establishment” in the UK basis. In
some respects, this mirrors the points that my hon. Friend the Member
for Wirral South has
raised.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000088">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Again,
I want to pick up on a point highlighted in the submission from the
Institute of Chartered Accountants, which raises a set of questions on
the meaning of “permanent establishment”. In particular,
it implies that there is a query concerning the criteria by which a
company obtains the definition of permanent establishment. It suggests
that the Bill could be interpreted to mean that a company employee who
makes a sale in the UK on behalf of the company would thus define the
whole company as having permanent establishment status in the UK. There
appears to be no requirement for that employee to be resident in the
UK, yet a visitor carrying on business on behalf of the company would
seem to achieve that
qualification.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Is
there therefore a risk—perhaps because of injudicious
drafting—that foreign employees might benefit from generous tax
reliefs on their share options in that way? That might well be the
intention of the Treasury and the Minister, but I would welcome
clarification.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000090">&#160;</a>

clause that we have brought in to prevent EU infraction proceedings. It
is perhaps worth informing the Committee that one reason why we needed
to bring in this second Finance Bill was to deal with a number of
detailed technical points that we could not leave for next
year’s Finance Bill. That is why we have brought forward this
clause and, indeed, it is the justification for a number of clauses in
the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000091">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Enterprise
management incentives is a share option scheme that allows certain
types of company to grant tax advantaged options over their shares to
key employees. The scheme was introduced 10 years ago with the aim of
helping smaller, higher-risk companies to recruit and retain
high-calibre staff. The rewards that the scheme offers provide key
employees with a powerful incentive to promote the success of their
company. EMI is part of the Government’s strategy to help and
encourage such smaller companies, which are so important to the
UK’s
economy.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000092">&#160;</a>

the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the clause removes the present
requirement for EMI qualifying options that companies must broadly be
carrying on a trade “wholly or mainly” in the UK. In the
future, a single company wishing to grant EMI options must have a
“permanent establishment” in the UK. Alternatively, in
the case of a parent company, at least one company in the group that is

the legislation must have a “permanent establishment” in

employees exercising their options fell by 45% to 4,900. I suspect that
there is a cyclical element, as one would expect in these matters. The
annual estimated cost of income tax and national insurance
contributions released have both declined by 23% to £100 million
and £40 million respectively. As I say, those downward trends
reflect the difficult economic climate during the relevant

Member for Nottingham East raised an interesting concern about
employees and the sale of shares in these circumstances. As far as I am
aware, that matter has not previously come up in consultation.
Obviously, we published the clause in July but, before that, the matter
dates back to the previous Government. If I may, I will look into the
particular concerns he raised and write to him accordingly. However, he
makes an interesting point. We will look into the issue and I hope to

important matters, I would like to say that I am more than happy for
him to come back to the Committee on the point about the lack of a
requirement for an employee to be resident in the UK and the fact that
a visitor coming from abroad to carry on business here on behalf of
that company appears to trigger the qualification for some of the tax
relief. My point is simply that there could be a risk of tax relief
tourism, and that people will put a foot in the country and therefore
potentially open up the door to significant sums of UK
taxpayers’ money. That is why we should reconsider that
important issue at some point.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000099">&#160;</a>

such an approach. I am certainly concerned about the risk of tax relief

                           </strong> We now come to clause 7, which covers settlors
returning excess payments to trustees. It takes us to a different and
equally exciting part of tax law that many Committee members have been
waiting for—I hope for not too long. For those who are
unfamiliar with such arrangements, the settlor is the donor or trustor
who gives money or assets to trustees. They are the person who
originally created the trust. Some trusts are established to benefit
others, such as children or other individuals or organisations, but
some are set up for the benefit of the settlor—a
settlor-interested
trust.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause seems to iron out an anomaly in the circular nature of the
taxation of settlors who may have interests in trusts to ensure that
double taxation does not occur. That is entirely fair. However, there
are various categories of trust for a panoply of family and life
circumstances, many of which are wholly understandable and
laudable—for example, when the beneficiaries are vulnerable or
incapable of governing their own financial best interests at a given
point. However, sometimes the dusty and arcane rules surrounding trust
tax law may be used as a mechanism for the avoidance of significant
sums of tax on income that might ordinarily be paid to the Exchequer,
but for the clever legal and accountancy planning that more affluent
people are able to obtain. I accept that it is for the Treasury
continuously to define the rules to ensure that abuses are clamped
down, but some doubts remain about the regime of trust rules in
general.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000106">&#160;</a>

                           </div>small and modest trust sums, perhaps in safeguard for vulnerable
individuals, may be unwittingly drawn into complex self-assessment tax
arrangements that could incur significant costs? What is the
Minister’s opinion of the proportionality in terms of the
administrative burden falling on those small trusts for such
individuals, and what can he do to relieve the burden on those
trusts?<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000107">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
contrast, does the Minister believe that wealthy individuals whom
ordinary members of the public would not consider to be deserving of

laws to ensure that abuses are clamped down
upon?<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000108">&#160;</a>

I am told that the Law Society has looked at the framing of the

clause’s workability. It understands that other representative
bodies, particularly the Association of Corporate Trustees, have called
for the clause to be withdrawn. Given those opinions expressed by

                           </strong> This clause provides for a minor technical
adjustment to the administration of settlor-interested trusts. It will
oblige settlors to pay to trustees any repayments of tax they receive
in connection with the trust income, tax that originally had been paid
in effect by those trustees. A settlor-interested trust is a trust set
up by a person—the settlor—who puts property into it for
the benefit of people, which may include themselves. For income tax
purposes, the trust income is treated as that of the settlor, but tax
is paid initially by the trustees at a special trust rate. If the
settlor pays income tax at a lower rate than that of the trustees, he
may be entitled to a repayment of tax on the trust income treated as
his.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000110">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
trust rate increased to 50% from April 2010 and, with many settlors
having a tax rate of 40%, that type of repayment will become more
common. Settlors currently have to refund to the trustees any tax
repayments they get as a result of offsetting an allowance or relief
against their trust income, but they do not have to refund repayments
obtained in respect of their personal tax rate being lower than the
trust
rate.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000111">&#160;</a>

                           </div>to the trustees, there are no unwelcome inheritance tax charges.
Essentially, since the settlor will be legally obliged to refund the
tax to the trustees, he cannot be regarded as reducing the value of his
estate when he makes the payment, so no inheritance tax is
due.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000115">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Consultation
on a draft of the clause produced some useful feedback from
professional bodies on how settlors and trustees share information.
That is necessary to enable trustees to perform their fiduciary duty of
collecting payments properly due to them. In most cases, normal
communication between the settlor and trustee will mean that there will
be no problems, but we accept that there will be some cases where
trustees will want greater certainty.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000116">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Nottingham East raised concerns about the administrative
burden, which was raised in the consultation. It is worth saying that
settlors who do not make self-assessment tax returns can choose whether
to make a repayment claim. We think that most will make one, especially
where the sums are significant. The amount of the repayment is fairly
straightforward to calculate, and HMRC will be issuing guidance to help
people. Settlors and trustees often have a close relationship, as I
said, so there should not be any difficulty in agreeing the amount to
be paid, in the same way that trustees have little difficulty in
agreeing, under the current rules, the amount a settlor is repaid as a
result of applying their reliefs and allowances. Where greater
certainty is needed, HMRC will be able to provide settlors with a
certificate, confirming the amount of tax repayment they obtain in
relation to the trust
income.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is worth pointing out that if the measure were not introduced, trustees
would find themselves with unintended inheritance tax liabilities.
Professional bodies told us that the main area of concern was certainty
as to whether a repayment had been obtained and of what amount. That
was, as I said, a point that came up in the consultation. We have
addressed it by introducing the certification procedure, which followed
the consultation. Other issues have been raised, such as regarding the
treatment of losses, but they are not new, and HMRC will be working
with professional bodies to ensure a common understanding of the
existing rules. We are of course always willing to hear representations
on how the system may be further improved, but we have responded to the
concerns about the administrative burden during the
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000118">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman also raised concerns about avoidance in the area, and
whether there is more that we need to do to overhaul the trust regime.
Some members of the Committee may recall that significant changes were
made to the regime for the taxation of trusts in 2006. I remember it
well, having served on the Committee that considered that year’s
Finance Bill, and it was not entirely a happy process. The Government
want to avoid constant tinkering with the tax system, which leads to
complexity and uncertainty. We do not have any plans to make
significant changes in the area, but we are always willing to listen to
representations as part of the usual Budget process, and the Government
are keen to reduce tax avoidance at every opportunity.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000119">&#160;</a>

line 31, at end add—<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>‘(2A)
Any regulations under this section must have regard to accessibility
and convenience for the
taxpayer.’.<p class="tabbed">The
amendment moves us on to a slightly different, and perhaps more
accessible, part of the regime operated by Her Majesty’s Revenue
and Customs. In clause 8, Members will see a series of simple powers to
allow HMRC to create an online version of a form that taxpayers fill in
to report tax deducted on interest, perhaps from deposits or from
savings accounts. That is an entirely reasonable and worthwhile change,
and I am surprised that primary legislation is required simply to allow
the production of an online version of a form that, I gather, currently
requires a convoluted paper-based application and then 14 days for a
form to be returned for
completion.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the general sense, therefore, we believe that the new online return of
income tax deducted form—CT61—is a good improvement, and
will certainly ensure better compliance with tax law. We very much
welcome the provision, particularly given that it will be made through
the affirmative procedure in the regulation that is introduced. That is
always something that I would welcome on this side of the
Committee—<em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> I am sure that
the sedentary intervention by my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn
could not be recorded, and I did not hear what he
said.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment simply seeks to add, at the end of the proposed new
subsection, the requirement that the regulation under the proposed new
section also

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is necessary because the simple act of placing a tax form
online often does not necessarily do much for its intelligibility or
accessibility. I am sure that if members of the Committee have ever
endeavoured to fill in their own self-assessment tax forms, or had
dealings with HMRC in a personal capacity or on behalf of their
constituents, they will have metaphorically torn their hair out at the
complexity. Filling in the forms can sometimes feel like wading through
treacle.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000129">&#160;</a>

be made to improve convenience and accessibility for taxpayers, not
only because that is the right thing to do, given that taxpayers are
residents in our constituencies, but because it is in the self-interest
of the Treasury. The more compliance and the greater the understanding
of the rules, the more likely it is that people will pay accurate
taxes.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000130">&#160;</a>

in terms of accessibility, language use and the ability to assimilate
what tax rules apply to us as individuals, but that is a separate issue
from whether we should have tax credits. The hon. Gentleman’s
party looks set, possibly tomorrow, to hack away at the entitlement to
tax credits that many of our constituents may have, which would be a
great shame. Whether those tax credits are accessible depends on
whether the Government fund them and allow them in the first place. We
cannot put the cart before the horse. In all types of management we
could do better. For that reason I felt that it was important to table

amendment is that it could reduce some of the difficult cases that we
all see in surgery, where there is confusion or difficulty of

not only our constituents and members of the public, but those working

the Exchequer Secretary whether he would take this opportunity to
discuss the accessibility and intelligibility of tax forms more
generally. Certainly many of my elderly, retired constituents, who may
well be in receipt of much of their income through savings that they
have accrued over the years and find themselves returning declarations
about interest deducted at source, will be even less able to access
readily the meaning behind some of the complex terminology in the
current CT61 form, as well as in other forms.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Has the
Exchequer Secretary thought about consulting the Plain English Campaign
on the design of those forms? Can he say that if unnecessary acronyms,
gobbledegook and jargon can be avoided, he will make sure that they are
avoided, while at every opportunity trying to explain arrangements in
layman’s terms?<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000138">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Exchequer Secretary answer a question specifically on the whole set of
downloadable forms in terms of the wider self-assessment arrangements?
I have had constituents who have noticed that when they want to fill in
their self-assessment forms, they are sent a batch through the post and
then have to go online to find the relevant forms to download. That can
be a “hunt the thimble” exercise. Can he assure me that
the web version of the arrangement will have a facility for the
taxpayer to find the tax office address to which they must submit the
CT61 form? It may be that the online version allows a one-click return
of the form so that people do not have to print it out and go through
that rigmarole. I hope that that will be
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000139">&#160;</a>

that it is quite a simple form, so it is not the right time to have an

included somewhere else. I am not sure of the Minister’s view on
that, but I think that to include such a provision here would be most
inappropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000141">&#160;</a>

cross-party, bipartisan—tripartisan—way; I do not know
what the phrase might be. The deduction of tax from interest has
complexities, not necessarily about tax from individuals’
savings. Such complexities might involve whether the amounts are in
yearly or monthly terms, or whether they concern special recipients,
gilt interest, or foreign debts. Some companies have deductions at an
interest level that is paid gross, and there are differences in how
eurobonds are treated. It would be far better to spend a bit of time
designing the online form, hopefully with a one-click
solution.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000142">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As we have heard, amendment 5 would add a
requirement that any regulations made under the power provided in
clause 8 must have regard to accessibility and convenience to the
taxpayer. I am sure that the Committee is united in wanting to ensure
that tax forms are as accessible and convenient as possible. It is
important that HMRC faces a great deal of focus on that.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">HMRC has
carried out a lot of work on customer segmentation and it is important
that the customer segmentation that it has identified as being willing
and able is as big a part of the population as possible. There are many
who are willing, but not necessarily able to comply as they would like
to. HMRC must engage with such people and ensure that the payment of
taxes when they are due is as accurate, accessible and convenient as
possible. Both sides will agree with that and we can work as a
bipartisan-tripartisan Committee of national unity on that
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000147">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That said, we
believe that the amendment is unnecessary and perhaps it is worth
mentioning how clause 8 will apply. It is concerned with procedures
under which an individual or another non-corporate person, such as a
trustee, deducts tax from interest and similar payments by them.
Typically, that will occur when such a person pays yearly interest to a
lender resident outside the
UK.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000148">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause is not concerned with procedures such as those under which
taxpayers report interest received by them; for example, from bank and
building society savings accounts. Such payments are regulated by the
tax deduction scheme for interest—TDSI, if I may use an acronym.
I can confirm that the power has nothing at all to do with such
interest, for which there are entirely separate statutory provisions.
Nor does it have anything to do with the PAYE
system.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
aim of the clause is to provide a regulation-making power for payment
of interest, rather than receipt of interest. The current procedures
can be difficult for taxpayers to use. For example, at present, the
procedures state that the taxpayer must send an account of payment to
HMRC without delay, without specifying what “without
delay” means, or in what form the account must be
sent.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000150">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With
the new regulation-making power in place, it will be possible to
modernise the old procedures. For example, it will be possible to
provide a bespoke form, and consideration can be given to aligning the
procedures with the equivalent rules that apply to companies, for which
there are long-established regulation-making powers.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000151">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Any
regulations made under the power will be subject to consultation and an
impact assessment. They will also be subject to further parliamentary
scrutiny. As the hon. Member for Nottingham East pointed out, they are
to be made by affirmative procedure. He welcomed that, as is
traditional from those sitting on the Opposition side of the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is precisely because we are mindful of the need to have regard to the
convenience of the taxpayer that the regulation-making power is needed.
Without it, it would not be possible to improve the current procedures
in this area, provide certainty for taxpayers or reduce compliance
burdens.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
requirement on HMRC to have regard to accessibility and the convenience
of taxpayers is something with which we can all concur. The hon.
Gentleman suggests a wider look at online forms. The power in the
clause is limited to forms that apply where income tax is deducted at
source. Review of new or amended forms will, of course, be undertaken
at the relevant time, when we deal with those
points.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000154">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman raises a fair point about the importance of convenience
and accessibility, but adding such words to the Bill, particularly
given that they are not defined, would not add anything useful to the
clause, so I hope that he will agree to withdraw the amendment.
However, he is right to highlight the need for forms produced by HMRC
to be as accessible and convenient as possible, and I think he
particularly united the Committee when he highlighted an instance where

                           </strong> The clause is designed to tidy up the legislative
rules surrounding the corporate tax treatment of dividends and other
distributions following major reforms in the Finance Act 2009. Careful
work by the solicitors Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and others has
pointed out a set of anomalies that appear to have 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 56<a class="bkMark" name="Column56">&#160;</a>
                           </div>provoked officials at the Treasury to generate a new
framework in which to tie up some of the loose ends that were left
behind, and to reiterate the original intentions of HMRC in making that
2009 amendment to the law.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000161">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Generally
speaking, in this country we permit a company to make dividend
distributions only up to the balance of earnings that are available for
distribution according to its most recent audited accounts. Some
exceptions exist, usually in respect of distributions of shares of the
company for winding up and in other limited situations.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000162">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In 2009, new
rules replaced the system for taxing dividends from UK and overseas
companies following a legal ruling the year before in which, after the
FII Group litigation in the High Court in 2008, the European
Court decided to exempt EU and European economic area residents’
subsidiary distributions from tax in the UK rather than taking an
approach to taxing dividends depending on the residency of the dividend
payer. That decision raised the need for HMRC to become compliant with
European Union law—here we are again, all good
Europeans.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At that
point, HMRC could have opted either to introduce an international or an
EU exemption, or to remove the domestic exemption from UK to UK
dividend distributions. In the Finance Act 2009 HMRC seemed to opt for
the second option, placing both UK and non-UK companies within the
charge to corporate tax on income, although there were extensive
exemptions to those charges. A series of technical and unintended
problems arose, however. The rules were made more complex because of
the differing treatment of distributions, whether they were of an
“income nature” or of a “capital nature”.
Unfortunately the term “of a capital nature” was
insufficiently defined in the legislation, and here we are, therefore,
with clause 9.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have a
series of technical questions to ask the Minister. First, will he set
out clearly the alterations in yield for the Exchequer compared with
the original arrangements, for instance because of the change in
treatment of foreign dividends? Is it really the case that about
£200 million would otherwise have been collected had EU
dividends not been exempted, or do I have an incorrect
figure?<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000165">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, why
is it reasonable in paragraph 5 of schedule 3 to make those changes
retrospective in respect of distributions made on or after 1 July 2009?
Is there not a danger, as ever, in retrospective taxation arrangements,
and how will the election to opt out of that retrospective arrangement
operate in practice? Is that done for a particular reason, and if so
can the Minister expand upon the reason?<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
explanatory notes state that the current rules have created
circumstances in which
some<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000167">&#160;</a>

                        <p>What
is the scale of those unexpected charges, and is the retrospective
nature of the changes designed to compensate companies for those
arrangements? In my reading, that seems to be the logic behind the
schedule. Those are all technical points, and I would be grateful if
the Minister addressed them.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000168">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the measure
is highly technical, and it may help if I try to take the Committee
through it. Clause 9 and schedule 3 address an anomaly that
has arisen concerning the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 57<a class="bkMark" name="Column57">&#160;</a>
                           </div>scope of distribution exemption. As the law stands,
there is a risk of some very large, unexpected and unintended tax
liabilities arising within groups of companies. This legislation will
ensure that those potentially damaging tax liabilities do not arise
either in future or in past periods.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000169">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To provide
some background information, UK distributions have always been exempt
from corporation tax. In 2009, a new regime was introduced that
extended the exemption to foreign distributions. In common with its
predecessor, the new distribution exemption regime applies only to
distributions of an income nature and not to those of a capital nature.
Instead, those of a capital nature fall within the legislation that
taxes the capital gains of companies.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000170">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Following the
introduction of the 2009 rules, HMRC and tax specialists in the legal
and accountancy professions looked closely at the question of which
distributions qualify for exemption and which do not. HMRC took legal
advice and concluded that, in certain circumstances that are relatively
common within groups of companies, amounts that had historically been
considered as income distributions that qualified for exemption may, in
fact, constitute repayments of capital. Those amounts cannot qualify
for the distribution exemption.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000171">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
those points came to light only after the introduction of the 2009
distribution exemption legislation, they were equally relevant to the
UK distribution exemption before 2009. Therefore, HMRC concluded that
unexpected tax liabilities have potentially arisen in respect of
transactions undertaken both before and after the introduction of the
new exemption rules in 2009. That view gave rise to considerable
concern, because it affected the tax treatment of certain types of
transaction that are quite commonly carried out in corporate
reorganisations.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 9 and
schedule 3 simplify and expand the distribution exemption regime in two
ways. First, the exemption regime for UK and foreign distributions is
extended by removing the exclusion for distributions that are of a
capital nature. Secondly, the legislation ensures that certain amounts
that may be repayments of capital are instead brought into the scope of
the term “distribution” for corporation tax purposes.
That is in line with long-standing expectations about the status of
those transactions and it enables the amounts to qualify for the
exemption.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It has always
been the case that in certain situations distributions from the company
can be taken into account in calculating corporation tax liability on
chargeable gains, and that will remain the case. However, the changes
being made now will clarify which distributions are charged corporation
tax on chargeable gains and which distributions are exempt from
corporation tax, subject only to certain narrowly defined
anti-avoidance rules.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000174">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Following the
announcement of this measure at the June Budget, a significant number
of detailed and very helpful comments have been made about the draft
legislation. I want to thank all those who took the time to make those
comments, as they have led to a number of significant improvements. One
addition to the draft legislation is a small but significant extension
to the scope of one part of the distribution exemption rules to
accommodate distributions that are now brought within its scope. The
exemption that is currently given for all 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 58<a class="bkMark" name="Column58">&#160;</a>
                           </div>dividends that are not associated with tax avoidance
is now extended to any distribution, subject to the same tax avoidance
condition.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
change that was made following consultation was to restrict the scope
of those changes to corporation tax only. The problems that I have
described arose only in respect of corporation tax. There were some
concerns that the changes might adversely affect some income tax
payers, which had not been intended. Income tax payers will continue to
pay income tax on all distributions received with very few exceptions,
such as distributions received during the winding-up of a company and
repayments of share capital.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000176">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although the
provision fully addresses the anomaly concerning the scope of the
distribution exemption, some of the detailed comments received after
its publication have raised other important questions about wider
distributions legislation. I can inform the Committee that HMRC
officials have proposed a joint working group with representatives of
the tax profession. The group will aim to improve common understanding
of the legislation with a view to improving guidance. That will build
upon the constructive dialogue that has helped so much with the
development of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000177">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman raised a number of questions about how the clause will
work. First, there is the question of yield and whether the
changes will reduce the corporation tax take. The changes will not
reduce the take because they merely restore expectations for UK
companies. It has not been HMRC’s practice to charge tax on the
distributions to which the changes apply. The clause will, if one
likes, restore the status
quo.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman also asked why the measure was retrospective. Its
retrospective nature allows companies to take advantage of the benefits
of the new rules at any time. The legislation is almost always
beneficial, but the opt-out entitlement allows a company to elect for
any distribution made before 22 June 2010 to be unaffected by the
changes. The retrospective effect will not apply unless a company so
chooses—the election is made through the tax return—and
that merely preserves existing expectations. Large and unexpected
liabilities would arise without those reforms, and that would create
uncertainty within the tax system, which we do not want. If I may
anticipate the hon. Gentleman’s next question, we do not have an
estimate of the potential liabilities in aggregate but, none the less,
there is a concern that there might be an unexpected tax liability. The
clause seeks to prevent that from
happening.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000179">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provision will end the potentially damaging uncertainty that would have
arisen due to the risk of very large and wholly unexpected tax
liabilities. The changes make it clear that the potential liabilities
will not arise in future, and they also remove them
retrospectively.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000180">&#160;</a>

many members of the Committee, I received a brief this morning from the
Chartered Institute of Taxation highlighting its concern about the
application of the new rules for distribution in specie, not in cash.
The brief provides a number of examples that demonstrate how the Bill
is insufficiently clear. Unless the Minister wants me to bore him to

examples—<em>[</em>

there is no ‘transfer’ within the meaning of section

there will be a 'distribution out of assets' but in this case there
will also be a 'transfer'. In this case we assume that the legislation
can be applied on that basis that because the amount was declared as a
cash amount then it is regarded as a transfer of cash for the purpose

has asked about the scope of existing legislation dealing with company

detailed and, to be honest, beyond the scope of the debate on this

the CIOT’s questions, that HMRC is already discussing those

                           </strong> We have tabled an amendment to schedule
4, which relates to real estate investment trust arrangements,
particularly regarding the proposals to facilitate the payment of
dividends through stock issue. For the aid of the Committee, I should
set out that real estate investment trusts are tax-efficient mechanisms
through which investors in commercial or residential property can
conduct efficient business. They ensure that the property rental income
has tax paid on dividends but that the business does not need to pay
corporation tax or capital gains in certain circumstances, thus making
it easier for investments to be made in shares in firms holding
property assets. By and large, the retail estate investment trust
regime, which the Labour Administration were party to developing, has
been very beneficial.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There might
well be a variety of REITs that focus on specific areas such as office
space or retail outlets. Legislation stipulates that a real estate
investment trust must have three or more properties in its portfolio,
with each accounting for no more that 40% of the ring-fenced assets.
Obviously, that is to ensure that there is a basket of properties in a
genuine portfolio to ensure that there is a spread available for people
to invest in. Properties in REITs must not be owner-occupied.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A shareholder
in a listed British property company faces double tax. The company pays
corporation tax on its property-related business activities, while the
investor pays tax on dividends and capital gains. Real estate
investment trusts do not pay corporation tax on their ring-fenced
assets—profits arising from property-related activity, such as
earning rent—as long as at least 90% of their profits are
distributed to shareholders as dividends, which brings us to the point
of the clause. Taxpayers will pay more tax on dividends paid by a REIT
than they do on a dividend from a non-REIT share. Each such dividend
distribution is known as a property income distribution—PID. A
PID will be taxed as property letting income and paid after deduction
of tax. A basic rate taxpayer will pay 20%, so for every property
income distribution of 100p, they will receive 80p but, on the other
hand, a higher rate taxpayer will be taxed at 40% or, I presume, even
at 50%. The reliefs are therefore commensurate. Shareholders who do not
pay tax at all can reclaim the
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is expected, however, that due to the tax benefit to the company
itself, dividend payments are typically higher, offsetting the higher
level of tax paid by the investor, so in the long and short circle of
life of a REIT, it is still comes out as a more efficient tax
arrangement. Will the Minister explain why the property income
distribution is set at 90% of profits and not lower than 90%, or at 95%
or 100%? I would like to know the logic behind that figure. Would a
lower distribution requirement incentivise reinvestment in the quality,
fabric and maintenance of the property stock?

that the previous Administration put in place. I might well consult my

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have another question that might be even more academic in some
respects: to what extent does the Minister assess that the REIT
arrangements have affected property price inflation more generally in
our economy, given that commentators have voiced concern more generally
about the role that property plays in our economy? Obviously, a lot of
inflation took place before the REIT regime was in place. However, what
part has the regime played, particularly given that commercial property
and its direct purchase is hugely expensive and complicated? Has
opening an opportunity for investors to take a stake in areas of
property that were hitherto inaccessible fuelled some of the price
inflation?<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000201">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Property
is not a liquid investment on many occasions, but buying REIT shares
rather than actual properties can give the investor greater flexibility
to move in and out of the asset class—that is generally to be
welcomed—just like trading a share online or via a broker. Does
that extra liquidity create a multiplying or magnifying effect on
prices? What analysis has the Treasury made of that when considering
the thorny issue of particular asset class inflations and, as some have
said, a possible historical property bubble? I do not wish to comment
one way or the other on whether that is the case, but I hope that the
Treasury can analyse the effect of the tax rules on the market in
general. I will be grateful if the Minister can answer my
points.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000202">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
10 loosens the requirements for real estate investment trusts by
allowing amended distribution rules. At the moment, REITs are required
to distribute 90% of their profits from their tax-exempt
property business each year in cash. REITs were set up in about 2004
under the last Government when this issue was first identified in order
to offer different treatments for people who wanted to put investment
into property between those who did so via a company and those doing so
directly. At the time of their establishment, there were several facets
to desired outcome. First, it was about 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 62<a class="bkMark" name="Column62">&#160;</a>
                           </div>creating liquidity. Secondly, it was about improving
investor access. There was a sense that we needed to bring money into
the housing industry to create more housing, improve economic stability
and so help to stabilise the property investment market by rebalancing
some debt with equity among property companies. There was also the
desire to create more efficiency in terms of the tax issues that have
been discussed. It was also hoped that REITs would improve the housing
market by creating a better chance of fostering enhanced professional
management of the private rented sector. In fact, those tax rules were
largely successful because by the time of their introduction in around
2007, an awful lot of rental property management companies went under
the REIT tax
status.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000205">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
question then was to what extent we could improve the REIT status to
make it more flexible for companies. At present, unlike other
companies, as the hon. Gentleman said, REITs can only distribute
dividends in the form of cash dividends. So clause 10 effectively gives
them the flexibility in making distributions from their tax-exempt
property rental business and, in particular, in meeting their profit
distribution requirement. So it will help them to preserve capital,
which is important for all companies, including REITs, in the current
economic climate, given that we regularly discuss in the House how
difficult it is for businesses to access new capital. The Government
are also satisfied that this will not affect investors because they can
still choose to receive their dividend in cash if that is what they
want.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the hon. Gentleman will be aware, we put a draft Finance Bill out for
consultation and following representations from organisations such as
the British Property Federation, which overwhelmingly welcomed these
changes to give REITs more flexibility—in itself
welcome—we decided to loosen the use of stock dividends by
REITs. So, rather than allowing them to issue a proportion of stock
dividends instead of cash dividends, it seemed far simpler for REITs in
terms of both flexibility and bureaucracy to allow them to distribute
all their dividends as stock rather than cash dividends. As I said,
ultimately that will be an option for shareholders. If they wish to
continue getting cash dividends, they can do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
answer the hon. Gentleman’s question about the distribution
rate, it was set at 90% to ensure that there was no revenue cost to the
Exchequer: although we were facilitating more investment into the
property sector, which is needed if the numbers of houses that we all
want are to be built, it would not be at a cost to the Exchequer. If we
lowered that rate, it would potentially have an impact on the
Exchequer, but as I am sure the hon. Gentleman remembers from his time
in government, the property industry will clearly continue to make its
representations about how it sees REITs being further developed in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman’s final question about the impact of the tax
status of REITs and how that has affected the property market is
interesting. REITs were established as a means of facilitating more
investment with the aim of incentivising more house building of
properties for the rental sector. I do not have the analysis in front
of me today, but I should have thought that, if anything, the tax
change would have had more of a downward than an upward pressure on
property. Ultimately it is difficult to assess a particular change to
tax in a particular part of the property market that clearly includes
other 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 63<a class="bkMark" name="Column63">&#160;</a>
                           </div>stakeholders such as the construction industry. Then there are
demographic changes, regional pressures and the broader economic
climate to take into account. It is quite difficult to give an answer
one way or the other.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Certainly,
the extent to which this legislation facilitates more investment in
property opens up the investment that we need to get more homes built
for people. One of the main reasons that property prices have an innate
upward push is this gap between demand and supply. Hopefully, this
measure will ensure that we get investment coming into the sector so
that we can minimise the risk of the gap growing, which is something
that Members on both sides of the House are concerned about. I hope
that I have answered the hon. Gentleman’s
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000210">&#160;</a>

Broadly, I agree with many of her points, and it is helpful to have
that clarification. Other changes affecting the property market include
slashing the social housing budget in half, which I gather she and her

to help with the supply of housing stock across the country, but I
suspect that that is a debate for another day.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000211">&#160;</a>

meat of the matter within schedule 4 is specifically related to the
whole point of the changes. Currently, the REIT arrangements take the
yield of tax on the cash dividend of payment, and yet the change in the
clause seeks to allow companies to make that dividend payment in stock.
My questions for the Minister are pretty obvious. Will she tell the
Committee what the current tax yield is from the cash dividend taxation
regime on REITs? Perhaps she could give us the figures for the last
available financial year. Will she give us a sense of what we are
talking about here? As I understand it, allowing stock dividend
arrangements means that the tax on those changes will only be
crystallised at the point at which the stock is then sold or disposed
of. Under the current arrangements, there is a revenue yield to the
Exchequer at the point at which the dividend is distributed, which is
not the case under the stock dividend route.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000215">&#160;</a>

this particular change for the Exchequer. Moreover, an estimate of the
volume that is likely to be created by the stock dividend route would
be useful. I hope that officials will not be recommending the
introduction of such a change without having some idea of where the
industry might go. I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify
those points.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000216">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me specifically address amendment
6. The presumption behind it is that the tax treatment of stock
dividends will be different from that of cash dividends. That is not
correct. Stock dividends will be treated in exactly the same way as the
cash distributions, so there will be no loss to the Exchequer. In other
words, the amendment proposing a report that charts the plus or minus
for revenue is unnecessary because the change will have no revenue
impact; it simply gives REITs more flexibility on how they make their
distribution within their existing distribution
requirement.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With
regard to the baseline and the report that the hon. Gentleman wants to
see showing the amount either way, that information is not available
because there is such a wide range of investors involved that they
would not specifically identify their PID income in a way that would
allow us to collect the information centrally. We know that REITs have
become the main tax vehicle for many of the companies involved in that
area, so we can see the overall activity within the sector through
REITs, but specific investor-level tax revenue implications are less
clear. The answer to his underlying question about the difference to
the Exchequer is that there is no
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000218">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My understanding was that although the yield for
the Exchequer would be the same in the long run, in the short run it
depends very much on the point at which the stocks are disposed of.
Only at that point will the tax be paid and the yield gained for the
Exchequer. Given that we are in a spending review period in which every
single year of revenue yield matters for the profiling of public
expenditure, it seems important to ascertain whether there will be a
deferral of revenue, with money not coming into the Treasury as quickly
as it would do in a cash dividend circumstance. I would be surprised
if, as the Minister says, no stock dividend is paid at the point of
issuing. That was not my understanding at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000219">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I reiterate that there will be
no Exchequer loss or gain as a result of clause 10 or
schedule 4. There will not be that temporal issue with revenues that
the hon. Gentleman suggests there might be. There will be no deferral
of tax, which is why there is no difference. I hope that that has
answered his question—<em>[</em>

                           </strong> I am interested to hear the Minister’s
points, because although I of course accept that there will be no loss
of yield in the long run, I am not sure that her response is sufficient
to answer the point I was trying to make about the annual, year-by-year
profiling of the revenues and why, if tax will be deferred until the
point at which the stock is disposed, that will not affect yield. It
might be because of the gaping hole in HMRC’s knowledge about
the total yield, which hopefully she will join me in saying is
unacceptable. To have no idea about what the cash dividend yield is for
the Treasury really is not up to snuff, and I hope that her Department
will tighten its awareness of what the yield is from that area. That
might be why there is a lack of
information.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000221">&#160;</a>

productive. I can be very clear with him; he is labouring under the
misunderstanding that we will treat stock dividends differently from
cash dividends, but we will not. The tax on them will not be deferred,
as he has in his mind, so I can correct him on that. Hopefully he can
understand, as a result, that because tax will be paid on the issue of
the stock dividends, just as it is treated as a cash dividend, there
will be no revenue difference. I hope that that provides him with the
final reassurance that he needs.<a class="bkMark" name="10101953000222">&#160;</a>

should return to the issue after I have had chance to consult some

estimate of what is happening in terms of revenue yields. However, the
