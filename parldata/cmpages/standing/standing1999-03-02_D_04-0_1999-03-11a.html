<P>
Amendment moved [9 March]: No. 6, in page 2, line 20, at the end to add the words   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(10) The ninth condition is that the employer shall annually  provide to each member of the scheme, or shall procure that the  manager or trustees of the scheme shall provide, a report setting  out   
<P>
(a) the total sums paid into the scheme for the member's  account,  
<P>
(b) the total sums deducted from the scheme for any purpose,  
<P>
(c) the current value of the sums held for the member's  account, and

<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this  we are taking amendment No. 10, in page 2, line 20, at  end add   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(10) The ninth condition is that the scheme shall provide to  somebody who applies to join the scheme full and accurate advice  as to how a stakeholder pension would benefit the applicant  compared with other types of pension and shall tell the applicant  that they have up to 28 days to cancel the application without cost  or penalty; and an applicant to a stakeholder pension scheme shall  have up to 28 days from receiving the said advice to cancel the  application without cost or penalty.'. <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): It  works out rather well, Mr. McWilliam, that, as a result of  your wisdom, you called amendment No. 10 after  amendment No. 6   
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): On a point of order,  Mr. McWilliam, I find myself in need of your guidance  and experience. I was under the impression that the  amendment had been dealt with at our previous sitting on  9 March. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford  (Mr. Davies) said that he would not sit down between  discussion of amendments No. 6 and No. 10. Is it in order  for the proceedings of the Committee to be delayed in  this way?  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. First, the hon. Gentleman had  to sit down because I called time. Secondly, hon.  Members are allowed to speak as often as they wish in  Standing Committee. The procedure is not the same as on  Second Reading or in the Chamber.  
<P>
<B>  Mr. Davies:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I had  intended our discussion of these two amendments to be  shorter than it has been, but I could not have anticipated  the sensational revelations that we would extract from the  Government in our debate on amendment No. 6.  Stakeholder pensions were trumpeted around the land by  the new Labour publicity machine as unambiguously good  news for everyone without access to an occupational  pension scheme and it was left to the Committee to  discover that that is far from the truth. The Government  thought that stakeholder pensions were suitable only for  people earning between £9,000 and £18,000 a year, but  they may not be suitable even for them. I shall have more  to say on that.  
<P>
The Government now realise that the product is a  peculiar, specialised and mis-shapen product a strange  sort of chicken with three wings.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The wings are interesting, but  have nothing to do with the amendment.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The amendment refers to the need for  people to obtain advice, which is my thesis. That need has  been made more acute by the complexity   
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is about  to do the same again and he must desist. The amendment  refers to advice and that is all. We must discuss advice,  the need for it, who should give it and why, and leave the  other extraneous matters alone.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Indeed, Mr. McWilliam, but I hope that I  shall be able to persuade you that the need for advice is a  direct function of the complexity of the choices with  which the consumer is faced. I hope also that I shall be  able to persuade you and the Committee that the  complexities of the choices with which the consumer is  faced have been unreasonably and irresponsibly increased  by the way in which the Government have introduced the  stakeholder pension proposal. The risks of mis-selling of  mis-buying, even if no-one in the private sector sets out  to deceive people on where their interests lie, have been  immeasurably enhanced by the unnecessary complexity  with which the Government have saddled the whole  pensions industry.     
<P>
A modest and sober conclusion to draw from what we  have learnt in our proceedings about the stakeholder  pension is that it is a mis-shapen animal. It has an  unnecessary obligation to be invested in a money  purchase scheme we have already argued that there is  no reason why it should be it has an unnecessary  commitment to trusts, which we have also argued is  unnecessary, and it has a special tax regime that  differentiates it from other pension products; we have also  argued that that is unnecessary. That is why it is an animal  with three unnecessary and cumbersome wings, which is  unlikely to be able to fly or even to walk. It is unlikely to  prove advantageous for many people in the £9,000 to  £18,000 band for whom the Department of Social Security  designed it. The Treasury has designed a different  product the LISA which adds to the complexity.  
<P>
We discovered on Tuesday, and it was a useful day's  work, that the Government no longer pretend, as they did  in the Green Paper I read out the relevant passages at   our last sitting and in their publicity exercise, that the  stakeholder pension is good for everybody. They now  admit that it is not likely to be any good for anybody  earning less than £9,000 or more than £18,500 a year. To  increase the complexity and uncertainty, the Minister then  said that it may be a suitable product for some people  earning over £18,500. How is someone to decide whether  he should be in a stakeholder scheme?  
<P>
It is a serious matter. The House has now, rightly, been  made aware of the scale of the cynical and irresponsible  mis-selling of some personal pensions, which took place  over a number of years. Most personal pensions were sold  to people for whom they were designed those who did  not have an occupational pension scheme, who moved  jobs frequently or from employment to self-employment,  or who wanted to reinvest the state earnings-related  pension scheme rebate and had a better deal than by  staying in the SERPS system. I think that hon. Members  will agree that those people have been well served by  the personal pension system. But some people, who were  persuaded to come out of final salary and, later,  occupational pension schemes could have found  themselves devastated. They have now been compensated  and matters put right, but they have gone through a great  deal of anxiety. Against that background, the Committee  should ensure that an even worse outbreak of mis-selling  or mis-buying does not occur, with people making the  wrong decisions. Because of the great complexity, people  will need advice.  
<P>
To make the point clear, I shall set out the range of  choices that people have. The Minister can tell me if I  have it wrong, but I fear that he will not be able to do so,  from the way in which he has conceived and introduced  the Bill.     
<P>
People will now have a choice between a salary-related  occupational scheme, of which we all know the merits,  and one of the Government's state second pensions, the  details of which are set out in this paper. For those on  £8,000 or £9,000 a year it will be a difficult choice. They  will have the opportunity to join an occupational scheme.  Should they instead opt for the Government's state second  pension? The right answer may depend on the person's  age, on whether he expects to earn £9,000 or less for long,  and on whether he expects promotion, in which case he  will almost certainly want to join an occupational scheme.  People on around £9,000 will have to address that issue,  and they cannot be expected to pay for the advice that  they will need.  
<P>
Those in money purchase occupational schemes will  have to make an equivalent decision whether to join the  state second pension and at what level of earnings. That  will again be a function of many factors, including the  level of employer contributions. The calculations are  complicated, and will have to take account of the person's  age and prospects, what he can negotiate in the market,  and so forth.  
<P>
The Bill then raises the fundamental issue of whether  people will be drawn out of an existing occupational  scheme into one of the new stakeholder pensions. The  introduction of the stakeholder scheme may be a  convenient alibi for employers who want to end the   substantial liabilities involved in running a salary-related  occupational pension scheme. They may be inclined with  the Government's blessing under the incentive structure,  to take advantage of that alibi to push employees out of  occupational pension schemes and into the new  stakeholder scheme, which is a less attractive option for  employees. Many people in the industry share the concern  that the stakeholder will be either an instrument or an alibi  to induce employees to leave an occupational pension  scheme and join a stakeholder, or for employers to wind  up an occupational pension scheme for new employees  and replace it with a less good stakeholder pension.  
<P>
Individuals will have to decide where they stand and  how their rights can be best protected. They will need  complicated actuarial and possibly accountancy and  tax advice, but that does not come cheap. The extremely  able people in those professions are not the poorest-paid  members of society nor should they be, given their  expertise and the important decisions that they take. How  will people on modest incomes have access to that advice?  We are talking not about movie or football stars or  lawyers, but about people on average and less than  average incomes. Even people who earn considerably  more than the average income will find it difficult to pay  for that advice without seriously reducing the value of the  savings that they may make.     
<P>
There is a threshold I am certain that the Government  increase it each week below which it does not make  sense to save. A crucial consideration is whether people  should be in a stakeholder scheme or a state second  pension, because that decision affects the £9,000  threshold. Is it right, as the Minister implied, for someone  who earns up to £9,000 to stay in the state  earnings-related pension scheme or the state second  pension but to move into a stakeholder scheme when he  earns £9,001? A person who earns significantly less than  £9,000 will get the benefit of the credits for the state  second pension as if he were earning £9,000. At first  sight, that looks like a good deal, but when we discuss  clause 6 I will demonstrate that the state second pension  is not a good deal for almost anyone.  
<P>
Let us suppose for the sake of argument that the state  second pension is a good idea for some people, in which  case, a fortiori, it is a better idea for people depending on  the extent to which they earn less than £9,000 a year. Is  that amount the cut-off point, after which they join the  stakeholder scheme? I do not believe that that is the case.  
<P>
Now that the Government have confessed that the  stakeholder pension is designed to target people who earn  between £9,000 and £18,500 a year, let me read an  extraordinary line from the Green Paper. The Committee  will be forgiven for thinking that it relates to ta  stakeholder pension because it appears to confirm the  Minister's contention that rational people who earn  between £9,000 and £18,500 will be in a stakeholder  scheme and not a state second pension. Paragraph 16 of  page 42 states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Our new State Second Pension"	   
<P>
that is what this is about   
<P>
"will ensure that no one receives less under the new system than  they do now. All those people earning up to £18,500 a year will  gain."	   
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
Those people will gain from the state second pension.  They appear to have a choice. Will they be in the state  second pension or a stakeholder pension, or can they be  in both?     
<P>
Page 19 of the Library's useful research paper, 99/19,  states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Those who can afford it will be allowed to contribute to a  stakeholder pension, even during periods when they are out of work  or in the State Second Pension."	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
That implies that people should contribute to both. People  will therefore need to know the extent to which they can  contribute to both, and whether it is sensible to do so  rather than to contract out of the state second pension and  put all rebates and contributions into a stakeholder  pension.  
<P>
<H5>10.15 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
The question of who will advise those people is a  serious matter. Will the Government help them with that  decision? Will the Minister take responsibility for sorting  out people's affairs by, for example, setting up a  telephone advice bureau? Will he, in addition to holding  constituency surgeries, hold surgeries in the Department  of Social Security, so that people can ask him perhaps  even more forcefully than I have, although I have not got  many answers about the Bill's significance to them?  
<P>
People will also have to choose between a stakeholder  pension and a personal pension. It has been stated that a  stakeholder pension will be cheaper than a personal  pension, but the Minister is clearly not comfortable with  that statement because, in our earlier discussion on costs,  he did not say what provisions the Government will make  in respect of the cost of stakeholder pensions.  
<P>
I put it to him that it is mathematically impossible for  stakeholder pension always to represent a better deal. The  provisions on costs are vague, but it is clear that, to  qualify for a stakeholder pension, costs must be based on  a proportion of the moneys paid into the accumulated  fund, rather than on a lump sum. People beyond a certain  threshold may be able to get a deal on a fixed-cost basis  from a personal pension provider. The cost to the industry  will be comparable, or more expensive, than a stakeholder  pension. By definition, beyond a certain break-even point,  people will find personal pensions cheaper.  
<P>
People who paid front-end costs for the setting up of  an individual personal pension may have struck a good  deal on the basis that contributions would be made over  a long period. However, if they unwind the personal  pension and take out a stakeholder pension they will lose  that sunk cost and incur associated costs, which the  Government will not reveal. How will those people reach  a decision without advice?  
<P>
If people cannot get advice, they will be in a state of  complete paralysis. They will be unable to take a decision,  extremely worried about their money and completely  confused by the unnecessary complexity. The questions  that I have asked will be in the minds of such people and  their advisers, and quite rightly they will be put off by  the Government's evident reluctance to answer them.  
<P>
In such circumstances, people will say, "Well, perhaps  it is better not to bother to save. After all, we can fall  back on the Government's enhanced means-tested   benefits system."	 The perverse effect of that, which the  Government have never denied, has been discussed many  times. Alternatively, people will decide to spend their  money now. They will take the view that there is no point  saving because the associated risks and uncertainties have  been enhanced by the difficulty of taking decisions and  the impossibility of getting advice for a reasonable sum.  I am not suggesting that it is impossible to get sound  professional advice on those matters. However, the  complex advice that such decisions will require is beyond  the reach of ordinary mortals.     
<P>
There is a further area that Government have greatly  complicated: people will have to choose between the  stakeholder scheme and the LISA. I have been asking  questions all along about the LISA. I have been asking  how the LISA compares with the stakeholder scheme, but  I cannot get any answers. If I cannot get an answer, with  all the privilege of being a Member of Parliament and a  member of this Standing Committee, where the Minister  is forced to sit and listen to what I have to say, what  chance does the ordinary citizen have of getting any  answers? The Minister is not statutorily obliged to receive  each citizen, and I am certain that he will not do so.  
<P>
That was my point in asking the Minister whether he  intends to set up his own advice sessions, which of course  he does not. He may think that that is a joke, but it is not  a joke for the individual citizen who will need advice on  these matters. If I cannot extract any answers from the  Government, how the blazes will anyone else?  
<P>
Even if we do get some answers, it will be difficult to  interpret their significance for each individual case  without professional advice. If we get some clear answers,  there is no doubt that professional advisers will feel  competent to help individuals to make choices but, at the  moment, they are probably not even able to do that. If  they can help, they will naturally need paying because if  they are good at their job, there will be a market rate  attached to their services. We must recognise, first, that  advice is necessary and, secondly, that it might be difficult  to obtain.  
<P>
The Government have unnecessarily muddied their own  pool by introducing, less than two months apart, two  completely unrelated proposals for the future of pensions.  I do not disguise the fact that, as far as one can understand  the proposals in their initial and somewhat inadequate  formulation, I believe that the LISA is probably a better  deal for far more people than the stakeholder pension. If  I were taking a business decision in my previous role in  the City, and had to decide whether to invest resources in  a LISA as opposed to a stakeholder pension, I would be  more inclined towards the LISA on the basis of what we  currently know about it. However, we do not know the  full facts and unless the Minister tells us, the confusion  will continue to reign and, with the confusion, the  prospect that people will make inadequately informed  and, therefore, erroneous decisions. That is very bad  because it means that people's life savings might be  seriously damaged as a result.  
<P>
Then we come to the issue of the stakeholder versus  the group personal pension. That is a vital issue for all  employers and employees who currently have group  personal pensions another matter that I raised in an  earlier context and one that clearly relates to the issue   of advice. All the group personal pension schemes that I  have ever heard of involve an employer contribution, so  they are good value to the employee. In addition, there  are administrative and cost advantages to having a  collective group personal pension, so they are good value.  However, we have also discovered another valuable  discovery during the course of our proceedings that  group personal pensions will not qualify as stakeholder  pensions, so people will have a choice to make. Is that a  reasonable conclusion?     
<P>
The poor individual will have to make that choice on  his or her own because the Government are providing no  advice. How will people decide whether to leave a group  personal pension scheme and join a stakeholder scheme?  Some employers might wind down their group personal  pension schemes as a result and say, "You no longer have  a choice. We are closing the group personal pension  scheme and, because of the Labour Government's  legislation, we are setting up a stakeholder scheme."	 The  Government are not telling employers that they must get  rid of group personal pensions, but they are saying that  they must set up a stakeholder scheme, and employers  will say, "It is not reasonable to do both; to hell with this  confounded Government"	 they will probably use  stronger language than that "we shall do what they  demand of us, and nothing else."	 Employers will take the  choice, so there will be no choice for individual members.  
<P>
Where employers take a more liberal and generous  view and decide to continue both systems, and not to wind  down the group pension in a fit of pique or annoyance, or  because it serves their interests I hope that employers  will behave in that way individuals will have a choice  and will need advice. Where will that advice come from,  and what assurance can the Government give that people  will make educated and sensible decisions without  receiving advice on such complex matters?  
<P>
We should also consider the important matter of the  personal pension versus the LISA. Those Committee  members who have outside earnings and who can afford  to keep a personal pension will face that choice. I must  declare an interest right away: although I have not reached  a final decision, I am more attracted to the LISA than to  the personal pension.  
<P>
I may be asked in a moment whether I have failed to  declare an interest in the Register of Members' Interests  and whether I am receiving money from the Treasury.  After all, I am saying such nice things about the LISA. In  case there are any doubts, I have neither sought or  received any money from the Treasury. I have no financial  relationship with the Treasury whatsoever. I should be  happy for the Select Committee on Standards and  Privileges, on which I used to serve, to investigate the  matter.  
<P>
I was being as dispassionate as I could be when I said,  in all sincerity, that although both of the Government's  two schemes needed further clarification, the LISA would  make a genuine and useful contribution to this country's  panoply of pension instruments. However, the stakeholder  scheme will add nothing other than unnecessary and  extremely damaging complexity and I deprecate it in  that respect.   
<P>
I have set out the way in which the Government's  proposals will confront individuals with eight different  choices. They will need to take careful and informed  decisions. People who do not have an actuarial or  accountancy background should not take such decisions  unadvised it would be extremely dangerous to do so. In  fact, people who do have that background should also be  careful. I have a financial background and I feel the need  to talk to people and to compare notes before taking such  decisions. It is utterly irresponsible of the Government to  suggest that people should take such decisions without  advice, but, they have said nothing about the provision  of advice.     
<P>
The Government might say that they will pay for the  provision of such advice. That would be done at the  taxpayers' expense, but the advice would be for the benefit  of the generality of taxpayers who save for their pensions.  To some extent, the generality of taxpayers already  subsidise those who save that is the purpose of allowing  tax credits to be used in relation to pensions, of which I  thoroughly approve. I should not be shocked if the  Government took that approach. If the Government answer  my question by saying that that is how they intend to  resolve the matter, that will be fine. If they say that  employers should provide such advice, they should at least  come clean about their approach.  
<P>
When we come to a later amendment, we shall discuss  the burdens that the Government impose on employers. In  the course of less than two years, pretty devastating  burdens have already been imposed. If the Government  are going to give employers the responsibility for  providing advice, they should at least be honest about  their approach. The Bill has been written in such a way  that the Government could enact any regulation that they  wanted to. The fact that the Bill contains an open-ended  right to make regulations means that if the Government  wanted to, they could produce a regulation stating that the  moon was made of blue cheese.  
<P>
We all know that whenever the Minister gets into an  awkward jam in such debates, he says, "It wasn't that I  hadn't thought of that problem, or noticed that the Bill  was a complete nonsense. But don't worry. I'll sort out  the problem in regulations."	 When one asks, "When?"	 he  replies, "I don't know."	 When one asks, "And what will  the regulations say?"	 he replies, "Oh, I don't know. I  haven't decided yet."	 In that context, the Minister may  reply, "The proposal will be another burden on  employers."	 Well, let us find out this morning, here and  now, whether that is the hon. Gentleman's approach.  However, if it is, I warn him that we shall have something  to say about it.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): Under the Budget's  provisions, will the Small Business Bureau give advice to  small businesses about how to deal with the new  stakeholder pension?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend is right. However,  the Government might set up a new quango to provide  such advice. They may trail around to find some  Conservatives to put on it, in an attempt to buy them off.  That is another well-known ploy that the new Labour   Government use. We may hear all sorts of interesting  things in our debate, which will make us a good deal  wiser      
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman  will address issues that arise from the amendment.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> You cut me off in the middle of a  sentence. Mr. McWilliam; I assure you that the second  half would have done so. Whatever we learn this morning,  I hope that it is germane and useful to those in this country  who are planning their own pensions. Not much has been  said on that subject, even though it is extremely important.  
<P>
If there is to be advice, only three possibilities exist for  who will pay for it: the taxpayer, the employer or the  employee, who could be designated also as the pension  member, the investor or the consumer. If the consumer is  to be responsible for obtaining advice according to the  principle of caveat emptor. the Government will be  unwinding the system set up in this country in the 1980s  and 1990s, which will be devastating.  
<P>
<H5>10.30 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not always describe the work of the Conservative  Governments of that period as perfect as you know,  Mr. McWilliam but the Financial Services Act 1986  was an enormous step forward in providing consumer  protection in an important area. It is not sensible in such  matters medicine is another example to say, "Let the  consumer have his or her own choice"	. That is why we  have a system in which a person who has a headache  goes to a general practitioner, rather than straight to a  brain surgeon to ask for an operation. Equally, nobody  would take a complex pyschothropic drug that had not  been prescribed by a medically qualified person. People  who lack the relevant professional background cannot  make an educated decision on such matters that is  especially important in medicine because it is a matter  of human life or death.  
<P>
Financial services are not a matter of human life or  death, and property is not remotely comparable in  importance to human life or death I would not dream of  suggesting that it was. Nevertheless, if there is a  possibility of an individual's property or savings being  wiped out by fraud, malversation or incompetent  decisions, it is in the interests of the whole of society  and it is Parliament's responsibility to ensure, as far as  possible, that that does not occur.  
<P>
It is therefore right that a proper framework of  consumer protection should exist in financial services.  The extent to which people can be encouraged or  allowed to make decisions or have decisions made for  them, without proper consideration of their interests by  professionals, should be governed by proper principles. If  the Minister simply says that no provision will be made  for advice, that will be against the principles already  existing in the financial services system. Under the  Financial Services Act 1986 and regulations introduced  by the self-regulatory organisations as they then were  during the previous two Parliaments, independent  financial advisers must take account of their client's  individual position, know their client's interests, avoid   conflicts of interest and be properly trained. Mistakes are  always made when a new system is introduced, but its  structure is now recognised as a major advance. It has  been copied elsewhere in the European Union, and  authorities in many other parts of the globe have  recognised that our system might offer some real lessons.  It is fair to say that we have a s sophisticated financial  services industry.     
<P>
It will not be acceptable for the Minister to say that  there will be no provision for advice. The results of  that will be terrifying. The people who are most likely  to be disadvantaged will be those for whom every  pound is precious. Those people will be nearer to the  bottom than the top of the income scale in general. It  is defensible to say that a positive correlation not an  absolute relationship exists between financial  sophistication and income. The less well-off will  therefore be most vulnerable and will be least able to  dream of obtaining independent advice. People earning  hundreds of thousands of pounds a year will be  financially sophisticated themselves, or will have easy  access to actuaries through their accountants or lawyers,  all of whom will be delighted to lay on all the necessary  advice. That is not good enough because Parliament  does not legislate for 5 per cent. of the population but  for 100 per cent., I hope. In this case, we are legislating  for all savers. I thought that it was common ground  between us that we want the number of people in whose  interests it is to save to increase steadily it is certainly  the position of the Conservative party. We also want  them to be able to save as easily and simply as possible.  
<P>
The Government have produced the exact opposite.  So that the Committee can savour the irony I had  better not say hypocrisy as you might rule me out of  order, Mr. McWilliam of what the Government dared  to say in the Green Paper, I will read from paragraph  48 of chapter seven. It contains a shameful statement  in the light of what they have subsequently done. You will not believe what I am about to read, Mr. McWilliam. It is amazing, so I suggest that you  read the statement to reassure yourself that I am not  inventing the words. They are simply astonishing.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I just want to know that I will  not hear words that the hon. Gentleman has already read  out.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> You will not, Mr. McWilliam. The  Committee ought to focus on the stark contrast between  the Government's words and the reality as I have  described it.  
<P>
On Page 56 of the Green Paper, paragraph 48 states:     
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We intend to reduce, as far as possible, the need for individuals  to seek financial advice when they consider joining a stakeholder  pension scheme."	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
I emphasise those words because the Government have  produced such confusion. In at least eight different  situations, hundreds of thousands, and in some cases  millions, of people will face new choices, Unless my  remarks draw a response from the Minister, which I  profoundly hope that they will, there will be complete and  utter confusion. People will receive no guidance and there  will be no provision for them to seek the professional   advice that they need and deserve. If they do not receive  such advice, the Bill will inaugurate the most appalling  shambles and a harvest of mis-selling or mis-buying in  the pensions industry that even the most pessimistic  people who have followed the industry in the past few  years could not have imagined in their nightmares.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): The amendments  are interesting because, as my hon. Friend explained, they  would ensure that people who are thinking of joining a  stakeholder pension would know exactly what had been  paid into the scheme on their behalf and their employers  would have to give them a full statement.  
<P>
When I was examining the amendments earlier this  week, it occurred to me that the Minister might say that  they were unnecessary because most stakeholder schemes  would be conducted under trust law. There is already a  full law on trusts so, for the benefit of the Committee, I  have done some research on it and will deal with it in  a moment.  
<P>
Clause 1(2) states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The scheme is established under a trust or in such other way as  may be prescribed."	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
Although the Minister may say that trust law dealing with  the protection of beneficiaries of a pension scheme, is  already well established it is not yet clear whether all the  schemes will be conducted under trust law or in some  other way as may be prescribed. The Bill will give the  Government the right to determine that.  
<P>
I obtained information on existing trust law, as I  thought that the Committee would find it interesting to  know about the general duties of employers and trustees.  I hope that the Minister will listen carefully because the  duties of trustees do not cover what is described in the  amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for  Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies). Obviously, the  schemes will be properly conducted under trust law, but  even if they are, we should take account of the interesting  information that my hon. Friend hopes will be relayed to  members under the schemes. However, no duty is placed  on trustees to ensure that such information is conveyed  to members.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point about  trust law. Does he agree that the responsibilities of  trustees of a scheme extend only to the management of  that scheme on behalf of its beneficiaries? Under no  circumstances will they, or could they, under trust law,  pretend to give advice on the relative merits of schemes.  Advice is required on the essential choice of which  scheme someone should become or remain a member of,  but that is not provided for under the Government's  proposals.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is a good point. Someone on a  relatively modest salary, who may not be experienced in  such matters they are complex wants to know one  thing first: that is, not whether a scheme is well run or  whether information is available, but what the relative  advantages of different schemes are.   
<P>
I have glanced through the Bill and I hope that you will  forgive me, Mr. McWilliam, for having glanced also at  the clauses to come. I can see nothing to force an  employer to provide his employees with information on  the relative advantages of different schemes. I know that  you do not want the Committee to deal with clause 3 yet,  so I shall say this quickly. Under clause 3(3), an employer  has only to provide  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the name and address of the designated scheme and such other  information as may be prescribed."	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
However, we do not know yet what that information will  be, although the Minister might enlighten us. As we go  through the Bill, more and more information might be  made available to the Committee and to likely  beneficiaries.     
<P>
What duties are imposed on trustees under present trust  law, which has been developed by cases, especially  Re-Londonderry in 1965? There is a well-developed  corpus of trust law that deals with those matters, but there  is still nothing that deals with the specific financial  information sought by my hon. Friend the Member for  Grantham and Stamford through his amendment.  
<P>
I can sum up the first point made in any book on such  matters by quoting from one:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"How schemes communicate with members and potential  members can have a very real effect on the number of employees  who decide to join. Unless employees are aware of the real value of  the benefits on offer, and what they are giving up by not joining,  many will decline membership."	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
That is an obvious point. In this area, as in all others,  communication is vital.  
<P>
What information must be provided? The first duty of  the trustee concerns the information that the beneficiary  is entitled to know and the documents in respect of which  the beneficiaries have proprietary interest. I may be  wrong I do not claim to be a trust lawyer but it seems  that there is no general duty to ensure that those  documents are made available to members without their  requesting them. I suppose that is because members might  otherwise be flooded with information that they could not  hope to understand. All that trustees must do is ensure  that they have that information so that beneficiaries can  apply for it. A wide degree of discretion seems to be  available to trustees. Their primary duty is to run a  scheme in a proper legal way. Keeping people informed  is only a secondary duty.  
<P>
It is relevant to amendment No. 10 to consider the basic  scheme information. Under existing law, trustees are  required to make basic scheme information available  within two months of a person joining a scheme.  Members should be informed whether the scheme has  been approved by the Inland Revenue and, if not, whether  an application for approval has been made. Again, the  general information that will be made available to  members will not be the sort of information that my hon.  Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford seeks to  make available through his amendment. The document  refers to information that should be made available to  early leavers. It states that they must be informed of  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"what arrangements are made...to...obtain refunds of  contributions."	   
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
Another requirement is  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a statement as to whether, and the circumstances in which, the  trustees will accept a cash equivalent and provide transfer credits."	  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That information is general, but the sort of information  that can be provided this may be where existing trust  law comes closer to my hon. Friend's amendments  includes, for example, how normal contributions and  employers' contributions are calculated. I am open to  correction, but I understand that you do not have to  provide the information; it must be requested.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Obviously, I do not have to  provide the information any more. It is 20 years since I  was chairman of a pension fund.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I apologise, Mr. McWilliam. The  information must be applied for, but not through you, me  or any other member of the Committee. If we were to try  to provide such information, I suspect that we might  produce a major disaster.  
<P>
Disclosure requirements also exist for example, under  the Salvation Army Act 1963 for unapproved schemes,  but I shall not weary the Committee with those.  
<P>
In many cases, information to individuals must be  supplied only on request, but to avoid having to deal with  a large number of requests arriving periodically, many  trustees have chosen to issue annual benefit statements.  That is interesting and I wonder what ideas the Minister  has for stakeholder pensions. Presumably, there will be an  annual benefit statement containing as many of those  matters as possible. My hon. Friend has done the  Committee a service with his amendment and I hope that  the Minister will tell the Committee that an annual  statement will be provided written not in legalese but in  layman's language stating clearly the total sums paid  into the scheme for the member's account, the total sums  deducted for any purpose, and the current value of the  sums held to the member's account. Such simple  information should be stated clearly.  
<P>
When someone retires, under existing trust law a  benefit statement must be provided and, presumably, the  Minister will tell us that such a statement must also be  provided under the stakeholder pension scheme. It would  be incredible if that did not happen, but we would like  confirmation from the Minister and it might be advisable  for the sake of completeness, if that were stated in the Bill  or regulations.  
<P>
The "Pensions in Practice"	 document states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any member of a defined benefit (final or average salary)  scheme who is currently in pensionable service, and who is below  normal pension age, or a deferred pensioner, must be given on  request, as soon as practicable and in any event within two months,  a benefit statement. This should include the amounts of his or her  own benefits and of the survivors' benefits which would be payable  from normal pension age or on death. Requests may be limited to  once a year."	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
I do not know whether members of stakeholder pension  schemes can require information more often. The  document continues:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In any case, the information must include: the date on which the  member's pensionable service began; the accrual rate or formula for  calculating the member's benefits...for deferred pensioners, the  amount of member's benefit payable from normal pension age  and...the amount of the member's pensionable remuneration"	.   
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
That document from the IDS Pension Service, sums up  trust law and the sort of information that must be made  available to pension scheme members under existing  trust law.  
<P>
I am particularly attracted to amendment No. 10  which states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The ninth condition is that the scheme shall provide to somebody  who applies to join the scheme full and accurate advice as to how a  stakeholder pension would benefit the applicant compared with other  types of pension.".    <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister should assure us today that regulations  will be introduced to ensure that someone thinking of  joining a stakeholder pension scheme will be given full  information, not just about the other schemes that are  available, but about their relative advantages compared to  stakeholder pensions. As they go through their service  with their company and remain in that stakeholder  pension scheme, they should be provided with regular  information, clearly setting out the advantages and  disadvantages, the accrual rates and how the scheme is  performing. If the Minister gives us that assurance, that  will be helpful to the general public.  
<P>
<B> The Minister of State, Department of Social Security  (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> The hon. Member for Grantham  and Stamford talked at some length about the danger of  mis-selling in the new framework. It would indeed be  disastrous if there were a repeat of the mis-selling debacle  that took place under the legislation introduced by the  previous Government. I commend the hon. Gentleman,  because he is the only Conservative Member on the  Committee who has owned up to the mis-selling disaster.  He spelt out in forthright terms, quite rightly, the scale of  that disaster. I commend his views to his hon. Friends,  who have been much more reticent on the subject.  Although I commend the hon. Gentleman's frankness on  that point, the Green Paper makes it clear that we shall  not allow another mis-selling scandal to unfold. That  would be a disaster, and it will not happen.  
<P>
I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman is gradually  working his way through the Green Paper.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> There will be more quotations  before I am finished.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am looking forward to them. The  quotations are always extremely good and edify the whole  Committee; it is a splendid document.  
<P>
We have made it clear that we shall work with the  Financial Services Authority on a regime for the  promotion of stakeholder pensions that will avoid a repeat  of the previous disaster. We are consulting the industry  on the details and we shall introduce regulations in due  course.  
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Will the Minister assure me that, when the  consultation with the FSA has finished, no taxpayers'  money will be spent on promoting stakeholder pensions,  and the promotion will be entirely in the hands of the  companies providing the pensions?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Yes, that is the case. The Government  have introduced a good programme of pension education  and awareness. Indeed, a recent series of newspaper   advertisements has drawn people's attention to the  importance of making provision for themselves. But the  Government will not promote any individual product; that  will be a matter for the providers.  
<P>
I always enjoy the points in the hon. Gentleman's  speeches when he reads out parts of the Green Paper. He  said he had done a good day's work on Tuesday in  revealing to the world that stakeholder pensions are aimed  at those earning between £9,000 and £18,500 a year. I am  glad that he feels it was a good day's work. He could  have got that far by reading to page 5 of the Green Paper  in the first place, but I do not want to be churlish about  his achievements, in which he clearly takes pride. He feels  that he has done his job well and I do not want to detract  from his sense of achievement.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We went over page 5 the other day, as  you will recall, Mr. McWilliam. The relevant text, which  is inconsistent with other proposals, says that  stakeholder pensions  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"are particularly designed to help those on middle incomes (between  roughly £9,000 and £18,500 a year) to start their own pension but  will benefit those on higher incomes too."	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
That is the source of the confusion. How are people on  higher incomes supposed to know whether they will  benefit? They will need advice. That goes to the heart of  the point that I have just put to the Minister on advice.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Anybody listening to the hon. Gentleman  would feel extremely confused about the position and that  they faced an impossibly complicated set of choices, and  they would be deterred from taking out a pension as a  result. The only moments of blinding clarity in the hon.  Gentleman's speeches are when he reads out sentences  from the Green Paper, which are crystal clear. I cannot  add to the clarity of what he just read to the Committee.  Again, I enjoyed hearing from him.     
<P>
We are not entering a world of impossible complexity  of the kind that the hon. Gentleman has attempted to  sketch out. For the majority of the 5 million or so who  will benefit hugely from the stakeholder pension  framework, the position is clear: either they have a funded  pension or they do not. That is the only choice that faces  them. The Bill provides a simple, straightforward  framework whereby people know that, if they take out a  stakeholder pension, they will get a fair deal. The choices  facing most people are as simple as that and are not of  the labyrinthine complexity that the hon. Gentleman has  tried to persuade the Committee.  
<P>
The consequence of what the hon. Gentleman was  saying must be that people must take financial advice  before they enter their company's occupational scheme.  Does he really believe that? Does he believe that, before  signing up to a pension provided by the employer, a  person should take financial advice in case another, better  option exists? No. The reality is that those choices can be,  although they are not always, simple and straightforward.  For those whom the stakeholder pensions are aimed at, the  decisions are straightforward: they will not need detailed,  face-to-face financial advice before they decide whether  to take out a stakeholder pension.     
<P>
<B>  Mr. Davies:</B> Anyone joining any pension scheme  should satisfy himself that it is in his interests. Some  occupational pension schemes involve the minimum  amount of employer contributions sometimes the same  employer contribution is available for a personal pension.  There are already many complexities, but the Government  have increased them by introducing the LISA and, in  particular, the stakeholder pension.  
<P>
May I suggest another complexity? Again, it arises  from page 42 of the Green Paper, which states, that all  those earning up to £18,500 will gain from the state  second pension. The Minister is saying that such people  will also gain from being in a stakeholder pension. What  are the public to make of that? On page 5, it says that  everyone earning up to £18,500 should take out a  stakeholder pension

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions are supposed to  be interventions. If the hon. Gentleman wants to speak  again, I shall call him.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> One can only conclude, as The Sun did  yesterday about the Budget, "Everyone's a winner"	.  
<P>
We are talking about 5 million people for whom an  occupational pension is not a possibility. The hon.  Gentleman asked, "What if an occupational pension is on  offer?"	 The answer is straightforward: if an occupational  pension is on offer, people should take it. The Green  Paper makes that clear. The Bill provides the possibility  of a funded pension for those for whom it has not been a  practical possibility in the past.  
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether people should be  in the state second pension or a stakeholder pension. If  people are earning less than £9,000 a year, they should  not contract out of the state second pension. If they are  earning more than that and up to about £18,500 a year,  they should contract out into a stakeholder pension. That  is simple: there is no complexity there.  
<P>
The state second pension will provide more help than  SERPS for those earning up to £18,500 a year, but that  help will also be reflected in the rebates to those who  choose to contract out. As now, the national insurance  rebates will reflect the actuarial value of the benefits given  up. As we are introducing minimum standards on charges,  the decision to contract out will be simpler.     
<P>
<H5>11 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
If people say in the state second pension when it is up  and running, they will be better off than they would have  been under SERPS. They will be better off on any salary  up to about £18,500 a year. Thereafter, they will get the  same benefit as they would have received under SERPS.  However, they will be even better off if they contract out  into a stakeholder pension and that is what we expect  people increasingly to do.  
<P>
Given the assurance that is provided in the system of  minimum standards contained in clause 1, and in the  absence of an occupational pension or another funded  scheme, the key point is that people will be able to reach  a simple and sensible decision about whether to join a  stakeholder scheme without taking detailed face-to-face  advice. It would be a disaster if everyone had to have a   lengthy session with a financial adviser before choosing  whether to go into a stakeholder scheme. The reality  would be as it is now that no one would join. We want  a simple mechanism so that the decision is clear and  straightforward.  
<P>
We are working with the industry and the FSA on a  decision tree approach to produce simple, printed material  that allows people to work through the choices so that  they make the right one. I discussed that last week with a  major financial services provider. It is the industry's idea  to have a simple decision tree approach, which will not  require great expense. The simplicity of the structure will  allow people to make a choice with the assurance that it  is a fair deal.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) raised  interesting points about information for scheme members  and the requirements of trust law. We are going to  regulate for an annual benefit statement. The requirements  will be set out in clause 1(6), which refers to the powers  that were introduced by the previous Government in the  Pension Schemes Act 1993 to specify the information that  schemes must provide to members. We will not be relying  on trust law.  
<P>
We are not proposing to require employers to provide  advice to their employees about stakeholder pension  schemes, but the schemes will be required to provide  relevant information to potential new members as well as  an annual benefit statement to scheme members.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> How does the Minister envisage employees  obtaining information that will help them to choose  between different stakeholder schemes, or between a  stakeholder scheme and an ordinary personal pension?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> For the people for whom we are designing  stakeholder schemes, it will be clear that the stakeholder  choice is the better one because of the level of charges on  personal pensions. People on higher incomes will have to  make more complicated choices and will continue to seek  financial advice. Given the set of standards that we are  introducing, many people will choose the stakeholder  scheme to which their employer gives them access.  
<P>
They will have an assurance that they will get a fair  deal in making that choice because minimum standards  are in place. If, for some reason, people want to choose  another product, they will be able to do so. It is wrong to  give the impression that, before joining a pension scheme,  one needs to take detailed financial advice. If you have an  occupational scheme, you join it. You are not required   
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam.  
<P>
I recall that when I chose to join my company's  occupational pension scheme, I was not told that I needed  first to consult a financial adviser. It was a straightforward  matter because it was clearly in my financial interest to  join the scheme. That will be the position with  stakeholder schemes.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> We are making a little progress  because I set out at least eight examples of situations in  which uncertainty exists or has been gratuitously created   by the Government, and in which advice would be  required. We now have on record the Minister's  clarification of two of those situations two very  important clarifications, which I believe will be quoted in  the information that will be made available by the industry  and employers to employees. It is important that those  assurances should be quoted. It is even more important  that the Government should ensure that they are valid.     
<P>
The first assurance was given unambiguously by the  Minister and has clarified the point. It was made seriously  and in good faith: that is, that it will always be better for  someone earning more than £9,000 a year to leave the  state second pension and join a stakeholder pension  scheme. That is an important statement, which removes  the need for advice because it removes any possible  uncertainty. My own calculations show that the trade-off  might come a little higher than £9,000, but the Minister  said that that is not the case. If the Government have got it  wrong, I hope that they will compensate people, as would  happen in the industry, if someone made such a categoric  statement and was wrong.  
<P>
The Minister's second point was that, in all cases,  occupational pension schemes are a better deal than  stakeholder schemes. He did not qualify that statement.  He did not say that only salary-related occupational  pensions or ones in which the employer provides a basic  minimum contribution are better. He said that all  occupational pensions are, by definition, better than  stakeholder schemes. One can put that statement the other  way round and it would have the same force; by  definition, all stakeholder schemes are worse than  occupational schemes. Again, that is an important  statement and one on which people will, and must, rely.  So, it would be churlish of me not to acknowledge that  we have made a little progress and I am grateful to the  Minister for those two unambiguous statements.  
<P>
The remaining six quandaries that I described earlier, in  which individuals may be in danger of making expensive  mistakes if they do not take careful and professional  advice, remain on the table. Indeed, the Minister rather  emphasised my point, although he did not mention the  LISA. Whenever I do so, the Minister pretends not to hear  because he does not want to know about the dreadful,  rival product introduced by the Treasury. So it is not  surprising that he ignored the various additional choices  raised by the introduction of the LISA.  
<P>
On the personal pension, the Minister said something  that was not stated in absolute terms, which is perhaps  fortunate for the taxpayer. It might have been a very  expensive assurance from the Government because I  suspect that it would have been wrong. However, the  Minister said that it would always be better to be in a  stakeholder scheme. He ignored the points that I put to  him. First, we do not know what the charges will be on  the stakeholder scheme. We have to take on trust his  statement that stakeholder pension charges will always be  lower than personal pension charges. I do not think that  that is right. The industry will set up new systems to  operate the stakeholder scheme, which will give them  economies of scale. They will be able to extend the same  charges most of which are fixed and which relate to   systems, marketing and management to the personal  pensions that they offer. Stakeholder pension charges may  not therefore always be lower.     
<P>
The Minister ignored my point about people who  currently have a personal pension for which the bulk of  the charges have been paid up front. The remaining  charges will therefore be modest compared with the  charges for stakeholder pension schemes, which will have  to recover the initial costs from the people who take them  out. Why should a person take out a stakeholder pension  and incur the initial setting-up costs of a new pension  product, when he already has a perfectly adequate  product? The fund may be managed as well as, or better  than, a stakeholder pension scheme. That is a glaring  example of the way in which advice will continue to be  needed.  
<P>
We have had a response to two out of eight of our  concerns. I am glad that the response rate was not nought  out of eight, but two responses is not good enough. We  really needed eight out of eight. Either the Government  should take on the responsibility for ensuring that people's  choices are informed or they should ensure that the need is  met from elsewhere. They have taken on that responsibility  in relation to two of our concerns, but there is still enormous  scope for mis-selling or mis-buying. I prefer the latter  phrase because it does not imply dishonest or  dishonourable conduct, except on the Government's part. It  simply suggests that a person took a rash or uninformed  choice because he did not have access to appropriate  advice.  
<P>
The Conservative party introduced the Financial  Services Act 1986 and a system to protect consumers in  the financial services sector, which is generally regarded  as setting a precedent globally. Like everything else, that  system has been and will continue to be fine-tuned in  the light of experience.  
<P>
In view of that tradition and the fact that the  Government failed to reassure us on six out of eight of  the points that I raised, we shall press the amendment to  a Division. We shall also do so because we want to leave  a clear imprint in the Government's mind that we are  concerned about this matter. With your consent, Mr. McWilliam, we also want a Division on amendment  No. 10, which was grouped with the amendment.

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 2, line 20, at end add   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(10) The ninth condition is that the trustees have power to vary  the terms of the trust requirement for annuities to be purchased.'.  <P>

<P>
The Minister may be relieved to know that the  amendment is a probing amendment. Should it be  accepted, I would look to him, if necessary, to correct any  technical defects in its wording.

<P>
In the light of the Government's description of  stakeholder pensions as products that will provide value  for money, the amendment would set a ninth condition  for stakeholder pension schemes. In the past few years,  inflation has been brought under control for various  reasons, including the decline in global inflationary  pressure, sensible Conservative policies and two years in  which the Government kept to our public expenditure  programmes. Even though the savings ratio is declining,  which is a significant worry, it is still sensible for people  to invest in savings. However, a knock-on effect of the  controlling of inflation has been a decline in the value of  income from annuities.  
<P>
Many constituents of Conservative Members have  expressed a worry about annuities which, in the past, have  represented good value. With the exception of an  amendment to the Pensions Act 1995, which provides that  those who wish to run a draw-down pension must  nevertheless purchase an annuity at the age of 75, all  relevant legislation insists that pension funds be invested  in annuities at the age of 60 or 65.  
<P>
That was sensible when interest rates and gilt yields  were high. However, in an era of high growth, low global  inflationary pressure indeed, we may see global  deflation will mean that pensioners' incomes that are   tied to annuities will remain low. I agree that their capital  value will be maintained and I am delighted that, at long  last, money will retain its value. Nevertheless, investors  are suffering from lower than anticipated incomes.  
<P>
Until recently, incomes in respect of annuities were  satisfactory, which is why annuities are the only  instrument used for pensioners' funds. As Opposition  Members have made clear, Britain has a City and financial  centre that is second to none, and which is capable of  developing new instruments to give pensioners a good  guaranteed return that may be better than an annuity. The  problem is that at the moment there is no way in which  those instruments can be developed. After the Budget, one  or two people expressed concern in the newspapers and  wanted more flexibility in pensions. It would be sensible  for the Government to take that on board.  
<P>
We have discovered from the Government that  stakeholder pensions are geared to people earning  between £9,000 and £18,000, so it is particularly  important that they receive the maximum return on their  investment and that it is not reduced by Government  actions. One of the problems for people at whom  stakeholder pensions are aimed is that, with the  combination of the minimum income guarantee and their  access to housing benefit and council tax relief, it will not  be sensible for them to provide for their old age. People  with such incomes would have to have stakeholder  pension funds of around £100,000 to make them worth  more than the benefits that they could claim. The  stakeholder pension is unattractive in comparison to  current benefits because of the minimum income  guarantee, housing benefit and council tax relief.  
<P>
To attract people to stakeholder pensions, the  Government must ensure a higher guaranteed income at  the end. They should consider ways of encouraging the  City to develop other instruments to provide pensioners  with a better return on their money than annuities provide.  Annuities of 8 per cent. and potentially 4 per cent., as  opposed to 12 per cent., are bad value compared with  what people can obtain by investing in equities     
<P>
In our 1995 Act, we introduced the option of the draw  down so that people could invest their own pension funds  until the age of 75. That applies generally to people with  good financial knowledge. Some of the people who  wanted to mange their own funds are doing so very  effectively and have gained in both capital and income.  However, at the age of 75 they must go into the annuity  market.  
<P>
We are discussing not only the stakeholder end of the  market, but the whole range of pension provision. The  annuity is no longer the good investment that it used to  be and no longer provides good value at the end of the  savings period. The purpose of tabling my amendment,  which I hope the Government will consider   
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Does my hon. Friend recall the social  security question asked by the hon. Member for  Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) about this matter?  There is increasing all-party consensus on the need to  examine annuities?  
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Unfortunately, I was unable to attend that  Question Time, but I read the exchange and the  Government did not seem to be open to new thinking on   the matter. One of the great strengths of the City is that it  is endlessly flexible. The eurobond market was developed  in the City, which is already the biggest trader in the euro.  If the Government give half an inch towards developing  more flexible instruments to give people a better  guaranteed income, given that for the foreseeable future  inflation will be low, and hence the return on gilts low,  the City will develop those instruments.  
<P>
The draw down up to the age of 75 is working in a  range of areas. I want people to be able to take advantage  of new instruments that we may not even have thought  of. the Bill opens a window of opportunity to develop  instruments that would give stakeholders, who in a sense  will decide between state pensions and savings, the return  on their money that most of us want to see, because  pensioners already feel limited by the income from their  annuities. Because of the Conservative Government's  sensible pensions and savings policy during their 18 years  in power, 72 per cent. of all pensioners now retire with  some form of pension. Therefore, an increasing number  of people have a problem with the income from their  annuities.  
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to give us a  glimmer of hope that thought will be given to amending  the requirement that annuities are the only instrument of  income for pensioners from any pension fund. I look  forward to hearing what he says and hope that he will be  able to show that the Government are open to new  thinking in this area.     
<P>

<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): My  hon. Friend Mrs. Lait referred to a territory dear to my  heart, which I have mentioned elsewhere. There are many  issues to cover. First, it is not clear whether stakeholder  pensions will be obliged, as is the intent, to purchase an  annuity on retirement or whether, if the rules are not  changed, they will have the option, as with certain  personal pensions, to delay buying in annuity until the age  of 75. Whatever the intent is, it should be clear.  
<P>
Mrs. Lait has raised the huge problem   
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I know that the hon. Gentleman  is a new Member, but he should refer to the hon. Lady as  the hon. Member for Beckenham.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. The hon.  member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) raised an interesting  issue, which I shall put more simply. If £100,000 had  accumulated in a pension scheme 15 years ago, it might  have bought a pension of £14,000 a year. today it will  buy a pension of only £7,000 a year.  
<P>
There is the further complication that if one were to  buy an inflation-linked pension with the capital, either in  the past or in the present, the difference would not be so  great, But people typically want to purchase the maximum  pension that they can with the capital available. There is a  risk at present that they will buy a much smaller pension,  because of the low rates of interest and inflation and the  increase in longevity, but over the next 10 years the rate  of inflation may rise. Not only would that mean that they  had bought a poor pension, but it would destroy the value  of the pension.   
<P>
The Government have not thought through the  fundamental problem that if we move to money purchase  pensions, pensioners will have great uncertainty about the  pension that they will end up with, in nominal and real  terms. I do not believe that there is an instant solution to  the problem or that the City will be able to produce the  miracles that my hon. Friend the hon. Member for  Beckenham seeks.  
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Give it a chance.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As my hon. Friend says, we must give it  a chance.   
<P>
However, there are areas of flexibility that can and  should be addressed. The first relates to the obligation to  buy an annuity. For the reasons that I have just given,  there is widespread objection among those approaching  the age of 75, who have been able to defer, to buying  an annuity now. They are clearly better off leaving their  investments as they are and participating in that  draw-down scheme.
