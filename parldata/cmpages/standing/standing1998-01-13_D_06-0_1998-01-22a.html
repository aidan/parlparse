<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): Members of the Committee who are students of history will know that long ago an interesting conversation took place between Winston Churchill and a woman. Churchill asked the woman whether she would sleep with him for &#163;100. I say to the hon. Member for Sevenage (Barbara Follett) and other hon. Members that it was a disgracefully sexist episode, but it is relevant in one respect. The woman replied in the negative, but only after a short pause. That prompted Churchill speedily to rejoin, ``Now that we have established the principle, the only thing left to determine is the price.''
<P>
The analogy with the Conservative Members' attitude to the minimum wage is not precise because, as we have already said, we oppose the principle of the minimum wage. Nevertheless, it would be absurd to pretend--and I do not--that the impact of the national minimum wage will be the same regardless of the level at which it is set. I concede today, as I have before conceded to the Minister, that he will get his way, the Bill will reach the statute book and the national minimum wage will be established. I am a pragmatist in such circumstances, as are my hon. Friends the Members for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley). We will be concerned to try to make the best out of the Bill to ensure that it does minimum damage and, if possible, that it does some good. That will depend on the level at which it is set.
<P>
We have not managed to establish how the situation in 1992 differs in principle from that which obtains today. The principle is not something with which Ministers are familiar, but the Minister of State has a long-standing track record of explicit support not only for the minimum wage but for a given level. The Minister shakes his head in apparent incredulity at the observation, but he has a short memory because, as I said last week, before the 1992 general election his position was one of commendable clarity. As a Labour candidate in Makerfield, he told the electors that he favoured a national minimum wage set at &#163;3.40 an hour.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> For clarity, and as the hon. Gentleman is interested in history, I point out that the rate of &#163;3.40 was the policy set out at the time of the 1992 election. The policy set out here, to which the electorate overwhelmingly agreed in 1997, is that the Low Pay Commission will set the rate. Let us be clear that we are discussing the results of the 1997 election, not those of 1992.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> With respect, the Minister is guilty of a tautology. All he is saying is that the position is different now because the position is different now. That is not an answer. I reiterate my point. If in 1992 it was possible--and, indeed, considered desirable--for the Labour party not only to express support for a national minimum wage, but to state at what level it should be introduced, what compelling reason is there, in January 1998, for failing to declare a figure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): It occurs to me as my hon. Friend makes his argument that since 1992 there has been an additional five years' experience of wages and unemployment. Surely if it was possible to give a figure in 1992, it ought, a fortiori, to be possible to do so in 1997 and before the publication of the legislation in 1998.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend's logic is, as always, impeccable. There was an excuse for the Labour party failing to declare its hand before May 1997. I am prepared to allow the Government that concession because I am in an extremely generous frame of mind this afternoon. I understand that, for purposes of political expediency, the Minister would not have wanted to state a particular figure before 1 May. He would have been afraid not only of falling foul of his right hon. Friends and of breaching collective responsibility but particularly of upsetting the voters. In 1992, he turned voters off and contributed to the defeat that the Labour party suffered; in 1997, his party preferred to avoid that fate.
<P>
Why is it necessary, however, for the Government to continue to refuse to declare their hand in favour of a particular figure eight months after the election? The Government are glorying in the aftermath of their majestic general election victory--of which the Minister repeatedly reminds us, beaming with pride in the process--but as they have introduced the Bill and as we are now in Committee, what is to prevent the Minister from expressing an opinion in favour of one figure or another? My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire has made it clear that we are not arguing for a national minimum wage of &#163;3, &#163;3.50 or &#163;4 an hour and that we are merely setting out several options and inviting debate on them. This is the Committee stage of the Bill and it is a lamentable constitutional outrage that the Bill is an empty shell. There is no good reason not to offer a view. For the life of me, I cannot understand why nobody is prepared to offer one.
<P>
The hon. Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) accused Conservative Members of plucking figures out of the air. That is a spectacularly absurd point given that &#163;3, &#163;3.50 and &#163;4 are part of the currency of regular debate on the subject. The Confederation of British Industry, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Institute of Directors and the Forum of Private Business, refer to the figures--they are what the debate is about. One or two jocular references have been made to my supreme generosity towards my cleaner and to the fact that I pay her &#163;7 an hour. Nobody is seriously suggesting that the national minimum wage should be set at that rate, but it surely serves to focus minds if we concentrate on the figures.
<P>
I issued a challenge and was sorely disappointed--although not greatly surprised--that no Labour Member was brave enough to respond to it. I invited a new Labour Member--with one or possibly two exceptions, virtually every Labour member of the Committee is a new boy or girl--to say what he or she favoured. The ferocity of the discipline exercised from Walworth road and the frequency of the messages on the pagers must be something to behold if no Labour Member is prepared to declare in favour of a figure. Does anybody wish to declare in favour of &#163;3 an hour? Does anybody firmly declare that &#163;3 an hour is too low? Does anybody want to say that &#163;3.50 is the right rate? Does anybody wish to declare that &#163;3.50 is too low? Does anybody wish to express an opinion on the appropriateness of &#163;4 an hour, or is that too low? Answers come there none.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does it occur to my hon. Friend that the situation is rather like the famous public opinion poll conducted in the masters' common room at a school into the wearing of long woolly winter underpants? Three members of the teaching staff admitted that they wore them; 12 denied the charge; and three did not know. No Labour Member knows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend because he has enlightened me. I do not have the advantage of ever having gone to a masters' common room because of the school that I attended. I am not, therefore, familiar with the tale, although it sounds most enticing and I would like to hear the details. It is, however, entirely apposite because Labour Back Benchers are not prepared to say what they think.
<P>
Why is it that the hon. Members for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton) and for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) can focus on figures that are unacceptably low but are not prepared to state a figure that would be unacceptably high?
<P>
I enjoyed the speech on Tuesday of the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton), who acknowledged that I know a little about Cornwall because of my family background and because one of the members of my family lived there for some time. However, the hon. Lady chose some rather bad examples. Hard cases make bad law. She used examples of breathtakingly badly paid people--I have considerable sympathy for such people and would not want them to go on earning those rates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire):</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. In the debate thus far, the Minister and Labour Members have mentioned rates of &#163;1.80 or &#163;2 per hour and cited examples from their newspapers. If they continue to say nothing on this subject, those reading the report of our debates may conclude that Labour Members see &#163;2 or &#163;2.50 as an acceptable level for the minimum wage; they have said nothing to gainsay that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Their image would suffer gravely as a consequence. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire is right to point out that they ought to declare their hand so that we know not only what is considered too high, but what is considered too low.
<P>
I find extraordinary the notion that Labour Members might vote against amendment No. 62, an entirely respectable amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire. It simply asserts that the rate of the national minimum wage should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``not in excess of &#163;4 an hour (in September 1997 prices)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We must probe further. It is not yet clear what new nugget of information will emerge in the next few days, weeks or months suddenly to enable the Government to take a position on the level of the minimum wage, which they are steadfastly resisting doing today.
<P>
The Minister has been asked this several times, but I shall ask again. Will the Government make a submission to the Low Pay Commission soon? Will they do so this week, next week or the week after? Do they intend to state their preferred figure as part of that submission? That is an entirely reasonable question.
<P>
Has the document been drafted but not yet sent? Has the Department of Trade and Industry experienced difficulties with its photocopiers similar to those that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food experienced when he had to make a statement to the House on 22nd December? Have DTI officials prepared the submission? Does it comment on rates of pay? If it does not, but simply reaffirms the Government's general commitment to a minimum wage and their opposition to widespread exemptions or variations, then meaty document though it may be, it will tell us nothing about the one outstanding issue of substance on which the Government have said nothing but should speedily say something.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is on to a good thing. He referred, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), to the explanatory and financial memorandum, which states that the Government assume that it will be set at a level where
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``employment and the productive potential of the economy'' are unchanged.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Statements from the Minister suggest that that is, broadly speaking, the level of the wages council, which has now been uprated to &#163;3.40. Is one to deduce that the Minister thinks that &#163;3.40 is an acceptable rate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> One might reasonably deduce that if one did not know the Minister. He has his reputation to consider--he has a longstanding commitment to this subject. He is on the traditional left of his party and has robustly and with vigour stood up to the Minister without Portfolio. He made a point of telling the shadow President of the Board of Trade, my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) before Christmas that he--the Minister--was a winner in such situations because if he had a disagreement with his ministerial friends, he went in to see them and came out with an agreement.
<P>
It is clear, at least for the time being, that both the Minister and the President of the Board of Trade have squashed the Minister without Portfolio--unfortunately for British industry and commerce. I do not suppose, however, that they will have squashed him for long. We all know that he is a formidable figure who will no doubt rise up when the Minister least expects it, and in some dark corridor or worse will afflict appropriate damage on him.
<P>
The Minister had a clear position over some years and, under the circumstances, I would be astonished if he were prepared to settle for &#163;3.40. How he could ever mix with his trade union friends in working men's clubs ever again in the face of such a manifest betrayal of principle is difficult to imagine. If that is his position, however, let him say so.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is a matter of the gravest regret that the newspapers are being consistently briefed by Ministers and others that the intended figure is &#163;3.75. If the former hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, who was subsequently the hon. Member for South Down, were still a Member of the House, he would be incandescent with rage about the impertinence to Parliament of Ministers briefing journalists about their favoured figure, but denying the information to members of the Committee. The debate is meaningless without that information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It would be fair to say that the information is also being denied to the Low Pay Commission, if the submission has not been made to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> That would be an affront to the Low Pay Commission. Professor Bain has an important job to do, together with his colleagues. Opposition Members have expressed doubt about the commission's composition, which we would have amended if we had had the opportunity--we are not happy about it. The commission has an important project ahead of it. If Ministers were to give the newspapers their preferred figure but were to fail to inform Professor Bain of that figure in their submission, they would be guilty of the most monstrous discourtesy. It would be as if the Government were running a campaign alongside the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
In the past, Ministers and members of the Labour party in general were wholly opposed to contracting out and to competitive tendering. They seem to have gone all the way around the block and come full circle on the issue. The Government are now contracting out the making of policy to the Low Pay Commission. Will the Minister be so minded as to implement a recommendation from the commission? Does he think it likely that he would do something different? Will he give the Committee some advance notice of what he proposes to say to the commission? Will he at least indicate that the Government will not recommend in their submission a minimum wage of more than &#163;4 per hour?
<P>
The debate on those matters is substantial, and it is worth having. I am the first to admit the blindingly obvious: a &#163;3 minimum wage would not be as damaging as one set at &#163;3.50 or &#163;4 per hour. The CBI has already emphasised, as is clear beyond doubt and peradventure, that a &#163;3 minimum wage will do some damage. The Minister is not keen to acknowledge that point. It is on the record that the CBI holds that view. That rate will not, however, do as much damage as a higher one.
<P>
What is the Government's preference? When will they declare it? Will it be in their submission to the Low Pay Commission? I am asking for answers, answers, answers--not, please, the Minister's deliberate calculated avoidance of giving answers.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> If the past 15 minutes had not concerned the serious plight of low-paid people, I could have laughed at the hon. Gentleman's performance. For Boswell and Bercow, read Laurel and Hardy.
<P>
The debate started on one specific aspect of the amendment. The debate was presumably going to be one of engagement, a discussion of the level of the minimum wage. Very quickly, contributions made at whatever level became another frontal attack on the concept and principle of the Bill and of the minimum wage.
<P>
The hon. Member for Buckingham still has a sense of denial--the Opposition were unable to convince the electorate before 1 May last year that their view on minimum standards in the labour market and the right to a minimum wage had great public support. As with so many other issues and policies, the truth was that Opposition Members had little or no support across the political spectrum. Two thirds of Conservative voters support the principle and concept of the national minimum wage. More than 80 per cent. of the electorate believe in the principle. Increasingly, in industry, the business case for the national minimum wage is being put. The Opposition are making a rather crude attempt to trip me up and get me to say what the rate of the national minimum wage should be. I do not object. People have tried a similar tactic for the past three years. It is not my role, nor is it the role of the Government, to say what the rate should be. The purpose of the Low Pay Commission is to get a settlement on the national minimum wage by partnership.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does not the Minister accept that, in the absence of any indication of the proposed level of the national minimum wage, we have not even begun to complain? All we can do by various means--serious and jocular by turn--is to point out the difficulties in establishing criteria and the damage that may arise from a national minimum wage. That will continue until the Minister tells the Committee what the figure will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman, uncharacteristically, talks nonsense. In opposition, my party undertook a three-year consultation exercise, its biggest ever on a single issue. We went to all parts of the nation and met all sectors of the economy--the public and private sectors, and individual companies and groups. Overwhelmingly, the evidence was that a minimum wage should be established in partnership through the creation of a Low Pay Commission, and that the commission should be independent, responsible for taking and assessing evidence, and for making recommendations to the Government on the starting rate for the minimum wage and associated issues. That clear policy was agreed and then endorsed at the general election.
<P>
The crucial factor about the policy is simple: those who will be asked to pay a minimum wage, at whatever level, should be involved in its establishment. That is why the Low Pay Commission is critical to the partnership approach and why it has had such a great welcome across the social, economic and political spectrums, but not from the Conservative party. That is also why so many people want to work with it, and why its members are so proud of their membership and are doing such an effective job.
<P>
For those reasons, the commission will put forward well worked out proposals by the end of May and have across-the-board support for the way in which it has carried out its duties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Minister seems to be arguing that it is inappropriate for the Government to recommend a rate to the Low Pay Commission, or to set one, and that the obverse should happen. Is he also saying that the Government will accept the commission's recommendation and not vary from it?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I said that the commission has been given responsibility as a partnership body to come forward with recommendations which the Government will consider.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister said that it was not for him to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It is not my job to second-guess the Low Pay Commission. Having established an independent body, we will not, either privately or publicly, determine the scope of the rate. The commission was given that responsibility by the Government. The electorate wished us to do that and we will proceed on that basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister said that the commission will report by the end of May. Is that deadline unshakeable and will the commission will so deliver?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The deadline was set by the Government. I have every confidence that Professor Bain and his colleagues will meet it.
<P>
The web of argument boils down to one simple fact: Conservative Members want me to place on record my view of what the minimum wage should be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman admits that, but it is not going to happen. It is not my job to propose a rate for the minimum wage, but the commission's. The admendments are irrelevant to the Bill. They are an attempt to hold up its progress and to give Conservative Members another opportunity to vent their spleen against the national minimum wage--no more, no less.
<P>
The hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) attempted some historical analysis. He shamelessly tried to ape Sir Winston Churchill, and it was not a pretty sight. My accent prevents me from attempting the same, but I shall offer a quote. In 1909, Sir Winston said that it is a serious national evil that any of His Majesty's subjects should earn less than a living wage. Without minimum wage regulations
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the good employer is undercut by the bad, and the bad employer is undercut by the worst.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Decent employment conditions make for industrial efficiency and increase, rather than decrease, competitiveness. Conservative Members have not learned much in almost a century.
<P>
What was true in 1909 is as true today: that is why the Government have won substantial support for the proposals for a national minimum wage. There will be no variation according to region, sector or business: from day one of employment--regardless of whether the work is part time or full time, temporary or casual, or performed by a home worker or an agency worker, everyone will have the right to a national minimum wage. I am proud that the clause assists in that.
<P>
I ask the Committee to reject the amendments as a specious and erroneous attempt to undervalue, undercut and damage the concept on which the Bill is based.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for responding to the debate. However, I regret that he did not respond substantively. The Minister began his remarks by saying that Conservative Members were attacking the concept and principle of the minimum wage, but the amendments question its operation in practice. The principle behind the minimum wage was debated on Second Reading, and before.
<P>
It was a pity that the Minister did not respond substantively to the amendments. Although the saying is that it ``takes two to tango'', in this debate, Conservative Members were left to tango on our own.
<P>
I was slightly encouraged when the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) began her speech. She said that Conservative Members had plucked figures out of the air, but that is nonsense. They are rooted in the evidence to the Low Pay Commission, and provide reasonable parameters for the debate about at what rate the minimum wage might be set. When the hon. Lady said that the figures did not permit a substantive debate about that rate, I thought that she would go on to discuss that question. However, substance came there none: the hon. Lady said merely that the matter should be left to the Low Pay Commission, as though the commission were our master rather than our creature.
<P>
I understand that the Bill's purpose is to invite the Low Pay Commission to arrive at a determination, but policy making should not be abandoned to that body. When he responded to the debate, the Minister did not clarify what Ministers' intentions are. The Minister waxed lyrical about the Low Pay Commission: is it the Government's intention to accept the commission's recommendations.
<P>
As we shall discuss later, the Government propose to take powers to act on the Low Pay Commission's recommendation. If they decide not to do so, they will have to present their arguments to Parliament. Does not that suggest that those who will decide the level of the national minimum wage will be accountable to Parliament? It is Parliament--through future regulations and through the debates on this Bill--that will set the parameters for the national minimum wage. It is perfectly proper that we should do so, through legislation or in an indicative way through debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is precisely what will happen under the Bill. It gives Parliament the ability to consider the proposals from the Low Pay Commission, to consider the regulations and to put those regulations into practice.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Minister, I regret, continues to miss the point. It is a follow-through of our argument, which I shall not repeat, that the cart is coming before the horse. We are trying to put the horse before the cart. Labour Members have felt free to indicate by reference to specific jobs advertised in their local newspapers that such a rate is too low and that, by implication, the rate should be set above &#163;1.80 or &#163;2, or whatever figure was quoted. By contrast, they believe it improper for the Committee or the House to suggest that a particular figure would make a reasonable ceiling on the national minimum wage. Beyond that point, on the basis of evidence, there is a compelling view that the consequences would be a reduction in employment and in productive potential. Indeed, the Bill is directed towards that point.
<P>
If the Committee were convinced that a minimum wage above &#163;4 would lead to a reduction in employment and in the productive potential in the country's economy, we would be moved to revist the Bill's explanatory and financial memorandum and say that it would be unwise to proceed without having a saving clause of the kind suggested by the amendment to frustrate the Low Pay Commission from putting forward a recommendation that would so obviously be contrary to its remit. Ministers have chosen not to present parameters to the Low Pay Commission's remit which would frustrate a recommendation of that kind. Ministers may go on to present evidence to the Low Pay Commission which will serve that purpose, but they have not so far and show no signs of doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am following my hon. Friend's argument closely. Does he agree that the specific remit letter from the President of the Board of Trade prescribes and enjoins the commission to recommend an initial level, to make recommendations on lower rates and to consider and report any matters referred by Ministers--about which we have heard nothing since--by the end of May? In terms of the other important considerations, including economic considerations, the term ``should have regard to'' is used. There is no question of any executive decision or even any precise recommendation flowing from these considerations in the absence of a specific steer from Ministers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> That is a most helpful intervention. It further illustrates the difficulty of proceeding, even in these early stages, without discussion of the further details and in the absence of a clear indication from Ministers of the shape of the national minimum wage as they wish to see it in practice. On that point of evidence, my hon. Friend set out the argument extremely well. We shall have to reiterate from time to time, until we are satisfied on this point, that we do not know where the Ark Royal is. That is a useful question and Ministers should respond to it.
<P>
I suspect that our proceedings will appear very strange when those outside read of them in Hansard. My hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) referred to meeting his constituents. I have encountered the same attitude and expect to do so again this weekend. I will tell constituents that I have been debating the structure and functioning of the national minimum wage. To their question, ``What rate is proposed?'' I will say ``We will not know what the rate is until we have finished deciding the structure of the minimum wage.'' Anybody with half an ounce of business sense will say that to try and agree how the national minimum wage should function, its implications and what protection should be put in the Bill before we know the level at which it is to be set and what the implications will be for the economy as a whole, is an extraordinary way of proceeding.
<P>
We have heard some extremely useful points in this debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said that as we go up the curve, large numbers of workers are included in the national minimum wage by quite modest shifts in the rate. In the parameters of &#163;3 and &#163;4, at each 50p change we are talking about 1.5 million workers. By extension, logic suggests that hidden behind that large number, 2.25 million or 3.5 million workers in established pay scales could be involved. Therefore, there will be differential effects going up the scale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the cumulative effect of including workers is likely to crank up the mechanism of a rebound to enhance differentials above the minimum wage?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We also heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). I might have been able to buttress my original argument in moving the amendment. I missed the reference to a sensible level that Ministers made in the explanatory and financial memorandum, meaning a level at which employment potential and production are unchanged. There is by extension, therefore, an implication by Ministers that they will not accept, and would wish the low pay commission not to recommend, a rate that would lead to a reduction in employment or in productive potential. If Ministers see that as the basis of the measure, it would be useful for us to test at what level they believe--their evidence may illustrate it with worked examples in due course--a given rate would be economically damaging.
<P>
Ministers have referred to the experience of wages councils, about which they are wrong, because they cannot determine what would have happened in a closed economy, rather than a growing economy, or one in which unemployment was falling. None the less, Ministers have taken the trouble to suggest that the level of wage rates recommended by wages councils was not a level that led to a reduction in unemployment in the industries covered. By extension, they seem to be suggesting that &#163;3.40 is an acceptable level. However, all the evidence to the low pay commission shows that a national minimum wage of &#163;4 is at a level from which there is little doubt that adverse employment and other consequences will flow.
<P>
In a sense, we have set the parameters even more narrowly. If Ministers were to exclude a level below &#163;3.40, and if the evidence excluded a level above &#163;4, what figure between those two will be acceptable? I wholly endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham said about the discourtesy--to put it kindly--of proceeding with the Bill without our being given any indication of Ministers' thinking while they are engaging with the media in discussions and briefings about the figures that are being bandied about by Ministers in the privacy of Whitehall.
<P>
I was grateful, too, to my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford for illustrating very well that differentials matter in this context. It is extremely important that we find out the rate and the application of the minimum wage, if Ministers continue to adhere to the absurd proposition that there will be no impact on differentials.
<P>
Ministers are being curiously perverse in their arguments. On the one hand, we are told that the Low Pay Commission will determine all those things; it will take evidence from those affected and tell us its conclusions. At the same time, the Minister is perfectly willing to make bold assertions, such as suggesting that there will be no effect on differentials, as though he himself were determining the evidence and deciding what was in the economic interests of the country, and substituting his judgment for that of those who will be affected in business and who, through evidence from the CBI, have made it clear that differentials will be affected which, in consequence, will affect prices and adversely affect employment.
<P>
The Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot say that it is all down to the Low Pay Commission, and then say that the Government will judge everything in advance except the rate. Ministers are protecting themselves because they know that everyone invited to do so subscribed to the principle of a minimum wage because to do otherwise would seem perverse and socially harsh. Ministers have been saying, ``In 1992''--my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham quite rightly referred to 1992--``we said that we would stick to a rate. People should not worry; it will not be a difficult rate to live with because it will be subject to evidence and so on.'' We shall see.
<P>
Those in business will find that they have been asked to subscribe to a principle without being told the practical implications--again, because they do not know what the rate will be. Many of those who felt that the principle was right will find that, in practice, things will go wrong.
<P>
That is not to say that they will necessarily reject the principle, but evidence shows that small businesses tend to the view that a minimum wage set at a level below what they pay their staff is acceptable, and that a minimum wage set above what they pay their staff is damaging. That is not surprising; it is entirely rational. Many business men may feel that the minimum wage will not cause them much grief, not least because of Labour's softly-softly approach before the election. I hope that that is true.
<P>
I hope that the minimum wage will focus upon genuinely low rates of pay that can be excluded from the economy without significant adverse consequences. We shall find out. If the rate is set higher than that, many will complain to Ministers that they were not told what the rate would be. Certainly, they will be surprised to find that the rate was not the subject of the Committee's debates.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister's self-denying ordinance will be a source of anxiety to many business men when they learn of the Committee's proceedings? If the Minister is not prepared to rule out a rate of even &#163;4 an hour, thousands upon thousands of people in business will have to accept that jobs will be lost as a result. They have a great deal to fear. The Minister owes it to them at least to set out the parameters within which an acceptable figure could be found.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. The Minister said that he wants a serious debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham and I had to try to provoke Labour Members to enter into debate, but I fear that we failed. The record will show that it was a significant omission. Ministers have failed to publish their evidence to the Low Pay Commission and have not seriously discussed the factors that would determine what the Minister called a ``sensible'' level for a national minimum wage.
<P>
Far from trivialising, being too provocative, or venting our spleen on Ministers--I think we ought to keep our spleen to ourselves--we wanted to have a serious debate on an appropriate level for the national minimum wage and how, according to the evidence, different levels of minimum wage have various implications. We also wanted to debate whether parameters could be set for the Low Pay Commission's work in other respects and whether Parliament should set a ceiling on the national minimum wage, particularly given the belief in the House that, if it is set above a certain level, a minimum wage would have adverse consequences for employment, competitiveness and the economy.
<P>
I regret that the Minister chose to respond so negatively to the amendment rather than engaging in a constructive debate on a subject so central to the Bill. There is little profit in seeking to press the amendment to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amemdment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 1, line 18, after `may,', insert `reasonably'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 64, in page 1, line 18, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which shall not be a period less than a week in respect of weekly-paid workers, and, not be a period less than a month in respect of monthly-paid workers.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I suspect that the Committee will feel a sense of relief that we are now considering the final group of amendments to clause 1. The clause is the core of the Bill and the arguments about it have, I hope, been fully rehearsed within the limits of knowledge offered, rather than vouchsafed, by the Government.
<P>
The amendment is, in a sense, comparatively small, although it paves the way for some interesting considerations that will spill over into our discussion of clause 2. It would simply insert the word ``reasonably'' after the word ``may''.
<P>
I shall deal with a narrow front issue before I come to wider considerations. I suspect that you, Mr. Atkinson, like all Standing Committee Chairmen, will have had more than your fair share of debates about whether the word ``may'' or ``shall'' should be used, although that is not the subject of this amendment.
<P>
I have a personal flourish or signature that I try to introduce to virtually every Standing Committee with which I am involved, which is to have a debate on the word ``reasonable''. That betrays an interest--I am a lay person, but at least one member of my family knows about this--in judicial review and the reasonable conduct of Ministers. In a narrow sense, that is the subject of the amendment. The Minister is usually a reasonable man--although he was below his best in his response to the previous debate--and the amendment invites him to act reasonably in determining a pay reference period.
<P>
I shall not dilate on judicial review, but I believe that an element of judicial test has been a great asset to our public administrative system, to officials' deliberations and to the way in which Ministers take decisions; it enables us to see that those decisions have been fairly and reasonably approached.
<P>
There is a splendid little book--written by the legal adviser to a Department in which I was formerly a Minister--called ``The Judge Over Your Shoulder''. I know that the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry is aware of it. I think it wise for any Minister in any Administration to be aware that decisions should be taken properly and sensibly. I have introduced a new word, but the legal term of art is ``reasonably''.
<P>
The Minister of State may be aware of a series of legal concepts known as the Wednesbury rules about whether a Minister is acting reasonably. I need not say much more about that but, as it applies to the setting of a pay reference period, we are arguing formally that the Minister should take the decision reasonably and, in substance, that the decision that the Minister takes reasonably should be reasonable, which is not quite the same thing. As I understand it, the general practice of judicial review is that judges do not second guess a Minister and tell him that he cannot do what he thought he could, as long as he has taken the decision on best advice and according to the proper procedures.
<P>
We can perhaps bend the concept a little for the purposes of debate. We want the Minister to consider the evidence before he makes the decision on the pay reference period and to make that decision in the light of the evidence and advice that he has received. We are somewhat inhibited in being sure about what that advice may be, as it is not clear from the terms of reference to the Low Pay Commission. When, at long last, the Ark Royal is sighted and the Government's evidence to the commission is submitted and published, it might be clearer whether the Government intend the commission to reach a conclusion as to what should be the pay reference period.
<P>
My hon. Friends have perceptively tabled another amendment, under which some guidelines or gateway would be put into the determination of the extent of that period. If the Low Pay Commission were to suggest a particular period--a week, a month, a year or whatever--Ministers would be ill advised to reject it and do something totally and perversely opposite; or they would certainly have to have good reasons for doing so.
<P>
I thought that the Minister sought the best of both worlds and equivocated on the substantive issue of what advice he would take from the Low Pay Commission. I think that it was agreed that he would not be completely bound by such advice. I appreciate that he wants the last say and would not want to implement exactly what was suggested, but he would be well advised to consider doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Surely it is unreasonable of the hon. Gentleman to suggest that I, or any other Minister, should prejudge the Low Pay Commission's recommendations and specifically give our views on such matters. We have not yet even received the commission's recommendations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> With respect, the Minister slightly misunderstands me. I was seeking to discover--I leave it to him to consider this in his response--whether he thought that the Low Pay Commission should take a view on pay reference periods and whose advice he would take. I wanted his assurance that, when he had heard that advice, which is not to prejudge the issue, he would have regard to it--to use a term of art--and, unless it was self-evidently silly, implement it. I say that as a preliminary.
<P>
I shall now deal with some wider considerations--I suspect that some of my hon. Friends will also want to do so--of the pay reference period that have not been discussed, such as the hourly rate for the national minimum wage. My interpretation is slightly different to that of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, in that he was thinking of trying to turn everything into an hourly rate. I think that the Government want to divide the quantum of remuneration--a matter that we discussed in all its glory, and to which we shall return under clause 2--by the number of hours worked, which is also a complex subject. They would then divide the rate produced by the number of hours normally worked to get the hourly rate.
<P>
If I remember my school mathematics correctly, the pay reference period is, in a sense, the divisor; the amount of remuneration for that period is the dividend; and the result, which is comparable to the national minimum hourly rate, is the quotient. However, we are dealing with the number of hours worked, but that is not always as clear as it might be. I say that as a preliminary canter, but I hope that the Minister will begin to consider it.
<P>
Clearly, there are contractual undertakings, especially for those in what might be termed straightforward employment, such as those paid regularly by the hour without overtime. For example, the 39-hour week in agriculture, where there is a wages order, and the 36-hour week, or whatever, in engineering are determined by contract. Schoolteachers are enjoined to work for a statutory number of hours.
<P>
I appreciate that we have not yet reached the relevant part of clause 2--I do not anticipate that; we shall need to return to it--which determines what will be the relevant period. That is a slightly separate issue. I am more concerned about people who may have a job, the hours of which may not be easy to specify. If the pay references period were short, it would not be clear whether their employment and remuneration complied with the national minimum wage.
<P>
I shall give the Minister of State one or two examples. He may be surprised to learn something of which I have experience--indirectly, this concerns compliance with the agricultural wages order. In modern conditions, where there is highly capitalised agriculture and low levels of employment--I am not talking about the intensive operations that characterise horticulture, where people are paid by the piece, or whatever, but about the large parts of agriculture in which there is high capitalisation per employee--it is not unusual for the one, two or half a dozen employees in each enterprise to be paid a salary. That is a great social advance from the days in which people were paid in truck or in cash from a pot at the end of the week.
<P>
Modern farm workers are highly skilled people; they do an excellent job, and they are often paid a salary. There are good reasons for that. Farming--an industry that I know well-- is very variable in its labour profile. It varies from one farm to another but, partly because of the weather, it does not lend itself to an absolutely even labour profile. A person may be paid a salary of, say, &#163;15,000, and have a series of different responsibilities, including carrying out manual work on a farm. There will be peaks and troughs in the labour profile.
<P>
To take the example of a mixed farm, an employee may sometimes work in a sheep enterprise. At this time of year, when lambing is taking place, people have to get up in the middle of the night and work long hours. A person might work 60 or 70 hours a week during that time. In harvest time in, say, August he would also work very intensive hours to get the harvest in before the weather broke. He might work as many as 75 or 80 hours a week--extremely hard and responsible work--to secure the harvest.
<P>
At other times of the year, there is less pressure. There are maintenance jobs to do--tidying up, servicing, support jobs, a little bit of building, constructing a small piece of equipment, or whatever. If the chap was on the right sort of contract, he might well be able to push off at 4 pm when he had done his routine duties and his little bit of other work, and that would be perfectly fair. At the end of the day, it would be possible to work out how many hours he had worked. However, unless the pay reference period were rather wide, that could give rise to concern about whether people had been paid at the national minimum wage rate when they were heavily engaged, when at other times they might be grossly over-remunerated, relative to that rate.
<P>
I hope that one period would be reasonably taken with the other, and with the nature of the contract, which might specify work over a year at a monthly salary averaging out at, say, &#163;15,000 a year. That would be a reasonable form of employment, which should not be precluded from or fall foul of the proposals.
<P>
That leads me to my second example. If a farm worker were on such a salary arrangement and a crisis, such as a cow calving in the middle of the night, arose--it would be important from the animal welfare perspective for someone to be present to supervise that--and if his contracted hours had been fulfilled, it would be possible, though probably difficult, for him to turn out without triggering a breach of the national minimum wage requirement. Neither farmer nor farm worker would wish that to happen, but if it did, it would have unfortunate consequences, not only in terms of cash, but more widely.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the Committee is to rehearse, not resolve, the issues and to get the Minister to think about them. Having talked about a comparatively minor crisis in animal health, I wish to consider the case of trainee doctors and of nurses. They do not receive high pay, but they work very long hours. If a trainee hospital doctor works 80 to 100 hours--as often happens, depending on the particular hospital--not all of them spent in intense work but all on duty, they come close to the national minimum wage. I appreciate that there may be trainee rates which differ from that. I tried to do the sum for Members of Parliament and decided that unless they worked 167 hours out of 168--

<P>

<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Could I just take my hon. Friend back to our discussion this morning about the armed forces? A private soldier earns, in the course of a normal day's work of eight and a half hours, above the likely level of the minimum wage, but if he goes out on exercises overnight, he may work 16, 18 or 20 hours at a stretch. Is not it typical that the Government have recognised the problem of irregular working patterns for a group that is essentially employed by the Government, but appears to be blind to the potential problems in the private sector?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point although it remains to be seen whether the Government intend to exempt the armed forces. To anticipate the debate that we shall have, I hope that in one respect they do because I do not want a situation in which soldiers, not out on exercises but in a hot war, do not receive the national minimum wage when they are working--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that we shall debate that under clause 34.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am indeed conscious of that, but the matter is relevant to the general point that people have irregular working hours.
<P>
My hon. Friend interrupted me when I was making the point about Members of Parliament, who work long hours: I was once phoned by a constituent at 3.30 a.m. I do not know whether I regard myself as being on duty at night--I suspect that I am. When people work for long hours for low, or not huge, consideration, it is surprising how low the rate can drop. That also gives rise to the separate and interesting issue of two employments overlapping one another--the Minister ought to know about that because he receives both a parliamentary and a ministerial salary. He is not likely to fall below the rate, however hard he works--I appreciate that he works hard--but the principle remains.
<P>
I have mentioned the issue of people, particularly but not exclusively trainees, who work long hours in occupations with uneven working hours. Another example is that of my old history tutor, a remarkable man called Tom Brown. He was a fine man who, among other things, invented during his time at the Ministry of Economic Warfare, the concept of using the V sign to denote victory and the first bar of Beethoven's fifth symphony as the call sign for broadcasts to occupied Europe. He did many things in his life, and he was a great teacher who loved teaching undergraduates. He taught 72 hours a week--72 one-hour personal tutorials; I knew that because he happened to keep his schedule displayed on his mantelpiece. I thought that that was amazing. Magdalen college Oxford did not pay particularly well, even though its surroundings had other benefits--spiritual and physical. I would hate to think that Tom Brown was paid nothing like the national minimum wage of the time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As interesting as that is, we are talking about pay reference periods and not working hours, which are the subject of a later amendment. While I appreciate that they are linked to an extent, I would be grateful if members of the Committee could keep strictly to pay reference periods.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most grateful for that advice, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Further to your strictures, perhaps you could have time reference periods for some of our discussions. We might get somewhere.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most grateful for that suggestion because I am mindful of the need to get on.
<P>
I was making the point that there is indeed a link between pay reference periods and the number of hours worked, and I will seek to demonstrate that. Unless the pay reference period is set reasonably, the number of hours worked may give rise to a perverse effect if taken literally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I wanted to use precisely the point that my hon. Friend made about junior hospital doctors to illustrate the relationship between the amendments. I know from family experience that a junior hospital doctor may be paid for his many overtime hours not at the normal pay rate but at 0.38 of it. A doctor may well work 24 hours during the day. My wife often worked 24 hours during a given day, for most of which she was paid at 0.38 of the normal rate. If the pay reference period were reduced today, it would leave the hourly rate way down. It therefore matters what the pay reference period is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend makes the point eloquently.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will not take this jocularly, but all I am saying is that there are problems in determining a pay reference period and ensuring that it does not have knock-on effects that inhibit people making perfectly reasonable arrangements or responding to emergencies if required. That is all germane to the proposal in the amendment that the Secretary of State should ``reasonably'' prescribe the pay reference period.
<P>
Despite occasional appearances to the contrary, I believe the Minister of State to be a reasonable man who wishes to take reasonable decisions that lead to reasonable conclusions. In this case, I hope that he will feel that we are being reasonable and that he can consider taking on board the spirit, if not the wording, of our proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend has ably illustrated the argument for the amendment and has touched also on amendment No. 64 to which I want briefly to speak. I and my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham tabled amendment No. 64 to get Ministers to elucidate whether, as the notes on clauses suggest, they firmly intend to move--in their evidence to the Low Pay Commission or otherwise--towards specifying pay reference periods of not less than a week for weekly paid staff. It is important that that should be the case--no damage would be done if that were specified in the Bill. For that reason, it must be the concern of the Committee and, as I am sure it is, of Ministers, that the introduction of the national minimum wage should not add significantly or unduly to the compliance costs for and burdens on businesses. The explanatory and financial memorandum, which gives only a limited explanation because there is so much yet to be determined, concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There may be some cost to business in complying with these record-keeping duties, but they are not expected to be significant, either for recording pay or for recording hours worked.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We will discuss records in a future debate and you, Mr. Atkinson, would rule me out of order if I sought to have that debate now. However, we can confidently assert that if the pay reference periods of weekly paid staff were to be set at a period of less than a week, without commenting on whether they might be aggregated over a longer period, the consequence of the national minimum wage would be a significant addition to the compliance costs imposed on business. The same would be true if pay reference periods for monthly paid staff were aggregated over a period of less than a month because all the records within the business would be structured around the aggregation on a monthly basis of hours worked and consequent remuneration.
<P>
Businesses do not necessarily have records that are designed to generate data for periods other than those used for pay purposes. If businesses use weekly or monthly remuneration and we ask them to introduce their payroll systems record keeping based on one or two-day periods, or, for monthly paid employees, on a weekly period, there is no doubt that those companies will incur substantial additional costs. We are using the amendment to test Ministers and avoid imposing that compliance cost on businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that there is an argument for setting the pay reference period at more than a week for weekly paid workers and at more than a month for monthly paid workers to deal with irregularities in payment, such as bonuses, commissions and so forth?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Absolutely. My hon. Friend might like to elaborate on some of the considerations relating to what pay reference period ought to be set.
<P>
The Minister will say that the Low Pay Commission will tell us what pay reference period it advocates and we can discuss that point under clause 48. The amendment does not relate to whether it might be convenient for the purpose of the national minimum wage to aggregate at higher levels. Patterns of work and pay that are erratic because of seasonality or changes in demand mean, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry made clear, that there may be good reason to aggregate the pay reference period considerably in excess of the normal period used within companies, whether that is daily, weekly or monthly.
<P>
By contrast, I am at a loss to see under what circumstances--I should be interested to hear an example from the Minister--it would be appropriate to move in the opposite direction and seek to calculate on a daily basis or over less than a week the hourly rate of staff who are paid weekly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that this is another example of a matter on which the Government should be making their thoughts known in their submission to the Low Pay Commission? Does he also agree that if the Government do not tell us that this is one of the matters on which their submission will focus, we will be left to wonder on exactly what that submission does concentrate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I am tempted to say that Ministers are perfectly clear--and the notes on clauses indicate--that they expect the pay reference period for weekly paid staff normally to be a week, although in certain circumstances, changes in demand, seasonality and so on would require otherwise. I do not think that Ministers intend to set the pay reference period at lower than a week for weekly paid staff and at less than a month for monthly paid staff, but they have structured the Bill to give themselves the maximum discretion, and it is our task to question that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that there is another consideration? Where pay remuneration structures are being altered, there could be a perverse effect if it is not possible to bridge those periods and take the overall impact, rather than selecting one part or another of the period in which it is in transition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> That is very interesting. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I am sure that we could go on, but I shall not do so.
<P>
When one thinks through the practical implementation of the national minimum wage, it seems that in relation to pay reference periods, it would be better to move to a higher level of aggregation of time, rather than trying to disaggregate to a shorter period. From a technical point of view, therefore--this is not a vexatious amendment in any sense--if the Government do not intend to specify under future regulations pay reference periods which are disaggregated within the normal pay structures of weekly or monthly paid staff, it would be as well to put that in the Bill. For those reasons, I invite Ministers to respond positively to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): I have listened intently to the arguments. I was pleased that the hon. Member for Daventry was up front about the purpose of the proposal to insert the word ``reasonably'', because I thought that we might get into a mundane argument about the double meaning of that word. It is clear that the relationship between a rate of pay and the period of time to which it is decided that that pay accrues is absolutely central to any pay structure. That fact is well known to tens of thousands of personnel officers across the country.
<P>
I want to list some of the problems in defining periods. I suspect that hon. Members do not realise that a 39-hour or, as it used to be, a 40-hour week is less the norm than it used to be--if it ever was the norm. The problem with amendments Nos. 59 and 64 is that rather than allowing a more sensible scope for the Low Pay Commission and the Government, they would restrict their room for manoeuvre. Far be it from me to say that the Secretary of State would ever act other than ``reasonably''--of course she acts reasonably at all times and in all ways--but the insertion of that word would allow a challenge to her decisions from a myriad of sources.
<P>
The fact that the world of pay is more complicated now than it has ever been is an argument against--not in favour of--amendment No. 59.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> Perhaps I can finish the argument, and then the hon. Gentleman can come in.
<P>
Similarly, amendment No. 64, which specifically provides that the period
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall not be . . . less than a week''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for weekly paid workers and not less than a month for monthly paid workers, assumes that the weekly or monthly paid worker is the norm. Of course, in many instances that is the case, but there are very many examples where it is not. The amendment would undermine the Bill because of the problem of definitions.
<P>
We have talked about tautologies today, and it is interesting to note that despite the tautological link between pay periods and the pay itself--the two sides of the coin--no amendment has been tabled to line 16, which states that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Secretary of State may from time to time prescribe''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the single hourly rate of pay.
<P>
In the real world of work, standard hours--standard rates--of pay are the level above which overtime is paid. The definition of the period is related to pay, but overtime is not paid at above the premium rate in all cases. Sometimes it is paid below--for example, in agriculture. Suspected norms vary so often that it is worth dwelling on a few. The mode--the standard rate--for 41 per cent. of manual works is between 30 and 37 hours work, but 54 per cent. of non-manual workers and 56 per cent. of manual workers work more hours for most of the year. It is difficult to define a norm.
<P>
The hourly rate of pay of Members of Parliament was referred to by the hon. Member for Daventry. I shall not attempt to calculate the ministerial rate, but a back-of-an-envelope calculation shows that &#163;43,000 divided by the hours in a year comes to &#163;4 an hour. I draw no conclusions from that.
<P>
It is difficult to make calculations. For example, weekly-paid and monthly-paid workers get parental leave. Maternity leave is covered by legislation, but there are many negotiated agreements covering time off for fathers, and proposals on that matter are coming through. One in three workers are allowed time off for cancer screening, which is a problem for negotiators. Many employees--not enough, in my view--are given time off to care for relatives, some paid, some not. Those factors make defining the pay period difficult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting and well-informed speech. Does he agree that another issue is whether time off is given for the conduct of public interest activities such as local government service, which is highly desirable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> That argument would find favour with the leader of Oldham borough council. Perhaps I will inform him of it. There are many other examples such as contract work and annualised hours.
<P>
Those arguments go against the amendment because of their effects. We must give those in industry who agree rates of pay and definitions the flexibility to do their jobs. If we prescribed in such detail, the word ``reasonably'' would open up many decisions to challenge. The arguments might be rehearsed judicially and the Bill could be undermined. Similar problems of definition would come about with the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``not . . . less than a week . . . not . . . less than a month''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman is developing an interesting argument that contains much with which we could agree. Does he agree that pay and working practices differ considerably across industries, as do remuneration packages? Is it not unfortunate that the Secretary of State will not have the discretion to go with the grain of practices in different industries and institute different pay reference periods to acknowledge those practices?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> I take the point, but no, for the reasons that I oppose the amendment. Shift work is used by 70 per cent. of workplaces in Britain; it is not unusual. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Ann Keen) has had many years' experience of working split shifts and double-day shifts as a nurse. Shift working is very common throughout industry. The Bill would be undermined if the Government decided to make exceptions and divisions within it.
<P>
The Opposition's arguments come from the same point of view, but are reaching precisely the opposite conclusion. The hon. Members who tabled the amendments--especially amendment No. 64--should think through the effect that they would have.
<P>
The amendment has made me realise why I was slightly uneasy about the cleaner employed by the hon. Member for Buckingham, who has illustrated its exact problem. The cleaner is paid &#163;7 per hour. If she were to work eight hours in the day--[Hon. Members: ``She?''] I think that the cleaner is a she, and that the hon. Gentleman referred to a she. I say that before any suggestions are made about my words that may have been made about some of his. If she were to work eight hours a day, the hon. Gentleman would, I am sure, pay her &#163;54: that figure should be &#163;56, of course.
<P>
The definition of the number of hours is important. Will the hon. Member for Buckingham tell the Committee--not immediately but in one of the many contributions that I am sure he will make--how many hours he needs his cleaner for? I am sure that he can afford to pay her &#163;7 per hour, as he probably gives her only 30 minutes to clean his house.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee that if there is a Division, as there is likely to be soon, the sitting will be suspended for 15 minutes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I shall not animadvert on the domestic arrangements of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham: I am sure that he is more than capable of doing so himself later in the debate, if he wishes to, and as Labour Members seem to want him to.
<P>
Amendment No. 69 is especially helpful to the Minister. I should like to explain why I think that it is helpful, and perhaps use illustrations from amendment No. 64. I hope that that will enable my contribution to be economical, so that the Committee can continue its good and swift progress. While the Committee is discussing pay reference periods and productivity, I should say that I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire for his calculation that the Committee is proceeding through the Bill at one line per hour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Piece work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> If the Committee were doing piece work, it would be in trouble.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> It is not so much piece work--if the hon. Gentleman received performance-related pay, he would owe the Committee money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I hope that the Minister will withdraw that remark when he realises how helpful to him my contribution will be. It is designed to be so.
<P>
Amendment No. 59 would not hinder the Government from doing whatever they wish after the Low Pay Commission has reported to them. As has been pointed out, the amendment may defend the Government against the possibility of judicial review. The Secretary of State would not help the Minister if she thought that he was pushing through the Committee clauses that might land her in court some years later.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry noted that, although the Minister would reject silly suggestions from the Low Pay Commission, there was a possibility of an inadvertent slip into decisions that would require judicial review. However, I am not sure that the problem is that clear cut. Our discussions about basic matters such as the level of the national minimum wage lead me to think that the division--between an absurd decision that would leave a Minister liable to judicial review and a reasonable example of ministerial intervention or decision making--is that decisive.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To avoid doubt, may I say that, although I entertained the possibility that the Low Pay Commission might produce a silly solution, in no sense is that what I anticipate? I hope that the commission's proposals are sensible and reflect the complexities of the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that clarification. However, I shall rephrase the point that I am trying to make. The dividing line between what would be open to legal challenge and what would be a sensible and reasonable decision by a Minister is not so clear cut.
<P>
Submissions to the Low Pay Commission have suggested levels for the national minimum wage of between &#163;3 and &#163;4.61. There is an enormous difference between those two figures. The same problem arises in connection with pay reference periods and how they are defined, as was apparent in the contributions from my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire and from the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas). Their respective suggestions about the degree to which the pay reference period should be fixed were reasonable but very different. The notion that reasonable behaviour by a Minister occupies a plateau, beyond which no behaviour is acceptable, is not tenable.
<P>
Pay reference periods are complex. To contend that there is no need to specify how the Secretary of State determines what pay reference period is reasonable is to pay insufficient attention to the range of industries and services that exists in this country.
<P>
There is a tendency to think in terms of the traditional working week, with people maintaining a relatively regular pattern of work. However, that is not the case; the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth said that 70 per cent. of workers now perform some sort of shift work. Such people inevitable are more likely to work irregular hours, and those hours may vary dramatically from one period to another.
<P>
Amendment No. 64 is necessary if we are to set a sensible framework allowing employers to know how they will be affected by the detailed application of the clause. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has described the problems in the agriculture sector, and my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire detailed the problems in the medical profession. In that profession, often there are periods in which very many hours are required in one pay reference period, but relatively few in another. Failure to specify a long enough period for those differences to be aggregated and smoothed out may produce perverse or unfair results for the employer or employee. Given the way that our industrial structure is changing, I suggest that more and more jobs will fall into that type of area, especially those which are relatively badly remunerated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> It does not always follow that the response to seasonality or erratic demand in business is to aggregate to a higher pay reference period. Let us stay within the confines of the Bill's structure and the implementation of the national minimum wage. In some businesses, relatively high rates of pay are paid for a very short period for working exceptionally unsocial hours. If those were brought into the calculation on a regular basis each year or each quarter, a company could pay quite low hourly rates of pay for other parts of that period if it were aggregated at too high a level. But that does not change the point with regard to amendment No. 64.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed not. One point that arises from my hon. Friend's comment is the degree of inspection and checking that would be required by the authorities, particularly in areas that see sudden bursts of high pay for working unsocial hours. Companies might try and produce that period as a pay reference period which would be unfair to the employee concerned. To stop such behaviour, there will clearly need to be more inspectors and a more expensive bureaucracy to enforce these provisions. It would be unfair not only to the employees concerned but to the taxpayer.
<P>
On the way that service industries are changing, I was thinking in particular of the increasing number of jobs, many of them part time and many of them relatively low paid, which people do at least partly out of a sense of mission. I am talking about jobs for organisations such as charities and nursery schools. [Interruption.] I am glad that hon. Members find this amusing, because it is an important and growing sector of the economy. I know from my constituency experience that many people who enjoy being in the work force are not that interested in the level of pay they receive. They think that they are doing a good and useful job.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> May I offer an example which came to my attention yesterday. The Youth Hostels Association pays those who are in charge of its hostels overnight at a rate which, calculated over the whole period during which they are on duty, would be far below any predicted level of the minimum wage. Yet those people are quite willing to do that work; they do it with enthusiasm in what they believe is a very worthwhile cause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is an extremely valuable point. It is exactly the type of real-world example for which Labour Members appear to have no regard. I know from my constituency experience of a nursery school which has some people coming in to help for one or two days a week. They do it largely because they want to help the children; they live in the village and often their children go to the school. Those who run the school say that it is valuable to have them. It is better for the children because with more adults around, more services can be provided. They could not afford to do that if they had to pay their helpers much more money. For all the sneering coming from the Government Benches, the net effect on such activity would be to reduce services and take people away from the work force. [Interruption.] If the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) has a counter example, I should be happy to hear it, but that is what is happening in the real world.
<P>
We have moved from an industrial society in which women stayed at home and men worked for 40 hours a week to a much more flexible labour market. More women are working and there are more part-time jobs. It is precisely in such service industries that marginal jobs are created which would not exist if there were too much rigidity in the structure. One reason that we are trying to introduce more flexibility into the Bill is to stop such jobs disappearing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend's reference to a constituency example prompts me to add one of my own, which illustrates the question of pay reference periods. The other week, I came across two farm shops in my constituency. Farm shops often have very different patterns of productivity and margins of profitability at different times of the year. They operate in a very narrow labour market. Staff who work there would not go to work somewhere else; they work there because the hours are convenient in relation to their children, and so on. Farm shops often offer very low rates of pay for periods when there is little going on, and much more realistic rates of pay when the shop is busy. That means that it is necessary to aggregate over quite a long period to get a realistic pay reference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend is quite right. I hope that the Minister will understand from the range of illustrations from different areas of the economy which are not linked that our point about the pay reference period is genuine and has widespread application.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Before my hon. Friend leaves the point about farm shops, from my experience the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire is entirely right. I used to operate a seasonal farm shop, which was primarily run by granny and the children. I am not at all clear what the pay reference period would have been--it would have depended entirely on how the hours were defined and what was deemed to be the work rate. There were occasionally industrial rumblings from the children about how they were paid, but I did my best to compensate them in other ways.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Member for Ashford deals with that point, may I repeat that although those examples are interesting and to a degree relevant, we are talking about pay reference periods? While hours are of course important to that debate, they are in danger of overwhelming it. I should be grateful if members of the Committee would keep to the question of pay reference periods, which is rather a narrow subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I will happily accede, Mr. Atkinson, and will forbear to pursue the world of farm shops in the Kentish countryside, fascinating though that would be.
<P>
There are general problems with which the Government have not come to grips, and the Minister may want to use the amendments as a means to do so. The first problem is with jobs that rely to a degree on enthusiasm. They are precisely the sort of jobs in which the pay reference period may well be irregular, so it will be impossible over a short space of time to establish a fair pay reference period. Such jobs are increasing as a proportion of the work force.
<P>
The second problem, which has wider application throughout the Bill, is that of micro-interference in business by Government. Many submissions say that what businesses most want is simplicity. If the Government insist on going ahead with a national minimum wage, business wants there to be a minimum degree of interference.
<P>
Amendment No. 64 is intended to establish a degree of certainty that will make life simpler for those who will be on the receiving end of the national minimum wage--whether as employers or employees--and for those enforcing it. I dare say that the Minister will reject the amendments; I assume that that is because he and his colleagues want to make decisions after the discussion is over. They seek in clause 1, as in many others, to sweep under the carpet the difficult, detailed decisions, that will make a big practical difference--for example, those relating to pay reference periods--so that they can return to them later. They are hiding behind the fact that the Low Pay Commission has not yet reported.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, although they do not appear to be aware of it, the Government have a vested interested in offering specificity and accepting our amendments? If they were to do so, businesses would have a much less potent excuse--or reason, to put it more objectively--to argue for a long lead-in period to the introduction of the national minimum wage. They would at least have been informed well in advance of one of the key administrative burdens. It is in the Government's interest, as well as that of everyone else, to offer something specific and definable now.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is precisely my point. The amendments are helpful. The Government should consider accepting them because, far from being wrecking amendments, they would improve the drafting of the Bill. They would make the Bill's application easier, both in its initial stages and in the first few years of its operation, so I should be grateful if the Minister would tell us why he thinks that they are unnecessary or unhelpful.
<P>
I suspect that the reason why the Bill does not contain such certainty is because the Government, despite their long-held commitment to a minimum wage, have not yet thought through all the implications. I urge the Minister to accept the evidence of history, from Governments of all parties--legislation prepared in such a way is likely to be bad and is likely to come back and bite the Government. I use that metaphor with painful memories of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1989.
<P>
If the details of the Bill are not sufficiently specific, and Ministers have to make policy on the hoof after it has been enacted, many of the consequent problems will land at the door of the Minister who drove it through the House. The amendments are designed to improve the Bill now and make the lives of the Minister and his colleagues easier in the future. I urge the Minister to accept them as a gift from my hon. Friends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> You will be relieved to hear, Mr. Atkinson, that I do not want to make a lengthy speech; I simply want to add a couple of brief points.
<P>
The amendments are about fairness. The debate has focused on the rate and on exclusions but, if any measure in the Bill leads to unfairness in practice, it will be the imposition of the pay reference period. For the measure to work, it will have to pass two tests. First, it must not cost jobs and destroy businesses; that will depend on the rate at which the minimum wage is set--
<P>
<H5>6.17 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>6.32 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I was saying that there are two criteria by which the legislation will be judged; first, whether it costs jobs and destroys businesses, which will depend on the level at which the minimum wage is set--the Minister has acknowledged that; and, secondly, it must not lead to unfair outcomes between workers and between workers and employers. That is why the pay reference period is critical. In general, it would be safest for that period to be as long as possible, but I accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire that if the pay reference period is over-aggregated, that, in itself, could lead to unfairness.
<P>
The problem highlights the issue of a lack of sectoral flexibility. I made the point to the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth in an intervention that the pay and remuneration practices in different industries are very different. In the building industry-- I declare an interest here--it is not unusual for workers, who are paid quite highly when they are working productively, to have a fallback rate which is offered when, for example, bad weather stops the work. It is good employment practice to offer such a fallback rate. Building workers are by no stretch of the imagination poorly paid people--I am talking about people on skilled earnings--but if the aggregation period is too short, such that over a period of a couple of weeks of extremely bad weather, they are deemed to fall within the scope of the national minimum wage, employers could be tempted to lay those men off, rather than pay them the fallback rate. That is the sort of outcome that I am anxious to avoid because it would be unfair and negative for both the employer and the employee. I am sure that that is not the Government's intention. I hope that the Minister will say something about that.
<P>
We do not want absurd outcomes at the other extreme. For example, a City bond salesman, paid only on commission, might make &#163;200,000 a year on only one sale. Neither the Minister nor I would want him to have the right to be paid at the minium wage during the other 11 months of the year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Is that Mr. Leeson?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister asked whether I have a particular bond dealer in mind. I am probably being rather conservative about the amounts of money involved, given what I have heard about the payments that bond dealers receive. Nevertheless, the point is valid and applies to other workers lower down the pay scale. Some people in sales work on commission only and might earn substantial amounts some months and nothing in others. I do not think that the Government intend that highly paid people should be entitled to the minium wage during a given month or period of time just because their remuneratin pattern is irregular.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Although we can argue the toss about which bond salesman it might be, the point that my hon. Friend is making applies more widely--for example, to professional instructors who teach at clubs, especially those who give instruction in seasonal sports. There will be periods in which they teach many hours and, necessarily, those in which they teach few. We seek an assurance that the Government do not want to implement an excessively short pay reference period. If they do not want to do so, what is the harm of stating that in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That is a very good point. Seasonal professions, employment and work that is vulnerable to the weather are especially relevant.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will take these comments in the spirit in which they are made. No one wants to see tabloid newspaper headlines about someone earning &#163;100,000 a year who, nevertheless, is able to force his employer to pay him the minimum wage. We are seeking the longest sensible pay reference period to avoid such absurd outcomes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Daventry for the spirit in which he spoke to the amendment. This is a complex issue, as the speeches of Labour and Opposition Members have shown. My hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth mentioned some of the complexities in different sectors. Conservative Members described various scenarios--some more believable than others. However, their general drift was to tell the Government of their perception of the need to get clause 1 right. It is in all of our interests that that happens. The question is: by what process should that be done?
<P>
I shall deal with the Low Pay Commission's role in a minute. The regulatory regime will ensure that the calculation of the minimum wage is fair, reasonable and seen by all involved to operate appropriately--if not, the process will be brought into disrepute. It is important to the Government's strategy that the minimum wage is a success.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I welcome the tone in which the Minister has prefaced his remarks. However, given what was said by the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth, is not it important to ensure that the regulations are structured correctly? If that were done sufficiently flexibly to reflect the complexities of the real world, the subsequent risk of legal challenge could diminish The regulations would then be appropriate for all the difficult situations that could arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I will deal with that in a few moments. I feel that I am on remand here. As a former Minister, the hon. Member for Daventry has pointed out from the outset the problems and pitfalls that Ministers face in making decisions. Because of the legislative framework, work at the DTI involves other Departments and, almost on a minute-by-minute basis, the DTI faces such problems. Some of its Ministers have to make decisions in a way that is on a continuum in relation to the legislation, and have to make personal judgments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall give way in a moment.
<P>
We do not want to fall into the trap into which the previous Government fell. I do not wish to make a party political point, but under the previous Government, some departments made a regular trip to the court, which found that Ministers had acted unreasonably or in a way that was contrary to the court's powers, by using extensive powers that they did not previously have. It is therefore important, from the perspectives of our role as Ministers and of the success of the legislation, that once the minimum wage is established, there is a growing acceptance of the Government's reasoned approach and of the fact that the minimum wage will have been implemented in a way that involves employers, through the Low Pay Commission, so that they are appropriately consulted, and in a way that is not bureaucratic or burdensome, is easily understandable and does not cause friction between employer and employee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I want to make two brief inquiries of the Minister. First, during the election campaign, officials properly anticipated several different outcomes and worked on policies that they might then be responsible for bringing into effect. In that context, did DTI officials do any work during that time on pay reference periods and if so, could we be told something about it? Secondly, in the Government's submission to the Low Pay Commission, which, the Minister will forgive me for saying, seems to resemble Pandora's box, will there be a reference to pay reference periods?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> If I have got it right, the hon. Gentleman asked me first whether officials did work prior to Ministers coming into place. I have no knowledge of that because, unfortunately, I had to go around the Department trying to get the keys for the previous Government's files on the subject. I would be interested to know what they did. I am looking at officials with a smile on my face--I am joking. Rightly, all the documents are sealed and I am not sure whether they will be opened in 30 years, 30 months or 30 weeks. The hon. Gentleman will have to try and live a little longer to find out what his colleagues did in government.
<P>
On the second issue, I said at our previous sitting that as soon as it was available to the Low Pay Commission, I would disclose the Government's evidence to the Committee. That commitment was given and will be honoured. The hon. Member for Buckingham made a slight jibe in saying that the Government were taking a great deal of time over that. I concede that that is true--it is important that the Government should take time and should proceed in a considered way. That evidence should take into account Whitehall's views by considering the opinions of all Departments. That will be done and the hon. Gentleman has only to wait a little longer before all will be revealed. I shall also place the evidence in the Library, so that other right hon. and hon. Members have access to it.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is unclear in amendment No. 59 whether the regionalist test introduces a subjective or an objective element. For example, in whose view must the period chosen be ``reasonable''? If it is the Secretary of State, the amendment would achieve nothing. Obviously she will prescribe a period that she believes to be reasonable--on that basis, the amendment is unnecessary. If, on the other hand, the test is objective, in the event of a legal challenge it would be for the courts to decide whether the period chosen by the Secretary of State was reasonable. A challenge would therefore lead to the court substituting its view of a reasonable period for the Secretary of State's view. The courts are not readily equipped to do that.
<P>
The Bill as drafted means that the Secretary of State could be challenged only if the period that she chose was perverse--that is, a period that no reasonable Secretary of State would have chosen. That is how it should be. It is normal practice for Governments of all political persuasions and there is no novelty in it.
<P>
Under the amendment, if the Secretary of State chose a period that a reasonable Secretary of State could have chosen, others would have the right to substitute their views for hers. That does not seem right. It is always difficult to resist the inclusion of the word ``reasonable'' because it seems unreasonable to do so, but surprisingly often the word achieves nothing or causes difficulties. I do not imagine for a moment that the Secretary of State would want to be unreasonable--I know her well.
<P>
Given what I said a few moments ago, Conservative Members and my hon. Friends will realise that the Government will be careful in their relationship with the Low Pay Commission. We will ensure that it has the opportunity to deal with these matters so that we get them right.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I hear what the Minister says about the Secretary of State being unlikely to be unreasonable, but is not it disappointing and a missed opportunity that the Secretary of State's reference to the Low Pay Commission does not set out any desired outcome from the commission's deliberations? It does not say, for example, that it should ensure that there is fairness between workers and that there should be no erratic or bizarre outcomes as a result of the selection of the pay period.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> We wrote to the commission on 5 December to say that we wanted it to consider this matter and asking it to provide proposals for a period or periods. That is important. Given that we had already asked the commission to take evidence on the rate and related matters from employers, employers organisations and trade unions, it was not inconsistent also to involve them in considering this issue, taking evidence and coming forward with reasonable proposals for a period or periods. That is consistent with the nature of the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It occurs to me that that second letter, which does not contain the Low Pay's Commission's terms of reference, may not be in the possession of all members of the Committee. It would therefore be helpful if the Minister would circulate it to all of us for the avoidance of any doubt.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman did not mean that there was any doubt that I would send it. I will put the letter on the record. It is dated 5 December and is from Mr. Wright, the senior official in the Department who is responsible for pay, to John Rhodes, the secretary of the Low Pay Commission. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I am writing at the request of Ministers to draw clause 5 of the National Minimum Wage Bill to the attention of the Low Pay Commission.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Clause 5 requires the Secretary of State to refer various matters to the Low Pay Commission for consideration before making first regulations under clauses 1(3) or (4) or clause 2 of the Bill. The matters that must be referred are listed in clause 5(2) of the Bill. Ministers have therefore asked for the Commission to consider those matters listed in clause 5(2) and include its views in its report to the Prime Minister which is due by the end of May 1998 at the latest.<P>

So the commission has been formally invited to participate in this process and to come forward with its recommendations.
<P>
The regulations fixing the pay reference period will of course be discussed and debated in Parliament as well. There is a double lock on the Government in this matter. There is a total commitment to take evidence which is to be assessed independently, to put forward recommendations independently to the Secretary of State, and to do so in a reasonable way. The Low Pay Commission will determine whether it should be a period or periods. That will then come before the House for consideration.
<P>
As to what period of time constitutes a reasonable one in determining pay reference periods, we are of course aware of the huge variety of working arrangements. That is another reason why the Low Pay Commission was asked to consider the matter. Conservative Members and my right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth cited a range of potential areas in which it would be of major interest to employers and their employees to ensure that reference periods were fixed in a way that was commensurate with their working relationships and which easily defined whether the payment made in that period was commensurate with the national minimum wage. Therefore, it is important that the process should be dealt with in that way.
<P>
I hope that I am persuading the Committee that we are not fobbing anything off. Because of the diversification in the labour market we are genuinely trying to ensure the maximum potential for those who will be affected by the proposals by giving them an input into the policy deliberations.
<P>
In listening to this explanation, Conservative Membrs will either decide to come back at a later date if they are not satisfied or to press the amendment to a vote. That is for them to decide, but I hope that in explaining this, I am demonstrating the seriousness with which the Government take the matter.
<P>
If the Low Pay Commission makes recommendations on the matters referred to under clause 5(2) as set out in Mr. Wright's letter, and if the Secretary of State departs from the recommendations, she must lay a report before Parliament to explain why. This is another lock--another assurance--for both the House and, as importantly, for the employers and employees. It will ensure that when the Government come to decide about the recommendations, they have to act in a way that sets out clearly and specifically the reasons for such decisions. I think that that, to coin a phrase, is acting reasonably. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my explanation in good faith. We are not accepting the amendment because the points that he has made are already covered.
<P>
It is quite straightforward in many ways: a pay reference period is needed, whatever the length. The hon. Member for Daventry spoke about his farm worker's case. We shall probably come back to that when we debate the clause on agricultural wages. The whole purpose of the reference period regarding the farm worker is to average out the hours worked over the period so that it takes account of irregular hours. That is what we are trying to arrive at ultimately--a process to ensure that in the peaks and troughs there is a mechanism that identifies to employers and employees a capacity to determine between them that the individual is receiving at least the national minimum wage. With those remarks, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my comments in the spirit in which they have been made, and that we can move on to debate other issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Committee has done itself a bit of good with this debate. It has been of a very high quality. I was particularly interested in the distinguished and learned contribution of the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth. I was also interested in the Minister's contribution, as well as those of my hon. Friends.
<P>
We have a series of common objectives and understandings. First, we understand that the world is now complex, with a whole series of perfectly reasonable arrangements that are not in any sense evasive of the Government's principle. They arise in the normal course of events and reflect the different patterns of pay reference periods and periods of remuneration.
<P>
We understand some of the difficulties in approaching the matter reasonably. The Minister did himself a bit of good by responding sensitively. We will reflect carefully on the structure of his argument as to how he intends to deal with the matter. It sounded good and we were encouraged. I hope that that is a precursor. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 67, That the clause stand part of the Bill:--
