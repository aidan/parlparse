<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000215"></a>Mr.
David Laws (Yeovil) (LD):</b> Welcome back to the Chair,
Mrs. Anderson. Before the Committee adjourned, we were
discussing the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton and those in my name and that of my hon. Friend the
Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole. I was looking at the impact
assessment, which is always interesting on this Bill, and I mentioned
the criticisms in that impact assessment of the existing SIP system,
which was described as an inefficient use of resources.</div>
<a name="10020478000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The impact
assessment also makes clear what the clause is designed to
tackle&#151;the inability of SIPs to get involved outside
the narrow area of educational attainment&#151;and the issue is
whether the system could be restructured to provide SIPs with a greater
role and to reduce the role of link advisers. The amendments relate
directly to those issues and to whether this is a sensible way of
focusing the role of SIPs and whether the expenditure of public money
is justifiable, especially as the Government estimate it to be about
&#163;325 million at present
values.</div><a name="10020478000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to echo some of the criticisms and concerns that were
expressed earlier by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton. Amendments 68, 198 and 199 raise the issue of whether we
want SIPs to have a wider focus. Do we want them to be involved in
well-being and other matters, or is it sensible for them to focus on
what is presently the core responsibility of educational
attainment?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column456" />Column number: 456</div><a name="10020478000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">In part, the
answer depends on what role we see for SIPs. In our view, SIPs could
play a role as part of the accountability mechanism that enables
schools to deliver, particularly on their core educational
requirements. That could be a mechanism for local authorities to engage
with schools through individuals with relevant expertise, so that they
understand what job they are doing, find out whether educational
attainment is being improved, and potentially, as the Government
indicate, broker support from other organisations. Some people might
feel that the local authority is often not qualified to offer much of
that support, but there could be a role for SIPs in brokering support.
However, there is an issue about whether that is the right way for SIPs
to deliver on that responsibility.</div>
<a name="10020478000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments raise three issues. First, whether it is sensible
for SIPs to have that responsibility for well-being. I am not clear
that it is sensible, which is why amendments 198 and 199
essentially support the thrust of amendment 68.
The second issue relates to amendment 194, tabled by the
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, and is whether schools
should have a veto over their SIP. That is not something that we would
support, as we believe that SIPs should have a role not only in
supporting schools, but in holding them to account.</div>
<a name="10020478000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">We certainly
would not want local authorities to ignore the situation where a school
expressed concerns that a SIP was not appropriately qualified. If that
is part of the accountability mechanism, we are not convinced that it
makes sense for schools to have an outright veto over their SIP, as it
is possible that the SIP might deliver unpleasant news or have a view
that a school is failing. If the governing body is able to veto the SIP
that seeks to hold it to account, it would not be a very effective
mechanism for holding a school to account.</div>
<a name="10020478000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is this the
right way to deliver that type of school improvement and accountability
in the future? We need to look at the prescriptiveness involved, not
only in the way that the Government want to widen the role of SIPs, but
in the assumptions made in the impact assessment about how SIPs will
operate in the future, the number of days that they will spend in
individual schools and how that will be linked to highly or poorly
performing schools.</div>
<a name="10020478000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We appear to
have a prescriptive, top-down mechanism for central Government to
deliver a system of local accountability and improvement. Typically for
this Government, the system is not genuinely localised: local
authorities cannot decide whether they want SIPs, whether they want to
use existing link advisers, how they want to support schools and how
many days they want the SIPs to spend in schools. It is extremely
top-down and
prescribed.</div><a name="10020478000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are also worried whether the policy will deliver the zero net impact,
which is what the Government are estimating and which depends heavily
on the assumption that the scrapping of links advisers would offset the
additional costs of school improvement partners. Amendment 87 would
allow local authorities greater freedom and flexibility in how they use
SIPs. It would allow them to opt out of the guidance that the
Government otherwise intend to impose on local authorities.</div>
<a name="10020478000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such changes
would genuinely deliver a SIPs system that would be adaptable on the
basis of a local authority&#146;s priorities and correspond with its
views of what it needed to support school improvement. It would not be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 457</div>a top-down approach that would tell local authorities how to use SIPs to
deliver local accountability&#151;a role that should be provided by
the local authority. The clause is typical of the Government, and what
we fear is embedded in
it.</div><a name="10020478000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000216"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Mr. Vernon
Coaker):</b> Good afternoon to you, Mrs. Anderson,
and members of the Committee. The amendments tabled by the hon. Members
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for Yeovil would remove the two
emphasises given to the SIP&#146;s role to improve the well-being of
pupils at the school. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton believes that the clause would dilute the emphasis that a
SIP should have on improving educational attainment at the school. Both
emphasises are necessary.</div>
<a name="10020478000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many of
the schools that have featured in our debates, we cannot talk about
improving standards without considering the well-being of the pupil.
Someone acting as the broker between the school and the local authority
would need to be involved in what was happening outside a school in
respect of health, families, youth provision, social services,
children&#146;s services, employment and housing if that person is to
address school improvement overall. The school improvement partner is
the right person to do that. We will not take away the responsibility
from the local authority, but the person will act as a direct contact
with the school. Action or improvement plans will be a matter for the
school to work out to the SIP&#146;s satisfaction. I am a little
surprised at the amendment, as it is a fundamental part of a
SIP&#146;s role not to see the school in
isolation.</div><a name="10020478000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Yeovil is right that significant investment will be
used in such matters. It is expected that SIPs will spend more time
working with schools to deliver an outcome, which is extremely
important, particularly if it is seen in the context of the holistic
view of improving standards in schools. Of course, it matters to the
hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for Yeovil that we
focus on educational standards. I am not saying that there should be no
such focus, but just that well-being should be a part of it.</div>
<a name="10020478000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a further
point made by the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and
for Yeovil, a national strategies survey indicates that 80 to 90 per
cent. of head teachers think that their schools benefit from school
improvement partners. Another amendment proposes that schools should be
able to disregard advice with respect to SIPs. I do not accept that; we
would to go too far if we said that a SIP could not stay in role if the
heads and governors say that they did not want them. It may be that
there is a breakdown in the relationship or that a head teacher is not
willing to confront the improvement that is necessary in the school,
rather than the school improvement partner being the problem.</div>
<a name="10020478000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we were to
pass amendment 194, tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, a head teacher could say, &#147;We don&#146;t like
that improvement plan,&#148; even though most other people thought
that it was a good idea, and the school improvement partner would be
left with no role at all, which would not be an appropriate way
forward.</div>
<a name="10020478000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">School
improvement partners are an important part of the school reform system.
Including well-being as part of their tasks and responsibilities is a
crucial part 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column458" />Column number: 458</div>of raising standards and ensuring that opportunities exist for all our
young people in all our schools. With those remarks, I hope that the
hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="10020478000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000217"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I shall not prolong the debate too much. It is clear
that there is a difference of opinion between ourselves and the
Minister on at least two of the issues in the amendments. I want to
register our continuing concern that, although the rhetoric of
Government policy focuses on local accountability, the extent to which
the provision seeks to prescribe how each local authority should
essentially run its own systems of school accountability and the
delivery of advice about school improvement is very depressing and
reflects still a mentality in which Westminster and Whitehall know
best, rather than assuming that local areas have the skills and ability
to design systems that are based on their own needs, rather than on
some central prescription.</div>
<a name="10020478000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020478000218"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): I am
keen to progress rapidly, so that we can get to the home education
clauses. Many people, both inside and outside the Committee, are keen
for us to consider such important issues for a considerable time, so I
shall make two quick points. I do not believe that a concern over
diluting the emphasis on educational standards is my worry; it is
whether the same person can, with expertise, advise both on raising
educational standards and on the well-being issues, because they are
very different matters.</div>
<a name="10020478000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point relates to a breakdown in the relationship between the SIP and
the head. Such a breakdown may well be the head&#146;s fault in some
circumstances. None the less, if a SIP is meant to be a critical friend
and not an adversarial inspector, regardless of who is to blame for the
breakdown in the relationship, a new SIP is needed. The National Union
of Teachers is concerned about that and feels that there should be an
appeals process for governing bodies in the event of a breakdown and
the SIP is regarded as unsuitable. I have made my two comments; we have
had a good debate; and I ask leave of the Committee to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020478000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000221"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Like the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, I am convinced of the need at least to touch on the
issue of home education, even though we clearly have not been given
enough time for the scrutiny of the Bill. Before we get to home
education, however, we have to deal with a couple of incredibly
important clauses, which could have a major impact, for better or for
worse, on the schools system. One of those issues is the licence to
practise, which we will come to in a moment, and the other one is the
provision of information about schools. In shorthand terms, that is
known as the school report card.</div>
<a name="10020478000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
time constraints, you probably want to avoid a stand part debate, Mrs
Anderson, so I hope that you do not mind if I set out some of our views
at the beginning and then link in the
amendments.</div><a name="10020478000190"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="10020478000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are sympathetic to the idea that the existing school accountability
framework needs fundamental review. All sorts of different elements of
school accountability have grown up over time. John Dunford, the widely
respected head of the Association of School and College Leaders
professional group, often presents to me&#151;and, I suspect, to
those in the other two major parties&#151;a diagram with schools in
the middle surrounded by the vast array of different organisations and
mechanisms that are supposed to hold them to account. When he first
showed me the diagram a couple of years ago, I did not even know what
all the bodies were, because there were so
many.</div><a name="10020478000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">School
accountability is clearly incredibly important, but so is
accountability not being excessively expensive, not replicating itself,
and being useful to parents and those responsible for holding schools
to account&#151;from the head teacher and the governing body to local
authorities and others. At the moment, there is concern that the
accountability system replicates a lot that need not be replicated, and
does not often provide information that is useful to parents when
making decisions. Teaching organisations are often critical of the
league tables, although my response is that once information is
available about school matters and school performance, keeping such
information secret is impossible, as we have discovered in this
place.</div><a name="10020478000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
legitimate concern is that existing league tables reflect to a large
extent the social catchments of the schools in which they sit, and do
not always give us an idea of whether schools in tough areas are
performing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column460" />Column number: 460</div>particularly well or badly set against their challenges. Sometimes the
tables do not give us an idea of whether schools in leafier areas, or
in middle-ranking areas for social deprivation, are doing a good
job.</div><a name="10020478000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are not simply to end up with an unreasonable focus on the bottom
10, 20 or 30 per cent. of schools, but are to hold them all to account,
we need to find a better mechanism. That has been offered to us in the
school report card, a version of which I have obtained from the
Minister, who kindly circulated a draft the other day&#151;I assume
that the size had been blown up to help those with defective eyesight.
It was useful to have a copy before the debate so that we could reflect
on how useful it will be and on whether the process will get rid of
information that we do not
need.</div><a name="10020478000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
first comment is that I was expecting the Government&#146;s idea to
be a rather big one&#151;something rather radical&#151;that would,
for example, help me, as a local MP, to make judgments about the
schools in my area. I expected to see more refined information about
how schools were performing set against their catchments so that we
could compare performance to the degree of challenge. However, when we
look at the report card and, even more so, the impact
assessment&#151;I commend its precision, detail and helpfulness to
the Committee&#151;we discover that we have not a mountain of a
policy but a bit of a
molehill.</div><a name="10020478000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Instead
of the report card delivering a better, more refined judgment about
individual schools, the impact assessment says that all it will do is
consolidate existing available school information on, essentially, one
piece of paper, and deal with what is described as the market failure
of imperfect information by combining information sources, therefore
presenting economies of scale. Another clue comes from the annual cost
of the proposal: a total annual cost for the entire thing, in net
present value terms, of &#163;1.269 million. The costs all appear to
be one-off, up-front transitional ones, because some information is
already collected by the Department, while other information is held by
Ofsted and other bodies. The assessment says that &#147;significant
additional running costs&#148; are not expected, so there will be a
tiny set-up cost and, apparently, no average running costs at all, as
well as no collection of additional information or any processing of
data&#151;that is why there is a low
cost.</div><a name="10020478000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wonder whether the report card will deliver the real improvement in
school accountability that I hoped we might see. As I have said, I do
not think that the existing mechanisms of school accountability are
good. The way in which the Home Office now compares the basic command
units of different police forces is an example of better practice,
although not necessarily of best practice. If I want to compare the
east Somerset BCU with other forces, I compare it not with a tough part
of Bristol that will always have more crime, and so always flatter east
Somerset, but with BCUs with a similar level of
challenge.</div><a name="10020478000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government will probably say that the pupil progress element
demonstrates an element of value added, but I think that this is a
missed opportunity. We should find an accessible way&#151;pupil
progress is not accessible for most people&#151;in which to compare
schools depending on their catchments so that people have a clear idea
of whether a school is performing well or badly compared with other
schools with a similar level of challenge. No doubt other hon. Members
will have better suggestions on how we could compare schools.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column461" />Column number: 461</div><a name="10020478000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to get away from the problem that much of what is in the league
tables&#151;although not all of it, before the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton says anything&#151;is determined by social
catchment. That is not to say that we should have low expectations of
schools in tough areas. We should have high expectations of
all schools. There are schools with all kinds of social catchments that
perform incredibly. A comparison using a simplistic league table of a
school in the richest community in the country with a school
in the most chaotic community will deliver meaningless
information. My concern is that this is a missed opportunity to deliver
more meaningful
information.</div><a name="10020478000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sceptical about whether much of the information on the report card
will prove useful. I might sound a little Gibbish or Bognorish saying
these things, but I baulk at the bits about pupil perception, parent
perception, pupil well-being and partnership working. I fear not only
that it is all rather vague and meaningless and does not come to the
crunch of whether a school is doing a good job, but that those things
will be put into the computer somewhere in the Department for Children,
Schools and Families&#151;I will come back to that later&#151;to
produce the overall grade in the corner of the school report card,
which is the only new element. I assume that the six measures from
pupil progress down to narrowing gaps will be turned into one grade
that sums up the quality of the
school.</div><a name="10020478000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
first, I was sympathetic to the idea of straightforward and blunt
accountability and thought that delivering one grade would give
clarity. I say that with reservations because if hon. Members were
asked whether our performance should be measured by one grade, we would
quickly come up with 20 or 30 good reasons why doing so would be
meaningless. One of those reasons might relate to the experience of
school report cards in New York. I understand that when they were first
introduced, the grade was regarded as giving a clear signal of where
improvement needed to be made. There was a fairly predictable
distribution of grades among the schools, with about 20 per cent. of
schools getting As, Bs, Cs, Ds and Es. Although I do not have
the figures at my fingertips, I read recently that over the
past few years, the number of schools graded A had rocketed and that
the overwhelming majority now have
As.</div><a name="10020478000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Precisely
the same thing would happen if MPs were graded on five or six things,
such as making interventions in Committee or signing early-day motions.
We would all sign every daft EDM without any scrutiny because we would
want to move up the league table. We would also do all the other things
and all suddenly get As. Everyone would realise that it was a waste of
time because all the MPs would have As, whereas people would know that
they were not all
As.</div><a name="10020478000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
therefore think that the A, B, C, D grading might be
counter-productive. It will certainly anger schools and it will lead to
the inevitable inclusion of all sorts of other things. Schools do not
want to be compared only on the basis of attainment and results; they
want a wide range of other issues to be taken into account, but the
measure would start watering that down. The only new thing in the
school report card will probably not be valuable, and needs to be
dumped.</div><a name="10020478000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020478000222"></a><b class="B">Martin
Linton</b> (Battersea) (Lab): The reason why report cards for
MPs are not necessary is because we are on maximum five-year contracts.
I am sure that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column462" />Column number: 462</div>hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that schools should be put on a
five-year contract. Will he concede that, in the absence of anything
else, it will be helpful to
parents?</div><a name="10020478000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000223"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am not sure whether teachers would share that
view. I think that they would say, &#147;Look, we are accountable day
to day and term to term in all sorts of ways.&#148; If parents do not
like a school, they can take their children away, and there is
immediate accountability. As a Member of Parliament, we have
accountability every five years, which is not very much. If
someone was in an area that has always had a Conservative
or Labour MP with a 20,000 majority, or even a
Liberal Democrat MP these days&#151;with a
large majority, anyway&#151;the amount of
accountability, if they are unhappy, is quite limited. I think that
when the hon. Gentleman meets his local teachers, they might not be
quite as attracted by his argument. There are also all the other things
that do not give us a clear idea, such as partnership working, to which
I suspect the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will
object in a
moment.</div><a name="10020478000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
therefore seems likely that the measure will be&#151;I say this with
great disappointment, and without a determination to resist it for its
own sake&#151;a bit of a waste of time and a big missed opportunity,
which is something that I care about. This mechanism could be valuable,
and we could end up with two or three&#151;please not four, five, six
or seven&#151;meaningful comparators. It would not initially be
perfect, and schools would complain about it, as would be the case with
comparators of MPs, but it would be fairer than existing
league tables. It would shed light on why some schools do
better than others and enable us to be fair to
the people who teach in and govern schools when we make
comparisons about their
jobs.</div><a name="10020478000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments that we have tabled, to which I will speak briefly, try to
address some of the problems. Amendment 200 and the Conservative
amendment 69 address the question of whether it is worth the candle to
collect all the information to put into a school report card that is
not delivering anything new from schools, but no doubt imposing some
burdens on them. Amendment 201 suggests that as part of the
school report card, there should be a better attempt to assist people
to make informed judgments by facilitating comparisons of schools and
colleges that have similar people characteristics, in the same way in
which the Home Office compares
BCUs.</div><a name="10020478000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
202, which I have not touched on so far, questions whether it is
sensible for the Department for Children, Schools and Families to be
the guardian of the school report card. One of the things that has been
corrosive to education over the past 10 years is that because the
Government are so determined to improve schools, for all the right
reasons, we have ended up with incentives for the Government to
conspire in a situation in which results are seen to be
rising&#151;where we put all the attention into the continuing
development borderline&#151;instead of one of trying to deliver for
all young people. If we are to have a school accountability system and
the As and Bs are published annually, the Minister will get it in the
neck if the number of As go down, as the system will also hold the
Government to account. What is the point of the Government being held
to account in such a way when they themselves are the guardians of the
new system? If the new system is to be effective, it should be run
either by local authorities, who should, in our view, be the first tier
of accountability, or, if we do 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 463</div>not trust local authorities because they are compromised by their job of
school improvement, by Ofsted. The last people who should be running
the system are the
DCSF.</div><a name="10020478000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment 225 would require the information collected on schools in
this way to be subject to an annual report to Parliament.</div>
<a name="10020478000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will comfort us on those issues. However, at the moment, I
fear that this is a good idea badly delivered, and not worth
implementing in its existing form.</div>
<a name="10020478000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000224"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. I share
many of his observations regarding the school report card. He is right
that there are many things in here that, as he described, are
&#147;Gibbish&#148;, although I am not sure when I became an
adjective&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Perhaps the hon.
Gentleman meant &#147;gibberish&#148; rather than
&#147;Gibbish&#148;.</div><a name="10020478000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parents&#146;
perceptions are an important factor when judging a school. Leaving that
aside, I share many of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns about the
card. Clause 20 amends the Education Act 1996 to enable the
information to be gathered for the Government&#146;s policy of a
school report card. The consultation paper said that the report card
was necessary because league tables contain so much information
that</div><a name="10020478000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;they
can be difficult for parents to use, do not signal clearly the relative
importance of different academic outcomes and, with the exception of
the pupils&#146; attendance rate, do not contain information about
outcomes relating to other aspects of pupils&#146;
wellbeing.&#148;</div><a name="10020478000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the view of the consultation document. The answer, according to the
Government, is to have a school report card with an overall
score.</div><a name="10020478000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
take the view that we should publish all the data currently held on
schools, whether that is the proportion gaining five or more GCSEs, the
proportion gaining eight or more GCSEs at grades A* to C, or the
proportion gaining an A or B in physics GCSE. Different parents have
different priorities about what they want from a school for their
children, and we do not believe that it is possible to provide an
overall score, which will inevitably involve a very subjective
judgement.</div><a name="10020478000191"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="10020478000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I looked at the example of the report card that the Minister circulated
last week, I was concerned that the GCSE figures seemed to have been
transformed into a bar chart setting out whether the pupil progress, or
pupil attainment, was A, B, C or D. There was no mention of five GCSEs
at A* to C, including English and maths, so there is a reduction in the
amount of information available, not a consolidation of the
data.</div><a name="10020478000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
school report card is not an original idea, as the hon. Member for
Yeovil said. It was introduced in New York in 2007, and last
year&#146;s scores showed that 84 per cent. of the 1,058 elementary
and middle schools were awarded an A rating, and 13 per cent. received
a B grade. The New York <i class="I">Daily News</i> said at the time&#151;that
sounds like a song from Barbra
Streisand&#151;that:</div><a name="10020478000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
report card system makes a mockery of accountability. No one can be
held accountable when almost everyone gets an A or B. No one can tell
which schools are getting better or worse. Nor do parents get enough
information to make good choices.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column464" />Column number: 464</div><a name="10020478000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">We share the concerns
expressed by the people of New York about the report card system as
introduced in that
city.</div><a name="10020478000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
69 would add a new source of information about a school&#146;s
performance, in addition to the views of prescribed persons, which is
already provided for by clause 20. We would add details of the
proportion of pupils who go on to further and higher education and the
ultimate employment and training that such pupils undertake. If we want
a more rounded set of data to describe the outcomes of a school, this
would be far more pertinent information in so far as parents are
concerned than some of the nebulous, &#147;Gibbish&#148; and
subjective criteria set out in the White Paper and consultation
document.</div><a name="10020478000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wanted to keep my remarks brief so that we could get on to the home
education provisions as quickly as possible, so with those few words, I
await the Minister&#146;s response.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000225"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> We have had an interesting, short
debate.</div><a name="10020478000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Yeovil knows, there is a two-year pilot on the
report card, which started in September 2009, so it is not the finished
article. There is a lot of work to be done on how we take it forward,
but if we manage to get the report card right, it will be a fundamental
and radical reform that will answer the demand of schools up and down
the country, which is, &#147;Do not let our school be judged on just
the raw attainment scores.&#148; The hon. Gentleman was at a
conference with me earlier today at which that plea was also heard.
Doing that is a real challenge, however, because as we all know, people
will often look at just that raw attainment
score.</div><a name="10020478000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have often said in Committee, the Government believe that we need to
move on from that, and the fact that that is difficult and a challenge
should not stop people. We all have experience of schools and, as
someone who has taught, I know that people have said over a
considerable period that schools should be judged not only on their raw
attainment scores, but on the progress that they make with their
pupils. The pupil progress part is about trying to do that. For the
first time, we are laying out specifically in a report that goes to
every parent something that will allow them to make a judgment about
that.</div>
<a name="10020478000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, on
pupil well-being&#151;I will be brief, Mrs.
Anderson&#151;what is it that parents often say when they go into the
school? Of course they are interested in the academic standards in the
school, but when I was teaching&#151;I am sure my hon. Friend the
Member for Stourbridge and others have experienced this&#151;people
would ask what the school was like with respect to bullying. They would
also ask, &#147;Are people happy? Do they enjoy themselves? Are they
looked after?&#148; The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole
must agree that that should be part of the whole picture, because
everything for which she has ever campaigned in Parliament has been
about trying to ensure that the rights, voice and happiness of the
child are not seen as some glib accessory that is unimportant. Those
things are a fundamental part of any judgment about how well an
institution is doing. It is difficult but important to include those
things. Similarly, even the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton thinks that parental perception is a good idea.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column465" />Column number: 465</div><a name="10020478000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
big issue that we are all united about is narrowing the gap in pupil
performance. How do we narrow the gap between social background and
educational attainment? I agree with the point made by both hon.
Gentlemen&#151;it is difficult. However, if we were to accept the
amendments, we would not have the primary legislation available to
bring together the information that is required to try to come to a
determination about the grade. Exactly how that is done is part of what
the pilots are about. Some 700 schools throughout the country are
looking to see how the information is gathered. If we were to pass the
amendments, they would not be able to do that, and that would
completely preclude any attempt to try to introduce the report
card.</div><a name="10020478000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020478000226"></a><b class="B">Caroline
Flint</b> (Don Valley) (Lab): I am not sure why pilots always
have to take two years. Will my hon. Friend explain what
work has been done in the lead up to the pilots with focus groups of
parents and others about what information they want? I hear what he is
saying about his background as a teacher and what teachers want, but
parents might want something a bit different that gives them a much
clearer idea about what is happening in a school. I accept his point
that this is not the final article, but I am a little uncertain about
whether, in the pilots, parents have just been given a
sample to work with, or whether they have been able to intervene on
what that sample should be providing for them in terms of oversight of
the school and what it is
doing.</div><a name="10020478000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000227"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is a good point. My right hon. Friend is
right to point out the need to understand parents&#146; views.
Indeed, part of the work that was done to bring the measure together
involved looking at what parents were saying. Part of the ongoing work
through the pilots will be about not only teachers and education
professionals, but what parents think and the information that they
would find useful, so I can reassure her on that point. We have
involved and will involve parents, but they have said to us that, as
well as the raw attainment score, they want to know how to find out
some of these other things with regards to a school. They want to have
some way in which that can be reported to
them.</div><a name="10020478000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000228"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that the only effect of
the proposals of the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
and for Yeovil would be to drive parents back on to the Ofsted grade
and the GCSE score as the only ways by which to judge schools? That
would result in all the other information fed into a school report
being
ignored.</div><a name="10020478000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000229"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Of course, raw attainment and what Ofsted says are
important, but my hon. Friend is right in the sense that, alongside
that, we must have a broader picture of what a school is about and what
it is achieving in a way that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for
Don Valley said, is acceptable and understandable to parents and, above
all, meaningful to them. We are attempting to do
that.</div><a name="10020478000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
reach those grades, we need to gather the information. I therefore ask
the hon. Member for Yeovil to reconsider whether he wishes to press his
amendments further. If we want to see whether we can make the policy
meaningful, we must have the power to gather the
information.</div><a name="10020478000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for amendment 69, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
seems to believe that clause 20 has been used to substitute a power to
collect information 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column466" />Column number: 466</div>on the views of prescribed persons in place of the existing power in
respect of information about the continuing education, employment or
training of pupils leaving a school. In fact, the clause inserts a new
provision on collecting the views of prescribed persons as an addition
to the existing provision to collect such pupil information. I hope
that the hon. Gentleman is reassured that the amendment is unnecessary.
Following my brief but important comments, I hope that it will not be
pressed to a
Division.</div><a name="10020478000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000230"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am, as ever, grateful to the Minister. This is a
huge opportunity, and I agree with all that he said about the
deficiencies in the existing accountability regime. The problem is that
that does not take us any further. It is one thing for the Government
to say that the existing accountability regime is poor, but it is
another for us to vote through something that does not deal with the
deficiencies of that regime. The policy has four weaknesses. First, it
should be administered not by the Department, but by Ofsted or the
local authorities. Secondly, and most importantly, there is no new
content, even though the Government make a virtue of that in the impact
assessment, in contrast to the comment made by the hon. Member for
Battersea. All the system does is to consolidate things that are
already available, and that is part of the problem because the things
already available are not doing to the
job.</div><a name="10020478000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
there are already other mechanisms for assessments to be made of the
non-educational attainment elements. That happens in all the Ofsted
reports. Indeed, the model of the school report card reports the Ofsted
judgments on behaviour, safeguarding and other issues. Finally, we have
still not resolved the problem of whether or not there should be a
grade. It is important to the people working in the establishments that
they should have confidence that the grade is derived in a sensible
way. Even the Government&#146;s report highlights the possible
anomalies that will arise when we grade, for example, one school as
grade 2 on effectiveness, pupils&#146; behaviour and safeguarding
and, at the same time, there is an overall score of A. There is already
a discrepancy and we need a thought-out and considered process of
reconciling an overall grade given by a report card and the fact that
it is different from the grade given by
Ofsted.</div><a name="10020478000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
problem is not that the policy is not well-meaning and not that it is
unnecessary, but that it is not right. We are told by people in schools
and those who represent teachers and parents, &#147;Don&#146;t
legislate for things that are half-baked. Don&#146;t do things that
will deliver additional levels of cost and bureaucracy but will not do
the job.&#148; It is with sadness that I say that although I will not
press any of the amendments to a Division, we will want to divide on
clause stand part. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020478000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000247"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I beg to move amendment 203, in
clause 22, page 22, line 10, at
end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(7) The Secretary
of State shall not exercise any of the powers conferred by subsections
(1) to (6) above
without&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) consulting
the local authority in which the school is located,
and</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) receiving advice
supporting the planned actions from an independent body established to
make impartial assessments of school
standards.&#146;.</div><a name="10020478000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not detain the Committee long on this amendment. Clause 22 deals
with schools causing concern and the powers of the Secretary of State.
I think I am right that it amends the last education Act to be passed,
which was agreed by Parliament just one week before this Bill was
published. The Government are clearly not thinking their proposals
through properly and are proceeding with such speed that new
legislation is replacing legislation that has not even had a chance to
bed
down.</div><a name="10020478000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a sense of d(c)j  vu because, as in the last education
Act, there is a strong presumption in the Bill that the Secretary of
State knows best and that he or she should have powers that can be
exercised over failing schools, regardless of the views of the local
authority. The last education Act introduced powers for when the
Secretary of State essentially did not think that local authorities
were being tough enough, and clause 22 will give the Secretary of State
new powers to direct local
authorities.</div><a name="10020478000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would require the Secretary of State to consult the local
authority and an independent school standards body before undertaking
intervention action. That would ensure that judgments that overrode a
democratically elected local authority on how school improvement was to
be delivered were informed by discussion with the local authority,
which is accountable for the oversight of local school performance
under the Government&#146;s model and ours. It would also ensure that
there was ratification of the fact that the school concerned, which
could be closed down or have other action taken against it, was a poor
performing school on the basis of some form of rational assessment.
That should take into account the school&#146;s circumstances, as we
discussed under clause
20.</div><a name="10020478000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
concern is that this Secretary of State or a future Secretary of State
could unreasonably override a local authority without discussion or
independent evidence to show that a school was doing badly, and without
considering whether an improvement plan had been put 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column468" />Column number: 468</div>in place. We regard that as extremely heavy-handed, so we ask the
Minister to reconsider whether these draconian powers are
necessary.</div><a name="10020478000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000248"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Again, I thank the hon. Gentleman for the sensible
way in which he has presented his
amendment.</div><a name="10020478000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nobody
wants the Secretary of State to be intervening in every situation. That
would be ludicrous, clearly, and would override the rights and
responsibilities of the local authority to commission school places and
look after school improvement in its own
area.</div><a name="10020478000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
provision seeks to deal with those few cases in which the local
authority has not taken the action that needs to be taken with respect
to a particular school. If everyone but the local authority deems it
appropriate to give a warning notice to a school, it might be
appropriate for the Secretary of State to direct the local authority to
issue the warning notice. I am not talking about that as a first step,
however. I am not saying that we should immediately jump in and say,
&#147;Whitehall knows best.&#148; It should not be an immediate
reaction to a particular problem. The situation should arise in only a
few instances after a series of discussions with the local authority
and local representatives and reference to the school improvement
partner. In such circumstances it would be appropriate for the
Secretary of State to have, as the last resort, the opportunity to
intervene with respect to a local
authority.</div><a name="10020478000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that such a provision will not need to be applied to the vast
majority of local authorities in the vast majority of situations. None
the less, there have been situations&#151;I can think of one or
two&#151;in which the involvement and intervention of the Secretary
of State has led to an improvement in a particular school. There are
also one or two examples of when it has been difficult for the
Secretary of State to get the sort of local action that any reasonable
or sensible person would expect to happen. The amendment would
circumvent the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to take any such
action.</div>
<a name="10020478000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000249"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I understand the point that the Minister makes, but
that is not what the amendment says. It says that before exercising
such powers, the Secretary of State should have consulted the local
authority and received advice supporting the planned actions from an
independent body, which under his model would be Ofsted. Is he really
telling us that there are any circumstances in which the Secretary of
State would not want to do that before taking the serious action that
he
proposes?</div><a name="10020478000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000250"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I am not trying to say that at all. I am saying
that the amendment is unnecessary because the Secretary of State will
consult the local authority before taking action. The Secretary of
State will not look down a list of schools and their results and say,
&#147;Hey, things aren&#146;t going on very well there,&#148; and
then direct the local authority to issue a warning notice. Such a
reaction would come about only after the sort of process to which the
hon. Gentleman refers. Of course we will consult the local authority.
In a small number of circumstances, if a local authority fails to take
the necessary action, the Secretary of State should have the power to
direct action in the interests of the pupils or communities in that
particular area. As for the independent person, the SIP and Ofsted will
be involved.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000251"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I feel that we are making a bit of progress.
Proposed paragraph (b) in the amendment says that before taking action,
the Secretary of State should receive advice that supports the planned
actions. Is the Minister prepared to go that far? I would be satisfied
and reassured to a large extent, if, before such draconian action was
taken, there was not only consultation with the local authority, but
discussions with a body such as Ofsted to ratify the Secretary of
State&#146;s
judgment.</div><a name="10020478000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000252"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> It seems that we are dancing on the head of a pin.
If it reassures the hon. Gentleman, I will say that, in such
circumstances, I would expect the Secretary of State to obtain advice
and information from a whole range of bodies, starting with the local
authority, and then to consult others, which might include Ofsted and
the SIP. At the end of the day, the Secretary of State should have the
power to direct something to happen in a local area when&#151;this
will be in a very, very small number of cases&#151;the local
authority is not fulfilling its responsibilities. Following that
reassurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020478000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000253"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I feel a bit more reassured. I am not suggesting
that there are not circumstances in extremis in which such powers might
need to be exercised, and I am pleased that the Minister says that
local authorities will be consulted. When he says that he expects such
things to happen, he is talking about how he would conduct himself as a
Minister, but we are legislating for future Governments who might
behave in a totally irrational way, and who might, for political
reasons, want to be seen to be making some sort of draconian
intervention, even when that is not ratified by Ofsted, which has the
expertise to judge whether the intervention is necessary. That was why
I wanted to tease out that
point.</div><a name="10020478000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000254"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Of course in the first instance, before we direct,
we may ask for action to be considered&#151;as an intermediate step
first, if that helps. As I said, we are dancing on the head of a
pin.</div><a name="10020478000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000255"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I accept that, but we might not be dancing on the
head of a pin if there has been a lot of consultation with the local
authority, if the local authority has a clear view that a school is
improving&#151;it might have taken recent action&#151;and if Ofsted
takes the view that the school is improving and has taken the relevant
action. However, a Secretary of State, who might be of a different
political party to the local authority, could decide that he or she
wished to override those two judgments. In that specific circumstance,
we would have concerns. However, the Minister has at least acknowledged
that he&#151;the Government&#151;would not wish to do that under
the circumstances I have set out, so with that very modest triumph, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020478000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

been launched to widespread opposition. The NUT
said:</div><a name="10020478000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
NUT can see no argument advanced by Government which justifies the
introduction of the licence to practise for

that the licence to
practise</div><a name="10020478000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
likely to have little or no impact other than angering the
profession.&#148;</div><a name="10020478000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

said:</div><a name="10020478000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Until
the Secretary of State conducts a full cost-benefit analysis
demonstrating the need to create a Licence to Practise we believe that
legislating on this matter is premature and
unwise.&#148;</div><a name="10020478000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

say:</div><a name="10020478000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;what
value does a licence to practise add, over and above performance
management, CPD and capability
proceedings&#148;?</div><a name="10020478000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Chris

said:</div><a name="10020478000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

was most revealing, however, was the opinion on the proposal given by
Keith Bartley, the chief executive of the General Teaching Council for
England&#151;the body to be charged with implementing the licence to

said:</div><a name="10020478000180"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
see merit in measures that support teachers to develop and improve
their practice and that confer real benefits for teaching and learning
that serve the public interest. We do not yet know whether the
proposals in the Bill will achieve those
aims.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Children,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000259"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman confirm something for me?
If a licence to practise is good enough for doctors, is it also good
enough for
teachers?</div><a name="10020478000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000260"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The trouble with the proposal is that it is not
administered by something such as the General Medical Council. Although
administered by the General Teaching Council, that is a state body set
up by the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div>Secretary of State, rather than a body that has come from within the
profession. There is a big difference between a professional body
representing the profession and one that tends to represent the state
sector.</div><a name="10020478000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Friday&#146;s
edition of <i class="I">The Times Educational Supplement</i> reported that Keith
Bartley had said at a conference in London
that</div><a name="10020478000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;he
was concerned that it would be &#145;unduly burdensome&#146; for
teachers and called for a change to the way schools are
judged.&#148;</div><a name="10020478000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
was reported as
saying:</div><a name="10020478000182"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
need assurances that it won&#146;t be another layer of accountability
in the
system&#148;.</div><a name="10020478000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
according to the article, he
added:</div><a name="10020478000183"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
lack of information from the Department for Children, Schools and
Families...about how the scheme will work means the advantages to
teachers are not yet
clear&#148;.</div><a name="10020478000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the statutory body charged with implementing a Government policy has
concerns about that policy and expresses such concerns in public, we
all need to take
note.</div><a name="10020478000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would prevent the regulations to introduce a licence to
practise from being made until the proposals had the support of the
General Teaching Council. Our view is that the policy behind the
licence is wrong. It is bureaucratic, it will not lead to more
continuing professional development, and it will make it more, not
less, difficult for head teachers to be able to manage and develop
their teaching
staff.</div><a name="10020478000193"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000261"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I want to speak on the provision not only because we
tabled amendment 204, but because this incredibly important part of the
Bill could affect hundreds of thousands of people throughout the
teaching profession. Although I feel that I keep making the same speech
about our need to move on at some stage to other controversial issues,
we cannot pass over the matter quickly, given the importance of the
measure.</div><a name="10020478000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned the
controversy that has been generated by this part of the Bill. I have a
confession to make: when the Bill was first announced by the Secretary
of State in the House of Commons last year, this was one of the few
bits that, in a very Liberal Democrat way, I picked out and said that
the Liberal Democrats supported it. However, the more that I have
considered it, the more that I have heard representations and the more
that I look at the Government&#146;s policy, the less convinced I am
that this is a good idea, partly because I am not sure what the
Government are trying to deliver with these provisions.</div>
<a name="10020478000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I can
draw hon. Members&#146; attention to the rather large difference
between what is in the very helpful impact assessment and how the
Government decided to announce this part of the Bill. The provision was
headline-grabbing when the Bill and the White Paper were announced last
year. Indeed, in July, when, I think, the White Paper came out, the
subject grabbed all the headlines. In relation to the motivation for
the policy, one assumes that the headlines were inspired by the
Department. The headlines generated were very similar in all the
newspapers, so one assumes someone from the Department was spinning the
policy.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column472" />Column number: 472</div><a name="10020478000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me cite some of the headlines as examples to try to tease out what we
are trying to achieve in the measure. <i class="I">The Sun </i>covered the
proposal under the headline, &#147;MoT for teachers;
&#145;Licence&#146; test every 5yrs&#148;, and the article<i class="I">
</i>states:</div><a name="10020478000184"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Teachers
must undergo MoT-style check-ups to make sure they are fit for the
classroom under Government plans unveiled yesterday... The licence
will help...weed out rotten teachers and make it impossible for
those who have been sacked to walk into a job at another school. Rookie
teachers must apply for a licence from next
year.&#148;</div><a name="10020478000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
does not seem that that was a briefing given to just one newspaper,
because there are other examples. The BBC report on the White Paper
used the headline, &#147;Teachers facing classroom MOTs&#148; and
the Secretary of State even commented directly on the proposal. When he
was asked what impact it would have, he
said:</div><a name="10020478000185"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
would be foolish to speculate about
numbers&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10020478000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
other words, the number of teachers who would fail the licence. The
article goes on to state that the Secretary of State
said:</div><a name="10020478000186"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;checks
would make sure that schools were &#145;facing up to
inadequacy.&#146;&#148;</div><a name="10020478000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall list the headlines&#151;<i class="I">The Guardian</i><i class="I">,</i>
&#147;Teachers face MOT every five years to prove fitness to
teach&#148;; the <i class="I">Daily Mail</i><i class="I">,</i><i class="I">
</i>&#147;Teachers&#146; MoTs every five years&#148;; and <i class="I">The

licence plan&#148;. <i class="I">The Times </i>included a description of how
incompetent teachers will be weeded
out.</div><a name="10020478000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000262"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I must tell the hon. Gentleman that that was not
spun out by the Department. May I just caution him? He might not have
noticed this, but everything that we read in the papers is not always
true.</div><a name="10020478000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000263"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> That is certainly the case with Liberal Democrat
policy. I find what the Minister has said a little difficult to
believe. Is he saying that the licence to practise is not designed to
lead to MOTs to weed out poor teachers?</div>
<a name="10020478000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000264"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> It is certainly not the intention of the licence
to practise to weed out poor teachers. There is a performance
management process, which can then lead to a capability review that is
in place. The purpose of the licence to practise is to raise the status
of the profession and give people a proper link to continuing
professional
development.</div><a name="10020478000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000265"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Either a U-turn is coming on, or one happened a few
months ago in response to the coverage. If it is true that the policy
was never designed to weed out poor teachers, why does the Secretary of
State say on the BBC News website
that</div><a name="10020478000187"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Without
a licence, teachers will be unable to teach... It would be foolish
to speculate about
numbers&#148;,</div><a name="10020478000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
that checks would be necessary to make sure that schools were
&#147;facing up to inadequacy&#148;? Why does a teensy-weensy
little line at the end of impact assessment refer to the possibility of
a small minority of teachers failing the test and ceasing to
teach?</div>
<a name="10020478000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000266"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> If it is apparent at the five-year point that a
teacher has not met the various criteria that have been set for the
licence, as a result of the CPD and the capability to which the hon.
Gentleman referred, he or she will not obtain the licence. The
intention of the licence to practise is to provide a positive statement

<div class="Column"><a name="Column473" />Column number: 473</div>about the status of teachers in this country and to help them with their
continuing professional development. I repeat what I told the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton: if it is good enough for
doctors in this country to have a licence-to-practise scheme and good
enough for lawyers to have the same, it is good enough for our
teachers, and it is long
overdue.</div><a name="10020478000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000267"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Newspaper headlines on the MOT are making me
cynical. I must be completely wrong when I assume that someone in the
Department close to the Secretary of State decided to sell it as a
sensational part of the Bill to weed out head teachers. When the
Government came to tell the Social Partnership about the policy after
it had choked on its cornflakes, it was watered down in the impact
assessment. We do not read about culling teachers, but about building
on the current performance
arrangements</div><a name="10020478000188"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
incentivise teachers to undertake high-quality CPD...increasing
the incentive for schools to provide high quality CPD
opportunities&#148;</div><a name="10020478000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
increasing the professionalisation of teachers, and all the stuff about
the culling of poor teachers has suddenly
disappeared.</div><a name="10020478000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree that there are two important issues. There is a powerful case for
improving CPD for all teachers, particularly returning teachers who
have been out of the profession for a long time and for supply
teachers, too. Whether the existing performance management regimes are
satisfactory is a separate issue, but head teachers have a legitimate
concern that they are not. I thought that the licence was supposed to
be dealing with teachers who, for example, are poor quality in the view
of the head teacher. For example, when the head teacher tries to take
action against them, they resign and get a job in another school. If
the head teacher was right, they might be a poor teacher in that
school, too. If a licence to practise was operated in a coherent and
effective way, the GTC has been thinking that those teachers might have
either their licence withdrawn or qualified in some way to show that
there were concerns about
them.</div><a name="10020478000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government seem to suggest that the policy is not about improving
performance management, but only about CPD. Indeed, that makes me
wonder whether it will make the performance management parts even more
difficult. I cannot remember whether it was John Dunford at our
evidence session or the guest of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton from the academies movement who said that taking action
against poor teachers could become even more difficult as a
consequence, given that a teacher who was performing badly could say
that that was because they had not had their quota of CPD. The last
thing that we need is to make things more difficult for head teachers
who often make the difficult decision to get rid of the minority of
poor staff. A minority of people in every profession do not do their
jobs well, including at Parliament. We should not make the job of head
teachers even more difficult.</div>
<a name="10020478000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have two things tangled up. The CPD system will be
expensive, and there is no estimate of the return on its &#163;94
million cost. It will be applied not in a discrete way to the category
of teachers who might need support, such as supply teachers or
returning teachers, but to all teachers in the profession. It will be
an enormous bureaucratic impediment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column474" />Column number: 474</div><a name="10020478000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The teaching
unions are passionate about CPD. They want improved CPD, but they
question whether the Bill will deliver it. We might look at the
proposal as a performance management tool, but we now know that,
contrary to all the stuff about MOTs and weeding out poor teachers, it
is not supposed to deliver that in any case&#151;the Government have
rowed back from that. I fear that by the time the Government have
finished legislating for the measure, tying themselves up in knots and
retreating from the original spun intention, it will be even more
difficult for head teachers who want to take tough action against
teachers to do so, as they will have to go through a mechanism of
proving that the teacher had all the CPD support that they
needed.</div><a name="10020478000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
like the school report card, the proposal responds to some concerns
about the existing provision of CPD, which is not adequate for some
categories of teacher, such as supply teachers and returning teachers,
and tries to touch on the issue of performance management, but is being
done in a mangled way. If we allowed the measure to pass, its outcome
would look much like that of performance-related pay, for which the
Government legislated 10 or so years ago.</div>
<a name="10020478000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
performance-related pay scheme was supposed to incentivise teachers to
teach better, but by the time that it came in, it had been so mangled
up by the Government, who did not want to offend anyone, that such pay
was paid to virtually every teacher, unless they simply did not appear
in the school for years on end. It was a complete waste of time and
resources. The measure before us will be the same because the
Government are not clear on why it is necessary and why it is being
delivered in this form. It will be a waste of money and a bureaucratic
impediment. If we are trying to deliver CPD, it is unnecessary to do so
in this way. If the Government are no longer trying to deliver a better
performance management regime, the slender string from which the policy
is hanging has already
broken.</div><a name="10020478000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those reasons, our amendments and those tabled by the Conservative
party ask the Government to do what I genuinely think they
should&#151;not to implement the measure hastily and for every
teacher in the country, when many will not gain from it. They should
not legislate without a clear view from the GTC, which, I understand,
does not have such a view, or without further consideration by the
Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families, which has played a
useful part in scrutinising the Government&#146;s policies. That
could save the Government from making a big
mistake.</div><a name="10020478000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020478000268"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Ken Purchase</b> (Wolverhampton, North-East) (Lab/Co-op): I
have a few questions to put to the Minister regarding this part of the
Bill. I am aware, as is everyone else in the room, of the difficulties
that head teachers have had in the past regarding disciplinary matters.
There is no question about the fact that the structures of local
authority personnel departments have made life somewhat difficult to
weed out&#151;there are no other words for it&#151;teachers who
simply have not served our children as we would wish. It is, has been
and remains the duty of head teachers to ensure that their staff are
delivering education in the prescribed manner and in the way that the
school wishes to happen.</div>
<a name="10020478000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wonder whether granting a licence&#151;I am struck in this thought by
the Minister&#146;s suggestion that it will be the same as how
doctors, architects and others are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column475" />Column number: 475</div>licensed&#151;would remove from the state, the school, the education
department or any institution the possibility of being sued by a
parent. When a child emerges from school to the parent&#146;s
dissatisfaction, could action be taken against the teacher because they
have been licensed? Will the teacher be left open to legal proceedings?
If so, can we look forward to a similar edifice to the Medical Defence
Union and other professional organisations that have to set up funds
and insurances to protect
themselves?</div><a name="10020478000172"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020478000269"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> No doubt, I will be corrected if I get this answer
wrong. My hon. Friend is making a good point. If he is asking about the
rights of a teacher and what would happen in those or any
circumstances, let me say that employment law would normally apply.
Normal industrial tribunals and other procedures and processes would be
available.</div><a name="10020485000621"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="10020485000005"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000640"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> Those assurances need to be absolutely clear
before the whole Bill is passed in the Chamber. These are important
questions, and people in the teaching profession will want to know
their legal position as a result of being granted a licence to teach.
If it puts them in a similar position to doctors, architects and so on,
questions will need to be answered to reassure teachers that it is for
precisely the purposes that the Minister has outlined: to assist the
development of the teaching profession and to get it more clearly
identified as a profession. Even though a teacher might be employed by
the state, a liability might still accrue. Should the licensing system
not make it explicit, teachers need to be reassured that
that liability remains, as the Minister has suggested, with the local
authority or the school itself.</div>
<a name="10020485000006"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000641"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I will check the important point that my hon.
Friend makes. I think that what I have said is right; if not, I will
correct it later. My understanding is that the relationship between
pupils, parents and teachers will not change in any way. If there is an
employment issue, the normal employment law is available. However, I
will check that, and if I am wrong, I will clarify it. My hon. Friend
is right to say that we must have certainty. I think that there is
certainty, but I will ensure that that is the
case.</div>
<a name="10020485000007"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000642"></a>Mr.
Purchase:</b> I simply want to say that such assurances are
necessary for the morale of the profession.</div>
<a name="10020485000008"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000643"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I agree, and my hon. Friend makes an important
point. There need to be assurances so that there is certainty about the
legal position, as we have seen with other provisions in the Bill. I
have said that if there is an issue that needs to be clarified, or if
an assurance on certainty needs to be given&#151;whether that is
requested by my hon. Friends or Opposition Members&#151;I will do
that.</div><a name="10020485000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to repeat myself to the hon. Member for Yeovil for reasons
of time, but it was never the Government&#146;s intention to have a
new MOT that weeds out poor teachers. There is a performance management
system with capability reviews for that. I know that many people say
that it does not work and that we cannot get rid of bad teachers, but I
say there is a mechanism for that. We are trying to do something 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 476</div>completely different: improve the status of the teaching profession and
give it the continuous professional development that it needs and
deserves. We are working with our social partners and others to ensure
that there is a contractual entitlement to CPD. For the first time, it
will be laid out in the contract that, as well as a licence to
practise, there will be an entitlement to CPD, which will overcome the
variability between different schools, different parts of the country
and different local authorities. If we can invigorate CPD with the
introduction of the licence to practise, that will be significant. Of
course the process cannot be bureaucratic. It cannot weigh schools down
and interfere with teaching and learning. The intention is to continue
to raise the quality of teaching by addressing the variation in the
take-up of
CPD.</div><a name="10020485000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
referred to doctors because the system is similar in many ways. A
licence is granted to doctors. Information is then collected on how
they keep their practice up to date and the professional development
and courses they undertake. After five years, the information is looked
at to see whether it has been successfully completed, and then the
licence is renewed. It is not used as a way of striking off bad
doctors; there is a separate process
available.</div><a name="10020485000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">Teaching
is a fantastic profession, and I return to something I said to the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton: if this is good enough for
doctors and lawyers, why is not good enough for teachers? Of course
there will be difficulties, which sometimes can be challenging. I
should say to the hon. Member for Yeovil that he needs to keep the
faith. If he thinks that the licence to practise is important, we
should look to see how we can overcome the
difficulties.</div><a name="10020485000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are working with the GTC to try to deal with issues of practicality. Of
course there will be challenges regarding how best to proceed. The GTC
is asking whether we have got something right or whether it should be
changed, and we are working with it to deliver a workable
policy.</div><a name="10020485000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not agree with the other Conservative amendments. My hon. Friend the
Member for Wolverhampton, North-East will be pleased to know that
licences to practise will apply to academies, but one of the amendments
would provide that the measure should be not applied to academies. The
independent report that the hon. Member for Yeovil wants is
unnecessary.</div>
<a name="10020485000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">For decades,
the teaching profession has quite rightly been asking that it is
accorded the status that it deserves. The fact that, in many cases, CPD
has been substandard, inadequate or non-existent is simply
unacceptable. A contractual right to continuous professional
development, alongside a licence to practise, is difficult to
introduce, but it is a prize that we should all strive to achieve. That
is what the clause is about. It will raise the status of the profession
and give the teachers of this country a standard of professional
development that they have not had before. With those comments, I ask
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000644"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I listened carefully to the
Minister. His comparison with the medical profession&#151;the GMC and
the royal colleges&#151;would have more strength if the chief
executive of the GTC was not opposed to the policy. He is not mildly
opposed to it&#151;making his points behind the scene, as one would
expect&#151;but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column477" />Column number: 477</div>making his opposition clear in public. He said that the measure would be
&#147;unduly burdensome&#148;, and that he would
need</div><a name="10020485000557"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;assurances
that it won&#146;t be another layer of accountability in the
system&#148;.</div><a name="10020485000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">He

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000679"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> We now reach probably the most controversial element
of the Bill: home education. Schedule 1 implements the Badman report.
The report and these provisions have infuriated the parents of
20,000&#151;or is it 50,000 or 70,000, according to the Secretary of
State, or 80,000&#151;children in home education. As the shadow
Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael
Gove), said on Second
Reading:</div><a name="10020485000560"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
am deeply concerned about the additional bureaucratic burden that will
now potentially be placed on thousands of our fellow citizens whose
only crime is to want to devote themselves as fully as possible to
their children&#146;s education. It is a basic right of parents to be
able to educate their children in accordance with their own wishes, and
to educate them at home if they so wish. There may be many reasons why
parents take that decision: they might be dissatisfied with local
provision; their child might have a specific educational need that they
feel can be better supported at home; or they might have philosophical
objections to the style of education on offer at the local state
schools that are easily
accessible.&#148;</div><a name="10020485000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went on to say:</div>
<a name="10020485000561"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ultimately
however, this is a basic human right that every parent should have, and
I feel the Bill erodes that right, because, as I read it, it allows the
state to terminate the right of a family to educate a child at home if
the education offered is not deemed suitable according to regulations
that the Secretary of State writes.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 11 January 2010; Vol. 503, c.
456.]</div><a name="10020485000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Infuriating
the home-education community en masse can only be a sign that the whole
issue has been badly and insensitively
handled.</div><a name="10020485000622"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="10020485000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Education Otherwise reported in its written evidence, one local
authority told the
DCSF:</div><a name="10020485000562"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
review and its recommendations will be perceived by home educators as a
direct and unprecedented attack on the family, striking at the heart of
the relationship between parents and their children, and could damage
the relationship between Las and home educators where there has
previously been good and open
dialogue&#148;.</div><a name="10020485000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
seems to be confusion at the very heart of the policy. In a letter to
the Secretary of State, Graham Badman
said:</div><a name="10020485000563"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
January, you asked me to review the arrangements for home education in
England. In particular, you asked me to look at whether there are any
barriers to local authorities and other public agencies in effectively
carrying out their safeguarding responsibilities in relation to home
educated children. You also asked me to investigate suggestions that
home education could be used as a &#145;cover&#146; for child
abuse. Finally, you asked me to look at whether local authorities are
providing the right support to home educating
families.&#148;</div><a name="10020485000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was nothing in the terms of reference about the quality of education. I
asked Graham Badman in our evidence session about the primary purpose
of the review, and whether it was the issue of safeguarding, with home
education as a potential cover for abuse or whether it was a worry
about the quality of education being provided. He replied:</div>
<a name="10020485000564"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On
the basis of the quantum of evidence submitted by local authorities, I
think my first concern would be the sufficiency and quality of the
education received by a number of
students.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Children,
Schools and Families Public Bill Committee, </i>19 January
2010; c. 52,
Q70.]</div><a name="10020485000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
difference is revealing, and it matters because the policy prescription
for tackling hidden abuse is very different from that of concerns over
the quality of education. By conflating the two, the Government have
created an unworkable and deeply unpopular policy 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column481" />Column number: 481</div>that ends up implicitly accusing tens of thousands of sincere and honest
parents of being potential child abusers at the same time as intruding
into their approach to
education.</div><a name="10020485000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the prime concern is that of safeguarding, the purpose of a register or
notification is simply to assist with ruling out parents in the hope of
isolating those who might be problematic. If, on the other hand, the
issue is education, we must ask ourselves against what standard will
home education be measured, given that it will by its very nature be
eclectic. It is a road that will lead nowhere. There is no way in which
an inspector can judge the quality of such education unless he or she
has a set of standards against which he or she is to judge it. Without
such standards, the judgment will be sufficiently subjective to have no
validity if sanctions are imposed. For someone to draft such standards
would either be impossible or would constrain and constrict the very
type of education that parents want for their children, hence
interfering with the basic and fundamental parental
rights.</div><a name="10020485000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the policy statements, the Government stated:</div>
<a name="10020485000565"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
existing guidelines make it clear that a suitable, full time, efficient
education cannot be determined by the same methods that apply in
schools. Children normally attend school for between 22 and 25 hours a
week for 38 weeks of the year, but this measurement of &#147;contact
time&#148; is not relevant to home education where there can be
almost continuous one-to-one contact and education may take place
outside normal &#145;school hours&#146;&#148;.</div>
<a name="10020485000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guidelines go on to
state that the type of educational activity undertaken can be varied
and flexible. The policy statement
continues:</div><a name="10020485000566"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Home

Ann Cryer</b> (Keighley) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman keeps
talking about certain aspects of my constituency, but I have been
living there for a long time and the children are very dear to my
heart. What if an inspector went into a home and discovered that the
parent who had decided to home educate spoke no English? What is the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s remedy if we are not to have
inspectors?</div>
<a name="10020485000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000681"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Those issues apply in other parts of the education
system. The hon. Lady has been complaining that there are children who
are not getting English lessons in the schools that they attend, so I
do not think that that is an issue solely related to home
education.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column482" />Column number: 482</div><a name="10020485000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000682"></a>Mrs.
Cryer:</b> I have never said that children do not get English
lessons. They could not possibly join or perform in the school if there
were not dedicated groups of reception class teachers teaching them
English on arrival. My complaint is that there is no English spoken in
the home so they are thrown in at the deep end once they arrive at age
four.</div>
<a name="10020485000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000683"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I have friends who speak only French in their homes.
It is not for me to object to the way those parents bring up their
children. We have to be careful what powers we take for ourselves as
the state, and this issue treads over the line between the duties that
the state has and those that families have for bringing up their own
children.</div><a name="10020485000113"></a>

then the Minister, and then I will crack on, if I
may.</div>
<a name="10020485000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000686"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he and his party
would be happy if children in this country were educated without any
knowledge of English?</div>
<a name="10020485000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000687"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> No, I am not. The issues are very difficult and, as
my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath said during the debate on
Second Reading, things are not satisfactory at the moment, and we will
have to look at this issue. But this is not the right approach to
tackle such difficult matters. In the words of an old clich(c), it
is a sledgehammer to crack a nut, and it is offending tens of thousands
of people. That is the problem. We have to consider this again, more
sensitively, to tackle the problems that both hon. Members have
highlighted.</div>
<a name="10020485000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000688"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families (Ms Diana R. Johnson):</b> Will the hon. Gentleman
comment on one of the recommendations of the Select Committee? On home
education, it believes that the prospect of a child gaining basic
literacy and numeracy skills and a breadth of education is right. How
does that fit with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments on having
perhaps only one language in the home, which is not
English?</div>
<a name="10020485000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000689"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> There are many schools in this country where 8 per
cent. of young people are not learning to read. The way the Government
are trying to tackle such matters is not right. For one thing, it is
costing between &#163;130 million and &#163;567 million a year,
which will be completely wasted if their approach is designed to change
the way children are home educated.</div>
<a name="10020485000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020485000690"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): I wonder,
following the Minister&#146;s intervention, whether&#151;from what
she said about the system of local authority inspectors looking to see
that a suitable education is being provided&#151; any family who
cannot demonstrate suitable English skills will automatically be
deprived of the right to home educate? That seems to be the logical
conclusion of what the Minister suggested. If that is the message she
wants to send out to people in such a situation in this country,
perhaps she can say it more clearly.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column483" />Column number: 483</div><a name="10020485000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000691"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am sure the Minister will respond to that
point.</div>
<a name="10020485000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my
judgment, the state will be far better using that
money&#151;&#163;560 million a year&#151;to provide assistance,
pay exam entry fees, give access to exam centres or help to pay tutors
than wasting it on inspecting an eclectic type of education that will
ultimately be inconclusive. Local authorities should be focusing their
efforts on the one in three schools judged not good enough by Ofsted,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000692"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am pleased that we have now finally moved on to
what is an extremely important part of the Bill. The issue has probably
generated most correspondence to Committee members and has put
constituents in contact with their local Member of Parliament even if
their MP were not on the Bill
Committee.</div><a name="10020485000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
start with some comments about our attitude to the schedule, in order
to put our amendments in some sort of context and to prevent our having
to repeat some of those points later. I do not question the motivations
of the Government in introducing the provisions. We understand why the
Government are concerned to ensure that every child is receiving a
high-quality education. We take seriously some of the evidence given to
the Select Committee, in which some of the shortfalls&#151;for a
small number of home educating families&#151;were
acknowledged.</div><a name="10020485000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
acknowledge that the Government are under a great deal of pressure on
two sides of the argument. On one side, child welfare issues can come
into the public domain, and if children are shown not to be educated,
there can be a sudden media uproar about Government negligence. On the
other side, when Governments try to take action, they often get
criticised for over-regulating. The Government&#146;s job is not an
easy one. We understand that in some cases&#151;probably a small
minority&#151;there may be concerns about the quality of home
education and the effectiveness and ability of local authorities to
discharge their current
responsibilities.</div><a name="10020485000623"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="10020485000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
we also understand the concerns that have been raised by home educators
across the country about the nature of the Government&#146;s proposed
solution, which we feel is highly illiberal, for reasons that I will go
through in a moment. The solution fails a number of tests that we would
set for making legislation in this
area.</div><a name="10020485000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to pay tribute, without taking up too much of the
Committee&#146;s time, to all the home educating groups and
individuals who have made representations to us, the Government and the
Select Committee, and who, in spite of the fact that sometimes they are
not, by their nature, part of big, powerful national umbrella groups,
have been forceful in making their case over the last few months. I
want to refer to some of the people in my constituency in the Chard
Home Education Centre and some individuals, such as Tania Berlow, who
gave evidence to the Select Committee, which took a lot of time to
consider the Government&#146;s
proposals.</div><a name="10020485000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to the substance of the proposals, we share the Government&#146;s
concerns about the existing legislation in two respects. We welcome the
fact that Conservative Front-Benchers have made it clear that existing
regulations on home education are not perfect and that their party has
an open mind about making sensible improvements where possible. We are
concerned about two areas in the existing framework for home
education.</div><a name="10020485000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
we think it is reasonable that local authorities have, under current
legislation&#151;I am cautious about the words I use, because the
hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness has some expertise in this
area, and he will jump down my throat if I select the wrong
words&#151;some responsibilities in ensuring that no young person is
badly home educated. If I was a local authority, with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column485" />Column number: 485</div>the existing responsibilities under the law, I would be nervous because
I would not know many of the children and families who were home
educating in my area. Of course, that is the case at present; families
can move across local authority areas. I understand why, and I think
that many, though not all, home educators also understand why there is
some desire for local authorities at least to possess information about
who is being home educated. That is directly relevant to the large
cluster of amendments that deal with registration and
notification.</div><a name="10020485000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second thing on which we agree with the Government is that once local
authorities know who is home educating, if they have genuine concerns
that the quality of education&#151;I underline education&#151;is
poor, and believe that there is no evidence that young people are being
educated properly, they need to have sufficient powers to judge whether
that is the case and whether action needs to be taken. It would be
absurd to give local authorities a responsibility if they had no
information and no means of making an informed
judgment.</div><a name="10020485000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to a point made in an earlier debate. Although the vast majority
of parents, home educating and non-home educating, are passionate about
their children and are responsible&#151;I have no doubt that the vast
majority of home educators are deeply committed and are providing an
excellent education&#151;there are other people who are home
educating for other reasons. Some groups of people do not believe that
particular children should be educated beyond a certain age. Evidence
was given to the Select Committee about Traveller families who thought
girls, for example, should not be educated above key stage
2.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000693"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> On the point about Traveller families, one must
always ensure that the cause or perceived need for a measure is matched
by that measure. What in the Bill will make any difference and ensure
that Traveller families, for instance, who may have the view that the
hon. Gentleman mentioned, will be picked up and challenged? In the real
world, I do not think that the provisions in the Bill will make any
difference to those families, while they will inconvenience and
intervene in the lives of many others.</div>
<a name="10020485000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000694"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> That is a serious issue, and I do not underestimate
the risk that this could end up as a system to police those people who
are law-abiding, rather than those who are not. Nevertheless, if I were
a local authority employee responsible for this, I would want some sort
of power and presumption&#151;even if a small minority tried to
ignore it&#151;that I was entitled to know. If I had concerns, I
would want to be able to take action to find out whether those concerns
were substantiated.</div>
<a name="10020485000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000695"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> That takes us to the nub of the matter. Since
education was made compulsory, the settlement was that
parents&#151;not the state&#151;had legal responsibility for the
provision of education. They may delegate that responsibility to the
state, but that legal responsibility has lain with parents. The role of
the state has been only to challenge, where evidence has arisen to
suggest that parents were not delivering on their legal duty.</div>
<a name="10020485000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
implication of what the hon. Gentleman says, and certainly what is in
the Bill, would make an historic shift from the parent to the state. It
would be the state that must be reassured; the state must know, and the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column486" />Column number: 486</div>local authority must have its doubts and fears allayed. That takes the
primacy of the parents entirely out of the picture. We have a situation
in which local authorities, should they have serious evidence that
education is not being delivered, can challenge it. All too often, they
do not do that, even when they have the evidence. That is more of a
problem than the one that this draconian legislation seeks to
address.</div>
<a name="10020485000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000696"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> There is certainly a huge shift in presumption in
the Bill. I will come on to that in a moment; I believe that I will
start to converge with the views of the hon. Member for Beverley and
Holderness in some of my criticisms of the Bill. However, as I said to
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton when we discussed
one of his amendments earlier, it is sadly the case that there is
probably a small minority of individuals for whom home
education&#151;or the claim of home education&#151;is a negative
decision. That may happen when youngsters have been excluded from
school, or if parents have had bad experiences. It could be with
parents who have mental health problems. It is difficult for social
services to intervene and take a youngster away from their parents, as
that requires a high threshold. Even in my constituency, I have been
deeply worried about the circumstances of some young people. In a
society where everybody accepts their responsibilities&#151;as most
people do&#151;we would be happy to leave all such matters to
individual families. However, I fear that there is a small minority of
young people who need the additional protections that the state can
sometimes give.</div>
<a name="10020485000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have stated
the two areas where my position converges with the Governments, but we
have sincere and deep concerns about the proposals in a far larger
number of areas. I raised the first of those during the evidence-taking
session with Graham Badman, and this is where I agree with the hon.
Member for Beverley and Holderness. The Bill contains a massive change
in the presumption relating to citizens&#146; freedoms. It is set out
in stark terms in the policy statement that the Department provided us
with on home education, prior to the evidence-taking session.</div>
<a name="10020485000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">In paragraphs
19 onwards, we see clearly&#151;it is especially clear in paragraph
28&#151;that what is at the moment an entitlement by the citizen in a
free society to make a decision to home educate, has become an
application in the Bill. In the future, instead of having the
presumption that we are allowed to home educate, we must apply to the
state for that right. That is an extraordinary change that I find
deeply objectionable in a free society. We must not underestimate how
serious that change in presumption is. It is clear that the application
is not simply a process of notification, which is what we are trying to
make it through some of the amendments that I will discuss in a moment.
It is a fully-fledged process that involves having to supply huge
amounts of personal information. On top of that, a person must supply
the information contained in paragraphs 30 to 32 of the policy
statement.</div>
<a name="10020485000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000697"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the
presumption is that the child will be registered? That is the starting
point.</div>
<a name="10020485000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000698"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> No, I do not think that that is the presumption. I
had hoped that it was the presumption when the Bill was published. It
was not until I read the policy statement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column487" />Column number: 487</div>and looked at all the representations from home educators&#151;by
golly, there have been a lot&#151;that I understood just why they are
so angry. The issue is not only that a huge amount of information must
be given. I say to the Minister: look at what is in paragraphs 30, 31
and 32. Those are not things that must be done during the process of
home education. That is the statement that must be supplied along with
the registration
procedure.</div><a name="10020485000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
the statement must set
out</div><a name="10020485000584"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
educational needs of the child, and contain any relevant background
information...This may include information about special educational
needs, any particular aptitudes the child
has&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10020485000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">it
goes on and on. The second type of information will
be</div><a name="10020485000585"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
educational philosophy or approach to be adopted. This might cover the
degree of formality of education, any specific curricula that will be
followed, or qualifications
pursued.&#148;</div><a name="10020485000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
that is not enough, paragraph 32 states that the third piece of
information will
be</div><a name="1002058000001"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;outline plans for the
forthcoming
year&#148;.</div><a name="10020485000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is undoubtedly a process of application to the state for someone to
determine whether you or I, Mrs. Anderson, or anyone else is
fit to make a judgment even to start the process of home education. It
is a massive change in the presumption about the freedom of citizens to
home
educate.</div><a name="10020485000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000699"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> Paragraph 34 of the policy statement
states:</div><a name="10020485000586"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
envisage plans should cover around 2 sides of typewritten A4 paper as a
very rough guide to the extent of detail that should be
provided.&#148;</div><a name="10020485000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000700"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> That is fine. A plan can be one paragraph, two pages
or 500 pages. That does not avoid the fact that if I want to home
educate, I must write to the Minister or, in effect, a local government
official and supply a very extensive amount of information, some of
which is needed and some of which, I suspect, is not. Then I must tell
the Minister and the local authority about the educational needs of the
child and about my educational philosophy. I must produce
&#147;outline
plans&#148;.</div><a name="10020485000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point that the Minister is getting wrong is that it does not matter how
long the document is. The issue is that it must be approved.
It does not matter whether it is a paragraph or 10 paragraphs. What
matters is that it is being requested and someone has to filter it. If
they are not filtering it, what on earth is the point of asking for all
that information? I assumed, when home educators first came to my
advice centre, so angry about this, that all they were being asked to
do was submit information about their child, their home address and so
on. I did not realise that they had to go through an application
process to do something that they currently can do as of right. To me
as a Liberal, that is deeply
objectionable.</div><a name="10020485000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000701"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> My heart is warmed by hearing a Liberal spokesman
speak from liberal principle. I am delighted. It is so rare. None the
less, it gives me great pleasure. May I ask the hon. Gentleman about a
particular group? Let us take an example&#151;a poorly educated
single mother. The international research evidence is that poorly
educated parents have a tremendous positive impact as home educators. I
suggest that a poorly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column488" />Column number: 488</div>educated single mother, visited by the local authority inspector, will
find herself particularly challenged to deliver this set of
arrangements and, although it will be the weakest and most vulnerable
in our society whose children are most likely to be at poor schools,
they will then have a local authority inspector from the same
establishment that failed them with the school coming in to tell them
that they do not pass muster and their child must go
back.</div><a name="10020485000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000702"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am also delighted to hear liberal sentiments from
the Conservative party, which has occasionally been inclined to support
rather illiberal measures in the Bill and has occasionally needed some
encouragement to support our amendments. The hon. Gentleman leaps ahead
of me, because I have only just got to the first objection about the
application process. There are also the issues about how this will be
policed, which is directly relevant to the
amendments.</div><a name="10020485000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000703"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> When the hon. Gentleman said in his
preamble&#151;I have learned shorthand&#151;that local authorities
need to have sufficient powers to judge whether the quality of home
education is adequate, what did he
mean?</div><a name="10020485000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000704"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I meant that if it is obvious to a local authority
or if the local authority&#151;I shall come to the issue of oversight
in a moment&#151;draws the conclusion, from all the information it
has, which might include information from the school that the young
person attended, that no home education is going on at all, I would
want the local authority to be in a position either to ask for the
evidence or to do something about that. Even the existing Act makes it
clear that the local authority has some responsibility in that
regard.</div><a name="10020485000624"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="10020485000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000705"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> I am thinking of a child who has been home
educated for a long time, on whom there is no local authority
information. How does the hon. Gentleman propose that the local
authority obtain that information, if it does not even know that the
child
exists?</div><a name="10020485000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000706"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I had hoped that it was clear from my earlier
comments, and I shall make it clearer when we come to the specific
amendments, that we believe that it is perfectly reasonable for there
to be a notification requirement, so that local authorities are aware
of such children. It is also perfectly reasonable for there to be
mechanisms by which the local authority is able to form a judgment
about whether home education is being received, and if it is clear that
it is not or that there are serious concerns, to take action. That is
different from what is in the
Bill.</div><a name="10020485000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem with the registration process&#151;it is both registration
and an application&#151;is that somebody somewhere has to make a
judgment about whether all the submission, which the Minister says is
only two pages, conforms to some definition of suitability. When
Mr. Badman came to see us, we discussed what suitability
means. Given the amount of monitoring that will go on and the
accountability, judgements about suitability clearly will have to be
made from registration onwards. Yet, what consideration have we had in
Committee, or is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column489" />Column number: 489</div>there in the Bill, about suitability? In paragraph 43 of the policy
statement, Mr. Badman himself states that in the 21st
century, with all the employment
demands,</div><a name="10020485000587"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
curriculum must be sufficiently broad and balanced and relevant to
enable young people to make suitable
choices&#148;.</div><a name="10020485000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is precisely what he said in evidence to us. Yet, we know that
providing a broad and balanced curriculum is not part of the current
responsibilities of home-educating parents. Paragraph 47 contains a
long list of what home educators are not required to do. We then have
the supposed reassurance from the Government, in paragraph
48:</div><a name="10020485000588"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
will soon commission work to establish whether the current
interpretation of &#145;suitability&#146; needs to be
updated&#148;.</div><a name="10020485000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is completely the wrong way round. To put in all that architecture,
including an application process with an educational philosophy and so
forth, before we even have a clue what suitability means, seems to put
us and local authority officers in a dangerous position. Based on the
evidence that Mr. Badman gave to the Committee, there
clearly is a big difference between what he thinks is suitable and the
existing
situation.</div><a name="10020485000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
next point is that if I were charged in a local authority with the
responsibilities in the Bill, not just for oversight but for judging
the applications coming in and the educational philosophies, I would
want some advice from my local authority&#151;probably from the
Minister&#151;about precisely how to interpret
&#147;suitable&#148;. Which educational philosophies in paragraphs
30 to 32 are acceptable? What detail about outline plans should be
expected? We know what will happen. Either it will all end in complete
uncertainty, with local authorities policing the system in completely
incompatible ways in different parts of the country, or, much more
likely, certainly if this Government is in power, local authority
officers and others will rightly expect to have a large
document&#151;and it will get larger&#151;setting out what a
legitimate philosophy is and the right kind of information that should
be supplied regarding future plans. What is at the moment pretty light
touch and terrifically vague regarding suitability will soon become
incredibly
prescriptive.</div><a name="10020485000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000707"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that one of
Graham Badman&#146;s recommendations is better training for local
authority officers who deal with the home education population? The
Government accept that that is absolutely right, and money and training
will be made available for officers. They will then have much more
understanding of the different philosophies among the home education
population, including autonomous learning. It is absolutely right and
proper that we do that further research into defining &#147;suitable
education&#148;, and that we have some principles that local
authority officers can
use.</div><a name="10020485000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000708"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> But surely that argument is the wrong way round. I
am pleased that the hon. Lady is saying that she will commission
research, and although there will not be time in this Parliament, I
hope that there will be plenty of time in future for a meaningful
dialogue with home educators. Can it possibly make sense to impose all
that architecture&#151;it will be a massive change&#151;without
even debating suitability? Even if we did debate suitability, I am not
sure whether we would arrive easily at a conclusion about what it
means. Suitability of home education in an environment that we are

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000710"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I agree completely with my hon. Friend on those
important
points.</div><a name="10020485000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
draw the Committee&#146;s attention to two other deficiencies, both
of which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has
mentioned. It is relevant to registration as well as monitoring that a
lot of concern has been expressed about the extent to which the new
apparatus for the oversight of home education would pursue issues not
only of education, but welfare and child protection. It has caused
great resentment among the home educating community. It thinks that the
Government and the Badman report, intentionally or otherwise, has
associated home education with welfare and safeguarding concerns for
children. Sometimes, Ministers have said that the intention is not to
oversee home education, but in spite of those statements of good
intention, we see from the policy statement issued by the Department
that that is exactly the
intention.</div><a name="10020485000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s view is that the job of the architecture under
schedule 1 is not only initial registration and the policing of
education, but policing for all home-educating families of welfare
issues, whether or not there is cause for concern. That is set out
clearly in paragraph 40 of the policy statement. It makes it clear that
the responsibility of the regulator will not be to check whether
education is suitable, which is difficult enough to define at the
moment but at least seems to be a core competence of such regulations,
but whether
education</div><a name="10020485000589"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;accords
with their application for registration; what the child&#146;s wishes
and feelings about education are&#148;,</div>
<a name="10020485000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="10020485000590"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whether
it is harmful for the welfare of the child to continue with home
education&#148;.</div><a name="10020485000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not agree with the presumption that the state should not only be
seeking to satisfy itself that some home education is going on, but
essentially whether all home educating families throughout the country
should be presumed to need some sort of welfare check. That is
something that has driven the Bill, and many of the groups that are
passionate about children&#146;s rights outside this place are clear
about their motivations in that regard. I respect them. They view it as
important that, at the moment, children who do not come into contact
with schools and other agencies should have some other oversight. They
are concerned about the scope for the abuse of a tiny minority of
children, who might be away from schools and other secondaries. I
understand that, but I do not believe that it is right for the
architecture of the system to presume that there is a need to inspect
the welfare of children in every home educating
family.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column491" />Column number: 491</div><a name="10020485000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020485000711"></a><b class="B">Bill
Wiggin</b> (Leominster) (Con): I agree absolutely with the
hon. Gentleman, but does he agree that the sort of people who are most
terrified by such an intrusion are those whose children have been
bullied? Presumably, any local authority officer who heard of bullying
would do everything that they could to prevent it. Given that that
fail-safe has already let down such families, what does the hon.
Gentleman think is likely to happen to any family worried that their
bullied child is again being inspected by a local authority? If they
feel that the local authority is failing them again, what are they
likely to
do?</div><a name="10020485000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000712"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful point to which
the Minister rather than I should respond. The point is that, as far as
I am aware, we have not established that there is a difference between
the vulnerability of the most vulnerable children&#151;not the
average child&#151;in home-educating families and in school
settings.</div>
<a name="10020485000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final
area in which the Bill is
deficient&#151;</div><a name="10020485000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000713"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The effect&#151;there has been little comment on
it so far, because so much horror has been expressed about the
Bill&#146;s general provisions&#151;is that the most traumatised
and vulnerable children and their parents, who have been let down so
badly by schools, will cut off all links with the local authority in
response to the provisions. In order to escape from those who have let
them down the most, they will seek to elude and escape the attention of
the local authority. They will not seek to use its facilities. The Bill
should be responding to an agenda to open up public services and
support to home-educated children, particularly the most vulnerable,
but its effect on those whom we care about most could be precisely the
opposite.</div><a name="10020485000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000714"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I agree strongly. The hon. Gentleman brings me to my
next point, which is the Bill&#146;s lack of support and positive
reasons for home-educating parents to engage. I take seriously his
concerns that it will drive many home educators away from dealing with
local authorities. I did not particularly welcome the evidence that we
took from some home educators who said that they would not adhere to
the law and the regulations if the Bill were passed, because none of us
likes to hear people say that they will break the law. It is a serious
concern. If people feel that the laws imposed are unfair, unreasonable
and inconsistent with a liberal society, we are driving them not to
comply.</div>
<a name="10020485000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I would
have liked to see&#151;in notification procedures, not application
procedures&#151;is linked support so that notifying, if it became
part of the Government&#146;s policy, would include a series of
potential measures, funding support and access to other means of
support open to home educators. That might be the type of environment
in which a home educator might receive something from the process that
was actually of value to them.</div>
<a name="10020485000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
we tabled these and other amendments. I will refer briefly to the ones
in the present group. If you will excuse me, Mrs. Anderson,
I will not comment on those tabled by others, as our time is seriously
limited. Amendment 210 would change the process of registration and
application to make it a process of notification. In other words, it
would require compulsory notification by every home educator, but it
would not require them 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column492" />Column number: 492</div>to submit the same type of information required by the
Government&#146;s proposals, which essentially turn notification into
a process of application.</div>
<a name="10020485000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I had
thought about it at the time and seen the people from the Chard Home
Education Centre early enough, I would have tabled an additional
amendment linking notification to the provision of direct support as a
consequence of notifying, which might enable access to the support that
we have been discussing. That might take the form of vouchers or other
entitlements, so that people who notify can see that they are getting
support of the type that many home educators do not receive at
present.</div>
<a name="10020485000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 211
would ensure that parents of home-educated children needed to provide
only a limited amount of information to the local authority rather than
having to go through the complex process of registration and
application proposed in the Bill. Amendment 217 sets out what types of
information we think would be necessary for a light-touch notification
rather than the type of application and registration envisaged in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="10020485000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
213, 215, 216 and 214 are all pretty similar and would strip out the
elements of welfare oversight from what should, in our view, be an
attempt to oversee the issues of education. Amendment 212, which has
already been mentioned by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, would give a specific period of time within which to
register what, under our model, would be a
notification.</div><a name="10020485000625"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="10020485000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to finish by saying while we have the concerns that I have
set out, we also take the view that the Committee has had a seriously
deficient amount of time to consider such an extensive Bill. We have
only one and three quarter hours left to deal with 92 amendments and
new clauses, and a very complex debate. I have always hoped that the
Government might reconsider this excessive legislation and come back to
us with a much more limited scheme of notification, with some
incentives to notify, because that is all my party would be able to
support.</div>
<a name="10020485000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
reached the conclusion, along with my colleagues in the Commons and the
other place, that by trying to botch together this very bad job on home
education, the Government have made it almost impossible for the
concerns of people outside this place to be taken into account in a
sensible way, particularly as there will not even be a serious
Committee stage in another place. Therefore, I say to the Government
that it is inevitable that we will have to vote against this aspect of
the Bill and throw out all the proposals on home education, and I hope
that that is something that the Conservative party will
support.</div>
<a name="10020485000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">None the
less, in a spirit reflecting a residual desire to find some sort of
sensible conclusion, I say to the Minister that her only way out of
this is to bring back on Report a very modest schedule focusing on this
limited issue of notification with which we could deal before this
Parliament ends. Unless the Government do that, it is our strong view
not only that the provisions to which amendments have been tabled
should be deleted, but that the whole of clause 26 and schedule
1&#151;everything related to home education&#151;should be dumped
before this Parliament comes to its end.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000715"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> I will try to keep my comments brief because I know
that the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness has done a lot of work
in this area and wishes to
speak.</div><a name="10020485000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I started to consider this part of the Bill, I wondered why we should
not know the position of all our children who, in any other
circumstances, would be in our state education system. However, after
reading the documentation that was sent to us and listening to the
concerns of one of my constituents, I now have some doubts. Gordon
Whitehead has brought jobs into Doncaster. He supports learning and
opportunities for young people, and wants to offer apprenticeships and
opportunities in IT through his company. However, he has huge concerns
for his own home-educated children because of what the propositions in
the Bill will mean for him and other families who home
educate.</div>
<a name="10020485000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to repeat everything that the hon. Member for Yeovil said, but I have
some concerns about a process through which, for understandable
reasons, there is a desire to know that if children are not in school,
they are being home educated. Needing to know that information has
turned this proposal into something that is bureaucratic and
overburdening to families and local authorities. Those authorities are
not confident that they can carry out the Government&#146;s ask on
this matter.</div>
<a name="10020485000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">To echo the
hon. Gentleman, I have read the statement from the Government about
what is not expected of parents who home educate. However, although
earlier paragraphs say that parents need to produce only two pages on
what they provide, we then find that they will be asked to explain
their philosophy as well as other things. I find that very confusing.
We are able to read all this documentation and to hear from witnesses,
but I wonder how such information will be related to local government
officers on the
ground.</div><a name="10020485000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
submissions provided by parents who home educate, we have found out
about&#151;I say straight away that I am sure that this does not
represent all local government officers&#151;individuals giving
personal rather than objective points of view when they go into the
homes of people who home educate. It might not be my personal desire to
educate my children a certain way, but I recall one example of a local
government officer referring in a report to incense being burned in the
home. The family quite rightly questioned the report, saying,
&#147;What has that got to do with anything? People use fresheners in
their homes all the time.&#148; To be honest, however, there was in
that case perhaps implied criticism that the family were rather
&#147;brown rice and sandals&#148; and hippy-ish, and the very
mention of incense being burned conveyed an approach with which the
local government officer did not
agree.</div><a name="10020485000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee was provided with case studies of child protection, some of
which I found rather wanting. There was an example of a woman in
Gloucestershire&#151;I think she was a foster mother&#151;who was
prosecuted for cruelty to children. If I have understood it correctly,
the education services had annual contact to monitor the education at
home. Having visited that home on an annual basis, the education
service came to the conclusion that things were generally satisfactory
and that no child protection concerns were noted, although perhaps that
says something about whether the service was looking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column494" />Column number: 494</div>correctly. However, I could not see how anything in the Bill&#146;s
proposals would have made any difference in that
case.</div>
<a name="10020485000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
example was of a young person who sadly died. The serious case review
stated categorically that the
mother</div><a name="10020485000591"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;complied
with all statutory requirements in relation to children in elective
home education. She co-operated with visits from the London Borough of
Enfield Education
Department&#148;</div><a name="10020485000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">twice
in one year. The following year, it was identified
that</div><a name="10020485000592"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
visiting officer had no concerns about the family or their
circumstances, and was
satisfied&#148;.</div><a name="10020485000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
seems to have come out of those various examples linked to child
protection is that, even in such circumstances, those on the ground
have responded to the Government by saying, &#147;We need something
bigger. We need something more overarching to deal with these issues
across the
piece.&#148;</div><a name="10020485000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure whether the Bill strikes the right balance. Finding a way
through this matter is important, as is the language used. We have
heard valid points about whether something is seen as a registration or
an
application.</div><a name="10020485000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
law is also called into question. We have received numerous submissions
highlighting the role of the local authority in providing those
services that it is required to provide, including such things as the
national curriculum, child protection and Every Child Matters. However,
whether we like it or not, as far as I understand it, the law is
different when it comes to provision provided by parents. The locus for
the local authority in that case is very different, and I wonder
whether&#151;presumably the legal opinion in my hon. Friend the
Minister&#146;s Department has given views on this&#151;it might be
open to legal challenge by other quarters in relation to the
state&#146;s role in providing education, and the ways in which it
expects education to be provided when parents choose to do
that.</div><a name="10020485000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think we will resolve the matter today, but I hope that my hon.
Friend will show a willingness to listen&#151;I am sure she
will&#151;and engage in trying to find a better way forward. Another
approach might be to make an offer that opens up dialogue between those
in the community who home educate and local authorities. If there was
money available to do that&#151;money seems to be available to train
local authority officers to inspect and understand what they need to
inspect&#151;it would be better used when linked to some sort of
notification system with better
co-operation.</div><a name="10020485000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the evidence sessions&#151;I think that Mr. Badman
referred to this&#151;we heard positive examples of forums involving
home educators that already worked with a local authority. I do not
want anyone to misinterpret this, but some of those in the
home-educating community might be better gatekeepers for information
about possible legitimate
concerns.</div><a name="10020485000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000716"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The right hon. Lady is giving a thoughtful speech.
She is sending a much-needed message from this place that the voices of
home educators have at least been listened to, because many of them
feel that Members are deaf to what they say. Her fellow Labour members
of the Select Committee came to precisely the same conclusion about
improving the provision&#151;that was Badman&#146;s No. 1
identified need&#151;and then seeing what happens. We should work on
a voluntary basis 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column495" />Column number: 495</div>with families before imposing such draconian legislation. If there was a
need, and if there was no other way of tackling it, civil liberties and
other issues could be put aside. Initially, however, the offer should
be to work with families. I hope that the right hon. Lady&#146;s
words will influence the
Minister.</div><a name="10020485000203"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000717"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> I believe that my hon. Friend the Minister and the
Government want to take aspects of what Mr. Badman has
looked at, and what the Select Committee has said, and try to make them
work. My worry for the Government is that, for a number of different
reasons, there has been a breakdown in confidence and trust on the
issue. I am therefore worried about whether we will be able to bring
various parties together to discuss the issue productively. I think
that the Government have the best intentions. Part of the challenge, to
be fair to them, arises because they are being lobbied by a number of
other organisations and individuals to do something about the matter,
but this is about getting the balance right. We have heard about taking
a sledgehammer to crack a nut, but there are different ways to resolve
the issue and address the problems that have caused
concern.</div><a name="10020485000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000718"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I take the point that the Government are being
lobbied&#151;I am sure that that is one of the burdens of
office&#151;but the Badman report&#146;s original terms of
reference imply that the Government were originally being lobbied to
look into safeguarding, rather than the education issues. It now seems
that the issue has been turned on its head and that the education issue
is the Government&#146;s focus. Who is lobbying the Government from
that
angle?</div><a name="10020485000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000719"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will
answer that question. There is an issue about how safeguarding and
education have somehow merged into each other. Part of the problem
might be that some of the civil servants are trying to find a way to
argue the issue out by bringing that into the debate. I do not know the
answer.</div><a name="10020485000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
must be a way forward that can bring the relevant communities together,
whether they are parents, local government or the Department. I hope
that we can find a way forward, because I am concerned that we will
otherwise end up with something that cannot be delivered on the ground
and that will create division when people should be coming together,
and I am sure that that is not what this Committee or the House want to
achieve.</div><a name="10020485000626"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="10020485000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000720"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> It is a pleasure to take part in this debate. I am
glad that we have arrived at clause 26 and schedule 1. We
have had three outstanding and thoughtful contributions to the subject
so far, and it is a pleasure for me to follow
them.</div><a name="10020485000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
begin with the positive aspects of the Badman review. It arguably pays
more attention to the problems of poor support for home-educating
families and the segmented nature of the home-educating population than
to registration and monitoring, which have rightly attracted far
greater attention and controversy. The major recommendations of the
Badman report on support 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column496" />Column number: 496</div>and access to services for home-educating families include help in
finding appropriate examination centres and the provision of free
examination entries for home-educated candidates. The Children, Schools
and Families Committee received evidence that it cost &#163;1,000 for
one family to enter their children for their
GCSEs.</div><a name="10020485000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
across the Committee will notice that there are no firm provisions on
this matter in the Bill, even though central to it is the proposal of
parental guarantees and the idea that parents, as citizens, should be
able to demand from the school, the local authority and the state
certain rights, standards and access to ensure that their children get
a fair deal and a good start in life. It is extraordinary that there
are no such provisions in the Bill for home-educating families. If the
Bill gave such entitlements, we would find the kind of positive
engagement that the right hon. Member for Don Valley spoke
about.</div><a name="10020485000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000721"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> It is clear to me that such requirements are not
for this Bill. The Government have accepted the need for the
recommended provisions to support home-educating
families.</div><a name="10020485000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000722"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> It is always pleasing to hear a Minister make a
promise, albeit with no figures, no timetable and no guarantee. What
would be the point of the Bill if Ministers could just do that?
Ministers accepted the need to provide a decent education and for local
authorities and schools to be accountable to parents prior to the
introduction of the Bill. None the less, the Government have introduced
it, presumably because they believe that it will help parents to get
those things, rather than just for political window
dressing.</div><a name="10020485000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parents
of children in school have far more power and far more ability to
receive what they deserve from the state and a far greater record of
receiving it than home-educating parents, yet the Bill carries no such
guarantees for them. I would be delighted if the Minister told us what
guarantees for parents and what figures have been pencilled into the
Government
plans.</div><a name="10020485000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000723"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I am conscious that we will come shortly to
another group of proposals that contains a series of new clauses tabled
by the hon. Gentleman that deal with the specific recommendations of
Graham Badman for each area of support. I am happy to deal with these
issues at that stage, which would be the appropriate way to proceed. I
will take guidance from you, Mrs. Anderson, but it seems
that we are straying into that group of
proposals.</div><a name="10020485000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000724"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Given the time left to the Committee, I think we
will struggle to make much progress. With your permission,
Mrs. Anderson, I will take this opportunity to discuss the
whole Bill, as well as the proposals under consideration, as I hope
will other hon. Members. I hope that in the next hour and 28 minutes,
the Minister ensures that she tells us what the Government will
do.</div><a name="10020485000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000725"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns about
the provision of this much-needed support. The former Schools Minister
wrote letters to our constituents saying that there would be no support
for home education and that school was the Government&#146;s
preferred
option.</div><a name="10020485000216"></a>

consider with this batch of amendments the subsequent groups of

also be convenient to discuss the following: amendment 273, in

educated, the
authority&#146;.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0"><i class="I">This

new clauses in the second group on the support that Graham Badman
suggested home-educating families should
have.</div><a name="10020485000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000732"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I am grateful to the Minister, and I look forward
to the specific details. I believe that action is urgently needed to
clarify the existing responsibilities of local authorities in relation
to home-educated children, particularly those with special educational
needs, and to improve practice in line with those responsibilities. I
am concerned that Badman&#146;s recommendations and the Bill give
local authorities more power over home-educating parents with children
who have special educational needs, without ensuring that the
professionals working with those children have a strong understanding
of those needs. We heard about that in the oral evidence-taking
sessions, and it is a particularly important point.</div>
<a name="10020485000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was talking
about inspectors, and I will take the opportunity to focus for a moment
on that issue. The need for the proper training of inspectors has been
raised several times, yet no provision in the Bill will require
inspectors to be properly trained to do that job. Will the Government
ensure that there is a standard of training of local authority
inspectors to which home-educating parents can hold their local
authority to account? If people are going to arrive and will have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column502" />Column number: 502</div>these powers, given that the state should be the citizen and not the
other way round&#151;I know that it can get confused, particularly
over the past 12 years&#151;we need to ensure that the home-educating
parent can check that inspectors have had the proper training. The
proposal would give a massive increase in powers to those inspectors
and allow them to impose school attendance orders based on their own
judgment, which, as we have heard, may not always be
impartial.</div>
<a name="10020485000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
assessment has the Minister made of the increase in the number of
inspectors that will be required? This morning, I heard from two large
counties, which expect to go from having one person who currently works
in that area to needing 10 or more. Where will those people come from?
Will they be provided by April next year? Will they have the
astonishing array of talents and skills that they need? They will need
to be trained up to ensure that they can look out for the welfare of
the children in the home. They must be able to understand the variety
of approaches that home-educating parents use to educate their children
and provide them with autonomous education.</div>
<a name="10020485000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Children,
Schools and Families Committee heard from senior academics about just
how long it can take to learn and understand the processes and
procedures that are involved in those approaches. Inspectors must also
be able to support children with special educational needs. If they
make judgments, we hope that they will not do so on the basis of
prejudice or any snobbery towards someone&#151;perhaps a
parent&#151;who was not that well educated, but on a proper, sound
and fair basis. They get to sit in judgment and, if the Bill goes
through, decide whether to remove the right of the parent to
home-educate. We need answers on that.</div>
<a name="10020485000287"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020485000733"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Timpson</b> (Crewe and Nantwich) (Con): Does my hon.
Friend share my concern about the local authority officers who will go
into people&#146;s homes? If they do not have the proper training,
expertise and experience in dealing with that situation&#151;probably
one of most delicate situations that could be faced when dealing with a
child&#146;s education and welfare, as the Bill suggests&#151;they
might fall back on some sort of framework or mechanism devised by the
local authority to meet the requirements of the monitoring process.
That ends up looking something like the common assessment framework,
which in itself becomes a tick-box exercise, rather than a proper
analysis of that child&#146;s home
education.</div>
<a name="10020485000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000734"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> My hon. Friend makes a fair point, which I hope
resonates with hon. Members across the Committee. We know that existing
inspectors vary enormously in their understanding and approach. Some, I
must say, are excellent and one cannot find a home educator in the
country who would not speak highly of them. However, those dedicated
professionals are among those with the greatest doubts about the
Bill.</div>
<a name="10020485000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
a huge increase in inspectors. As my hon. Friend said, if we already
have unsuitable inspectors, how much more likely are we to have them if
we increase their numbers pretty much overnight, before sending them
out to make extremely sensitive judgments? On that issue alone,
consideration of the reality of the inspectors&#146; role and the
skill set that they will need should give the Minister pause before
unleashing a new group of inspectors freshly out on the streets in
April.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column503" />Column number: 503</div><a name="10020485000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, within a further three months&#151;by July
2011&#151;assessments will have been made and parents will have had
to register; I think that parents have three months in which to
register and send in to these people for evaluation the philosophy and
all the other requirements laid out by the hon. Member for Yeovil. So I
ask the Minister not only what reassurances can she give us about the
training of inspectors, but what evaluation process will be used ensure
that the inspectors themselves are kept up to standard.</div>
<a name="10020485000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, we
heard earlier in our proceedings my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton ask, &#147;Who guards the guardians?&#148;
He regretted the fact that he did not know the Latin for that phrase. I
then asked the Minister for Schools and Learners the question in Latin,
which was:</div>
<a name="10020485000593"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Quis
custodiet ipsos custodes?&#148;&#151;&#151;[Official Report,
Children, Schools and Families Public Bill Committee, 26 January 2010;
c.
193.]</div><a name="10020485000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thought that my asking the question in Latin was a perfectly reasonable
thing to do, but the Minister did not know what I meant. Of course,
many home-educated children who autonomously pursue Latin would have
known. That is a critical question.</div>
<a name="10020485000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to
me that the Bill is predicated on thinking the worst of parents; it is
all about the worst parents doing the worst job, and what we can do
about that. That is what the Bill is based on, while it is assumed that
local authority inspectors are marvellous. The only thing that I have
ever heard the Minister for Schools and Learners say about local
authority inspectors is that they will be marvellous: &#147;Oh no, we
understand the importance of training, and they will be trained up to
the highest standard&#151;oh, it&#146;s going to be
marvellous.&#148;</div>
<a name="10020485000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government view all parents as suspicious and possible failures, but
they view local authorities as paradigms of excellence. Surely, we
should be considering how the average home-educating family will be
treated by this process and what the average local authority inspector
will be like. If we understand those things, we will start to have a
more practical approach to these issues.</div>
<a name="10020485000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000735"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> My hon. Friend is making a very interesting speech.
He will be aware that Chloe Watson, who gave evidence to our Committee,
studied Latin at home. Indeed, not only did she get a GCSE in Latin,
but she is now a tutor in Latin. However, my intervention is really
about the revised impact assessment, which estimates that all
home-educated children will receive one eight-hour visit at the end of
the year and that half of home-educating families will receive an
additional eight-hour visit. It is upon that assumption that the
&#163;500 million cost is based. Therefore, does my hon. Friend think
that those eight hours, which are meant to include planning,
preparation, travel and writing up of reports, will be all the time
that these inspectors spend when they do their
monitoring?</div>
<a name="10020485000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000736"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> That is a fair question, given the assessment that
the inspectors have to make, because it is suddenly up to
them&#151;however poorly or excellently trained they are&#151;to
make that judgment, and as my hon. Friend suggests, they have to do so
even if they have been off work sick for a while, so doubtless those
hours will be crunched up.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column504" />Column number: 504</div><a name="10020485000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the moment, local authorities hire in a great number of the people who
support home education. If inspectors have to go into homes and spend
that amount of time, local authorities may need more of those people.
Whatever the arrangement, with eight-hour visits and 50 per cent. of
families receiving an additional eight-hour visit, I suggest that that
is hardly a light-touch approach.</div>
<a name="10020485000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
subject of quis custodiet ipsos custodes?, I would like to share with
the Committee the story of Ian Knight. I do not know whether the
Committee is aware of Ian Knight. Sadly, Ian Knight was grooming young
girls on internet chatrooms by posing as a man decades younger than his
real age of 50. Apparently, he used the innocuous moniker of
&#147;Reg&#148; when he preyed on girls as young as 13, using
instant messaging to contact them. All his messages had a sexual theme.
He systematically asked the children questions about their age, sexual
experiences and so on, while engaging&#151;I hate to share this with
the Committee&#151;in sexual activity in front of a live webcam.
However, the interesting thing about Mr. Ian Knight is that
he was an Ofsted inspector. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The
last thing that I would suggest is that all Ofsted inspectors are to be
viewed suspiciously, but then again I do not want all parents to be
viewed
suspiciously.</div><a name="10020485000627"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div><a name="10020485000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000737"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. May I remind the hon. Gentleman that we
are running very short of time? I urge him not to stray too far from
the subject in
hand.</div><a name="10020485000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000738"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Thank you, Mrs. Anderson.</div>
<a name="10020485000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">This goes to
the nub of a lot of fears. People from local authorities, perhaps
poorly trained, will have this role. Ofsted inspectors are subject to
far more rigorous scrutiny than, according to what we have so far heard
from the Minister, local authority inspectors will be. People
representing the state will arrive at home-educating parents&#146;
doors and say that they want to come in and insist on co-operation from
the family; otherwise, they can remove the licence to
educate.</div>
<a name="10020485000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The <i class="I">East
Riding Mail</i><i class="I"> </i>has a story this week telling the tale of
the</div>
<a name="10020485000594"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Pupil
sex shame of teaching assistant&#148;</div>
<a name="10020485000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">at a Bridlington
school. He took over from another teacher who had been struck off
because of inappropriate contact with a pupil. The point I am trying to
make, Mrs. Anderson, is that professionals who work in this
area may themselves have issues. What horrifies many parents is that
people carrying badges saying that they represent the local authority
have, under the Bill, the right to insist on co-operation from
families. We should think carefully before we assume the worst of
parents and always assume the best of local authority inspectors. We
should not stigmatise either group. It is regrettable that home
educators have been stigmatised by Ministers, including Baroness
Morgan, in public utterances.</div>
<a name="10020485000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government need to answer questions about the suitability of education.
Local authorities will have to make judgments about the suitability of
education provided, as the hon. Member for Yeovil mentioned. The
Government commissioned research from York Consulting and published
&#147;The Prevalence of Home Education in England&#151;a
feasibility study&#148; in February 2007, which made three
recommendations. The first
was:</div><a name="10020485000595"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Action
should be taken to more effectively define what constitutes an
efficient and suitable education for the purposes of LA
monitoring.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column505" />Column number: 505</div><a name="10020485000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was exactly three
years ago. Has the Department done any such work? It appears it has
not. Instead, it is leaving the work to later this year, after the Bill
has become an Act. Perhaps the Minister will tell us about
that.</div><a name="10020485000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
key question we need to ask about the direction of travel is whether
the Minister intends to extend the licensing principle further. It has
always been the statutory duty of parents to educate their children,
yet now they are to be licensed to do it. They have to apply for
permission to do what was their legal duty. Some deprived areas of
London have life-expectancy rates of five or more years lower than
those of better-off parts. People are dying because their parents did
not teach them to eat properly from an early age. Surely, a re-elected
Labour Government should identify obese parents and make them apply to
a compulsory register with proof of eating plans, annual
inspections&#151;or more if thought necessary by the
inspector&#151;and withdrawal of the right to feed their children at
home if they lose their registration. After all, Minister, if one life
is saved, that would be appropriate. This is as fundamental: the right
and duty to ensure the education of one&#146;s children is as
fundamental as eating to a family. I suggest the Minister draws back
from such a thing.</div>
<a name="10020485000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether the Minister read the article by Jonathan Sacks in <i class="I">The
</i><i class="I">Times</i><i class="I">,</i><i class="I"> </i>in which he compared the French and the
English systems of rights. I mentioned it to the Minister earlier. He
wrote:</div><a name="10020485000596"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
French approach was to see rights as an ideal description of humanity
that it is the task of politics to enforce. Politics is about the
transformation of society by the force of law. English liberty sets
limits to the State. French liberty is imposed by the State. That is
the
difference.&#148;</div><a name="10020485000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is yet another example of this Government deciding to impose their
standards on families rather than restrict the powers of the state to
intervene.</div><a name="10020485000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
inspection system, as the Minister should know, is not
neutral&#151;it will have an effect on families. We heard from Autism
in Mind, for instance, about the impact on children with autism when a
stranger such as an inspector comes into the house. I hope that we will
hear from the Minister why the equalities assessment that accompanied
the Bill did not touch on that in any way. As Carole Rutherford, the
co-founder of AIM, put
it:</div><a name="10020485000597"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Children
with autism find change very difficult and often hold fixed and rigid
views about people and the places where they are used to coming into
contact with that person. If a child is used to seeing a
professional/teacher therapist in school then bringing that person into
their home places that person out of context in their minds, and they
can find it very difficult to interact with that person even though
they are well used to doing so in
school.&#148;</div><a name="10020485000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is someone the child knows, but someone the child does not know coming
into the home will have a strong impact, and that is not even mentioned
in the consultation
process.</div><a name="10020485000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Member for Don Valley spoke about putting the cart before
the horse. I go back to what &#147;suitable&#148; looks like,
because the policy statement
says:</div><a name="10020485000598"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
intend to commission work to examine whether we can develop a set of
principles describing good quality learning in home
education&#148;.</div><a name="10020485000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Whether
we can develop&#148;? Surely we as legislators need to know the
answer to that question before we legislate. We are giving blanket
powers to local authorities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column506" />Column number: 506</div>to intervene and disrupt settled home education arrangements on the
basis of an undefined offence. We might as well pass a law allowing the
police to arrest people for an offence yet to be defined. Why not
legislate so that courts can send someone to prison for two years for
unsuitable behaviour in a public place, definition of
&#147;unsuitable&#148; to follow&#151;but do not worry, we plan
to commission work to find out whether we can come up with a set of
principles to describe
it.</div><a name="10020485000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would
we pass such a law? Would we allow such a power to be left to guidance
and ministerial whim? I hope we would not, and neither should we allow
this proposed law to pass. It will allow some jumped-up, half-trained,
school-fixated bureaucrat&#151;in some cases&#151;to take away from
families their right to determine the education of their children on
the basis of a report whose outcome was described by the Church of
England education division as
predetermined.</div><a name="10020485000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
whole process has been flawed, starting with a consultation that
ignored Cabinet Office guidelines, to which the Department is a
signatory. The Minister frowns as if to suggest that that was not the
case. The criteria and code of practice on consultation, to which the
Department is a signatory,
states:</div><a name="10020485000599"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Formal
consultation should take place at a stage when there is scope to
influence the policy
outcome.&#148;</div><a name="10020485000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we know, the response from the Government did not come out until the
day before Second Reading, so the people who took part felt that they
were not influencing the legislation. And we know, once a Bill has been
drafted and enters this place, how reluctant the Government are to give
way, sometimes even on new clauses or amendments with which they agree.
Therefore, what we had in the consultation was a complete failure to
ensure that proper guidance was followed and that people had the
ability to influence and change the
process.</div><a name="10020485000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">Home
educators are overwhelmingly opposed to the proposals in schedule 1.
The Department, when it did consult, found that it was rejected by
4,497 to 230. Ministers can gloss over that, but it is a fact. We can
argue about nuances in the report of the Labour-dominated Select
Committee, but, as I said, it rejected the central tenet of the Bill:
that registration and monitoring should be compulsory. It
stated:</div><a name="10020485000600"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
view of the concerns expressed by home educators about compulsory
registration, we suggest that registration should be
voluntary.&#148;</div><a name="10020485000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yet
the Minister has made out on several occasions that the Select
Committee report was favourable to the Government&#146;s position. It
was anything
but.</div><a name="10020485000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is widespread public concern about schedule 1, and, as colleagues have
said, I imagine that most Members of Parliament have been inundated by
correspondence from home educators. A record number of
petitions&#151;244 from across the country and from all
parties&#146; seats&#151;have been submitted to the House in
opposition to the measures. We have, as the right hon. Member for Don
Valley said, a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The numbers that were used
by Badman and now underlie the impact assessment are deeply flawed.
Every effort by home educators and me to get clarification from the
Department has failed to deal with the central issues, even though I am
grateful for its responses. The impact assessment is based on the
figure that 20 per cent. of home-educated children are not receiving a
suitable education. Yet, that is not what Graham Badman&#146;s
inquiry found. It found that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column507" />Column number: 507</div>numbers were a fraction of that. Will the Minister address why, with
children for whom the local authority did not know whether their
education was suitable, it was automatically assumed to be unsuitable?
Regarding benefits, the Government then assumed a large percentage of
the 20 per cent.&#151;itself a false figure&#151;would, by being
monitored and possibly sent back to school, immediately move back to
the national average of outcomes and get five good
GCSEs.</div><a name="10020485000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
numbers of people not in employment, education or training were equally
flawed. When queried by home educators, local authorities that were
part of the Badman response said that they could not rely on the data.
Yet, we have heard in Committee again and again that there is a high
number of NEETs. We do not know that&#151;we have no firm number to
give us any idea what the truth
is.</div><a name="10020485000320"></a>

some of the measurements are
taken.</div><a name="10020485000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000740"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Yes, and there are many other cases. It would be
welcome if the Minister were to confirm that the NEET numbers are not
robust, cannot be relied on and are not an excuse for legislation that
further invades the right of families to home
educate.</div><a name="10020485000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to remember the context. We talk about difficulties with
home education, but, in 2009, 19 per cent. of school pupils
did not achieve a single GCSE at the end of key stage 4. In 2007-08, 35
per cent. of all pupils at the end of key stage 4 did not achieve five
good GCSEs or their equivalent, and over 52 per cent. of all school
pupils failed to achieve five good GCSEs including English and
mathematics. Therefore, we are not talking about a perfect system in
schools. Yet the impact assessment assumes that any child who is picked
up and driven back to school will automatically achieve the average
outcome.</div><a name="10020485000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given,
as we have heard in evidence, that the number of children who are home
educated and who have special needs is higher in proportion than that
of the average population&#151;they may be autistic&#151;the
likelihood of their achieving the national average outcome is extremely
unlikely.</div>
<a name="10020485000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Keighley, who is no longer in her place, said that in
certain parts of this country, we must be careful about where children
are attending at a given time. However, schedule 1 will do nothing to
bring to light children below the radar or taken out of school for
forced marriage or other purposes. There is no obligation on parents to
register their children&#151;as before, it will be for local
authorities to find them and catch up with mobile families. That is
what makes the policy so problematic. Some of the people in the
home-educating community about whom many local authorities doubt and
worry have specific qualities. The legislation will not allow local
authorities to pick up on them, and therefore will not make any
difference.</div>

recognise that the interests of the child are of paramount
importance.&#148;</div><a name="10020485000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">And
yet, nowhere does that appear in schedule 1. We have Ministers saying
that the system will be light-touch, but when we look at it, we find
that it is anything but. We have Ministers saying that the interests of
the child should be paramount, but when we look at the legislation, we
find that the interests of the child are not mentioned.</div>
<a name="10020485000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will now
move on to the amendments. Amendments 254, 255, 256, 263,
264, 266, 269, 270 and 285 reflect a desire to shift from registration
to notification for the purposes of support. This should be a voluntary
notification system. The Government have again and again stressed the
importance of knowing where children are and of local authorities
knowing those who are not in school. The hon. Member for Yeovil has
used that as a reason why he and his party support the illiberal
measure of compulsory notification. I put it to him, as I have
before&#151;I hope that he may yet change his mind&#151;that
compulsory notification, albeit with no penalty, is unlikely to provide
a full
picture.</div><a name="10020485000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I mentioned in an earlier intervention, we will see many parents
deliberately hiding themselves from the local authority. For local
authority purposes, I believe that it is good for them to ascertain to
the best of their ability, without imposing on parents, all the
children in their areas who are not at school. If they interrogated
child benefit, NHS and other records, they would find a far higher
percentage of the children in their areas than they ever would hope to
achieve through registration, even if it was nominally
compulsory.</div>
<a name="10020485000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000741"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> That is the point on which we disagree. The
Children, Schools and Families Committee&#146;s review of elective
home education came up with a voluntary scheme, which I suspect was
something of a compromise among its members. It also concluded at
paragraph 62 of its report that it considers it:</div>
<a name="10020485000603"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unacceptable
that local authorities do not know accurately how many children of
school age in their area are in school, are being home
educated&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column509" />Column number: 509</div><a name="10020485000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assume that he signed
up to that part of the report, so is he really confident that the
mechanisms that he is suggesting can deliver that outcome efficiently
and economically?</div>
<a name="10020485000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000742"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> We have a system, which he highlighted the costs
of, proposed in the Bill. If the Secretary of State is right about the
number of home-educated children he mentioned on Second
Reading&#151;70,000&#151;the costs of the monitoring and licensing
system will be around &#163;500 million over the next 10 years. The
child benefit records already exist; the claimant rate for child
benefit is astonishingly high. If that database was interrogated, along
with others, the cost would be a fraction of the cost of setting up a
registration system. Therefore, unless the hon. Gentleman has reason to
believe that that is not true, I do not understand why he would think
that setting up yet another database was a better and more economical
way of finding out what we both desire local authorities to
know.</div>
<a name="10020485000336"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000743"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am not sure whether the evidence that the Select
Committee received justifies the view that it is possible to prepare
confidently an estimate of those young people in home education by
working back from the indicators that he has mentioned. The cost he
cites is the cost of this hugely bureaucratic mechanism for oversight
which he knows we strongly
oppose.</div><a name="10020485000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000744"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> That is a fair point. When the Select Committee
heard from our clerks that the Government had intimated that they did
not think existing databases could be used I wondered why that could
possibly be. Why could we not use existing data? If we need to give
local authorities the right to access that data, we could do so simply
and easily in this Bill. I cannot see any blockage to using existing
information. This Bill is far more invasive than simply looking at
existing figures<i class="I">.</i> The hon. Gentleman knows that as from last
September we have ContactPoint, which provides a list of all children
in the
area.</div><a name="10020485000338"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000745"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises some interesting issues.
He knows that both our parties are committed to abolishing
ContactPoint, so there is a limit to the extent to which we can fall
back on that solution. He has raised an interesting point. I hope that
the Minister will take that on directly.</div>
<a name="10020485000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000746"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> We are opposed to ContactPoint precisely because,
like the Bill, it is universal rather than something that targets
limited resources on those with greatest need. The compulsory
notification system proposed by the h M for Yeovil would force parents
to notify the state of how they were educating their children only if
they were home educating. Although I am sure that there are other ways
of notifying the state, I am not aware that parents who send their
children to independent schools have to fill out a form and register
the fact that they are doing
so.</div><a name="10020485000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000747"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman not concerned that even if
we could get all the information from the other data sources, we would
merely establish the total number of children not at school? We would
not establish which children were being home educated. We would be
including in that children who have gone missing, children 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column510" />Column number: 510</div>who have totally disappeared&#151;a whole host of children. That is
why we feel that the notification scheme must have a firm
basis.</div><a name="10020485000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000748"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> That is a fair point. The Select Committee said
that there should be visibility. If it interrogates existing databases,
it will have that. It can then go out and try to ascertain within the
powers that it currently has what the situation of those children is.
The big point that people have made is that we need to narrow it down.
We need to find the children below the radar. If all the children below
the radar are identified it will be possible for the local authority to
make inquiries. I do not know whether parents who send their children
to independent schools have to register in some way. That itself is an
interesting question. Parents who educate at home would have to go
through registration, even under the Liberal Democrats&#146;
proposal, and yet those at independent schools do
not.</div><a name="10020485000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000749"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not feel that there is an
inconsistency in that he wants to send inspectors to every single
family where there is a child who is not at a main
school?</div><a name="10020485000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000750"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I think we all agreed that it would be best if
local authorities had that data and could then make judgments on how to
act on that. It would be a different Bill from this that looked at what
they did. This takes me on to another interesting aspect of this whole
notification argument. The serious case review information with which
we have been provided, and the information that the hon. Lady and I get
on the Select Committee, show that the most vulnerable children in this
country are not of school age. They are under five. That is one of the
most peculiar things about this. As my hon. Friend the Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham, who is an expert on these matters, knows full
well, children under five are subject to the greatest level of abuse
and are the most vulnerable to abuse. Are the Government coming forward
with any form of registration system for them? No they are not. They
are doing it for school age children, who would be in school for only 9
or 10 per cent. of the year&#151;that is the average
amount of time that a child in a maintained school spends at school. We
are setting up this vast panoply of registration just in case there
might be a problem, even though we know from international research,
from New Zealand and around the world, that home-educated children do
not have those problems.</div>
<a name="10020485000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">New Zealand
has a very similar jurisdiction to ours, and it introduced a system
very similar to the one proposed by the Minister. What has it done with
it? Last year it decided to stop operating it because it was a waste of
time and money. It found that incidents of poor education were
sufficiently small&#151;just around 5 per cent.; so much
less than the educational failure found in its own school
system&#151;that it could not justify the monitoring and inspection
regime for a system that produced much better outcomes and a far lower
level of failure than state schools. Of course, we call home education
a system, but it is not&#151;it is diverse and varied. New Zealand
decided that, if it was to take an additional sum of money to improve
education, it was best spent on an area where there were known
problems&#151;failing schools would spring to mind
immediately&#151;rather 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column511" />Column number: 511</div>than on pursuing the families of home-educated children, with 95 per
cent. of whom the local authorities could see no
problems.</div>
<a name="10020485000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right
hon. Member for Don Valley gave a very thoughtful speech. The question
that I am sure she would be asking the Minister is why are we doing
this if those who have done it elsewhere have found it to be a waste of
time and found that there were no problems with home education. Do we
have any special reasons? I am sure that she could be convinced to
bring in this kind of draconian system, as indeed could I, if we saw
that there was a serious problem that needed to be tackled. No such
serious problem has been established. The Badman report came up with
the pre-determined outcome, as the Church of England put
it.</div><a name="10020485000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will talk a little more about the international context, because the
Minister may have seen the memorandum from Kelly L. Green, a parent
from British Columbia who home educates. My heart sank when I first
read it, which must show a certain errant prejudice on my part, but I
read her submission and found it to be excellent. Canada has large
heavily populated jurisdictions with excellent regulatory models
including the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia.</div>
<a name="10020485000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the United
States, 10 states make no legislative demands of home
educators&#151;none. They include the heavily populated states of
Texas, Illinois and Michigan. Some 14 states require notification only
of intent to educate at home. They include California, Wisconsin and
Delaware, so at least they are with the Liberal Democrats. Some 20
states have moderate regulation, meaning that parents may be asked to
submit materials in a portfolio, test scores or evaluation. Only six
states have what is considered to be heavy regulation. Even the heavily
regulated states make no demands on home-educating families who home
educate akin to those proposed in schedule 1. Kelly L. Green
says:</div><a name="10020485000604"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
the best of my knowledge, no state demands home visits, and no state
requests to interview home-educated
children.&#148;</div><a name="10020485000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
vast laboratory of the United States, where there are far more
home-educated children than in any other part of the world and they
must know the subject better than anyone else, has no state demands for
home visits and no state requests to interview home-educated children.
Yet here we are with the Government pressing ahead with something that
has no
base.</div><a name="10020485000349"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000751"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I wonder, while we are touring around the world,
whether we might just go back to New Zealand, where I understand that
parents must receive approval for home-based schooling from its
Ministry of Education. It is a complicated registration process and
they are given an annual grant to help with the cost of learning
materials. I understand that in Ireland and France there is a
registration scheme. Some countries are highly regulated and in the US,
Pennsylvania has a highly regulated scheme in place for those families
who wish to home educate. We need to have some balance when we look at
what happens around the world.</div>
<a name="10020485000629"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000752"></a>Mr.
Stuart</b><b class="B">:</b> I was seeking to provide that balance,
because in Badman&#146;s report he mentions New Zealand a great deal
and did not mention that it had just given up the very proposal for
monitoring and registration that he was suggesting.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column512" />Column number: 512</div><a name="10020485000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">Greater
regulation of home education does not produce better results. A
peer-reviewed academic article on that topic in &#147;Academic
Leadership&#148;, called &#147;State Regulation of Homeschooling
and Homeschoolers&#146; SAT Scores&#148; and dated 11 August 2009,
made the following
observation:</div><a name="10020485000605"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
authors of this study find no evidence from their analysis that
supports the claim that states should exercise more regulation of
homeschool families and students in order to assure better academic
success&#148;.</div><a name="10020485000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
looked at all the different states&#151;they had all the
laboratories, as states in the United States are often referred
to&#151;and compared outcomes to find out whether they were better in
more heavily regulated states. What a fantastic opportunity to do that
in respect of so many different jurisdictions and approaches. That
article found no link at all between the level of regulation and the
outcomes. So we are talking about bringing in legislation that could
cost &#163;500 million, even though the only evidence that we have
from international studies suggests that it will bring no educational
benefits at all. That is not reassuring when we are considering giving
this measure the okay.</div>
<a name="10020485000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">The article
continues:</div><a name="10020485000606"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On
the contrary, the findings of this study are consistent with other
research findings that homeschool students perform well
academically&#151;typically above national averages on standardized
achievement tests and at least on par with others on college-admissions
tests &#151; and do so regardless of whether they live in a state
that applies low, moderate, or high governmental regulation of
homeschooling.</div><a name="10020485000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have mentioned previously another particularly interesting bit of
research that I ask Government members of the Committee to think on. It
states:</div><a name="10020485000607"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Research
conducted on home-based education indicates that, unlike traditionally
schooled students, home-educated students whose parents have less
formal education achieve similar academic results to those whose
parents have more academic
credentials.&#148;</div><a name="10020485000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, home education levels the playing field between the more
educated and the less educated
parent.</div><a name="10020485000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
1999 study by Dr. Lawrence Rudner, vice-president of the Graduate
Management Admission Council, which is the testing company that runs
the GMAT test in the United States&#151;the primary test used
there&#151;observed:</div><a name="10020485000608"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Home
schooling&#146;s one-on-one tutorial method seemed to equalize the
influence of parents&#146; educational background on their
children&#146;s academic performance. Home educated students&#146;
test scores remained between the 80th and 90th percentiles, whether
their mothers had a college degree or did not finish high
school.&#148;</div><a name="10020485000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would have hoped that hon. Members throughout the House would be
excited at that prospect. Home education could have a transformational
effect on the chance of children from the poorest homes getting a good
education&#151;if the parents had the commitment and the desire to do
it&#151;even if their parents did not have a good education
themselves. He
continued:</div><a name="10020485000609"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Students
taught at home by mothers who never finished high school scored a full
55 percentage points higher than public school students from families
of comparable educational
backgrounds.&#148;</div><a name="10020485000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, although that cannot be guaranteed for all by any means,
not least because of the economic realities, parents who are not well
educated and who live in a deprived community and are prepared to show
such commitment will none the less make a huge difference to the
outcomes for their children, who are of course most likely to fail at
school.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column513" />Column number: 513</div><a name="10020485000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000753"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> The hon. Gentleman is quoting some research, but
it is clear that there is a lack of good research in this area about
home education versus schooling. From the analysis done of the limited
research that is available, the problem seems to be that often the
groups of parents who nominate their children to be put into such
studies have some of the brightest children, and they are
self-selecting, so those studies do not give a full, accurate picture
of home education across the piece. Does he accept
that?</div><a name="10020485000361"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000754"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Any academic exercise&#151;I want to be rude and
say, &#147;unless it was dreamed up by the DCSF&#148;&#151;would
seek to ensure that it took out all those biases: that is what
academics do. However, former local authority officers who are asked to
come to a predetermined outcome do not get rid of the biases. When they
contact local authorities and get 74 of the 152 respond, it seems that
they do not ask themselves the question that the Minister asked me. The
Minister&#146;s impact assessment is based on the responses of the 74
self-selecting local authorities that replied to Graham Badman&#146;s
request. Why would a local authority choose to reply? Perhaps because
it is a local authority that has a problem with home education. Perhaps
because it is a local authority that has not got it right and does not
understand the existing legislative guidelines, and has therefore
decided to fill in the forms and send them back. Where is that
self-selecting bias represented in any of the Government&#146;s
views? It is absolutely
absent.</div><a name="10020485000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister sits there, dismissing serious academic research from all over
the world&#151;as did Graham Badman, because it did not fit with the
outcomes that he had predetermined for him by the Department, and that
he duly delivered. Yet his own efforts at gathering data were subject
to no such rigorous academic scrutiny and, in fact, every time anyone
has questioned them, they have been shown to be false. When the
Minister gets a chance to respond&#151;when I sit down&#151;I am
particularly looking forward to hearing her defence of the numbers,
such as the 20 per cent. of young people not getting a suitable
education.</div><a name="10020485000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will also help us with the contradictions that
seem to be so frequent. We were told that the regime would be light
touch, but then we read about it and it is the opposite. We heard that
the whole purpose, from the Government&#146;s point of view, was to
give more help to home-educating parents, yet Ministers have
successively said that there is no money to support home
education&#151;the right hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight),
when he was Minister with responsibility for schools, wrote saying that
to the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole. A few weeks ago,
when looking on the DCSF website, we found the programme that allows
children to have a home computer&#151;I forget its name&#151;in the
small print at the bottom of the page, and it said specifically,
&#147;but not if you are home-educated&#148;. No access to IT then.
The website said that on the very day the Minister told us how the
Government wanted to change
things.</div><a name="10020485000364"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000755"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> That point presents an interesting issue. The
reason why the home access scheme is not being made available to
families who home educate is because 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column514" />Column number: 514</div>we do not know who those families are. We have no accurate register to
look to. Some families have put themselves forward and notified their
local authority, but there is no accurate record. That is the problem,
and the nub of the issue. We do not have an accurate record of families
who are home
educating.</div><a name="10020485000365"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000756"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. As I have decided to broaden the debate
to cover all the amendments to schedule 1, the hon. Gentleman may wish
to refer to his later amendments, and hon. Members who have already
spoken may wish to speak again, briefly. However, we want to allow time
for the Minister to respond, so I urge hon. Members to be as brief as
possible.</div><a name="10020485000366"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000757"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Thank you, Mrs.
Anderson.</div><a name="10020485000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s intervention was extraordinary. Time and again we get
the circular argument that we need registration before we can provide
support. We have 20,000 home-educated children who are known to be
registered with their local authority. Has that led to any provision
for them? It has not. That is extraordinary. People have registered
even when there is nothing in it for them, but why, when something
comes along that they could be given, do the Government put in the
small print at the bottom of the website, &#147;But not for you,
I&#146;m afraid, even if you are registered&#148;? Why should those
people have any trust or
belief?</div><a name="10020485000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
gets worse. On 12 November, in a written answer, the Minister
said:</div><a name="10020485000610"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;So
far as local authority support for the education of home educated
pupils is concerned, we plan to strengthen the school census guidance
for the January 2010 return to ensure that all local authorities are
aware that they can already include in the Alternative Provision Return
for Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) home educated pupils whom they
support financially and who have a statement, or have significant
special educational needs that have not been formally recognised
through a
statement&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10020485000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">they

for DSG purposes.&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 12 November

can only fund those whom they are funding, but they cannot add anyone
who comes to them for funding. Perhaps the Minister can spell out why
that is not an extraordinary set of
contradictions.</div><a name="10020485000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am aware of your strictures, Mrs. Anderson. The first set of
amendments would make the shift from registration to notification. In
the second group, which is now grouped with the first, amendment 273
suggests that, as in New Zealand and Ontario, visits should take place
only where there are reasonable grounds for concern about home-educated
children. Having heard the debate this afternoon, I hope that all
Committee members will see that that is entirely reasonable. Home
visits should not take place if there are no grounds for concern. I
hope that we will have the chance to push the amendment to a
vote.</div>
<a name="10020485000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the new
clauses, I have
tried&#151;</div><a name="10020485000379"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000758"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. May I ask you to repeat for the benefit
of the Chair and the Committee which clause or amendment you wanted to
press to a
vote?</div><a name="10020485000380"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000759"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Amendment 273 in the second group.</div>
<a name="10020485000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clauses would put into law Graham Badman&#146;s positive
recommendations, which, despite all the talk and policy guidance, are
not to be found in the legislation. I hope that Members will consider
supporting the new
clauses.</div><a name="10020485000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the final group of amendments, amendments 115 and 279 would do
essentially the same thing. They suggest that refusal to
co-operate&#151;assuming, of course, that the Government press ahead
with the measures&#151;should be grounds for refusal of continued
registration only if the refusal to co-operate is unreasonable. As it
stands, the local authority does not even need to show that a parent is
being unreasonable. I hope that Ministers will see fit to include my
amendments, as our direction of travel is the same, but my amendments
ameliorate some possibly draconian impacts. Amendments 287, 303 and 304
are an attempt to ensure that the Bill will do what Ministers say it is
supposed to do, which is to put the interests of the child first. I
would like to push amendment 287 to a vote, if I may.</div>
<a name="10020485000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
current bias against home education in schedule 1, which deals with
school attendance order proceedings, must be removed. It is absurd that
our law says that if someone home educates without being registered,
the quality of the education, the needs of the child and so on are to
be disregarded. If a parent tried to challenge that and went to court,
the court would be told that it must disregard the quality of the
education and the interests of the child, because the law says so. I
therefore hope that the Committee can support the amendments if, as I
fear, the Bill is to continue on its merry way out of Committee. Having
spoken for long enough, I will sit down.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000760"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I will be relatively brief, covering the rest of
the amendments. Our starting point must be a recognition of the
diversity of the home education community. The biggest category seems
to be parents who are so committed that they devote themselves to home
educating their children. I have only admiration for that, because it
means that at least one parent does not take the opportunity to work
and instead supports and provides hour after hour of education, in
whatever form it takes. That is an enormous commitment, and it makes me
understand how angry those parents feel about what is a real attack on
them.</div>
<a name="10020485000630"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="10020485000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
second category is parents who withdraw their children from school
because the school is not serving them well, and often that is when the
child or young person has special educational needs that the school
just cannot meet. I have also come across many instances where that has
been done, possibly for those with special educational needs, because
of bullying. I presume that there is a category of children about whom
we know little. The Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families
discovered that some local authorities have been colluding to keep down
the exclusion figures, and that ought to be tackled firmly. It is
absolutely clear that that complex situation has been dealt with in a
rushed and flawed process, which can only lead to bad legislation in
its current
form.</div><a name="10020485000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to the quality of education that might be provided, I would like
to submit some DCSF evidence to the hon. Member for Beverley and
Holderness. The extension of the &#147;effective provision of
pre-school education&#148; study has shown that children with parents
who have lesser qualifications and who spend large amounts
of quality time with them will perform better that children
with parents who have higher qualifications but do not. That is
interesting, and in some ways it supports what he has said. The
research was carried out by the Institute of Education, based at the
university of London.</div>
<a name="10020485000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
is such a pig&#146;s ear that the best thing would probably be to
vote against it, but we have tried to be constructive and have set out
a series of amendments that hang together to scrap the idea of a
registration process. I had originally thought that a simple
registration process would work, but as soon as we look at the
Government&#146;s suggestions, we see that there seems to be no such
thing as a simple registration process. We therefore propose a
notification scheme. That must, of course, be backed up by other
measures in time, but immediately it could be backed up with the
supportive measures. Supportive measures should be in the Bill and
there should be a guarantee.</div>
<a name="10020485000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
tabled two amendments pertaining to special educational needs in
particular. Although there is support as far as children&#146;s
statements are concerned, there are many concerns about parents
withdrawing their children from school because they are not getting the
extra support that they need there, probably because they are not
statemented. If we were assured today that that support would be
offered as soon as possible, we would feel much better about the
situation.</div><a name="10020485000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
give a fair summary, the rest of our amendments try to reduce the
prescriptiveness of the Government&#146;s approach throughout. In
amendment 225 and new clause 5, we suggest that we should
start again with a proper, independent inquiry that people trust so
that we can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column517" />Column number: 517</div>define what we mean by &#147;efficient and suitable&#148; and,
equally, establish fully all the support that is needed. We need to do
that properly with a full, independent inquiry, and that must be done
before we establish the sort of registration scheme that the Government
propose.</div><a name="10020485000390"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000761"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Was the Badman review not meant to be a
full, independent inquiry? It was certainly an independent
review.</div><a name="10020485000391"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000762"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I covered that earlier when I said that the
process was rushed, as everyone would agree, so I do not think that it
could be counted as a proper inquiry. The fact that the Badman review
did not include examples of good practice for home education shows that
it was not balanced. That was totally lacking in the report. We are
looking for an independent
inquiry.</div><a name="10020485000392"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000763"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> It is worth putting on the record that not one of
the people on the Badman review had expertise in home education. It was
quite extraordinary. One member of the expert panel described the whole
process as the most slapdash in which he had been involved in 30 years
of academic
life.</div><a name="10020485000393"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000764"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman. I go back to where I
started: we should not have legislation based on that process. It can
only end up as bad legislation of which no Government would be
proud.</div><a name="10020485000394"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000765"></a>The
Chairman:</b> As we have broadened the debate to all the
amendments to schedule 1, do you want to make a further contribution,
Mr.
Gibb?</div><a name="10020485000395"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000766"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b>
No.</div><a name="10020485000396"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000767"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> In response to the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and
North Poole, I wish to say that Badman contains references to good
practice throughout the country where local authorities work alongside
home-educating families. I refer the Committee to page 16, which sets
out good examples. The debate has been wide-ranging and, clearly, the
number of amendments that have been tabled and grouped means that my
response will be lengthy. However, I shall try to get through all the
issues that have been
raised.</div><a name="10020485000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
behalf of the Government, I totally refute the idea that we believe
that home-educating families are not doing a good job in the majority
of cases. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton drew
attention to three tasks given to Graham Badman, but the fourth task
was to look at whether any changes were needed in the current regime
for monitoring the standard of home education to meet the needs and
support the work of parents, local authorities and other partners to
ensure that all children achieve the &#147;Every Child
Matters&#148; outcomes. That was clearly put to Graham Badman as one
of the issues he needed to address in his
report.</div><a name="10020485000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities have lobbied hard on the education point. On several
occasions, they have told the Department that they do not have the
powers they need to make sure that children in their localities are
receiving an education. As for the needs and best interests of a child
not being set out in the Bill, that is because local authorities have a
general duty under section 175 of the Education Act 2002,
which provides that they must carry out all functions conferred on them
in their education
capacity</div><a name="10020485000617"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;with
a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of
children.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column518" />Column number: 518</div><a name="10020485000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
set out the role of a local authority and what it has to do, at the
heart of the Bill is ensuring that the interests and needs of children
are met, and the basis of our proposals on the registration and
monitoring of home education are no different from the basis of other
clauses that we have been considering during the past few weeks.
Parents have a primary duty to ensure that their child receives a
suitable education, and home education is a perfectly valid option. The
state is already required to intervene on the child&#146;s behalf
when parents fail to fulfil their duty to the child, but the state
cannot fulfil its responsibilities towards the child if it does not
know that the child is being home educated, and has no means of
establishing whether the child is receiving any education, let alone a
suitable one. That is the key point that the hon. Member for Beverley
and Holderness fails to
grasp.</div><a name="10020485000400"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000768"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I refer to annexe A of the Badman report. First, the
fourth bullet point is not mentioned in Graham Badman&#146;s letter
to the Secretary of State. Secondly, it does not mention standards of
education. It refers to achieving the &#147;Every Child
Matters&#148; outcomes, which is more towards the safeguarding side
of the issue rather than the quality of education. It seems to be
something that Badman introduced as the review was being conducted
rather than what was asked of him by the
Government.</div><a name="10020485000401"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000769"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> At this late hour in our proceedings, I shall be
happy to write to the hon. Gentleman and set out matters clearly. I
understand that Graham Badman was tasked with looking at home education
and what could be done to support local authorities and home-educating
families to do their job
better.</div><a name="10020485000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over
the past year, we have heard repeatedly that the proposals are a
massive state intrusion into family life, but the reality is quite
different. I do not accept the opening comments of the hon. Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. We presume that parents opting to home
educate are acting in the best interests of their child, which is why
there is a presumption they will be registered. I also do not accept
that we are maligning families by asking them to go through the process
of being registered on the presumption that that will
happen.</div><a name="10020485000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">Registration
will be a simple, once-a-year process. The education plan, of which
there has been much discussion this afternoon, will be simple and able
to accommodate all educational approaches. Monitoring will be light
touch and will involve one meeting a year. There will be informal
discussions with an emphasis on the work that has taken place over the
year, plans for the year ahead and any additional support the local
authority can give. Children will not be tested or forced to meet alone
with a local authority officer.</div>
<a name="10020485000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Beverley and Holderness seemed to imply that the
consultation was completely meaningless. After that consultation
process, the Government thought again about the Badman recommendation
that the child be seen alone by a local authority officer. We have
removed that provision from the legislation. The officer can ask to see
the child, but there is no requirement on the parent or
child.</div><a name="10020485000405"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000770"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> But if they do not co-operate with that visit,
which is specifically set out, they can have their licence from the
state revoked. Surely, that is disingenuous.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column519" />Column number: 519</div><a name="10020485000406"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000771"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> The hon. Gentleman fails to grasp the fact that
the issue is about moving home education to a new way of working in a
spirit of collaboration and co-operation with local authorities. I am
not for one moment pretending that everything has been perfect in the
past. Clearly, it has not been. In the vast majority of his
recommendations, Graham Badman sets out the need for more support for
home-educating families and a change in how local authorities work with
such families. I see that as a positive way forward that is in the
spirit of collaboration and co-operation, rather than the adversarial
way in which the hon. Gentleman seems to think the registration and
monitoring process should be
conducted.</div><a name="10020485000407"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000772"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> It is not me who thinks that,
but the huge majority of home-educating families. Thousands of them
replied to the consultation, even though extraordinarily and against
the Cabinet guidelines to which the Department is a signatory, the
Department did not ensure that everyone who had already registered with
a local authority was told about it. The guidelines specifically state
that the people who will be most directly affected must be told. The
Department did not do that, but thousands of people replied, and 95 per
cent. of them said, &#147;No way.&#148; It is those people who
think the proposal will destroy positive relationships, and there is
evidence from North Yorkshire and elsewhere that parents who previously
co-operated with local authorities are no longer doing so. That is not
my assertion&#151;it is the reality on the ground, and it is time the
Minister woke
up.</div><a name="10020485000408"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000773"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> One of the key problems is that we do not know
all the families that are home educating. It is difficult to alert
home-educating families to a consultation if we do not know who they
are. I am very conscious of the time and feel that we need to move on,
but I want to put this clearly on the record: we cannot take it as read
that all home-educated children are receiving the education to which
they are entitled, when some remain unknown to the local authority. Far
from intruding into family life, it would be a failure on the part of
the state not to take the action we are proposing. Local authorities
must be able to act against parents who wilfully fail to educate their
children.</div>
<a name="10020485000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parents who
are struggling to give their children the education they want for them
need to be much better supported&#151;I think we all agree on that
point&#151;without the fear that their child will automatically be
sent back to school if that is not the best place for them. I think we
can all agree on that as well. We want to support home-educating
families and ensure that they can provide the education their children
need. Let us be clear about why the proposals are
important.</div>
<a name="10020485000410"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000774"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Will the Minister answer the specific point about
the January census. I cannot claim to be an expert, but why does it
appear that local authorities cannot register a home-educated child and
have the money that the Minister says she is so desperate to get to
help
them?</div><a name="10020485000631"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="10020485000411"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000775"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I am happy to come to that point in a moment, but
I want first to talk about the available financial support.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column520" />Column number: 520</div><a name="10020485000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are taking
action because unless we do so, we will not know how many children are
home educated, which cannot be right. I think the hon. Member for
Yeovil agrees. He made it clear, as did the Select Committee, that it
cannot be right for local authorities not to know which children in
their area are being home educated. Without the provision, some
children will not receive the education they need because the local
authority cannot intervene. That cannot be right, and the hon. Member
for Yeovil recognised
that.</div><a name="10020485000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
proposals are not about state control of home education. They are about
acting when a child&#146;s rights are not being met by their parents.
The proposals are moderate and proportionate, and they will keep
England among the most liberal countries in the world for home
education.</div><a name="10020485000414"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000776"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> By the same token, on the criteria set out by
the Minister, why have the Government singularly failed to introduce a
scheme of compulsory registration of private
fosterers?</div><a name="10020485000415"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000777"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I am sorry. Will the hon. Gentleman repeat the
question?</div><a name="10020485000416"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000778"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> By the same token, on exactly the same criteria
that the Minister set out, why after many opportunities have the
Government singularly refused to institute a scheme of compulsory
registration of private fostering arrangements for exactly the same
safeguarding reasons that she is setting out for home
education?</div><a name="10020485000417"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000779"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I will be frank with the Committee. I do not know
the answer, so I will write to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="10020485000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the new clauses tabled by the hon. Member for
Beverley and Holderness on the need to support home-educating families,
new clause 8 is intended to give effect to the Badman report&#146;s
recommendation 15, which states that</div>
<a name="10020485000618"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the DCSF should
take such action as necessary to prevent schools or local authorities
advising parents to consider home education to prevent permanent
exclusion or using such a mechanism to deal with educational or
behavioural
issues&#148;.</div><a name="10020485000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
schools and local authorities should not advise parents to consider
home education to avoid permanent exclusion or to deal with behavioural
issues. We have strengthened the &#147;Guide to the Law for School
Governors&#148; to emphasise that that is both unethical and against
the law, and we have undertaken to strengthen the DCSF exclusions
guidance on the issue when it is next
revised.</div><a name="10020485000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 9 addresses recommendation 4 of the Badman report, which was to
put local authority consultative forums on a statutory footing, and to
control closely how they are constituted and operate. That is to give
home-educating families a
voice.</div><a name="10020485000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">Children&#146;s
trusts are a series of partnership arrangements whereby a local
authority and its partners co-operate to improve the well-being of
children. Consultation with home educators is consistent with our
commitment to making regulations for children&#146;s trust boards to
consult widely with partners. We will include a requirement in our
statutory guidance on home education to require local authorities to
set up a consultative forum to review local authority
arrangements.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000780"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="10020485000423"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000781"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I am happy to do so, but I will not get through
much.</div><a name="10020485000424"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000782"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> This is an important point. The Bill could inflict
further damage by destroying existing forums. Children&#146;s trusts
are not working effectively throughout the country&#151;that was
certainly the evidence that we heard in the Select Committee&#151;so
why not set up a consultative forum specifically for home-educating
parents?</div><a name="10020485000425"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000783"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> Home-educating families said that they did not
feel they had a voice into the local authority. That is why Graham
Badman made that
recommendation.</div><a name="10020485000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 10 would give effect to recommendation 10 of the
Badman report covering support for home-educated children and young
people to find appropriate examination centres and to provide entry
free to all home-educated candidates who have demonstrated sufficiently
their preparedness, through routine monitoring, for all DCSF-funded
qualifications. We accept that local authorities have a role in
supporting home-educated children and young people to identify
examination centres, and that they should provide funding. We support
that.</div><a name="10020485000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 11 would give effect to recommendation 11 of the
Badman report about working in collaboration with colleges and schools
to extend access to a range of services and facilities, such as music
tuition, on the same cost basis as for students in maintained schools.
In our response, the Government agreed that home educators should have
access to specialist music tuition, and commented that that would
require careful and sensitive brokering by local authorities, which
would need to work closely with their schools and other service
providers to deliver what was
needed.</div><a name="10020485000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 12 is intended to give effect to recommendation 11 of the Badman
report, which recommends that local authorities should, in
collaboration with schools and colleges, extend access to a range of
services and facilities, including school libraries, sports facilities
and specialist facilities. The Government response detailed specific
steps, including new funding, for implementing the Badman
recommendations, and implementation is under
way.</div><a name="10020485000429"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000784"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Will the Minister confirm, therefore, that she will
extend and make available the opportunities of flexi schooling, which
is important to some
parents?</div><a name="10020485000430"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000785"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> In the recommendation, Graham Badman referred to
flexi schooling, and to the role that it could play for some
home-educating families. The Department is keen to explore flexi
schooling, and to consider how it can best be used to support families
who choose to home educate for part of the time but would like to be
able to access flexi schooling when
appropriate.</div><a name="10020485000431"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000786"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Three years ago, the York Consulting study
recommended that flexi schooling had to be considered. There were only
three recommendations. Why did not the Department act then, and why is
it making vague promises
now?</div><a name="10020485000432"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000787"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> I want to come on to the York Consulting study in
a moment, but I first want to deal with the issue of training for
inspectors, and its funding. I believe that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column522" />Column number: 522</div>the impact assessment shows that money has been set aside already for
the training of inspectors, which will, of course, take place before
implementation.</div><a name="10020485000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also want to refer to special educational needs, because many members
of the Committee are interested in support for home-educating families
with a child who has special educational needs. The Government have
undertaken to send further guidance to local authorities, setting out
their responsibilities towards children with SEN statements and
emphasising that they should be working in partnership with
home-educating parents. We will ensure that our guidance for local
authorities makes it clear that home-educated children with SEN can be
included in the alternative provision return for funding purposes, if
the local authority is providing significant support towards the
child&#146;s education, irrespective of whether the child is
statemented. I hope that that is
helpful.</div><a name="10020485000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">Home
educators have not suggested to the Government that there are
deficiencies in those aspects of Graham Badman&#146;s recommendations
on support. They are concerned about consistency in local
implementation, which is why we seek, through our guidance, to ensure
that there is a level playing field around the
country.</div><a name="10020485000435"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that I have addressed the point about the consultation. I feel
that all responses to the consultation were
considered.</div><a name="10020485000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first group of amendments is very much about the registration system
that will be established. The main amendments in the group are about
having a notification system rather than a registration system,
removing the grounds on which registration could be refused, removing
the requirement on a parent to have to lodge an educational statement,
and making registration continuous rather than annual, by removing the
cross-references to the revocation section. There is also
the issue of keeping the register private, on
which I think we started the debate&#151;that seems many hours ago
now.</div><a name="10020485000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that this is the third time that I have said that the presumption
is that any child whose parent applies for registration will be
registered. Refusal of an application must be for the limited reasons
set out in the Bill. Grounds for refusal must be substantial, and
parents will have the right to an independent appeal against any
decision not to register. A local authority has the power to refuse to
register a child when the authority has decided that home education
will be harmful to the child&#146;s
welfare.</div><a name="10020485000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is right to give local authorities the discretion to refuse to register
when an application is devoid of key information about a child, such as
where they live, or when the parent has previously been refused
registration or registration has been revoked. A notification scheme
would not allow any of that to happen, and would therefore be
unacceptable. In all cases, but particularly when refusal is
contemplated, we want to encourage local authorities to make full and
comprehensive inquiries, which we would not want to cut
short.</div>
<a name="10020485000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think that
the regulations and guidance, which will be produced through wide
consultation with home educators, will set out the correct balance
between making timely decisions and ensuring that they have been
carefully thought through. They must be reasonable and not
arbitrary.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column523" />Column number: 523</div><a name="10020485000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 27
of the policy statement makes it clear that refusal is likely to be
considered only when a child protection plan indicates home education
is inappropriate or when a section 47 Children Act inquiry is under
way. We expect there to be few such
cases.</div><a name="10020485000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other amendments in the first group address issues relating to the
manner in which the application is made, including the educational
statement setting out the approach to be taken in the year ahead, and
access to, and the purpose of, the education. We set out in our policy
statement the approach we would take through regulations and guidance.
Those will be produced in consultation with home-educating families and
other interested
parties.</div><a name="10020485000442"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000788"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> In the Minister&#146;s own words, how will she
know who those home educating families
are?</div><a name="10020485000443"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000789"></a>Ms
Johnson:</b> At the moment, the problem is that there are only
various groups that we know of, of which Education Otherwise is a vocal
example. Once we have the register up and running, we will be able to
consult more widely. In the first instance, that has to be with the
people we know of. That is the only logical
approach.</div><a name="10020485000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley commented on local
authority capacity and the ability of council officers to understand
and engage with home-educating families. I listened carefully to her
concerns. We want to move away from instances such as the example of a
report including the fact that incense was burned in the house as if
that was indicative of something being not quite right. We want local
authority officials and officers to concentrate on working
co-operatively with families and to provide the support they need. They
should consider what is in the best interests of the child for the year
ahead and look at the education that will be
provided.</div><a name="10020485000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
reforms will have minimal impact on home educators, who, in the main,
are doing a good job and co-operating with local authorities. Parents
will continue to be able to follow the wide range of educational
approaches they currently use, including autonomous learning. We have
made it clear that home-educated children will not have to follow the
national curriculum or take SATs and other public examinations. We had
a short debate on Tuesday about how the PSHE provisions will not apply
to home-educated children, who will not have to observe school hours,
days or
holidays.</div><a name="10020485000446"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are allowing parents to undertake to provide a statement of prospective
education to their local authority. They will be given time to prepare
one. When a parent has removed their child from school at short notice,
it is right that they are given time to develop their educational
approach. That extra time will give them the opportunity to discuss the
approach with the local authority. That contrasts with many other
countries where parents need prior approval of their education plans to
home
educate.</div><a name="10020485000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first group of amendments seeks to remove the requirement for an
educational statement. That is consistent with the aim of hon. Members
to replace our scheme with a notification scheme that does not require
a parent to do anything other than to notify the local authority that
they will home educate. As I have indicated, we do not think that is
enough.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column524" />Column number: 524</div><a name="10020485000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not want the educational statement to be a significant burden. We
had an interesting discussion earlier about the information that will
be required. In the public evidence session, Sir Paul Ennals said that
a two-page
statement</div><a name="10020485000619"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as
part of a simple registration process, is not an onerous
burden&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Children,

effect of the amendments on the duration of registration would be to
make registration continuous once notification had been received. It
would not be dependent on annual renewal. We do not think that is the
correct way
forward.</div><a name="10020485000632"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000849"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> On a point of order, Mrs. Anderson. I
thank you, Mr. Amess and Mr. Betts for chairing
the Committee. I also thank the Clerks and all those who have made our
proceedings possible, including the <i class="I">Hansard</i> writers and the
police.</div><a name="10020485000540"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank all members of the Committee. I am grateful for all the
contributions made by Labour Members. The Under-Secretary of State for
Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East, made a fantastic
contribution&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am seriously
grateful to her for being here.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column526" />Column number: 526</div><a name="10020485000541"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and his colleagues, and
the hon. Member for Yeovil, for the way in which they have put their
points and the good debates that we have had. I also thank the hon.
Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham.</div><a name="10020485000542"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
has been a good Committee. Serious issues have been discussed and the
atmosphere has been very good. I thank my officials for the advice that
they have given me and the other
Ministers.</div><a name="10020485000543"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000850"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> On a point of order, Mrs. Anderson. I add
my thanks to you for your careful and very patient chairing of these
sittings, and to Mr. Amess and Mr. Betts for
their contribution to chairing the Committee. I thank the Ministers for
their courteous approach to the debates, which have been very
full.</div><a name="10020485000544"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has been encouraging that Government Back Benchers have contributed in
an independent way to the proceedings of the Committee. This is the
first Committee of which I have been a member in which that independent
viewpoint has been expressed, which is encouraging. I do not think that
that was any sign of dissent among Labour MPs; it was a good, healthy
contribution to a debate, and ultimately it did not lead to any
rebellions in the
voting.</div><a name="10020485000545"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the hon. Members for Yeovil and for Mid-Dorset and North Poole
for their contributions to the debates and for voting with us on many
occasions. It is good to work with colleagues in other
parties.</div><a name="10020485000546"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham for
co-leading for the Opposition on the Bill. I also thank my hon. Friends
the Members for Crewe and Nantwich and for Beverley and Holderness and
our Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster. I am grateful in
particular to my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness for
the passionate way in which he made the case for home
educators.</div><a name="10020485000547"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
have been very interesting, if short, Committee proceedings. I hope
that we can return on Report to many of the issues that we were not
able to cover under the remaining
clauses.</div><a name="10020485000548"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000851"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> On a point of order, Mrs. Anderson. It
would be discourteous of me not to take this opportunity to thank you
and your co-Chairmen, Mr. Amess and Mr. Betts,
for your chairmanship of the Committee over the past few weeks. I also
thank the Clerk and the other officials of the House who have supported
our activities, including the <i class="I">Hansard</i> writers, who have tried to
make better sense of our comments than they sometimes sound when we
make our speeches&#151;as I have just ably demonstrated. Thanks also
to the departmental officials, who have been so involved in the Bill
and who occasionally struggle to keep Ministers on course while
offering them appropriate
support.</div><a name="10020485000549"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has been a good
Bill&#151;</div><a name="10020485000550"></a>

Loughton:</b> Good
debate.</div><a name="10020485000551"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000853"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful for that correction&#151;I do not
want my comment to be used against me. We have had a good debate, with
contributions from Back Benchers as well as from the party
spokespeople. We have heard a little less from the Under-Secretary of
State for Justice 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column527" />Column number: 527</div>than all of us wanted, and I suspect a little more from the hon. Member
for Wolverhampton, North-East than Ministers sometimes wanted. We feel
that his comments struck the right balance. He has probably ensured
that he will not be invited to sit on a Public Bill Committee for a
sustained period of time, but he has done enough with his loyalty while
voting not to upset the usual channels to the extent that they will put
him on all future
Committees.</div><a name="10020485000552"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also thank both Ministers for the way they have conducted themselves
during the debate and for their patience while responding to a large
number of interventions. That has been helpful and continues the
tradition of their predecessors, including the right hon. Member for
South Dorset (Jim Knight), who was always co-operative. I have also
enjoyed participating with Conservative colleagues. We have had shared
positions in parts of the debate and I have enjoyed the comments about
synthetic phonics and the opportunity to explore some of the slightly
dottier policies that have emerged from the Conservatives over the past
few weeks.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column528" />Column number: 528</div><a name="10020485000553"></a><div class="hs_Para">Committee
stage has been a useful process, although it is a pity that we have not
had time to give full scrutiny to the Bill&#146;s measures. No doubt,
we will return to those on Report in a couple of
weeks.</div><a name="10020485000554"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020485000854"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> On a point of order, Mrs. Anderson. On
behalf of those of us on the Back Benches, I thank you and your
co-Chairmen for your excellent chairmanship and your good spirit. We
have enjoyed participating. It is a truly dreadful Bill, but it has
been a great debate. I thank the Ministers for their consideration and
effort in responding, sometimes with the help of officials, to queries
that have not always been made in the Committee Room. As a Back
Bencher, I am grateful for that effort. I am also grateful to them for
ensuring that we got to the home education parts of the Bill. I also
thank my colleagues for making it so clear that, all the way to the
wash-up, the Conservatives will ensure that this Bill will never become
law.</div><a name="10020485000555"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Bill,
