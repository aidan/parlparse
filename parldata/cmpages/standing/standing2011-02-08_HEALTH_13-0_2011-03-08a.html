Hood. I seek clarification. At the start of the Committee, you said
that, as a general rule, you and your colleague Chair, Mr Hancock, did
not intend to call starred amendments unless they had been tabled with
adequate notice. We notice that in the past 24 hours the
Government have tabled well over 100 amendments that, obviously, we
have not yet had time to look at properly. We need to get to clause 50
today, so we will not have much of a chance to discuss many of the
amendments, in particular those to the
schedules.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000024">&#160;</a>

I clarify, Mr Hood, whether it is your intention not to call those
amendments, given that they were not ready in time for the Committee?
The situation appears to be another example of a Government in
disarray; only last week, they submitted amendments in respect of their
U-turn on prices. We are concerned about the situation and we seek your
advice, Mr
Hood.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000025">&#160;</a>

said at the start of the Committee that, as a general rule, we did not

amendments are not necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000035">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 174
seeks to introduce a requirement for the consortium to have a board
with rigid membership requirements. That membership must include
particular clinical specialists, at least one representative from the
local healthwatch organisation, and at least one from local authorities
in the consortium area. It would also limit such boards to having no
more than four other members of the consortium, irrespective of the
number of practices within it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000036">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 21
introduces schedule 2, which makes further provision on commissioning
consortia, including provisions about consortia constitutions, into
which the amendment would be inserted. I make clear to the Committee
that the constitution must specify clearly in its activities the
arrangements that the consortium has put in place to discharge all its
duties and functions. Unlike the present arrangements for primary care
trusts, the constitution will set out clearly the governance and
decision-making arrangements, and it will be a publicly available
document.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000037">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When
authorising consortia, the national health service
commissioning board is required to check that the arrangements put
forward by a consortium in its constitution are appropriate. The agreed
and published constitution is fixed on establishment, and the
commissioning board can exercise its intervention powers should a
consortium not act in accordance with it. The check and balance in the
system ensures that at all times consortia will have governance
arrangements of their own design, but that those will be independently
assessed and approved by the NHS commissioning board. A lack of
prescription in the Bill does not equate to a lack of governance, as
has been suggested by some hon. Members.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000038">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Leicester West has overlooked the purpose of the new
legislative framework that the Bill proposes, which is simply to
liberate rather than to micro-manage the NHS. General practices will
have the flexibility to form consortia to operate in ways that they
consider will secure the best health care and health outcomes for the
patients and communities whom they serve.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000039">&#160;</a>

picked up on the point that consortia may appoint committees or
sub-committees, and that any such committees should consist of or
include persons other than consortium members or employees. The
intention of that measure is to allow for the membership of lay people
or other health care professionals. I assure her that she is mistaken
in thinking that the actions of sub-committees or committees will not
be bound by the duties placed on the consortium—they are bound
by such duties.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000040">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>I am grateful to the hon. Lady, because
she has guessed what I was about to come to in my remarks. Let us be
clear: when a consortium delegates a function to a sub-committee or
engages an external organisation—perhaps of the sort that she
had in mind during her question—it remains
responsible and accountable for the discharge of that
function; it cannot sub-contract its responsibility under the Bill. The
consortium must ensure that when a function is

practitioners and whether a licensed private health care provider would
be permitted under the legislation, first, to provide services, and
secondly, to enter into a contract with GP consortia to carry out
duties in relation to its work as a commissioning body. His response

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman has read out part of the
answer that my right hon. Friend has given him. As he points out, we
intend that a commissioning consortium should be able to commission
support from an outside provider—a charity, for example, such as
the Neurological Alliance—to ensure that access is available to
appropriate clinical and patient expertise regarding commissioning
activity. That is something that Members on both sides of the Committee
have sought to probe and test. There is nothing sinister involved; it
is exactly what hon. Members on both sides have sought to achieve, and
the Bill will enable it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under new
section 14O of the National Health Service Act 2006, as detailed in
clause 22, the Bill provides that consortia will be under a duty to
seek appropriate advice from health experts when they are carrying out
their functions. I suspect that the hon. Member for Easington was
alluding to that point in his intervention.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In drafting
the Bill, we have avoided the temptation to micro-manage. We have not
constrained the ability of consortia to seek advice and input from
those health professionals who are best placed to give it. By naming
particular professional groups in the Bill, we would impose an
unhelpful restriction on the ability of consortia to access appropriate
clinical advice, which is their duty.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000047">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Southport has raised some important concerns
about the emphasis on GPs, and he has expressed a particular concern
about the ability of GPs properly to commission services without access
to specialist knowledge. The new model for commissioning is based on
the system of registered lists of patients held by GP practices. GPs
play a crucial role, as I am sure hon. Members on both sides of the
Committee acknowledge, in co-ordinating patient care and committing NHS
resources through their daily clinical decisions in primary care. We
believe, therefore, that the emphasis on GPs as the foundations for
consortia is right.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000048">&#160;</a>

Friend makes an important point, however, about the essential
contribution of other clinicians. Consortia will find it impossible to

                           </div>health outcomes without the right advice. Effective commissioning will
require the full range of clinical and professional engagement
alongside that of local people. Hospital doctors, nurses, allied health
professionals and others all have a vital role to play in developing
services and improving health outcomes. How a consortium goes about
that is rightly a matter for it, and it will be held to account for the
outcomes that it achieves. The consortium will set out its approach to
discharging its duties in its constitution, which will be scrutinised
and approved by the NHS commissioning board at the point of
establishment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Stafford considered that that was an essential
area that should be included in the criteria that the commissioning
board would use to assess consortium establishment applications. New
section 14C of the National Health Service Act 2006, as set out in
clause 21, contains a regulation-making power that will allow provision
to be made regarding the factors that the board must take into account
in deciding whether it is satisfied that a consortium has made
appropriate arrangements to discharge its functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Southport also raised concerns, echoed by the
right hon. Member for Rother Valley, about GPs acting in a
self-interested way when commissioning services, and about the
potential instability that might be caused to a consortium if a
practice were to fail. That issue is clearly important, and it needs to
be aired and properly scrutinised in Committee. The Committee will have
the full opportunity to discuss conflicts of interest when it considers
amendments 211 and 217 to clause 22. Those are valid points, and we
have made provision for them in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000051">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will briefly describe what we have done. Without wanting to pre-empt
the debate, I should say that consortia must set out in their
constitutions the arrangements for making commissioning decisions and
managing conflicts of interest. The board will review the constitution
and the appropriateness of such arrangements at the point of
establishment of a consortium. Clause 63 allows regulations to impose
requirements on consortia with regard to good procurement practice and,
importantly, the management of conflicts of interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I can also
reassure the Committee that the failure of individual GP practices will
not lead to the failure of a consortium; quite simply, they are two
separate legal entities. However, the way in which primary care is
delivered contributes to the achievement of consortia objectives in
improving health outcomes. It is for that reason that consortia have a
duty under new section 14M to support and assist the board
in its duty to improve the quality of primary care delivered by their
member practices, which we have already considered in this
Committee. In the event that the practice loses its primary care
contract, the commissioning board has the power under new sections 14Z3
and 14Z4 to assess the impact on commissioning arrangements. The board
can then offer assistance and support to the consortium under the
powers under new section 14X of the Bill or exercise its intervention
powers to ensure that there is no risk whatever to pensions. I hope
that that provides the assurance that hon. Members sought in last
Thursday’s debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000053">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I turn to the
points raised about public involvement and engagement. New section 14P
in clause 22 places a duty on consortia to ensure that people who
receive a service are involved in both its planning and development. As
with the duty to seek appropriate clinical advice, consortia will have
a flexible approach to how they exercise that duty and engage with
communities in the ways that make sense locally. That is to ensure the
flexibility and freedom specified in new section 14Z: consortia are
obliged to hold a public meeting at which their annual report will be
presented to members of the public. Consortia may go beyond that
minimum level of prescription, and the board will have the power to
issue guidance to consortia on the discharge of their public
involvement duties to which the consortia must have regard.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Consortia
will need to develop effective ways of harnessing the patient and
public voice, so that commissioning decisions are increasingly shaped
by people’s experiences and aspirations as to what high-quality
health services mean to them and whether their express needs are met. I
suspect that that is something that all members of this Committee want
to see, and it is provided for by this Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 175
would specify that the accountable officer is to be appointed by the
commissioning consortium board. Amendment 176, moved last Thursday,
would specify that the board may appoint a person to be an accountable
officer for more than one consortium. If the concerns of the hon.
Member for Leicester West are that the consortium will have no say in
the selection of its accountable officer, I can reassure both her and
other hon. Members. Although the Bill does provide for the NHS
commissioning board to appoint a consortium’s accountable
officer, it will be a matter for the consortium to choose who is put
forward. Subsection (3) of new section 14B states that an application
to become a commissioning consortium must be accompanied by the name of
the person whom the consortium wishes the NHS commissioning board to
appoint as its accountable officer.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000056">&#160;</a>

the board in confirming the appointment is to put a check or balance on
the suitability of the proposed accountable officer. That is an
important check in the system; in some ways, it is strange that
Opposition Members have sought to remove it from the Bill. Schedule 2
also provides in paragraph 9(3) that the NHS commissioning board may
appoint a person to be an accountable officer for more than one
consortium. Again, it would be for the consortia, if they wished to
share an accountable officer, to agree who they wished to take that
role and to put that name forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000057">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Thank you, Mr Hood. This has been the start of an
important debate, which goes to the heart of the Bill. We have had
contributions from Members who may support the Government’s
direction of travel but have concerns, as well as from Members who
oppose the direction of travel but also have genuine
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000061">&#160;</a>

points were raised during the discussion. First, the hon. Member for
Enfield North was keen to emphasise that he would be concerned if GPs
were not directly involved in running the senior management
of consortia. Currently, that is not a specific requirement
in the Bill. It also relates to an issue that the hon. Members for
Stafford and for Southport raised about the need to ensure that
consortia involve other clinicians.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000062">&#160;</a>

have an essential role to play as the catalyst of this process, and

that we had last week, and she seems to be skating over the

consortia their responsibilities to discharge their duties.

stable model. The Minister gave a full and thoughtful answer to that

people might be able to sit on consortia, but last week we discussed in
detail the conflict between—and, on occasion, within—GP
practices, and the fact that they are not necessarily a solid base. The
other conflict, which has run for many years in the NHS, is the
stand-off there has often been between primary and secondary doctors.
If secondary care doctors do not have a role to play unless they are
invited, they may not be invited. What does my hon. Friend think of

be the case. My own experience of working in and around the NHS is
that, as my right hon. Friend says, conflicts of interest between GPs,
and between GPs and clinicians—particularly within the hospital

on, the fourth concern is about effective scrutiny by and

again to the Health Committee. The reason I keep referring to it is
that, as a lot of Members know, the Select Committee has said that it
is concerned to look at all the arrangements, and it will report on
whether it believes that the Bill deals with some of the problems and
challenges. We have not yet seen that report, although I am sure we
will all be interested in what it
says.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000090">&#160;</a>

its third report, under the heading “Patient and Public

Committee states, at paragraph

neither this nor subsequent documents have detailed how patients or the

to what my hon. Friend and the Minister said. The Minister made an
important contribution to allay fears about consortia being able to
subcontract important functions such as the principal function of
commissioning. He effectively said that, to whomever the consortia
subcontracted, the subcontractor would be banned from doing that under
the duty to improve services placed on the consortia in new section
14L. That new section 14L binds the subcontractor acting for the
consortium is, obviously, an interpretation by the Minister. However, I
cannot find anywhere in the Bill an explanation of how that
subcontractor is to be bound by the duty. What is my hon.
Friend’s view? Will legal contracts be needed to bind the
subcontractor? Is that what the Minister is saying? Otherwise, I cannot

my hon. Friend agree that the constitution, which we are being asked to
take on trust because we have not seen any version of what it might
look like for a consortium, cannot cover all eventualities in respect
of all the functions that might be subcontracted? Equally, even if a
consortium is under a duty to deliver on its duties, it cannot
guarantee that its subcontractors will do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000106">&#160;</a>

fairly regular scrutiny meetings with the local health and well-being
board, that is not the same as having a board with non-executive
directors who regularly scrutinise the work of the executive directors.
That is why I am not reassured by the Minister’s response to the
points raised, not only by Opposition Members, but by Government
Members and the Health Committee. These are serious concerns. Whatever
the Government say their intentions are, Members are looking for
greater reassurance and a stronger guarantee that there will be

is completely right. I think he is correct, as are Government Members.
We shall take the amendment away for further consideration and bring
the matter back on Report. By that time we hope to have had the benefit
of further thinking from Committee members on both sides and of the
wise words of the Health Committee. We can all then be assured that
GP-led commissioning consortia have the effective governance structures
that they will need if they are to be custodians of £80 billion
of taxpayers’ money. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment raises the question of general practice size. The
Bill’s effectiveness will depend very much on the commitment of
general practices, particularly small ones. I draw the attention of
hon. Members to my declaration of interest, which is that my wife is a
general practitioner. Arising from that, and from the evidence that the
Committee has received, I was minded to table the amendment to discover
the Government’s position.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In his
evidence to the Committee, Dr Kingsland said that<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“84% of GPs are
independent contractors, and of the 16% who are not, half work with
independent contractors. It is largely an environment of independently
contracted, self-employed GPs who inherently have always wanted to
produce a good practice and accept
patients.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000384">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Small
practices often have the highest patient satisfaction ratings. In
response to the same question, Dr Gerada said that the Royal College of
General Practitioners values such practices,
which<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000117">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“often
get the highest patient satisfaction. If you look at the research
evidence and compare like with like, small practices do as well as
large ones if you compare their make-up, but you have to accept that
small practices tend to be in much more deprived areas, for lots of
reasons.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000385">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Many
small practices are content with doing the work they do, and do not
want to become larger. Traditionally, there have been two methods of
limiting practice size: the first is to use the ability to close a list
if it is believed to be getting too large for them to manage; the
second is to restrict practice boundaries. Patients now have choice,
and rightly so, but practices also need it. That does not mean the
choice whether or not to accept a particular patient, which would be
entirely wrong. I agree with Michael Sobanja, who said that he shared
Dr Gerada’s view<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000118">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for
moving this amendment, so that we can have a short and relevant debate
on an issue that is very important to many GPs and patients. The
amendment proposes that consortia should be able to develop internal
arrangements so that individual members can set the de facto limit on
the number of patients who can register to receive primary medical
services from their practice. Such arrangements would be set out in the
consortium
constitution.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am afraid that I cannot support the amendment for the simple reason
that I believe it would create a substantial barrier to people’s
ability to register at the GP practice of their choice. That is a
principle to which the Government signalled a clear commitment in our
White Paper, “Equity and excellence: liberating the NHS”.
We wish to give every patient a clear right to choose to register with
any GP practice they want to with an open list and without being
restricted by where they
live.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment could allow arrangements to develop whereby practices could
effectively close their lists. If all the practices within the
consortia were to apply to close their lists to new patients to
maintain the maximum population set by their consortia, where would
those patients go for their care? I accept that that is an unintended
consequence of the amendment, but would create serious
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
point out that if a practice wishes to close its list, it must at
present seek the approval of its PCT and, in future, that of the board.
That is the proper way to do things because those organisations, not
consortia, hold the primary care contract with individual practices.
The amendment would create a requirement that would sit very uneasily
with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given
my hon. Friend’s question about whether practices will have the
choice to stay small, I repeat the straightforward answer that a
practice could apply to the board to close its list if it wanted to.
Provided that the board agreed that the practice could close its, list
because the reasons were valid, that aim would be achieved, but it
would be up to the board to determine the
validity.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000125">&#160;</a>

fact is that the board would decide whether a practice was allowed to

the board might make a decision either

the health and well-being boards, and its work with consortia

                           </strong> This excellent amendment has propelled me along a
line of thought that had not previously crossed my mind. I have started
to rehearse in my own mind how such a situation would be dealt with
now. I am familiar with the situation in my own neck of the woods
where, if a GP practice is not big enough or an area is under-doctored,
the primary care trust plugs the gaps—it puts another
organisation in place. It allows the practice to stay smaller than it
wants, and in some cases brings in private providers or other GP
practices.<a class="bkMark" name="11030878000002">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <p class="tabbed">What I am not
clear about—the debate on the amendment has added to my general
confusion—is what will happen when GP consortia are left with
that role. What will happen when a consortium contains a practice
which, for perfectly valid and clinical reasons—perhaps reasons
of clinical safety—wishes to remain a certain size, does not
wish to grow any further and cannot be coerced into doing so, but a gap
in the system is emerging because of an influx of people into the area
who are looking for doctors? Clearly, when the GP consortia are making
that decision, they will consist entirely of local GPs—in a
sense, we have a scenario where local GPs decide whether to invite
another practice in to fill the gap, or to persuade one of the partners
in the consortium to expand further. All those decisions are quite
problematic in the current environment and in the environment created
by the legislation, and I am intrigued by what will happen. The
amendment has highlighted a lacuna about which we need to
have clarity.<a class="bkMark" name="">&#160;</a>

to the Minister for his response. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Southport said, the matter in one about which there will probably be
considerably more discussion. I reiterate that the present situation
could be unsatisfactory, in that independent contractors—it is
clear that they are independent—in effect, through the laudable
policy of patient choice, will sometimes be required to extend their
practice and their patient care further than they want. Perhaps one
solution would be to make it easier for new practices to be set up in
areas where existing practices are saying “Enough is
enough.” As my hon. Friend said, and I believe the right hon.
Member for Rother Valley has made the point before, there are areas,
particularly in inner cities, that are under-doctored. I will certainly
withdraw my amendment —because I had no intention of pressing
it, but tabled it simply to raise the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11030878000003">&#160;</a>

absolute requirement for everyone in a consortium area to have a
doctor—to be registered. That is a legal requirement. The
consortium would therefore be required to ensure that there were
sufficient primary practices for every patient in that consortium area
to be registered. I think the problem could be overcome in that way.
Local doctors might be unwilling to see another practice come in, but
they would simply have to put up with it doing so if they were not
prepared to take the patients on to their own list. That is the other
side of the coin.<a class="bkMark" name="11030878000005">&#160;</a>

outlined, the amendment seeks to ensure that consortia staff be
“suitably qualified.” Aside from the fact that that is a
nebulous term, without definition, general practice-led commissioning
consortia have a duty to act

some protection for staff when they are transferred, rather than
leaving terms and conditions, pay and pensions entirely to the whim of
the consortia. The pay review boards of the NHS and of doctors and
dentists are independent bodies and are respected by staff and
employers alike. Their independence and credibility should be
maintained in the new system. Likewise, the NHS staff council brings
together organisations from across unions and employers.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000143">&#160;</a>

ensure that reasonable terms and conditions apply also when a

all know that what are most important are the quality of care that
patients get and the staff within the NHS. The amendments are important

to 157 would require consortia to have regard to NHS pay scales, pay
reports, and terms and conditions agreed by the NHS staff council and
the NHS pension scheme. We must bear in mind that where a function
transfers from one employer to another, the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 and 2006 may apply.
Additionally, any transfers of staff from the public sector must
appropriately apply the principles of the Cabinet Office statement of
practice on transfers involving public sector staff. The transfer of
undertakings regulations require that staff terms and conditions at the
point of transfer be protected. The Cabinet Office statement of
practice contains additional protections regarding pensions, which will
ensure that staff do not lose out if they are to transfer.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000146">&#160;</a>

23, consortia will have a ring-fenced administration budget, which they
have the freedom to spend on such administrative functions as they
determine, including staff salaries. To attract and retain the best
staff, consortia must be free to remunerate as they determine, within
the confines of their budgets. Consortia would, of course, be required
to publish information relating to remuneration. Paragraph 8 of
schedule 2 contains a regulating-making power to achieve
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000147">&#160;</a>

pensions, referred to in amendment 157, we intend that GP commissioning
consortia be classed as employing authorities for the purposes of
access to the NHS pension scheme. As such, staff employed by consortia
will be enrolled automatically and able to participate fully in the

from April 2012, to include GP consortia in the definition of an
employing
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000148">&#160;</a>

156 would affect a consortium’s ability to engage support for
its functions. Making each contractor employed by a consortium subject
to the same guidance and regulations as direct employees would be
extremely impractical. Contractors’ pay levels may be made
publicly available, and the guidance on pay levels might prove
uncompetitive. Where expertise is best sourced from outside the
consortium, it is essential that the consortium can secure it, and at
market rates. The two amendments could prejudice that. Furthermore,
amendment 156 would restrict the well established principle of freedom
to contract within the common law. That could leave consortia at the
risk of judicial
review.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000149">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment makes a minor change to schedule 2, which inserts new
schedule 1A into the National Health Service Act 2006. Schedule 2 makes
further provision about consortia. Paragraph 9 of new schedule 1A sets
out the duties of a consortium’s accountable officer. The
accountable officer is a key leadership position within a consortium
and is responsible for ensuring that the consortium exercises its
functions in a way that provides good value for money while complying
with certain obligations. The consortium as a whole will, of course, be
responsible for complying with all duties conferred on it by the 2006
Act through the Bill. However, there are certain obligations which it
makes sense to attach specifically to the accountable officer’s
role. Doing so will ensure that there is a clear reference point with
regard to accountability in respect of the
obligations.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000181">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
present, the accountable officer is responsible for ensuring that the
consortium complies with its financial, accounting and auditing duties,
and exercises its functions in ways that are efficient, provide good
value for money and aim to secure continuous improvement in the quality
of services provided and outcomes achieved. The accountable officer is
also responsible for ensuring that, if requested, the consortium
provides the board with certain information relating to its accounts,
income or expenditure, or its use of resources. That allows the board
to hold consortia to account for their finances and, in turn, enables
the board to account to the Secretary of State for how funds have been
spent across all
consortia.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would extend the responsibility so that the accountable
officer must also ensure the consortium complies with its obligation
under paragraph 14 of new schedule 1A to provide the board with such
information as the Secretary of State may require from all consortia,
as opposed to from a single consortium or group of consortia, on the
basis that he considers it necessary to receive that information to
carry out his functions in relation to the health service. The board
would be required to relay that information to the Secretary of

                           </div>State, who accordingly would have no direct contact with consortia.
Given that the Secretary of State must consider any such requested
information to be necessary to enable him to perform his functions, it
is appropriate that ensuring that it is provided forms part of the
accountable officer’s
responsibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000183">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of the amendment is to remove the explicit reference to
employers altering the terms of a transfer after it has taken place. In
extenuating circumstances, that can already happen for an economic,
technical or organisational reason, so there is no need to put it in
the Bill. The health service unions would be hugely reassured if the
reference were taken out. As it is already in legislation, why does it
need to be underlined in the Bill? All the provision does is act as an
encouragement for some employers who want to unravel the terms of staff
transfer after the fact.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000186">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Amendment 158 would restrict flexibility in staff
and property transfer schemes that are created by the board in
instances where consortia dissolve, merge or vary their membership.
There might be occasions where it is practical to include provision in
a scheme to make it possible to amend that transfer scheme when it is
already in effect, and we wish to retain the ability to do so. An
example of where a modification would be needed might be if, due to an
oversight or error, a property or liability was not initially
identified as requiring
transfer.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
key words in the passage that the amendment would omit are “by
agreement”. That is the check and balance on the exercise of the
flexibility by the board. It goes without saying that any such
agreements would have to be agreed by both parties concerned. Quite
simply, where no agreement can be reached, the board cannot amend the
transfer scheme. I, therefore, see no reason to restrict transfer
schemes in this way. I recommend that the Committee opposes the
amendment if the hon. Lady presses it to a
Division.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000188">&#160;</a>

commissioning consortia, and we have expressed our concerns about their
inadequacies, particularly in terms of their public accountability. The
clause deals with the way in which, once established, the board behaves
in relation to the public. It gives the commissioning consortia a duty
to promote patient involvement, to obtain advice and to involve the
public. Those duties all sound very nice, but a line-by-line analysis

Members will have noticed that amendment 138 is remarkably
similar to amendment 133, although it applies to commissioning
consortia rather than the NHS commissioning board. Amendment 139 is
remarkably like amendment 134, and amendment 140 is remarkably like
amendment 135. Amendments 133 to 135 were right for clause 19 and
amendments 138 to 140 are right for clause 22. Given how much we have

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
141 is a classic amendment. There is always a problem with
consultations in that people feel the consultation is an end in itself.
Given the Government’s focus on outcomes, the amendment would
ensure that the Government are not only saying that people will be
consulted, but listening to what people say and learning from it, which
is an important part of
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000207">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When
the Minister responds to this group of amendments, perhaps he will be
able to have another stab at the distinction made between patients and
the public. Could he tell us what the difference is and how we can work
on a definition? The Bill talks about patients at one point and the
public at another without defining either. Presumably patients are part
of the public, but the public are not always patients. So I would like
the Minister to make another attempt at providing a fuller
definition.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has said that the consortia will be held to account by
overview and scrutiny. It is our view that the extent to which
consortia can be held to account is weak. Amendment 142 would beef that
up. If the Minister’s ambition is that commissioning consortia
are accountable to overview and scrutiny, I cannot see why he should
object to this amendment, which simply beefs up his aspirations and
ensures that they are included in the Bill. The amendment would make
the Bill
better.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000209">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
144 is about publishing an annual plan. When the annual plan is
published, we say that the annual plan from the GP consortia should
include how they have involved the public. If they are reporting once a
year, they should report specifically on that
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000210">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
most important point about amendment 147 is that the annual report
should not just be the commissioning consortia telling the public once
a year what they are going to do; they should also receive the views of
patients and the public and their representatives on the
consortia’s assessment of how their functions will be
discharged. We should not just be there to tell them; we should be
there to listen as well and to learn from what they say. If Government
Members are so keen on ensuring that GP consortia are properly
accountable to the public, I cannot see what the objection to that will
be. It is a shame that it was missed out of the legislation in the
first place, but we are here to
help.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000211">&#160;</a>

of the all-party group on patient involvement in health and social care

they had canvassed a number of the pathfinder areas and asked the GPs
what their public engagement strategy was and what plans they have.
They had various responses, which I am sure they will publish in the
fullness of time, but they were not completely satisfied with the
answer, nor did they have any indication that the Department of Health
had asked for
one.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000215">&#160;</a>

brought this up with the Secretary of State, who made the sensible
point that the consortia have enough to do at the moment without being
asked to have all their documents lined up in order, which I totally
accept. However, the Patients Association wanted to make a serious
point, which is that, for many doctors, this will involve a huge
culture change. Going out and engaging with the general public in their
area is not something that they customarily do. They are normally
snowed under dealing with day-to-day clinical matters and therefore,
except in the more progressive, imaginative practices, they are now
being pressed to do something completely new and the priority has to be
stressed to them, put across to them, as to what the Government expect
them to do. Loading them with various book exercises to complete and
various documents to produce may not be the most satisfactory way of
doing it, but I want to put on record that the Patients Association
have a genuine concern as to how real patient and public engagement
will be conducted under the new regime, given that doctors have not
really done this
before.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000216">&#160;</a>

said that she was trying to be helpful, though I am always cautious of
people who try so blatantly to be helpful when they have not been
helpful in the immediate past. There is a saying in America—I
hasten to add that it is from America, so that it is not
misunderstood—“I’m from the Government and
I’m here to help” and the meaning is always the opposite.

me start by reassuring hon. Members that public accountability is,
rightly, at the heart of the Government’s vision for the NHS. We
passionately believe in devolving power and responsibility to local GPs
to strengthen commissioning through a patient-centred approach. We have
therefore included a clear duty on consortia to engage with patients
and the public on an ongoing basis as they undertake their
commissioning
responsibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000218">&#160;</a>

seeks to add a definition of the word “public” as it
features in the clause. However, it is not necessary, as new section
14P already includes a duty to involve the public. We demonstrate in
the Bill the importance of putting people at the heart of decisions
about the provision of health and care services. We refer throughout to
“patients and their carers”, “individuals to whom
services are being or may be provided” and “public
involvement”. The public are at the centre of the
reforms.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000232">&#160;</a>

section 14O of the 2006 Act imposes a duty on consortia to make
arrangements with a view to securing appropriate advice from those with
professional expertise relating to physical and mental health in order
to enable them to discharge their functions effectively.
Amendment 140 would require consortia, in carrying out that
duty, also to make such arrangements to seek advice from those with
professional expertise in patient and public involvement and review and
scrutiny. However, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 538<a class="bkMark" name="Column538">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the amendment would increase prescription and prompt the question why we
had singled out one group over others. It returns to a problem that we
discussed in relation to other amendments earlier in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As we also
discussed in relation to clause 19 and the NHS commissioning board, we
recognise the valuable role that scrutiny has to play in providing
transparency, accountability and local challenge, and our proposals
adequately reflect that. Amendment 142 seeks to ensure that the
commissioning arrangements for consortia are covered by local authority
scrutiny functions. Section 244 of the 2006 Act is amended
by clause 175 to provide powers to make regulations on scrutiny,
including matters relating to the health service on which local
authorities may make reports and recommendations to relevant NHS
bodies. Paragraph 129 of schedule 4 to the Bill inserts a definition of
NHS body that includes a commissioning consortium. This would therefore
enable us to ensure that consortia were properly covered by local
authority scrutiny powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000234">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 170
would specify that consortia must consult with individuals to whom the
services are being or may be provided. Under the new arrangements,
consortia would have flexibility in determining their own approach to
involving the public. The effect of this amendment would be to remove
that flexibility by requiring any engagement to take the form of a
consultation. As drafted, the Bill places a duty on consortia to make
arrangements for public involvement and consultation, but we would wish
consortia to retain flexibility in deciding their approach. I therefore
urge the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury not to press
amendment 170 because I do not expect the fulfilling of this part of
the Bill simply to involve popping a piece of paper on someone’s
desk. We expect full and proper consultation in the spirit of greater
transparency and accountability within the legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000235">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 147
seeks to extend the requirement in new section 14Z for consortia to
hold a public meeting to present their annual report. It would place
obligations on consortia to publicise their annual report, hold at
least one meeting to present it to the public and receive views on how
they have discharged their duties. As drafted, the Bill already
requires consortia to hold a public meeting at which their annual
report would be presented to members of the public. How a consortium
goes about this is not something for the Secretary of State to
micro-manage. I assume hon. Members would agree that consortia should
be able to develop ways of working with their communities that make
sense locally. Freedom and flexibility is what we are trying to create
here. Amendment 141 seeks to make it explicit that consortia must have
regard to the outcome of public involvement activities when exercising
their functions. This is not necessary. Meaningful consultation is
about involving the public and also letting them know the results and
action being taken forward from those consultations. The public will be
able to find out more about those results in consortia annual reports.
We have placed a duty in new section 14Z subsection 2 requiring
consortia to report on how effectively they have discharged their
duties on public involvement and consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000236">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I will take
amendments 144 and 148 together as my response applies equally to both.
Amendment 144 seeks to add the duty of public involvement to the list
of duties that consortia must explain, via their annual

amendment 148 proposes to add the public involvement duty to the list
of duties that the board will review when annually assessing consortia
performance.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000237">&#160;</a>

14Y and 14Z1 explicitly state that both the scope of commissioning
plans and performance assessments automatically include the whole range
of consortium functions. Consortia will be required to produce a
commissioning plan before the start of every financial year that
describes how they will go about their functions in the coming year.
Similarly new section 14Z1 defines performance assessment as
being an assessment of how well the consortium has discharged its
functions during the previous financial
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000238">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of the list of duties in proposed new sections 14Y(2) and
14Z1(3) is to highlight the key accountabilities of consortia:
accountability for improvement in service quality, and for effective
management of public funds. After all, let us not forget that the
purpose of consortia is to deliver better health outcomes for local
populations. That is not to underplay the other duties placed on them;
if they were not important, they would not be in the Bill at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000239">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 214
concerns the board’s powers to intervene in the operations of
consortia. Under proposed new section 14Z6, if the board is satisfied
that a consortium is failing, has failed, or is at significant risk of
failing to discharge any of its functions, the board has powers to
intervene in the operations of a consortium. That includes directing
the consortium as to the discharge of its functions, terminating the
accountable officer’s appointment, and appointing another person
to be accountable officer to ultimately dissolve a consortium.
Amendment 214 seeks to amend subsection (1) of the new section so that
the board can intervene only after consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000240">&#160;</a>

clear that the board will have the power to intervene only where there
is evidence that consortia are failing or are likely to fail to fulfil
their functions. It must be satisfied of that before it exercises the
powers. To that end, the Bill provides the board with powers to require
documents and information from a consortium where it has reason to
believe that a consortium might have failed, might be failing, or might
be at risk of failing to discharge any of its
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000241">&#160;</a>

things, including potential or possible financial failure, but in other
areas, failings could be in the quality or standard of care, or there
could be a failure to increase the quality or standard of care that a
consortium is providing. To give an all-embracing definition, failure
is to fail to perform one’s functions. That is not only
financial, and it is not only about the provision of care, the quality
of care, or improving outcomes; it is across the board. I hope that is

outcomes. With so much focus and attention on that, I do not think that
what he is suggesting will happen. Another point about quality of which
he will no doubt be aware is that it was the Labour Government who
introduced a major programme to improve the measurement of quality; we
are adopting that, so we will benefit from and use that ongoing work. I
hope that he not only welcomes that information but accepts it as a
plus, and a very useful tool in the

new section 14Z4 sets out the board’s powers to require the
consortium to provide it with an explanation, either oral or written,
regarding any matter relating to the consortium’s exercise of
its functions. Proposed new section 14Z7 sets out the procedural
requirements in connection with certain of the intervention powers.
Before exercising the power to dissolve a consortium, the board will be
under a clear requirement to consult the commissioning consortium
concerned, as well as relevant local authorities and any other
appropriate persons. The board will also be required to explain to
those bodies and individuals its reasons for proposing to exercise the
power.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000248">&#160;</a>

by the board to dissolve a consortium would be the most significant
form of intervention, used rarely and only in severe circumstances, so
it is appropriate to set out in the Bill the procedural requirements
that the board must follow before using that power. However, we also
intend to set out in regulations the procedure to be followed by the
board in the exercise of its other intervention powers, including the
power to direct the consortium on the discharge of its functions, and
the power to vary a consortium’s constitution. That will ensure
a clear and transparent framework within which the board must operate
when exercising the powers. Setting out the detail in regulations will
help to ensure that the intervention regime is operated fairly and
equitably, with all parties knowing what is expected of
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000249">&#160;</a>

and rules-based as possible. May I also answer one or two other points

she raised earlier in proceedings: the definition of
“patients” and “public”. Patients are
persons who have been provided with services; if she looks at proposed
new section 14N, that will help. The public are persons who may be
provided with services, but need not be registered patients. The
reference is in proposed new section 14P, if that is helpful to her.
“Public”, for obvious reasons, goes wider than
“patients”. As she rightly said, patients will be members
of the public, but not all members of the public are necessarily
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000252">&#160;</a>

that the duties under proposed new section 14P bind the board to

Centre for Public Scrutiny, and he recognises that many of these
amendments come from that body. There have also been attempts, behind
the scenes, to speak to the Government about the amendments, which
represent a genuine attempt to get the Government to accept amendments
that will properly give the Bill some form of democratic legitimacy. It
is unfortunate, therefore, that the Government’s apparent
attitude is not to give an inch on any amendment, no matter how
genuinely reasonable or helpful, which is a shame. When the Minister
and Government Members talk about the importance of introducing greater
accountability and democracy to the national health
service—sometimes in fairly florid language—they find
friends on the Opposition Benches. However, the question is whether you
are actually going to do such things or are using them as a

amendments are tabled and dismissed in the way they are, the question
sometimes arises as to whether Government Members are being genuine
when they say they want to introduce greater accountability, and that
is particularly true of issues such as GP consortia. GPs do not have a

greater accountability and democracy at the level of GP consortia, why
not allow health and well-being boards to work properly with GPs to
establish their annual commissioning

                           <em>]</em> Well, hon. Members
roll their eyes and wave their arms, and they pay lip service to these
things, but the purpose of the amendments is to ensure that there is a
proper connection between health and well-being boards. The boards are
a good idea in principle, but they simply do not have sufficient teeth
or sufficient power in relation to GP consortia. That is the link we
are attempting to establish, as we are on overview and scrutiny. That
is a simple point, simply put. The Government should look again at this
issue. Obviously, they can be assured that we will return to it at
another stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000274">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
talks about key accountability, but he gives the game away in a way. Of
course we agree that key accountability in relation to GP consortia
should be about improving services and giving greater value for money.
Those are the two points that he made, but he did not go on to state
that the other aspect of key accountability was democratic
accountability at a local level. The only time he prays that in aid is
when he is challenged on whether there will be quality improvements. To
prove that, he says, “Well, of course there will be greater
accountability, so there will be an increase in quality.” The
Minister simply needs greater education on this before he can promote
the Bill properly. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

from our previous debates, the Government’s position is to give
bodies the autonomy to make the decisions that they are best suited to
make themselves. In this case, that includes allowing consortia the
flexibility to obtain appropriate advice to enable them to perform
their functions effectively. It remains our view that consortia will
find it impossible to secure improving health outcomes without the
right advice. Effective commissioning will require the full range of
clinical and professional input alongside that of local
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000283">&#160;</a>

consortia should take. It is for consortia to decide, and we have trust
in them doing so. I am happy to confirm again that, although it is our
intention that consortia should obtain advice from appropriate clinical
professionals to enable them to discharge their functions effectively,
I do not think it is appropriate or necessary to set out in the
legislation the form that that should take. For those reasons, I oppose

Duty to consult staff</strong>(1)
Each commissioning consortium must have regard to the NHS Constitution,
as legislated for in section 1 of the Health Act 2009, including the
responsibility to engage staff in the exercise of its functions and to
engage staff on changes that may affect their working
practices. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 545<a class="bkMark" name="Column545">&#160;</a>
                        </div>(2) Each commissioning consortium must publish a
staff engagement strategy in relation to commissioning,
including—(a)
developing and implementing commissioning
strategies;(b) reviewing
services and care pathways;(c)
developing service
specifications;(d) procurement
of services.(3) Each
commissioning consortium must engage regularly with staff
representatives through local or regional Social Partnership Forums, or
similar bodies, or any successor
bodies.<strong>14OB Duty to work in
partnership</strong>Each
commissioning consortium must seek to work in partnership with
employers and staff side representatives in implementing new contracts,
particularly where this would involve transfers or other changes that
could affect working
practices.’.<p class="tabbed">Touched
as we were by the Minister’s optimism in relation to the
establishment of consortia, we believe that the amendment may be
necessary on the basis that they might not be autonomous
workers’ collectives. The procurement guide for commissioners
was rewritten by the Department of Health in the light of last
summer’s White Paper, and much of the wording in annexe B on
engagement with staff and their trade unions is similar to
that of the amendment. The amendment is, therefore, designed to do
nothing more than ensure that commissioning consortia abide by
established Government
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000288">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
work of the NHS Social Partnership Forum has developed many positive
initiatives for partnership-working throughout the country in recent
years, and those successes must not be lost. For example, recent
research by Aston University for the Department of Health demonstrated
the considerable alignment between strong consultation of staff and
high standards of care, which, ultimately, is what we all want.
Conversely, at the Mid Staffordshire, where appalling lapses in care
were revealed, there was a concurrent breakdown in staff
involvement and
engagement.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000289">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
first part of the amendment would oblige consortia to engage staff, in
line with the constitution. It would also require them to produce
strategies to show how they would engage staff in different parts of
their operation as a means of improving patient care. It acknowledges
the importance of partnership working and the SPF process, the local
working of which could be lost when strategic health authorities are
abolished, as those are often the places in which regional SPFs are
based. The second part of the amendment would explicitly require
consortia to engage staff when changes are made to contracts or through
transfers that would impact on working
practices.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000290">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
is a serious amendment, and we would wish to have proper answers to
those points; otherwise, we will need to press it to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000291">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendment would impose an extensive duty on
consortia to consult their staff regularly and to publish a staff
engagement strategy. It also seeks to ensure that consortia have regard
to the NHS constitution. It is fortunate that it mentions the NHS
constitution: I am sure that I do not need to remind the Committee that
there is a general duty for the bodies listed in the Health Act 2009 to
have regard to the NHS constitution. The Bill amends that Act to ensure
that the NHS commissioning board and consortia are also captured by
that duty. Hon. Members can find that in paragraphs 74 and
75 of schedule 5 to the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000292">&#160;</a>

amendment deals with the issue raised by the hon. Member for Southport
and by my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley, and the issue
that I referred to earlier, which was highlighted by the Select
Committee on Health, about managing conflicts of interest, particularly
where GPs could be commissioning other primary and community services.
I am sure that many hon. Members here have spoken to local pharmacists,
as well as national organisations, who are all understandably concerned
that GPs may end up commissioning services that are currently provided
by pharmacies, or even that GPs may take over and start running such
services—understandably so, perhaps, because GPs would be able
to attract more patients and bring more money into the consortium. I
want to give some specific examples that will help bring the issue to
life.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000323">&#160;</a>

problem—and particularly in London, as well as across the
country, chlamydia screening services. Boots pharmacy has done
fantastic work on that issue, helping hundreds of young

                        <p class="tabbed">In our
constituencies, many of us find pharmacies easier and more convenient,
and that particularly applies to disadvantaged groups, such as the
homeless, or those whose problems mean that they are much more
comfortable visiting a pharmacy. The concern is whether we can ensure
that such services continue to be effectively commissioned, not
necessarily by pharmacists, but by whoever is in the best place to
provide the easiest access to the widest group of people. That is
particularly true in disadvantaged communities, such as the one I
represent.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000325">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The purpose
of the amendment is to require consortiums to publish information about
the services that they seek to commission in such a manner that ensures
that any prospective provider—whether it is the NHS, the
voluntary sector, or the private sector—is able to respond to
express an interest in providing the services before commissioning
decisions are taken. Because consortiums have GPs as members, it is
vital that we have a series of checks and balances in place to ensure
that conflicts of interest are managed.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000326">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In previous
debates, the Minister has said that such conflicts of interest will be
set out in the constitution. What this amendment—and others that
I shall come to later—seeks to do is to make it clear that in
every part of the process, consortia cannot simply commission services
without going through the proper process. It is expected that
compliance with the amendment’s requirements would be achieved
by issuing some kind of formal tender or notice for any service that is
being commissioned, so that the best possible service is provided,
whether it is from the NHS, voluntary or other providers, as I have
said. Placing that requirement on a consortium is one way in which
checks and balances could be put in place to avoid conflicts of
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000327">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In moving the amendment, the hon. Lady has flagged
up an important issue. As she knows, we will be dealing with the core
issue of conflicts of interest on amendments 211 and 217, so, for the
purposes of this debate, I will stick strictly to the specific purpose
of the amendment. I hope the hon. Lady will accept that as the right
way forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000328">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I believe
that amendment 208 is unnecessary. Where services are to be
commissioned, commissioners need to ensure that such services are
specified and advertised in a way that does not give an unfair
advantage to any particular provider. From the time commissioning
consortia are established, they will have a responsibility under
procurement law to act in a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory
way when commissioning services from the full range of potential

commissioning consortia will, from the time they are established, have

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 209
concerns a consortium’s arrangements in respect of local
authorities. This part of the Bill places an obligation on the NHS
commissioning board to encourage commissioning consortia to work
closely with local authorities for the provision of services, which is
to be applauded. However, the duty to work closely with local
authorities in the provision of services also needs to be put directly
on consortia. It is not enough to expect pressure to be exerted on them
by faceless people in Whitehall. It is important for GPs themselves to
know that they have an obligation to work with local authorities,
particularly in relation to complex health and social care
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000341">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I think all
parties can agree that we must integrate services, particularly health
and social care, more than at present. However, it is not sufficient
simply to talk about it. When opportunities are available, as in the
Bill, to tie new bodies, such as commissioning consortia, to an
obligation to work closely with local authorities in the commissioning
of care, that is important, particularly when commissioning consortia
replace primary care trusts, many of which have developed integrated
working. I know that in my primary care trust, for example, there would
be a person at one desk employed by the PCT—and, therefore, by
the NHS—sitting next to somebody working for the local
authority, who is providing social care. Neither of them knows who
their boss is, or who is paying their salary, but they both know that
they have an obligation to ensure that the needs of the local
population are met.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000342">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is the
sort of integrated care and integrated services to which we should
aspire. If we are going to throw that out, we need to ensure that what
replaces it works properly. One of the greatest concerns is that the
fractured service we will have from GP consortia will mean that they
will not work sufficiently closely with local authorities, and perhaps
not even meet current standards, let alone improve on them. The
amendment therefore include a duty in the Bill for GP consortia to work
closely with local authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000343">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
amendment 210 is important, having thought about it overnight, it is my
view, particularly having listened to the Secretary of State for
Health, that it does not go far enough. I am confident that the
Government will be looking further at what more they can do. I looked
at the transcript of what the Secretary of State for Health said on the
Andrew Marr Show on 13 January. He said
that<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000344">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“that
commissioning plan has to be agreed in the Health and Well-Being Board
of the local authority, which is a publicly open and publicly
accountable body.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000395">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I am pleased that that
is his aspiration in the Bill, but unfortunately, it simply does not
happen, so I am sure that the Government will look at that again. If,
in effect, health and well-being boards of local authorities are going
to have sign-off of commissioning plans of GP consortia, that is a
definite improvement. It is not in the Bill at the moment, but if the
Government are about to introduce that in an amendment, then good. They
will find friends on the Opposition Benches, because that is the sort
of power that matches the hyperbole that

145 and 146 seek to bring in the views of the relevant overview and
scrutiny committee when the health and well-being board is considering
consortia commissioning plans. Since we have overview and scrutiny
bodies, we should use them. Amendment 212 states that, where the board
has received the opinion of the health and well-being board, it must
reply to it in 28 days. That highlights just how poor the
relationship is, and the power that the health and well-being board has
in relation to commissioning consortia at the moment. The amendment
stipulates that the board reply to any views expressed by the health
and well-being board within 28 days. I suspect that at the moment the
Minister will be against that, but I am sure that, when he reviews the
powers of health and well-being boards and ensures that they have
sign-off of commissioning plans, we will have something much stronger
even than that. At the moment, this is a probing amendment and is
unlikely to be put to a vote, but we want to hear Government’s

greater collaboration between consortia and local authorities for the
purposes of joining up health and social care provision. Hon. Members
will recall that the Committee discussed that when it considered
amendments to clause 4. I need not remind hon. Members that
the Government recognise the importance of integration between health
and social care. As I have previously set out at length in earlier
debates on this point, the Bill includes strengthened proposals in
relation to collaboration and integration between health and social
care commissioners. The amendment is unnecessary, as I shall
demonstrate, and I will hopefully reassure the hon. Member for
Islington South and Finsbury. The NHS commissioning board will have a
duty in new section 13J of the 2006 Act to exercise its functions to
encourage consortia to work closely with local authorities in arranging
for the provision of services and the use of section 75 arrangements in
particular.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000347">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
board has levers that it can use to influence consortia behaviour, such
as the publication of commissioning guidance and the commissioning of
outcome framework indicators against which consortia performance will
be assessed. The hon. Lady said that consortia need an obligation to
work with local authorities. I hope that I can reassure her, because
they do. Consortia have a duty under section 82 of the 2006 Act to
co-operate with local authorities to secure and advance the health and
welfare of the people of England and Wales. The forum for bringing
together health and social care commissioners is the health and
well-being board. Clause 179 places a duty on health and
well-being boards to encourage integrated
working.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000348">&#160;</a>

177 requires health and well-being boards to consider the use of
commissioning flexibilities, such as pooled budgets or lead

Health and well-being boards can bring that duty to bear when assessing

well-being strategies. I hope therefore that the interest of Opposition
Members has been satisfied on this point, and that the amendment will

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
210 would require GP consortia to address in their commissioning plans
the needs identified in their local health and well-being strategy, and
to consult each relevant health and well-being board about its view on
whether the commissioning plan adequately addresses local needs. I
understand the intention behind the amendment. It would help to ensure
that commissioning consortia develop their commissioning plans within
the framework of the joint health and well-being strategy, which is
itself a high-level strategy for how to make GPs identify with the
joint strategic needs
assessments.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000350">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
agree with the sentiment of the amendment, which is why we have made
provision for it under clause 177. It might help if I
outline the purpose of that clause. It requires local authorities,
consortia and the commissioning board to have regard to JSNAs and the
joint health and well-being strategies when discharging particular
functions. In partnership with the reform to the provision on JSNAs
under clause 176, the clause establishes a framework for commissioners,
patient representatives and local councillors across health and social
care to think strategically about how the needs of the people they
serve can be met. It places a duty on commissioners to have regard to
such strategy when they commission
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000351">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would to some extent duplicate the duties under clause 177
and is therefore unnecessary. Adding an additional requirement that the
consortia commissioning plan should align closely to the joint health
and well-being strategy would simply serve to make it a duplicate of
that plan. Moreover, the amendment would have the unintended
consequence of requiring commissioning consortia to act in certain ways
that would limit their autonomy. That would undermine the progress on
allowing clinicians to make decisions in the interests of their
patients, albeit in the framework given by the joint health and
well-being strategy. It goes much further than the majority of the
responses to the consultation, which were generally content that the
wording on consortia “having regard” to the joint
strategic needs assessment and the joint health and well-being strategy
was sufficient to ensure that they properly addressed the identified
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000352">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
145 would give the health and well-being board a new duty to have
regard to the views of the local authority overview and scrutiny
committees when providing a view on whether GP consortia commissioning
plans in their area have had regard to the joint health and well-being
strategy. Amendment 146 would require consortia to include a statement
of the opinion of any overview and scrutiny committee in
their commissioning plan. That would go further than the
current requirement for the GP consortia commissioning plan to include
the opinion of relevant health and well-being boards on whether the
plan takes proper account of the most recent joint health and
well-being strategies. It would require health and well-being boards in
reaching their view to have regard to the views of the local authority
overview and scrutiny committee. We recognise the valuable role that
scrutiny has to play in providing transparency, accountability and
local challenge, which is why we listened and responded to

                           </div>the consultation responses, giving local authorities flexibility on how
they discharge the scrutiny function, while retaining the separation
between executive and scrutiny functions by preventing delegation to
the health and well-being board.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000353">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would blur the separation between executive and scrutiny functions that
we have recognised is so important. As the County Councils Network said
when we proposed in the White Paper that scrutiny functions should be
placed on the health and well-being
boards,<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000354">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“it

                        <p class="tabbed">To require
health and well-being boards to have regard to the views of the
overview and scrutiny committee would interfere with a health and
well-being board’s ability to give its own independent opinion.
The lines will be blurred, and the separation of the health and
well-being board and the scrutiny function could be compromised. Local
authorities will continue to have scrutiny functions separate from the
health and well-being board, and they will be able to scrutinise
matters concerning certain members of the
board.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000355">&#160;</a>

would muddy the waters. What is the purpose of overview and scrutiny if

                           </strong> No, I am not saying that at all. I am saying I do
not think it is sensible to formalise a requirement that health and
well-being boards must have regard to the views of the overview and

the ability of the health and well-being board to give its independent

saying, the functions and powers that I have outlined will maintain the
separation between executive and scrutiny functions that people have
asked for, retaining local authorities’ ability to
play a leading role by influencing commissioning through health and
well-being boards, as well as scrutinising local health services
through their scrutiny functions. I believe that that separation is
appropriate. It is what people have asked for following the
consultation process—including experts such as the
Centre for Public Scrutiny. It is for those reasons that I urge the
Committee to reject amendments 145 and 146.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000358">&#160;</a>

would require the commissioning board to respond to the health and
well-being board within 28 days if it had written to express its
opinion on whether the commissioning consortia plan had taken proper
account of the joint health and well-being strategy. We appreciate that
the commissioning board has a role to play if commissioning consortia
are not meeting their legal duties. As I have explained, the health and
wellbeing boards have the power to write to the commissioning board
with their opinion on whether they feel consortia commissioning plans
have taken proper account of the joint health and well-being strategy.
That is in addition to duties on consortia to have regard to the
strategy and the JSNA.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000359">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">However, we
hope that that power will rarely be needed if health and well-being
boards are working well. Consortia will be fully involved members of
the health and well-being board, contributing to the joint development
of the joint strategic needs assessment and the joint health and
well-being strategy, alongside elected representatives and other local
commissioners. We fully expect consensual partnership working to
flourish in future as a result of the common flexible framework we have
outlined in later clauses. We want to support the changes in culture
and behaviours that are needed to bring about effective partnership
working, which will result in improved health and well-being for local
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11030868000360">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment does not take into account the provision in the new section
14Z2 that clause 22 would insert into the 2006 Act. If consortia are
not fulfilling their legal duties—for example by not having due
regard to the joint health and well-being strategy—there are
grounds for the commissioning board to initiate its intervention
powers. The new section grants the NHS commissioning board a power to
seek further information and/or explanation from a consortium if it has
reason to believe that, as a result of a letter from a health and
well-being board, for example, the consortium might fail, is failing or
has failed to discharge its functions properly. If the board, having
sought additional information, is satisfied that the consortium has
failed, is failing or is at significant risk of failing, it can
exercise the intervention powers conferred by new section 14Z6. The
amendment would work against the development of effective partnerships,
place a burden on the NHS commissioning board to respond to all letters
from health and well-being boards and duplicate some existing
provisions in the Bill. It is for those reasons that I would urge the

loans to relevant voluntary organisations. Such voluntary organisations
have a particular expertise in certain areas of care pathways or
conditions, and the grants or loans are to help them to grow the
necessary capacity to provide care or help to patients. Consortia would
be able to make both grants and loans subject to any terms and
