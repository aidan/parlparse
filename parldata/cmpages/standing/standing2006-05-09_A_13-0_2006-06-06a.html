<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000338"></a>The

Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</b> Good afternoon, Sir

John. I welcome you to the Chair. I am grateful that my back is to the

window and, although I cannot see the beautiful blue sky, I am sure we

shall make good progress this

afternoon.</div><a name="0606079000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before lunch

I was responding to certain questions that had been asked by the hon.

Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) on the operation of schedule

12, one of which was about the definition of &#147;making&#148; in

relation to settlors and settlements. Many of her questions are

technical, but I shall respond as well as I can and make some general

comments at the end.</div>

<a name="0606079000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The legislation refers to a

settlor making or entering into a settlement. A settlor will make a new

settlement or enter into an existing settlement. When trustees declare

new trusts over settled property by way of a deed of appointment, the

property may be held on a new settlement trust, provided that that is

within the powers of the trustees. The question, however, is one of

fact and law, and the particular issue that the hon. Lady mentioned has

been the subject of several court decisions. The position under the

proposed legislation is therefore the same as

previously.</div><a name="0606079000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Lady also asked about new settlors adding property to an existing

trust. Whether there is an addition to an existing trust or a new

settlement is a matter of general law. As was the case before the

drafting of the schedule, the tax rules apply by reference to the legal

status; they do not themselves determine the question. So I wish to

reassure her that the purpose of the provisions is to achieve exactly

the changes that were identified by the Government.</div>

<a name="0606079000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the definition of settlor

interest, the purpose of the trust modernisation package is, as I have

already said, to harmonise as much as possible the treatment of trusts

for income tax and capital gains tax purposes. That will help with

compliance by trustees&#151;especially in the case of smaller

trusts&#151;because it will help them not to be tripped up

inadvertently by differences between

rules.</div><a name="0606079000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The capital

gains tax rules on settlor-interested trusts are more generous than the

income tax rules, and lend 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 428</div>themselves to avoidance opportunities that we do not want to extend to

the income tax regime. It is true that some people have created trusts

for their children in order to take account of the annual exempt

amount. The main purpose of the new rules, however, is not to stop that

abuse but to align income tax and capital gains tax treatment more

closely, as I said originally. Tackling one small area of avoidance in

isolation would increase complexity rather than simplify matters,

whereas the driving imperative for the provisions is one of

simplification.</div><a name="0606079000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">All

trusts set up by living parents for their minor children will now be

treated as settlor interested. We think that it is right that the tax

system should reflect the effective financial dependence of minor

children on their parents, so parents will no longer receive capital

gains tax advantage if they choose to set up a trust for their

children. The principle of charging tax on gains of settlor-interested

trusts at the marginal tax rate of the settlor remains a fair

policy.</div>

Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con)

<a name="0606079000038"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000340"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I shall give way, but I shall just conclude

this point, because the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) asked about

it.</div> <a name="0606079000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trusts set up for

children on the death of a parent will benefit from the favourable tax

regime for vulnerable beneficiaries provided that the conditions are

met. The hon. Gentleman specifically asked that question with regard to

disabled children. The short answer to his question about whether they

would receive the beneficial arrangements is yes. The benefit of the

regime would apply in those circumstances&#151;uniquely, because of

the carve-out that the Government have already

made.</div>

<a name="0606079000040"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000341"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> The Paymaster General outlined an underlying

rationale for equating capital gains tax in respect of trusts for

under-18s with that of the parents. Are the professional associations

correct in asserting that the new rules will not apply to bare trusts

for under-18s? If so, why are the Government introducing different

rules for non-bare trusts in that instance, which is so controversial,

while retaining the old approach for bare

trusts?</div>

<a name="0606079000041"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000342"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I was looking quickly through my papers,

because the hon. Lady referred to bare trusts. The answer to her

question is yes. The measure does not affect gifts to dependent, minor

children other than gifts to a trust, because there is a difference

between an outright trust and a gift into a trust where the settlor

generally retains a degree of control over the assets. She need not

worry about the problem that she identified. It will not be an

issue.</div> <a name="0606079000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady

then moved on to a discussion about holdover relief. Parents have used

the tax rules favouring trusts for minor children in various

ways&#151;by protecting family assets and enhancing family income.

The new rules reflect the principle with which we are familiar from

income tax, in which a minor child&#146;s income that originates from

a parent should be regarded as the income of that parent. Assets held

in 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 429</div>trust for minor children, with the exception that the hon. Gentleman

raised and I have confirmed, should be regarded in the same way for

capital gains purposes.

</div><a name="0606079000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady asked

whether there might be a double charge, and she identified a possible

interaction with inheritance tax. Such a scenario is highly unlikely,

because there will be no inheritance tax charge if the asset qualifies

for agricultural or business asset relief, or if the transfer falls

within the nil-rate band. There will be no capital gains tax charge

except to the extent that the assets put into the trust are chargeable

assets standing at a gain. In the unlikely case that a charge to

inheritance tax arises on the transfer, it will be deductable in

calculating the gain on the disposal by the trustee to whom the

transfer was made.</div>

<a name="0606079000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady

referred to the Budget note. I can confirm that she is correct in her

assertion that it was wrong&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.

Members:</span> &#147;Ah!&#148;] Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue

and Customs has already apologised for that and made the correction. I

understood that she would raise that query if she were working from the

Budget note. She might have been about to ask me about that

next.</div>

<a name="0606079000045"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000343"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> I was, yes.</div>

<a name="0606079000046"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000344"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> Okay, fair cop. The Budget note was wrong, but

it has now been corrected and apologies have been made.</div>

<a name="0606079000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady

asked about sub-funds. As I said in my introduction, their creation was

at the request, in specific circumstances, of some people whom we

consulted. We were happy to provide for that. The option to make a

sub-fund election, which she mentioned specifically, will assist

trustees whose trust deeds do not allow them the freedom to treat

sub-funds as a separate trust. It puts them in the same position for

tax purposes, including the availability of tax relief where the

relevant conditions are met, as, for example, trustees whose deeds

already allow that degree of flexibility.</div>

<a name="0606079000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady

went on to talk about holdover relief. Providing a general holdover

relief would give more favourable tax treatment to trustees who opted

to make a sub-fund election compared with the trustees of trusts who

set up a new trust under the existing power. That would clearly be

unfair and would be an accident of timing as well as of drafting. It

would be illogical and could open the door to pretty substantial

capital gains tax avoidance opportunities. I am not attracted to that.

As I said, the measure for the election of the sub-fund is designed to

solve a specific problem that was raised in the consultation period. It

is therefore entirely appropriate that it is structured in the way that

it is.</div> <a name="0606079000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady

identified in her opening remarks that this is a complex issue. I have

tried to explain in my contributions this morning and this afternoon

that this is about attempting to align as closely as possible the

treatments for capital gains tax and income tax. Much of this is

underpinned by the written rule of law and the courts as opposed to tax

determining the situation in the first place.</div>

<a name="0606079000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite the fact that this

matter was consulted on from December 2003, with draft clauses made

available, HMRC will publish new guidance. If Members of the House or

those outside it who read our proceedings have particular points that

they 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 430</div>consider need clarifying further, HMRC officials will be available to

discuss them and ensure that the guidance issued would put them beyond

any doubt. I hope that the hon. Lady finds that helpful and that most

of her fears have been

assuaged.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000345"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> I welcome the last part of the Paymaster

General&#146;s address to the Committee. There is clearly a case for

additional guidance about these laws. On many occasions during our

consideration of this Finance Bill, I have been able to take great

reassurance from clarifications and undertakings given by Ministers.

However, in this case, I remain worried about what is in the Bill. It

might be something that the Opposition should consider coming back to

later in the discussions on the

Bill.</div><a name="0606079000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Paymaster

General refers to the advantages provided by these schedules in terms

of simplification for the trustees of smaller trusts, because they

would have to deal with fewer definitions. It is difficult to classify

the phenomenally complex provisions, and I have struggled with them at

length over the past couple of weeks. I therefore have a degree of

doubt that they contribute to simplification.</div>

<a name="0606079000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am genuinely anxious about the

imposition of penal treatment of transfers into trusts and the

extension of the definition of settlor interest in trusts. I heard what

the Minister said about why it is being done, and it seemed that the

key reason was simply to align the treatment for income tax with that

for capital gains tax. Given the significant penalty involved, we need

a stronger benefit to justify the change. I do not accept that trustees

will gain so much advantage from a simpler system that they will not

mind paying a whacking great CGT charge. The Paymaster General and I

are simply not as one on the

matter.</div><a name="0606079000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I continue to

be worried about the arbitrary distinction which means that bare trusts

for under-18s will be treated differently from substantive trusts for

under-18s and trusts for over-18s, which will not receive the same

penal treatment. One type of trust&#151;an ordinary trust for

under-18s&#151;will be penalised. Even after the Paymaster

General&#146;s helpful and extensive discussion of the schedule, I

cannot understand why that distinction is being drawn. She tried to

assure us that very seldom would cases occur in which there is an IHT

hit and a CGT hit, but she drew our attention only to the exemption

from CGT for agricultural business assets and the fact that there will

be an allowance for CGT. That still leaves a range of ways in which

trusts could be hit. There will be a significant extra tax charge, and

if the motivation is simplification and the wish merely to harmonise

two sets of legislation, there will be sufficient negative consequences

for the measure not to be justified on a cost benefit

analysis.</div><a name="0606079000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I

acknowledged in my speech on clause stand part, I accept that the

request to set up sub-funds came from the professionals themselves.

However, there is a case for distinguishing the setting up of sub-funds

from the setting up of a wholly new settlement. They are part of the

existing settlement, so it seems only reasonable to allow a holdover

into the sub-fund. In essence, such funds are not being transferred. I

end by repeating my point that if the Government want to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 431</div>respond to the request for sub-funds made in the

consultation, they must create a system that people will use. People

will not use the proposed system, because any administrative savings

that they might make as a result of being able to run sub-funds rather

than running everything as part of one trust will be outweighed by the

new tax charges. I am grateful to the Paymaster General for her

clarifications, but I remain concerned about the

schedule.</div><a name="0606079000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000348"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> I assure the Committee that this contribution

will be much shorter than my previous one. I should make it clear that

the Opposition have no objection in principle to Government amendments

Nos. 191 and 192, which seem to make useful improvements to the Bill,

although we believe that there are other problems in the schedule that

they do not

cover.</div><a name="0606079000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

186 is a probing amendment designed to deal with an anxiety that has

been raised about paragraph 2, which it would delete. Previously,

trustees of settlor interested trusts were not charged income tax under

section 686 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 because the

income was deemed to be that of the settlor, who was charged instead

under section 619 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act

2005. Paragraph 2 deletes section 686(2)(b)(ii) of the 1988 Act and the

effect is to remove trustees&#146; immunity from tax in that

situation, which they currently enjoy because the tax is paid by the

settlor. There does not seem to be a corresponding credit anywhere

else, so at the moment, paragraph 2 of the schedule will make trustees

liable for a tax that the settlor is also being asked to pay. I am sure

that it is not the Government&#146;s intention to levy tax on the

same income twice, so I have tabled my amendment to give them the

opportunity to reassure the Committee that there will not be a double

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000349"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I shall give the hon. Member for Chipping

Barnet the assurance that she is looking for. I could explain why the

amendment is defective as well, but she has said that the amendment is

a probing one designed to get my assurance that there are not two tax

charges. That is not the case. The total is 40 per cent. and under the

old regime, it was the proportion paid by the trust, topped up by the

settlor if necessary&#151;if they were a higher rate payer. The 40

per cent. figure is not covered by specific tax legislation but by

general law. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 432</div>The provisions are only arranging for it to be paid in one place, rather

than having an administrative process where the top-up is paid

subsequently to the 40 per cent. figure. The provisions do not prevent

the 40 per cent. tax being made available as a credit to the settlor,

if they are not liable for the 40 per cent. Some people outside the

House have misread the provisions, which has led them to believe that

there might be the 40 per cent. and the 37, which is not the case. It

would be underscored slightly more if that were the

case.</div><a name="0606079000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not going to

speak to the Government amendments, except to say that I am glad that

the hon. Lady welcomes them. It was noted that the way in which the

regime was drafted was slightly harsher&#151;to put it

mildly&#151;than intended and the Government amendments restore the

position to that set out previously, which should have remained all

along. That has been widely welcomed. With that assurance, I hope that

the hon. Lady will withdraw her

amendment.</div><a name="0606079000065"></a>

<a name="0606079000070"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000351"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> Again, I can assure the Committeethat

the debate will be much shorter than that on schedule 12. I am

conscious that people do not find this the most exciting thing in the

Bill. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am

trying.</div><a name="0606079000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">As

we heard, schedule 13 introduces changes to income tax similar to the

ones we discussed on capital gains tax. I want the Paymaster General to

consider some of the points raised by the professionals. The first of

those concerns new section 685 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act

1988 and the meaning of separate property. I am told that the new

section will mean that some trusts become bare trusts for income tax

purposes, so that the beneficiaries rather than the trustees will be

liable to pay the tax. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has

pointed out how significant an administrative change that will be for

the trusts involved. It asks whether there is a possibility of

postponement of implementation to give trustees the opportunity to

prepare for the measure.</div>

<a name="0606079000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">A point that runs through the

changes that we are discussing in schedules 12 and 13 is that they will

involve more work for the Inland Revenue on

specialist trust taxation. Two of the specialist centres dealing 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 433</div>with trusts and tax were recently shut down by the Inland Revenue. It

would be useful to have the Paymaster General&#146;s assurance that

the additional implementation costs and administrative burden on the

public sector, because more trusts will be making tax returns than was

previously the case, have been taken into consideration in the

decisions taken by the Government on the

Bill.</div><a name="0606079000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">On new section

685(B) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act, the same issues arise

on the meaning of &#147;settlor&#148; as do on schedule 12. I need

not delay the Committee with them but put on record that the same

anxieties apply here as we just discussed on capital gains tax. The

same point can be made about new section 685 on transfers between

settlements.</div><a name="0606079000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The last

point about the schedule concerns paragraph 4, which introduces new

section 686(E) of the Taxes Act. It deals with multiple settlements and

is an anti-avoidance provision. The concern is that the measure is a

complicated response to a problem that will not arise. It is not a

disaster if it goes on the statute book, but it is a complicated

reaction that is not necessary. It provides for new rules to be applied

where a settlor sets up multiple settlements. In this situation, it

provides that the basic rate tax band of &#163;1,000 will be split

between the settlements with a minimum of &#163;200. The avoidance

that it is concerned with is the idea that a settlor might set up many

trusts to try to take advantage of the &#163;1,000

band.</div><a name="0606079000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,

it has been pointed out by the professionals&#151;for example, by the

Chartered Institute of Taxation&#151;that the costs and hassle

associated with setting up trusts are so significant that there is not

much risk that the abuse that the Government fear will happen. I have

sympathy with those concerned, given the significant costs of running

separate settlements. While I do not have a huge problem with new

section 686(E), I query whether it is necessary considering the

significance of the problem with which it is designed to

deal.</div> <a name="0606079000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are

significant problems on schedule 13, but they are largely the same as

those that we discussed extensively on schedule 12. Therefore, I need

not detain the Committee further on them.</div>

<a name="0606079000077"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000352"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> The hon. Lady has considered the issue closely.

She says that there are substantial problems with the two schedules.

All I can say to her is that, given the points that were made during

the consultation on draft clauses from December 2003, her fears are not

borne out by an overwhelming reaction. The Government would have

expected such a reaction to the proposals about the clauses.</div>

<a name="0606079000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been sitting here

thinking that the next time my civil servants say to me,

&#147;Trustees think it would be a good idea to simplify things a

little so that instead of operating two sets of rules on capital gains

and income tax, we align them as closely as

possible&#151;wouldn&#146;t that be a nice thing to do,

Minister?&#148;, I shall say no.</div>

<a name="0606079000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">This whole discussion, preceded

by the consultation, demonstrated how clearly the alignment and changes

were welcomed by those in the specific field. That just goes to show

that, no matter what a Government do with the tax system, nobody ever

believes a Treasury Minister when they say, &#147;Trust me,

I&#146;m from the Treasury and I am here to help

you.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 434</div><a name="0606079000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bare trusts have never had to

self-assess. They are blind trusts and are described in various ways.

They are, and always have been, taxed in a slightly different way. That

was clearly spelled out in tax bulletin 32. The hon. Lady has studied a

great deal, but even she may not have trawled through every single tax

bulletin<i class="I">&#151;[Interruption.]</i>. Okay, she has; congratulations.

Bare trusts remain able to self-assess with respect to their income,

although not their capital gains

tax.</div>

<a name="0606079000294"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5

pm</div><a name="0606079000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady

asked also about whether the impact on the public sector had been taken

into account. The answer is yes; if anything, administration costs will

be marginally reduced&#151;only marginally, as a complicated area is

being brought together. Finally, the hon. Lady asked about the standard

rate band. It is at a relatively modest level, having been increased to

&#163;1,000 this year.

</div><a name="0606079000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will now be a

minimum &#163;200 standard rate band applying to all trusts created

by the same settlor, regardless of how many trusts that settlor has

made; that strikes the correct balance between assisting on this issue

and trying to deter anyone who wanted to abuse the standard rate,

although I am sure that no one will. There is a combination of

measures. Raising the level to &#163;1,000 takes another 5,000 trusts

out of the self-assessment system, on top of the 25,000 that were taken

out by the &#163;500 change last year.</div>

<a name="0606079000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have listened carefully to the

hon. Lady; perhaps I shall listen more closely next year. I sincerely

hope that her fears are unfounded and shall do my best to ensure that

the clauses and schedules operate exactly as the consultation

indicated. Taxpayers expect the issue to be taken forward.</div>

<a name="0606079000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady

said that she did not know whether the change should be called a

simplification, but that depends on where one starts. The provisions

are better than previous ones. It is most definitely a simplification,

but this will never be an easy area of tax.</div>

George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): The clause

seems wholly commendable. It reduces the tax payable on trusts for

which tenants and leaseholders have paid their service charges from a

higher to a lower rate, and I am sure that it will be welcomed by

social landlords and local authorities.</div>

<a name="0606079000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two questions for the

Minister. We are amending the Income and Corporation TaxesAct

1988, so I assume that for the past 17 or 18 years registered social

landlords and local authorities have been paying the high rate of

tax&#151;either 40 per cent. or 32.5 per cent. As directors of

finance in both kinds of organisation are shrewd individuals, why has

it taken them so long to put up their hands and protest at the

relatively high rate of tax that they have to pay? 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 435</div>Perhaps the Paymaster General can explain how the

problem came to light. My other question is related to that, but the

Paymaster General may not have the figures at her fingertips. How much

extra money have local authorities and registered social landlords paid

over the odds by being subject to the high rate of tax instead of the

lower one that the clause introduces, and as a gesture of benevolence

would the Treasury consider giving back to local authorities and

registered social landlords the excess sums that they have

paid?</div><a name="0606079000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606079000354"></a><b class="B">Julia

Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): I have just one

further question to ask the Minister on the issue. I have received

representations about concerns that some regimes may fall outside the

changes to the special trusts&#146; tax treatment. In particular,

residents&#146; associations that set up sinking funds rather than

having service charges may set up discretionary trusts without

realising it, and so may not fall under this new tax treatment. I would

appreciate the Minister&#146;s reassurance that efforts will be made

to inform the associations that there is a more beneficial means of

undertaking such treatment of service charges, or a reassurance that

the new treatment will be extended to such sinking

funds.</div><a name="0606079000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606079000355"></a><b class="B">Rob

Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): I welcome you to

the Chair, Sir John. My point is on similar lines to those of the

previous two speakers. I understand that the provision does not apply

General say whether it applies to housing co-operatives and/or

tenant-managed

co-operatives?</div><a name="0606079000092"></a>

Primarolo:</b> I do not want to go down the route of giving

money back&#151;not today, anyway. I can tell the right hon. Member

for North-West Hampshire(Sir George Young) that the issue

came to light as a consequence of the rate change for trusts in 2004,

so it has not been going on for long. The Office of the Deputy Prime

Minister and the Housing Corporation had it drawn to their attention,

so they came forward to the Treasury on the basis that the problem was

the interaction with service charges, sinking funds and the use of

regulations. Of course, the smaller cases are covered by the

exemptions, which were &#163;500 and then &#163;1,000. We are not

talking about a substantial amount of money, and the changes are

negligible in terms of calculations for the Treasury. As the right hon.

Gentleman will know, being an ex-Treasury Minister, that means that the

amount is less than &#163;500 million and is not calculated.

<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> &#163;5 million; did I say &#163;500

million? Well, then I should apologise to the Committee, because that

would be a large error. I am sure that the Chancellor would be very

cross with me.</div> <a name="0606079000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">With

tenant-managed co-operatives, and the points raised by the hon. Member

Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), I will need to check

those points. I hope that the clause will cover tenant-managed

co-operatives, because the whole point was to cover that sector. The

clause does not cover private landlords. I intend to monitor the

measure, which is clearly sensible, when it comes in and will see what

benefit it

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000359"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I welcome you to our proceedings,Sir

John. I made my debut as a shadow Treasury spokesman during debates on

the National Insurance Contributions Bill late last year. In some

respects, I was fortunate to have participated only at the tail end of

those debates, but they were all about employment-related securities.

As a result, when I looked at the measures before us to prepare for

this debate, I felt rather like Yogi Berra, the baseball

player&#151;it was d√(c)j√  vu all over again.</div>

<a name="0606079000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to Budget note 33, the

clause is intended to deal with</div>

<a name="0606079000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;complex and contrived schemes to

avoid paying the proper amount of income tax and National Insurance

contributions, exploiting the tax rules relating to options over shares

and securities.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 437</div><a name="0606079000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under UK tax law,

options are specifically excluded from the definition of securities and

are therefore not taxed on grant, but on exercise or a similar event,

when the option holder realises some benefit from the option. Clause 92

further tightens the rules on options, and subsection (3) amends the

definition of securities in the Income Tax, (Earnings and Pensions) Act

2003 so that it excludes only securities options, which are defined as

a right to acquire shares. The change proposed in subsection (2)

ensures that all other types of options are deemed to be securities

and, therefore, to be taxed on grant, rather than on

exercise.</div>

<a name="0606079000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its

submission on the clause, KPMG suggested that the new definition

captures some fairly mainstream schemes for incentivising employees.

Those include, for example, put options, which allow the employee to

force the employer to take back or buy shares from them, share

appreciation rights, phantom share option schemes, and share options

and awards granted to those who are not ordinarily resident in the UK.

Having said that, KPMG understands that HMRC now considers phantom

share option schemes not to be options and therefore not to be caught

by the clause, but I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm

that. None the less, the range of incentive packages that are caught by

the clause demonstrates how broad it has become, and some external

observers of these proceedings believe that it goes beyond the

statement of 2 December 2004 that the measures before us should relate

to complex attempts to avoid paying tax.</div>

<a name="0606079000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">In effect, the change in

definition creates a wide class of options that will be taxed on grant,

even when it is not clear that any benefit will accrue to the employee.

Currently, the employee is taxed only when they have obtained some

benefit through exercise. However, there could be good commercial

reasons for using some of the structures that might fall outside the

definition of a securities option. For example, it might be the right

answer commercially for an enlisted company to issue put options to its

shareholders, given the lack of a market for the shares. Although the

Government might suggest that such issues could be tackled more

satisfactorily using non-statutory concessions where there was

uncertainty and ambiguity, some think that it might be better to have

targeted, well-directed legislation to give those responsible for

drawing up such schemes greater certainty.</div>

<a name="0606079000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 135 to 137 would change the focus of the clause. Amendment No. 135

would delete subsection (2), which inserts the words &#147;options

and&#148;. In their place, amendment No. 136 would insert a main

purpose test so that those schemes could be taxed differently when the

main purpose is to avoid income tax or national insurance. That might

be a more satisfactory way of targeting schemes and tackling the

anti-avoidance practices that have grown up in that

area.</div> <a name="0606079000295"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000360"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> The hon. Gentleman brings us on to the thorny

question of who defines &#147;main purpose&#148; and what it really

means, particularly when we talk about incentives and so on, to which

he referred. Would his amendment not be

unworkable?</div><a name="0606079000111"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000361"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> That is a very interesting question, and I am

surprised that the hon. Gentleman raises that 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column437" />Column number: 438</div>because throughout the Bill there are references to &#147;main

purpose&#148;. For instance, when one of the principal purposes of a

particular scheme is to avoid tax it should be under threat and

consequently taxed. The Revenue is familiar with that, and I am sure

that if we dig back through the annals of this Bill or others, we will

find times when Opposition Members were critical of the use of a main

purpose test. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Only two weeks ago.</div>

<a name="0606079000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">That test is used, and it is an

alternative approach to tackling the problems that we have discussed.

Some of us are concerned that broadening the definition of an option

scheme could create greater uncertainty than going down the route of

&#147;main purpose&#148;. That is why the amendment has been

proposed; it is a probing amendment, as are a number of our amendments,

so that we can understand the schemes that the Government are trying to

tackle.</div><a name="0606079000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 137 is a relatively small one seeking to insert

&#147;income&#148; in front of &#147;tax&#148; at the end

ofline 39. There is a concern that &#147;tax&#148; might

be interpreted rather broadly. For instance, is it the

Government&#146;s intention to capture corporation tax as

well?</div>

that the Government&#146;s objective is to test that as

well.</div><a name="0606079000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

come to another familiar debate: on retrospection and the tackling of

schemes already in place, and on the date when the rules will come into

effect. I have tabled amendments Nos. 138 and 139 which address the

collection of liabilities from employees, particularly when a scheme

has been in place historically and falls within the scope of the

anti-avoidance provisions. They address also the question of who should

be responsible for paying that tax, unpaid as PAYE, and national

insurance&#151;whether that burden should fall upon the employer or

the employee.</div><a name="0606079000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall

return to retrospection and the start date for the measures because

concerns have been expressed about the breadth, variety and number of

schemes that can be caught by the provisions, now or in the future,

which would create added uncertainty in the minds of advisors about

which schemes are available to use and which should be ruled out of

order. Where legislation is more targeted and focused, it is easier for

advisors to understand the use of retrospective legislation. Where

legislation is more broadly drafted, advisors are much more conscious

about the risk of retrospection and the danger that schemes that looked

and were understood to be legal, and whose main purpose was not to

avoid tax, are picked up. I tabled this brief series of amendments to

probe the Government&#146;s thinking on clause 2, and to push them on

issues of the breadth and variety of schemes to which it will apply.

What effect will it have on companies&#146; tax planning and how they

seek to incentivise their

employees?</div><a name="0606079000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606079000364"></a><b class="B">Ms

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000366"></a>Ms

Barlow:</b> My hon. Friend made some reference to those areas,

and indeed has done so today. It is only right and proper to send a

clear signal that we will not accept tax avoidance by those who have

more than enough money to pay their fair share. It is a question of

fairness, common sense and justice for all.</div>

Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): On the subject of fairness,

does the hon. Lady agree that the wording of subsection 5 in particular

appears to be open-ended? She used the words &#147;alleged

subsection 5 applying the measures

to</div><a name="0606079000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an option acquired

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000368"></a>Ms

Barlow:</b> The indication was clear. I shall read out my

notes on that issue. On 2 December 2004, the Paymaster General made a

statement setting out how the Government would deal with future tax

avoidance schemes, warning that any counter-measures would be backdated

to 2 December 2004 if necessary. Despite that warning and the Finance

Act 2005, schemes continued to be promoted that sought to avoid income

tax and NICs on employment reward using securities. Indeed, some

employers have continued to engage in those 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column439" />Column number: 440</div>schemes. I support the Government&#146;s uncompromising stance and

urge all Members to support the clause in its unamended

form.</div><a name="0606079000128"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000369"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> Let there be no mistake about it; the clause

has a retrospective effect, potentially back to 2 December 2004, the

date of the statement. It is not for accounts that are closed off, but

a clear line was drawn for money that is still trying to cascade

through the many and varied schemes. Indeed, Opposition Members have

been very supportive of the need for such action.</div>

<a name="0606079000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are talking about payments,

bonuses and forms of employment remuneration that are disguised, and

successive Governments have tried to deal with them. It started in 1991

with unit trusts; in 1993 it was gold bullion and other tradeable

commodities, and in 1994 it was diamonds and fine wines. In 1995, there

was anti-avoidance legislation on tradeable assets and vouchers, and in

1996 grants of share options in third party companies had to be dealt

with, as did company share awards and options. In 1997 there was more

on vouchers; and in 1998 it was conditional shares. Again in 1998, we

dealt with readily convertible assets and with convertible shares; and

in 1999 we dealt with the exercise of options.</div>

<a name="0606079000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The relentless

march against those who seek to take employment remuneration without it

being properly taxed continues. The evidence is that by 2003

&#163;1.4 billion was going through those known schemes.

Interestingly, the spokespersons for Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition

have supported such action. For instance, when discussing last

year&#146;s Finance Bill in Committee&#151;it is a mirror

image&#151;the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr.

Field) said:</div>

<a name="0606079000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No one on the Opposition

Benches will defend the payment in wine, gold or in other ways that was

clearly an abuse of the system.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,

agree with them. In 2003, as we were wading through complex

enough&#151;</div><a name="0606079000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;but why we

continue to have legislation year after year to deal with such

avoidance schemes...surely we must consider whether we can

introduce legislation specifically to address avoidance of income tax

and national insurance contributions on remuneration in a way that will

deal with the matter once and for all&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official

Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 24 June 2004; c.

in December 2004, a clear line was being drawn.</div>

<a name="0606079000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the points that the

hon. Gentleman makes, but I must tell him in the gentlest possible way

that the amendments will restrict the will of Parliament and not

delivering the taxation that Parliament clearly wants for such

remuneration. The amendments open up the possibility for remuneration

in one form or 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 441</div>another not to be taxed. I am sure that he does not intend that, but I

want to explain why that would happen.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000370"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> In order to catch schemes that try to avoid

what clause 92 attempts to overcome, does the right hon. Lady think it

would be appropriate to have a pre-clearance scheme, so that HMRC could

establish whether such schemes fell foul of the rules before they were

introduced?</div><a name="0606079000137"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000371"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I have said it before: why should we give tax

avoiders a pre-clearance scheme on how to get round the tax system? The

law is clear, as is the statement, so there would be absolutely no

point.</div>

<a name="0606079000296"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

pm</div><a name="0606079000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">To deal with the

two points that the hon. Member for Fareham raised, there is an issue

with regard to phantom option plans and what are called the put

options. The matter has been brought to the attention of my officials

by some in the accountancy and legal professions, and HMRC officials

have already made it clear on the website that, following the new legal

advice, typical phantom option plans are not within the definition of

securities options. Put options are rare but are sometimes used in

takeover situations. Officials have examined the typical commercial

situation and have confirmed that the put options used therein do not

deliver employment reward. The Department therefore anticipates no

adverse impact from their retention as securities.</div>

<a name="0606079000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those inquiries have not

identified any adverse impact on genuine commercial share option plans.

However, if companies had concerns regarding the use of options in

commercial circumstances not involving avoidance, they could seek a

ruling from HMRC officials under the usual code of practice 10

procedure, as we have discussed before. In those circumstances where,

as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, there is legitimate use that might be

inadvertently caught, the position is quite clear. The operation of the

code of practice 10 procedure means that once all the facts are put on

the table and made clear to HMRC and an opinion has been given on that,

companies are bound by that opinion.</div>

<a name="0606079000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman has sought to

deal with those concerns, but unfortunately amendments Nos. 135 to 137

place a severe limit on the clause&#146;s effectiveness in dealing

with tax and national insurance avoidance. They would lead only to

further revenue loss and provide opportunities for further exploitation

of the legislation. To make it quite clear, the statement to Parliament

in December 2004 drew the line and said, &#147;That is the end.

Whatever happens, you cannot use the schemes,&#148; hence the

backdating.</div><a name="0606079000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 135 and 136 have the admirable intention of simplifying the

clause. However, the clause makes it clear that all options, other than

those that are a right to acquire securities and were not acquired with

the main purpose of avoiding tax or national insurance contributions,

are within the normal charging provisions for securities and hence

subject to existing anti-avoidance measures. Amendments Nos. 135 and

136, far from simplifying the clause, would therefore remove the

clarity 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column441" />Column number: 442</div>and lead to uncertainty, since the rules would be silent on the position

of an option that was neither a securities option nor acquired with the

main purpose of avoiding tax or national insurance contributions, such

as an option that was a right to sell securities.</div>

<a name="0606079000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 137 seeks to

narrow the effect of the clause by restricting its application to

income tax and national insurance only. That would be an unacceptable

weakening of the proposals.</div>

<a name="0606079000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">My statement of 2 December made

it clear

that</div><a name="0606079000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This

Government are determined to ensure that all employers and employees

pay the proper amount of tax and NICs on the rewards of employment,

however those rewards are delivered.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official

Report</i>, 2 December 2004; Vol. 428, c.

44WS.]</div><a name="0606079000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

phrase &#147;however those rewards are delivered&#148; in that

sentence is crucial to the schemes that are devised. Avoidance schemes

are being marketed to engineer a corporation tax deduction on

employment reward, without a commensurate matching income tax charge on

the employee. The schemes defer taxation indefinitely or until a

considerable time after the employee has received the employment

reward. I cannot see that using a wholly uncommercial option is

anything other than avoidance, depriving the Exchequer of the proper

amount of tax and national insurance and employment reward. I gave fair

warning on 2 December 2004 that we would no longer accept

that.</div><a name="0606079000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.

138 and 139 attempt to prevent retrospective PAYE and seek to transfer

from employers to employees the obligation to pay HMRC the tax arising,

by virtue of clause 92, on earnings received prior to the date of Royal

Assent for the Bill, thereby removing any obligation on the employer to

account for the tax under PAYE. Since it is the employer who decides to

pay earnings in such contrived ways, it is only right that, in

accordance with the existing underlying principle of PAYE and national

insurance, the employer should be held to account to pay the tax and

national insurance. Amendments Nos. 138 and 139 would undermine the

principle of PAYE and negate the timely payment of tax to the Exchequer

by those who have chosen to pay earnings in a manner expressly intended

to avoid a

liability.</div><a name="0606079000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 140 would limit the backdating of the clause to the date of the

Budget&#151;22 March 2006&#151;when the provisions were announced

and published. That would undermine not only the clear warning that I

gave on 2 December 2004, but future Government action to tackle

avoidance. It would also give entirely the wrong signal to those who

abuse security options to avoid tax and national insurance by allowing

them to keep some of the tax and national insurance that they have

avoided.</div><a name="0606079000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let

me dispel the notion that uncertainty prevails among

practitioners&#151;some of whom, I am sorry to say, perhaps supplied

the amendments that we are discussing&#151;by quoting from a

post-Budget publication, issued by a firm of active advisers,

appropriately called the &#147;Tax Planning Newsletter&#148;. It

states:</div><a name="0606079000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

main problem area for our clients would have been for those...who

used one of the schemes which enabled bonuses to be taken from

companies tax free. We had been warned by Dawn Primarolo that there was

a danger of retrospective legislation in this area and we passed that

warning on to clients. For some, however, it was a risk worth taking

but it now appears that she meant what she said.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 443</div><a name="0606079000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Absolutely; I meant

what I said. If clause 92 were only made effective from the date of the

Budget, it would return us to the cat and mouse games of the past,

where there was always a window of opportunity to manufacture and use

an avoidance scheme before remedial legislation could be

enacted.</div><a name="0606079000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are

determined that we will not return to these types of games around

employment reward and that they should end. Avoiders will no longer

have such an unfair advantage over those who have paid their fair share

of tax and national insurance. The effect of the clause is clear: it

applies only if security options are acquired or something is done to

existing security options on or after 2 December 2004 that is part of

an avoidance arrangement. The avoiders know exactly what they are

doing, as Opposition Members have acknowledged at each point when we

have discussed the various schemes over the years. Those who do not

attempt to avoid paying the proper amount by participating in complex

and contrived avoidance arrangements will have the certainty that these

provisions do not apply to

them.</div><a name="0606079000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parliament is

clear. It expects employment remuneration to be properly taxed. That is

exactly the intention of the clause and it is regrettable that some

people sought to test whether I meant what I said on behalf of the

Government about a retrospective effect. I meant it and I hope that

they take the lesson now and that a line has finally been

drawn.</div><a name="0606079000151"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000372"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I am sure that readers of the &#147;Tax Planning

Newsletter&#148; will take note of the Paymaster General&#146;s

comments. If they were uncertain, they must be certain

now.</div><a name="0606079000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to make it

clear that we support measures to tackle tax avoidance. The list of

abuses that the Paymaster General read out included measures that we

closed down when we were in Government, so we are cognisant of the risk

of tax avoidance and the way in which people seek to hide remuneration

through schemes that are dressed up as share option schemes and so on.

People are always inventive and I am sure that they are even now

looking at the Bill and wondering what measures the Government are

introducing that they can use to their own advantage. As the Bill has

progressed, various changes have been made to schemes introduced by the

Government that have been used for tax

avoidance.</div><a name="0606079000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome

the Paymaster General&#146;s clarification of phantom share option

schemes&#151;it is good to have that clarification in the Committee

as well as on the Customs and Excise website&#151;and put

options.</div><a name="0606079000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will leave

to another day how the code-of-practice-10 process for clearance of

schemes differs from the pre-clearance scheme mentioned by the hon.

Member for Falmouth and Camborne, but the fact that the process exists

for those with legitimate schemes is welcome. Those who use that

process should recognise the important words used by the Paymaster

General when she referred to full disclosure of the facts of those

schemes. That is

important.</div><a name="0606079000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

not clear to a number of people and we discussed it on Report and Third

turned out to be. Today&#146;s debate has emphasised the breadth of

those comments, but for a number of people the statement on 2 December

2004, in conjunction with the Government&#146;s later actions, came

as a surprise and any doubts they may have had have been dispelled. I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000373"></a>The

Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):</b> The

clause takes us to the enterprise management incentive scheme. It is

designed to correct a small defect in the rules on corporation tax

relief that we introduced under schedule 23 of the Finance Act 2003.

The change under clause 93 will allow the intended corporation tax

relief when restricted and convertible shares acquired under the

enterprise management incentive options are granted at a discount to

market

value.</div><a name="0606079000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">At

present, the amount of corporation tax relief allowed is equal only to

the amount of the discount. That is not intended, so the clause gives

the correct corporation tax deduction for both the amount of the

discount and the amount that would have been taxed on the employee but

for the income tax relief given under enterprise management incentive

legislation. The change will ensure that a company offering enterprise

management incentive options will not be disadvantaged by receiving a

smaller corporation tax deduction compared with one that offers fully

taxed share

options.</div><a name="0606079000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was no

intention to disadvantage EMI options that were granted in the discount

objectives of the package of measures begins under clause 95. The

provisions provide a level playing field and fair tax treatment for

innovation in financial markets. They build on the measures that were

introduced last year to provide a level playing field for basic

financial products and extend them to cover further products, following

ongoing and substantial consultations with industry and interested

parties. The measures will be of benefit to everyone who wants to

access to financial products that do not involve interest, but they

will be of benefit in particular to those members of the Muslim

community who wish to avoid interest for religious reasons. The

existing tax laws can be difficult to apply to such products and can

give awkward results. The clause is designed to provide consumers with

certainty in their tax

position.</div><a name="0606079000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clauses

are developed in partnership with business and its professional

advisers, and bring the tax treatment into line with equivalent

products that involve interest. Clauses 95 and 96 set out the tax

treatment of two particular financial products and align the tax

treatment to that of their conventional equivalents. Clause 97 ensures

that beneficial loans legislation applies to alternative finance

arrangements as well as to conventional products. Clause 98 contains a

regulatory power to allow further similar products to be incorporated

into the tax system by Treasury order and provides the Government with

the flexibility to respond quickly to

developments.</div><a name="0606079000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 95

enables a new long-term finance product in the form of an agency

relationship that gives a similar income account fund to a deposit of

money at interest. The Finance Act 2005 provided a return on particular

arrangements, calling the legislation a profit share return, to be

taxed in the same way as interest. The clause extends that definition

to include the return from a profit share agency arrangement under

which certain conditions are met. It means, for example, that the rules

on deduction of tax from bank or building society interest apply to the

return from profit share agency arrangements. It ensures that both the

investor and the financial institutions are taxed fairly on the

financial return that each makes on the arrangement. It also contains

some further changes to the legislation to ensure consistent treatment

between the agency-based product and conventional interest-based

products. I commend the clause to the

Committee.</div><a name="0606079000171"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000375"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> I must start by apologising to the Chairman and

to the Economic Secretary for missing the first few seconds of his

presentation. I will follow his example in addressing clauses 95 to 98

together. I am slightly worried that I find myself in agreement with

him on the proposals. They are welcome because, as we have heard, they

provide a legal and tax framework to accommodate two further

sharia-compliant finance arrangements.</div>

<a name="0606079000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Koran

provides:</div><a name="0606079000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Oh

you who believe, you shall not take usury compounded over and over.

Observe God that you may succeed&#148;.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 446</div><a name="0606079000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">At another point, it states:</div>

<a name="0606079000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;God does not bless

usury, and he causes charitable deeds to

prosper&#148;.</div><a name="0606079000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some

interpret the prohibitions in the Koran to cover only usury. However,

it seems more generally accepted that the ban extends to the paying of

interest or riba in any transaction. Considerable effort has therefore

been made over recent years to develop financial products that suit the

needs of the Muslim community, but which also enable it to comply with

sharia law and avoid interest, as we have heard from the Economic

Secretary. Last year&#146;s introduction of a financial framework for

two sharia financial products, morabaha and modaraba, were widely

welcomed.</div>

<a name="0606079000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 95

provides similar legal certainty for the wakala contract, which

involves profit share agencies. Clause 96 performs the same function in

relation to diminishing musharaka products, which use diminishing

shared ownership arrangements. There are a number of reasons why it is

important to ensure that the United Kingdom&#146;s tax and regulatory

structures embrace sharia-compliant products such as those. It is

important to ensure that the UK&#146;s Muslim community is encouraged

to save and deal prudently with managing its finances. I recently had

the pleasure of visiting a mosque in north Finchley. It falls just

outside my constituency, but its catchment area covers my constituents.

The much respected imam at the north Finchley mosque, Mr. Mufti

Barkatullah, is an expert on Islamic finance. He advises several banks,

including Lloyds TSB, on sharia-compliant products. He believes that

providing such products is vital to improve prosperity levels in the

Muslim community.</div> <a name="0606079000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">At a

recent meeting in north London, Mufti Barkatullah was quoted in the

papers as

saying:</div><a name="0606079000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Much of

the deprivation among Muslims is because they don&#146;t find the

financial world friendly to their ethics. They find it hard to believe

that financial institutions are becoming friendly. I am here to

reassure them.&#148;</div><a name="0606079000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure

that the Committee will be aware of the tensions that we have seen in

some cities with large Muslim communities where deprivation levels are

high. No doubt action on many fronts will be needed to reverse that,

but a thriving Islamic finance sector could be helpful in that

regard.</div><a name="0606079000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ensuring

that we are an attractive location for Islamic finance could give us an

important competitive edge. The Islamic financial sector has been

experiencing high levels of growth. The law firm Clifford Chance

recently estimated that the sector is worth about $2 billion with very

fast growth in areas such as sukuks, which are Islamic bonds.

Moody&#146;s, the credit ratings agency, recently announced that it

was setting up an office in Dubai to provide credit ratings for those

bonds and other Islamic financial instruments. It estimates that the

world&#146;s 200 Islamic mutual funds are handling assets

worth &#163;161 billion and, of course, serving the vast

Muslim population of India&#146;s increasingly successful economy is

also likely to open up huge business opportunities.</div>

<a name="0606079000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other areas of growing business

include Islamic leasing or ijara, Islamic hire purchase or

ijara-wa-iqtina, Islamic asset-backed securities, and Islamic

risk-mitigating instruments. Insurance, once frowned on in the Islamic

world, is also growing with the spread of takaful products. HSBC

Singapore manages about 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 447</div>280 million such funds. HSBC has also developed a number of

sharia-compliant mortgages and pension plans in this country.</div>

<a name="0606079000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Using a 1,400-year-old law to

govern modern contracts is not without its challenges. Such is the

dramatic success of the Islamic finance sector that the <i class="I">Financial

Times</i> on Friday reported an increasing shortage of scholars with

the expertise to advise on such matters. The procedures required before

a product can be authorised as sharia-compliant can make the Financial

Services Authority process look positively tame and simplistic. In many

cases, authorisation is needed from a board of 15 scholars that meets

only twice a year in Mecca and Medina.</div>

<a name="0606079000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another reason for supporting

the Government&#146;s attempts, this year and last year, to adapt our

legal framework to encourage Islamic financial products is that in a

world in which there is increasing anxiety about the relationship

between the Islamic world and western Governments, it is good to see an

area in which financial institutions at the forefront of our capitalist

economy are working harmoniously to meet the needs of the devout and

the Muslim community.</div>

<a name="0606079000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I

sound a note of caution. While these clauses facilitate

sharia-compliant finances, in schedule 20 the Government are

undermining the freedom to create sharia-compliant wills. I shall

explore the issue when we debate that schedule, but it is another

reason for the Government to look afresh at schedule 20 and to review

the proposals in

it.</div><a name="0606079000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606079000376"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Sadiq Khan</b> (Tooting) (Lab): I am afraid that my Arabic is

no better than that of the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet and the

Economic Secretary.</div> <a name="0606079000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

welcome the provisions in this Bill and in last year&#146;s for

sharia-compliant wakala and musharaka products. I agree with the

compliments that the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet paid to Mufti

Barkatullah. It is pleasing to see not just a fantastic British

Chancellor leading the way and making sharia-compliant products

feasible, but HSBC doing so too. The good thing about clauses 95 to 98

is that they provide opportunities for British citizens of Islamic

faith and British companies that wish to pursue an Islamic ethos, as

well as letting overseas companies know that the UK is Muslim-friendly.

We have here examples of alternative financial arrangements that are

beneficial for loans to employees, for those who wish to have

diminishing shared ownership and for profit-sharing agencies.</div>

<a name="0606079000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me formally welcome the

Economic Secretary to his new position. I know that he has been

welcomed by every member of this Committee over the past seven

years&#151;sorry, six weeks&#151;but my question is, can he assure

us that the fantastic work that we have seen over the past two years

will continue? In particular, will Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury and

HMRC continue to consult representatives of banks, businesses and the

Muslim community on the tax treatment of arrangements that achieve the

same result as conventional financial instruments without involving

payment or receipt of interest? The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet has

given examples of some of the things that are prohibited by sharia law.

The important assurance that 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 448</div>my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary can give us will be that the

excellent work undertaken hitherto will continue in the weeks, months

and, dare I say, decades of this Labour Government.</div>

Balls:</b> The clause has already been

discussed in so far as it refers to musharaka arrangements, which are

basically partnership-based products that are economically similar to

secured loans. I can confirm that in this instance and the previous one

we consulted widely with the Muslim community and with the financial

industry and its advisers. In each case, the product was highlighted as

being one for which there is a demand that cannot be met because of the

current uncertainty about tax treatment. These clauses provide the

certainty that will allow such trade to go ahead.</div>

the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) that over the coming months we will

continue to consult the community and its financial advisers. As London

such products, it is important for the strength of the City of London

that we continue to support the parts of the City that provide special

products. I definitely will be having meetings and will be seeking his

advice on the best people to consult to ensure that we are at the

forefront of thinking in this area. I can also tell him and others that

the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be speaking at a conference in the

next few weeks at which these issues will be addressed directly in

discussion with members of the community and experts. I can definitely

give him the assurance he seeks that in the months, years and decades

<a name="0606079000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606079000378"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Paul Goodman</b> (Wycombe) (Con): It is a pleasure to welcome

you to the Chair, Sir John. Although I am half hypnotised by the

beautiful blue sky outside that the Paymaster General referred to

earlier and which, alas, she cannot see, I do have a few questions on

clause 99. I hope that she and Ministers will allow me to sketch out

briefly what the clause does before I ask them.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column448" />Column number: 449</div><a name="0606079000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">In essence, the

Energy Act 2004 reorganised the nuclear industry. It made accounting

entries of certain publicly owned companies&#151;I stress the word

&#147;publicly&#148;&#151;in the British Nuclear Fuels group not

liable for corporation tax purposes, dependent on certain events of

reorganisation taking place. Those events duly took place, but the

European Commission launched an investigation into state aid in respect

of nuclear decommissioning. Transitional financial arrangements were

then set up, which meant that the intention of section 29 of the 2004

Act to exempt transactions from corporation tax no longer applied. The

clause seeks to reapply them. So far, so

dry.</div><a name="0606079000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

is, however, a rather more interesting development. It is worth noting

that since the Budget it has been announced that one of the BNFL

companies&#151;British Nuclear Group, which is its specialist site

management and nuclear clean-up business&#151;is to be transferred

from the public to the private sector. During the Budget debate, the

then Trade and Industry Secretary, who is now the Secretary of State

for Education and Skills, stated in words that did not apply to the

deputy leadership of the Labour party but to this

subject:</div><a name="0606079000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

must...ensure that elements in public ownership that do not need

to be in public ownership to meet our objectives on decommissioning are

put into the private sector.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 28

March 2006; Vol. 444, c.

699.]</div><a name="0606079000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

sounds reasonable in principle. Obviously, Members on this side of the

House look sympathetically&#151;although not favourably in all

cases&#151;on the case for transferring services from the public to

the private sector. However, this is where the questions

arise.</div><a name="0606079000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">If

I am not mistaken&#151;Ministers will correct me if I am&#151;it

seems that an exemption from corporation tax that applied to a public

body is now to be applied to a private body, and in circumstances in

which there is a sale. Can Ministers explain what connection there is,

if any, between the exemption and the sale? It was put to me, perhaps

wrongly, that the exemption could simply have been intended to make the

sale more attractive. I would like to know whether that is the case

and, if so, what the cost of the exemption will be. Finally, are there

precedents for this kind of exemption? If so, what are they? The

Paymaster General may be able to refer me to a large number of

exemptions in the years of Conservative Government, but I am curious

about

that.</div><a name="0606079000199"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000379"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I find the clause difficult to understand, perhaps

because it comes under the Energy Act and I am not an energy expert.

However, I understand the explanation given in his introductory remarks

by the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman). But further to that

understanding it appears to me&#151;I may have got it

wrong&#151;that, under the Energy Act 2004, a certain tax regime was

set up. The European Commission said, &#147;Well we think it might be

unauthorised state aid,&#148; so clause 99 of this Bill was drafted

to rejig it slightly. That prompts the question whether we have still

got unauthorised state aid, albeit in a different form, overlaid, as

the hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, with the possible privatisation

of British Nuclear Group, a site management and clean-up company, which

seems to be shadowed in clause 99(4)(a)(b)&#151;for the anoraks among

us, it is on page 93, line 11&#151;which

states:</div><a name="0606079000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a company that

immediately before 1st April 2005 was a wholly-owned subsidiary of

BNFL&#148;.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 450</div><a name="0606079000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would count under the Energy Act 2004

as the definition of a BNFL company, even though it may have been

privatised since 1 April 2005.</div>

<a name="0606079000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stepping back from that to the

politics of the matter which, heaven forfend, we have in the Finance

Bill, it appears at first glance that not only section 29 of the Energy

Act 2004 but the proposed amendment to it looks like another subsidy to

the failed nuclear industry, which uses old-fashioned technology, has

never paid its way anywhere in the world and has left us and succeeding

generations for the next 186,000 years, or whatever is the half-life of

a uranium atom, with a huge clean-up problem.</div>

<a name="0606079000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 99 appears to further a

subsidy for an industry that is a failure financially and works around

the world only with continuing subsidies from the states in which it

operates, as evidenced by the fact that, as far as I am aware, there

are no applications around the world for permissions to build new

nuclear power stations unless they are state sponsored or state

subsidised, whether they are in Finland or in China. Anyone could apply

to build a nuclear power station in the United Kingdom now; the head of

E.ON UK which is, I think, wholly owned by the German E.ON company,

could say, &#147;Well, I think we need new nuclear power

stations,&#148; but not actually put in an application to build

any.</div> <a name="0606079000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">We cannot have

the whole nuclear debate now, as you would not allow it, Sir John, but

I would like reassurance that clause 99 is not a further subsidy to the

nuclear

industry.</div><a name="0606079000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0606079000380"></a><b class="B">Helen

Goodman</b> (Bishop Auckland) (Lab): I echo the questions

already asked by hon. Members on these two clauses; I simply want to

ask Ministers to explain how the proposals will operate and what the

cost will be.</div>

<a name="0606079000205"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000381"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> May I first respond directly to my hon. Friend

the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West? The answer is no; it is not a

further subsidy, and I shall explain what happens. The clause amends

section 29 of the Energy Act 2004, as the hon. Member for Wycombe

said.</div> <a name="0606079000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 29 was

intended to prevent a BNFL site licensee company from incurring

corporation tax charges as a consequence of accounting entries made to

reflect the assumption of financial responsibility for decommissioning

and clearing up certain civil nuclear sites by the Nuclear

Decommissioning Authority. Section 29 proceeds on the basis that the

recognition of the assumption of financial responsibility by the NDA

would relate to specific events. That is not the case.</div>

<a name="0606079000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments are required to

ensure that the appropriate accounting entries are included and to

ensure that the companies will not incur tax charges solely because of

the accounting for the recognition of the assumption of financial

responsibility. It is to do with the interaction between those

companies, as the hon. Member for Wycombe mentioned.</div>

<a name="0606079000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">To take the

matter further, let us deal with the question of precedent. In 2005,

the Government took over responsibility for British Energy plc&#146;s

liability for decommissioning and certain other liabilities. The

resultant credit in the accounts was exempt from tax by way of similar

provisions to these in section 4 of the Electricity 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column450" />Column number: 451</div>(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. Section 29 of

the Energy Act 2004 was intended to prevent a large amount of money

moving in circles, and to take account of the accounting practices. The

reorganisation could not have gone ahead if tax charges had arisen, and

this clause preserves the intended tax treatment. It is a case not of

giving up forecast revenues, but of preventing an inconceivable and

unexpected charge that would arise solely because of the timing of

events and the accounting for reorganisation. It has been done

before.</div> <a name="0606079000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Gentleman asked me for examples of precedents in the transfer between

public authorities. Although I recognise that the BNFL group includes

the private sector, tax and liabilities follow the normal tax

provisions. The provision goes no further than that; it is simply a

tidying-up measure. It was originally undertaken in an Energy Act, and

the reason why it is being undertaken in the Finance Bill is because

there is no suitable vehicle for dealing with it apart from the Finance

Bill. The provision could have been included in another Energy Bill had

there been one.</div> <a name="0606079000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">With

regard to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about any proposal to sell

off British Nuclear Fuels or part of it, the Energy Act 2004&#151;not

this Bill&#151;provided that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority

would be given responsibility for decommissioning and clearing up the

designated nuclear sites and installations. Section 29 was a practical

measure to prevent a large amount of Government money moving in circles

from one Department to another. Under ordinary tax rules, the account

in credit arising when the NDA takes over responsibilities would count

as a taxable income resulting in a liability that BNFL would not be

able to fund from its own resources.</div>

<a name="0606079000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 44 of the 2004 Act

stripped BNFL of its tax losses. It represents the other side of the

coin in this removal, ensuring that they are both in accord. This

clause preserves the intended effect of section 29 of the 2004 Act, and

it is included in this legislation for no other

reason.</div>

<a name="0606079000212"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000382"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> This is complicated, revolving-door finance, but

taking my right hon. Friend back a couple of sentences, I understood

her to say&#151;or words to the effect&#151;that without section 29

and because of nuclear liabilities moving over to the Nuclear

Decommissioning Authority, BNFL would not have been able to meet its

tax liability. I think that that was what she said, and she will

correct me if I am wrong. If that is the case, is not it an indication

that BNFL does not work financially?</div>

<a name="0606079000213"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000383"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> As my hon. Friend said, this is not the place

to discuss an Act that went through the House in 2004. The provision

before us simply ensures that the 2004 legislation follows the

accounting practices and reflects the reality. It would not be

appropriate for me to go over discussions that took place when that

legislation went through the

House.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000388"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> The Opposition welcome the clause, which extends

the temporary tax and accounting regime for securitisation companies to

the end of December 2007. It confirms that, during that period,

securitisation companies can continue to calculate profits under UK

GAAP&#151;generally accepted accounting principles&#151;rather than

switching to IFRS, or international financial reporting

standards.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column452" />Column number: 453</div><a name="0606079000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is important because

of the crucial role played by securitisation companies. As I am sure

the Committee is aware, securitisation is a type of shock-treatment

finance used to pool assets and income streams into a single tradeable

security. The assets can be any financial assets, such as mortgages,

corporate loans or rent receivables. The companies at issue here are

special purpose vehicles that have beneficial ownership of the assets

and receive the income that they generate. They use the value of the

future income stream to issue securities&#151;generally, debt

instruments that are traded on the

market.</div><a name="0606079000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Securitisation

has revolutionised the operation of financial markets. It has enabled a

range of diverse financial assets to become tradeable and has opened up

a whole new investment area by enabling risk to be split much more

easily between multiple lenders. It has enabled groups of lenders to be

linked with borrowers in a way that was never possible before. The

global market for securitisation is worth about $6.6 trillion, or at

least it was in 2003&#151;the figures have probably increased since

then. It is well worth putting it on the record that maintaining the

right tax and regulatory framework is crucial to securing a thriving

bond market in London and a healthy financial centre in the City of

London.</div><a name="0606079000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue that

the clause is designed to tackle results from the move to international

financial reporting standards, which causes a particular problem for

securitisation companies. Because securities are issued by SPVs and are

traded, it is crucial that they can attract a good credit rating for

those securities, because without that the costs of borrowing spiral.

One of the factors taken into account by the ratings agencies relates

to the level and consistency of tax charges.</div>

<a name="0606079000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the UK generally accepted

accounting practice, profits are broadly calculated as income

receivable from the assets less interest payable on the traded

security, and tax is payable based on those profits. In short, the SPV

is taxed on the income it receives net of the interest charged.

However, international financial reporting standards require that the

traded security is accounted for on a marked-to-market basis. That

means that it is revalued for each balance sheet date based on its

market value, and the difference is booked to the accounts via an

income statement or the reserves.</div>

<a name="0606079000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The differences are taxable and

that gives rise to significant fluctuations between taxable profits

from one year to the next. The effect is that instead of the smooth

taxable result that one gets under UK GAAP, the tax charge becomes

highly volatile. Despite the SPV having a stable income stream, large

peaks and troughs in its tax bill could threaten its ability to pay,

which would be of considerable concern to the ratings agency and could

have a significant impact on the rating of the bonds issued by the

SPV.</div> <a name="0606079000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, the

switchover to IFRS could cause ratings previously given to

securitisation companies to be downgraded, hence the welcome decision

to allow such companies to continue to use the old UK GAAP rules.

However, that solution was only ever intended to be temporary. It is

not ideal because it means that securitisation companies effectively

have to draw up 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column453" />Column number: 454</div>two sets of accounts and there is, as yet, no indication of when a new

permanent set of rules will be developed and published.</div>

<a name="0606079000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the Minister covering

this issue to give the Committee some indication of what stage the

Government have reached in preparing those long-term rules. I urge them

to prioritise making progress on this important matter, given the

highly significant role that securitisation companies play both in our

financial markets and in our economy. It is important to bear in mind

that most securitisations are done on long-term debt issues, where

long-term certainty in respect of the tax regime is obviously highly

desirable. I also emphasise the importance of providing for effective

consultation in finalising the

rules.</div><a name="0606079000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, will the

Paymaster General consider giving some kind of undertaking that the

temporary provision will stay in place until the permanent new rules

are introduced. I hope that she will be able to give us assurances on

the issues that I have raised in relation to this

matter.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000389"></a>The

Chairman:</b> I am happy for the Paymaster General to reply to

the questions on international accounting standards raised by the hon.

Member for Chipping Barnet. However, I do not think that it would be

appropriate for this then to develop into a debate on the various

merits and demerits of the international accounting

standards.</div>

<a name="0606079000235"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000390"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I shall briefly respond to the points raised.

The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet is right that a temporary

arrangement was made and it is desirable that we should move to a

permanent arrangement as quickly as possible. The temporary

arrangements are far better than moving now to the international

accounting standards for the reasons that she has given.</div>

<a name="0606079000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady asked me to give

an indication of the Government&#146;s plans in trying to move

towards the permanent regime. I hope that draft clauses will shortly be

available for consultation with the industry on how to move to a

permanent arrangement. Given all her points about the importance of

liquidity, I would like, as I am sure the industry would&#151;that is

the advice I have received&#151;the consultation to be concluded in

good time to enable the permanent regime to become operational on 1

January 2007. Obviously, that means that we need to get the drafts out

as quickly as possible, and that is what we intend to do.</div>

<a name="0606079000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Lady rightly says,

the clause is a temporary extension of a temporary arrangement. It is

important in this crucial area of availability of finance that we seek

to make permanent arrangements as quickly as possible. I hope that she

finds that

helpful.</div><a name="0606079000238"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000391"></a>Mrs.

amendment No. 217, in page 80, line 27 [Vol II], leave out &#145;22nd

June' and insert &#145;10th

March'.</div><a name="0606079000244"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000394"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> The amendments would backdate the relief to the

date of the publication of document UITF 40 on 10 March 2005. To show

the rationale behind the amendments, it is necessary to set out the

background to the issues that we are discussing. Clause 102 and

schedule 15 deal with the taxation of work in progress and the impact

of FRS 5 and UITF 40, which was issued by the urgent issues task force

of the Accounting Standards Board. Affected businesses include service

providers such as solicitors, marketing and advertising firms,

accountants, insurance brokers and consultants of various descriptions.

That covers a number of Committee members, in one way or another. I

believe that one or two of the provisions in schedule 15 also impact on

barristers, so I suppose that I should admit that I was one, at one

stage.</div><a name="0606079000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

broad terms, FRS 5 is the UK accounting standard that seeks to look

through legal form and account for the substance of transactions. It is

one of the most complex and hard to understand of all the UK accounting

standards. Application note G of FRS 5, which was issued in November

2003, sought to deal with service businesses with large contracts. It

set out new rules for the accounting treatment of the period when the

contract was ongoing. In the past, the profit on the contract was

recognised when it was completed and taxed, which tended to be when the

payment was received.</div>

<a name="0606079000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Application

note G required that the amount was brought into account as soon as

there was a contractual right to payment as a result of performance

under contract. Problems arose because it was interpreted differently

by different accountants. Some required professionals whom it affected

to bring amounts into account evenly over the performance of the

contract, whereas others felt that it was sufficient to bring amounts

into account when performance occurred.</div>

<a name="0606079000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The urgent

issues task force looks into such areas of uncertainty in relation to

application of accounting standards. It issued UITF 40 to deal with the

question of whether profit should be recognised as the contract

progressed under the new method, or on completion of the old method.

The key factor is the point at which consideration is legally due. UITF

40 considered that it accrues as time goes by, hence the new method was

adopted.</div> <a name="0606079000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The overall

effect of UITF 40 is that a large, one-off tax bill arises for

solicitors and other service providers affected. That caused

considerable anxiety, as did the prospect of having to pay tax on

ongoing work for which the firm might not yet have been paid. To its

credit, the Revenue has recognised that problem by introducing schedule

15 essentially to spread that one-off tax charge over three to six

years. It does not reduce the tax charge, but merely spreads the time

over which it is payable.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column455" />Column number: 456</div><a name="0606079000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">In principle, the change provides

some welcome relief, but serious concern has been expressed by the

professional associations regarding the implementation dates. As

drafted, the relief set out in schedule 15 applies only to businesses

that adopted UITF 40 from its official start date on 22 June 2005, but

many businesses adopted the approach in UITF 40 before then. That may

have been because their auditors advised them to do so, or simply

because they wished to follow best practice. However, paragraphs 1 and

9 of schedule 15 deny the relief to any firm that adopted UITF 40

before its start date.</div>

<a name="0606079000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chartered Institute of

Taxation and the Law Society have both pointed out that it seems unfair

to penalise such firms because they acted swiftly in seeking to apply

the highest accounting standards, and the amendment seeks to backdate

the relief so that those firms can claim the spreading

relief.</div><a name="0606079000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Institute of Chartered Accountants has stated that

</div><a name="0606079000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;this sends out a

powerful message to business that early adoption of accounting

standards in accordance with the highest standards of corporate

governance will be encouraged and will not result in such businesses

being

penalised.&#148;</div><a name="0606079000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendments are modest, and as many firms started to amend their

procedures for drawing up accounts even in advance of the publication

of UITF 40 there might even be an argument for backdating the measure

further, as the Law Society has suggested. The Law Society also

observed that the proposal is not for a tax reduction; instead it would

allow more time for firms to spread the cost of what the society has

described as a one-off windfall tax for the

Treasury.</div><a name="0606079000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">As

drafted, the Bill perversely rewards those who left it as late as

possible to adopt best practice. Given the need to encourage high

standards of corporate governance, I hope that the Government might be

prepared to consider the amendments that I have

proposed.</div><a name="0606079000300"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30

David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): I declare

that I am a non-practising solicitor. My attention was drawn recently

to an article in <i class="I">Taxation</i> magazine. I do not know whether that

was by Mr. John Endacott, a partner at Winter Rule chartered

accountants. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.] </i>No, it was not by

Mrs. Gauke, though Mrs. Gauke drew it to my attention; I should perhaps

declare that my wife is a practising solicitor. The article, which was

published in January 2006, stated that around 70 per cent. of the top

100 law firms had already decided to adopt the new standard by the end

of 2004 and that it was likely that the remaining 30 per cent. would

have done so by the time of publication of the article. Mr. Endacott

was extremely critical of the Treasury in its approach to spreading. He

stated

that</div><a name="0606079000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;What we

have here is firms being penalised for adopting good accounting

way&#148;</div><a name="0606079000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;given that

most firms will already have changed their accounting systems. He added

that</div><a name="0606079000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;firms embracing

modern approaches have to suffer the tax consequences of doing so,

whilst the laggards benefit from some relief.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column456" />Column number: 457</div><a name="0606079000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 15 attempts to address

an unfortunate circumstance, but it fails, because for the vast

majority of firms it will be unavailable. Most firms that are likely to

seek to comply quickly will have been required to do so by their

auditors and will already have changed their accounting systems, so

there is nothing in the schedule to assist them. That is petty, and I

should like to know why the Treasury has adopted that route rather than

making the provision effective as of 10 March 2005 or November 2004

when the accounting standards were

developed.</div><a name="0606079000257"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000396"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I should make it clear that the Government are

not penalising those who followed the UITF 40 interpretations in

accounting periods ending before 22 June 2005. They will pay the same

tax as they would have paid had the Government not included the measure

in the Bill, and on the same date. They will pay the same tax as they

would have paid had the Government not included the measure in the

Bill, and on the same date. They will face no additional charge that

they could not have anticipated when they decided on their accounting

policy for a period, at which point they would have examined the matter

carefully and taken advice. The amendments ask us to do something that

is incredibly complicated and could result in more tax liability in

years that have already been dealt with. I shall explain

why.</div><a name="0606079000258"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000397"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I think we should vote for it.

<i class="I">[Laughter.]</i></div><a name="0606079000259"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000398"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I thank my hon.

Friend.</div><a name="0606079000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even

those who are not accountants will understand that it would be

difficult to set a start date of 10 March. Income tax payers&#146;

accounting dates are up until 5 April 2005, so we would have had to

include the effect of the first year&#146;s spreading in 2004-05 tax

returns, which were due at the end of January this year. The provisions

of the Bill were not available to help people at that point, and they

would be able to take advantage of the new laws only by amending their

returns. Spreading adjustment income from 2004-05 would also reduce

taxable income from that tax year, but would consequently increase

taxable income in 2005-06 and subsequent years. The amendment would

therefore impose a tax charge for the first time in 2005-06, rather

than in 2006-07 as would be the case with a start date of 22 June

2005.</div><a name="0606079000261"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000399"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> Will the Paymaster General give

way?</div><a name="0606079000262"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000400"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> Hang on. Let me answer the points. If I have

not dealt with them, the hon. Gentleman can reinforce

them.</div><a name="0606079000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">In setting dates,

it is always difficult to establish who knew what when about the

changes being made, but I took the view that it is fair to put the

start date for spreading at the date on which the new accounting

interpretations became compulsory rather than at some interim point

that can be justified only because it was the start of a new tax year.

That would still leave a group of early adopters feeling unfairly

treated. I emphasise nobody will be penalised because they adopted

early. They will not face any additional tax charge but will pay the

same tax on the same date as 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 458</div>they would otherwise have done. Even the hon. Member for South-West

Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) can see that to go back into tax years that

are already closed off would present untold problems, particularly in

the case of complex partnership arrangements. It is a matter of

judgment, and my judgment is that the right start date for spreading is

the date on which the requirements were finally introduced. That is the

decision that the Government have

made.</div><a name="0606079000264"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000401"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b><b class="B"> </b>I hear what the Paymaster General is saying,

and I can see some of the practical difficulties involved. Is it not a

fact, however, that most firms changed their accounting practices

before it was compulsory to do so? If the policy objective of the

schedule is to relieve the burden on firms that are changing their

accounting systems and to spread out the windfall cost, did not the

Treasury miss a trick a year or two ago? It should have brought in

legislation equivalent to the schedule earlier, so that we would not be

in a position in which there is practical difficulty and in which we

cannot go back to before 22 June? Is that not the

problem?</div><a name="0606079000265"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000402"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> No, it is not. It is not for the Treasury to

anticipate when accounting standards and directions will be made and to

legislate accordingly. Those companies that looked at the statements

that were being made and the possible changes that were coming forward

took decisions about whether or not to be early adopters. That was

sound advice for their business, and they moved in that way. As long as

they are not disadvantaged, which they are not, I cannot see what the

problem was.</div> <a name="0606079000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this

example, the Opposition are seeking to put phenomenally complex

legislation in place that could result in a tax charge on those who

currently do not face one. If the Opposition want to put their

amendment to the vote I shall ask my colleagues to oppose it. If they

do vote it in, I do not think that they will be thanked by those

companies that might find themselves with a tax

charge.</div>

<a name="0606079000267"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000403"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> I hear what the Paymaster General is saying about

it not being the role of the Treasury to anticipate what firms will do

when it comes to changing their accounting practices. However, as we

have just heard, 70 of the 100 largest law firms had already changed

their accounting practices by the end of 2004. It is not a question of

anticipation, as during the course of 2005 the Treasury might have

noticed, received representations and acted then. Instead, it is acting

now with schedule 15. Presumably its purpose is to try to help firms

and there is an objective that is meant to be achieved, but that

objective will not be achieved because the vast majority of firms that

will be affected will not benefit from the schedule as they had already

done changed their accounting by the end of 2004. We are talking about

a whole year when the Treasury did not act and should maybe have done

so.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0606079000404"></a>Mrs.

clear that the shift was underway and it was entirely desirable that it

would be underway at an early stage. I appeal to the Paymaster General

to try to ensure in future that early adoption of best practices in
