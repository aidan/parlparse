</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand that Mr. Woodward had the floor this morning before the Committee adjourned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. I had the floor when we adjourned for lunch.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I apologise; I was obviously given the wrong information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On a further point of order, Mrs. Winterton. Before lunch I said that the water company Hyder has sustained a windfall tax charge of &#163;283 million; that figure is incorrect and should be &#163;282 million. I wonder whether the record could be altered accordingly.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that that will be noted and attended to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Before we broke for lunch, I argued that it would be better if the Government had found a means whereby the general trading activity of companies subject to the windfall tax could be separated from their regulated activities. The windfall tax does not encourage good environmental management. Hyder will suffer the highest windfall tax charge of &#163;282 million. Labour Members contended that that will not affect companies' reinvestment performance, or the bills that customers receive.
<P>
That is complete nonsense: taking &#163;282 million from any company is bound to have a long-term effect, either on its reinvestment programme or on the price that the company ultimately charges its customers, no matter how carefully the regulator monitors the position.
<P>
The Chancellor has claimed that his main aspiration is to encourage efficiency and good environmental management among these companies. Those companies that, wisely, have invested in the past, thereby reducing their profits and thus their liability to windfall tax, will suffer compared with those that have not invested and are not so efficient. This tax will have a distorting effect, encouraging the opposite of what was intended.
<P>
We should be encouraging good environmental management. Often, the environment is a marginal consideration for these companies: it is considered merely as a goodwill gesture to their customers. We should look much closer at how companies are regulated. If we cannot encourage good environmental management through the windfall tax, the Government have a duty to investigate ways in which it might be encouraged.
<P>
I am especially keen that the windfall tax does not encourage demand-side management. Energy resources are precious: we should be aiming to achieve sustainability--to pass on a better world to our children than that which we have inherited. We should encourage everybody to use energy more efficiently. We should encourage companies, through good education and advice, to encourage their customers to use less energy, whether it be electricity or gas, thus reducing the need to build new generation power plants or new reservoirs, or some other major capital improvement, because less of those commodities are being consumed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Can we therefore infer from the hon. Gentleman's comments that he will wholeheartedly support the Chancellor's efforts, proposed for the November Budget, to introduce an environmental tax? That tax will have a decisive influence on the privatised utilities and other industries; it is designed to shake up their environmental behaviour, which the hon. Gentleman has criticised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I know, Mrs. Winterton, that I will be ruled out of order if I pursue that point too far. However, I am wholly in favour of environmental fiscal measures, provided that they do not constitute a general increase in taxation. I support a shift in the balance of taxation in favour of environmental taxes that encourage better environmental practice. For example, the differential in petrol tax has been extremely successful in encouraging a 90 per cent. market share today, from 5 per cent. 10 years ago. Correct fiscal balance, which the windfall tax does not encourage but this amendment would, can encourage good environmental management.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Does my hon. Friend recall that the landfill tax was criticised by antediluvian interests at the time of its introduction by a Conservative Government? Labour-controlled Northamptonshire county council did not support it because it believed that the tax imposed further costs. Was not the introduction of the tax an example of the need to strike a balance, because the extra revenue received for a green purpose was used to reduce other industrial costs by reducing national insurance? Such a balance must be struck to protect the environment and reduce industrial costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend, whose intervention goes to the heart of the matter. Environmental taxes should be used to secure good environmental management or to improve competitiveness.
<P>
The amendment would separate trading activity from regulated activity, thereby encouraging increased competitiveness. This part of the Bill, like so many other parts of it, such as foreign income dividend provisions, will have a perverse effect because it will reduce the competitiveness of British utilities. Other private water companies--for example, Generale Des Eaux--will now be able to take over British companies that are subject to the windfall tax. This perverse effect--I like the word ``perverse'', my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) used it a lot in his speech, it is very descriptive--
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg </B>(Halton): What is the hon. Gentleman's evidence for arguing that the windfall tax will harm companies' competitiveness?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> A company subject to the windfall tax can be charged between &#163;9 million and &#163;282 million, yet a similar company trading in exactly the same conditions will not be liable to the tax. So it stands to reason that companies that are liable to the windfall tax will be less competitive. That observation pre-empts a speech that I wish to make later about the perverse and arbitrary nature of the tax. One cannot have it both ways: if money is taken out of a company there has to be a knock-on effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Cunningham </B>(Coventry, South): Can the hon. Gentleman explain how the six companies which paid out special dividends totalling &#163;1&#183;3 billion did not have their efficiency affected? Does that removal of moneys have no effect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> That is a market-driven decision, entirely up to the companies. Charging these companies through a compulsory windfall tax is a completely different proposition. The companies must first look after their customers; secondly, after their shareholders; and, thirdly, after their country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cunningham:</B> The hon. Gentleman still has not explained why the efficiency of a company is not affected when dividends are paid, but when a tax is paid it does affect efficiency. Will he explain that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> As I said earlier, I accept that in earlier years the regulators were not as tough on some of the utilities as they should have been; for example, we should have been tougher on the water companies over leaks much sooner. I applaud what has happened recently; for example, Severn Trent Water was praised yesterday by Ofwat for cutting leaks by one third to an all-time low of 16 per cent. The company has introduced a free repair scheme for customers' own supply pipes to help bring the total down still further.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith (Redditch):</B> Does the hon. Gentleman realise that Severn Trent's free repair scheme was introduced only after the Deputy Prime Minister's initiative in gathering water companies together to discuss these matters?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am not sure how far you will allow me to stray down that route, Mrs. Winterton, but in answer to the hon. Lady's question, I do not know whether that is true. It is--[Interruption] If it is true--and hon. Members should listen for a minute--I welcome the Deputy Prime Minister's initiative, because anything that improves the performance of the water companies on leaks must benefit shareholders, investors and the general public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am blessed by three major water service companies meeting at a watershed in my constituency. One of them is Severn Trent Water, which recently sent me a very helpful briefing. It introduced a service for which there was a fixed charge, and at the behest of the Deputy Prime Minister it waived that charge. That is an example of its ability to exercise discretion over its fund of profits, and it is precisely because it has spare profits that it is in a position to do so. Does my hon. Friend agree that if profits are eroded it will become progressively more difficult to take such action?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> If companies cannot retain profits to reinvest--the windfall tax will affect their bottom line--they will be unable to move as fast to reduce leakages or emissions from power stations, to lay new gas pipelines, or to take other energy-efficiency measures, which is not in the interests of customers.
<P>
I was diverted; I wish to stick to the amendment. Separating trading activity from regulated activity would better enable non-general utilities that are subject to the windfall tax to compete. That would be a much fairer and more transparent tax.
<P>
I am anxious that the windfall tax will distort the regulator's ability to exert tight price control. When the regulator reviews price controls, he may be unable to resist the huge upward pressure as a result of the windfall tax. I should be concerned if those tight price controls were relaxed because, as I said this morning, that would affect the bills of the poor people of Wales. It is extraordinary that a Conservative Member should have to protect the interests of Welsh constituents against Labour's proposed tax.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): I take this opportunity to welcome you, Mrs. Winterton, to the Chair of the Committee.
<P>
The essence of the amendment is to achieve the original, announced purpose of the windfall tax, which was to take for the public purse a share of the supposed additional profits made by companies operating in a natural monopoly. Supposedly, those additional profits had been allowed by excessively weak regulation.
<P>
That was the rationale and the justification for the tax. It was said that the tax was not arbitrary and discriminatory; it did not resemble a tax levied at will by a mediaeval potentate or by a robber baron. We were told that new Labour was not doing that. The tax was said to be rational, and justified by the excess profits made by a specific category of companies lucky enough to enjoy a natural, inadequately regulated monopoly. The Labour argument was that the Government have a right to take a share of those excess profits retrospectively through the windfall tax.
<P>
I note that my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and Chelmsford, East (Mr. Whittingdale) agrees. I do not see any Members on the Government Benches shaking their heads; none of them appears to want to contradict me. I have summarised fairly the purported rationale of the windfall tax--if such a tax can have a rationale. Logically, this additional tax would be levied on the regulated activities and undertakings of a natural monopoly. For companies engaged in commercial activities outside the regulated sector, however, whose price formation decisions are subject to the constraints of competition, that rationale--by definition--cannot apply. The amendment would merely ensure that the principle that the Labour Government brought forward to justify the windfall tax is implemented.
<P>
In those circumstances, the Government should want to accept the amendment in good faith. How, in good faith, and with any respect for logic, could they do otherwise? All that the amendment does is give their purpose effect. What justification is there for taxing the non-regulated, non-natural monopoly profits of the companies involved?
<P>
I do not ask that question rhetorically, but as an invitation to Labour Members--and Lord knows there are enough of them--to intervene. I must not pause for too long or you, Mrs. Winterton, will rise to your feet, but I have made the point sufficiently well. There is no reason why the amendment should not be accepted: it would implement the Government's intentions--is that not sufficient reason to accept it?
<P>
We have objected that it is not true that the regulatory structure was too weak, that profits were excessive and that this retrospective levy is justified. To accept the Government's analysis would be to accept that it is right to levy a tax on profits made from commercial activities in a monopoly, while it would not be right to tax profits made from other activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that profits made in non-regulated sectors result directly from the investment of windfall profits in regulated sectors? The companies are sitting on a massive slush fund. Having very little experience, they do not know what to do with it. They have speculated--
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> No. They speculated in another area and failed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I just inform the Committee that it is not possible to intervene in an intervention?
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman may--
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> May I just finish my point? The profits made in the non-regulated areas were the result of windfall profits made in the regulated area, so it is quite right, as a one-off, to tax them as a hybrid proposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman bears my name, so I must be careful how I treat him--I do not wish to slight any hon. Member.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Having accused Labour Members of not answering the points that I put to them, I do not wish myself to be accused of not responding to the points made by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies), but of course I give way to my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Does my hon. Friend, like me, have some difficulty in understanding the use by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) of the phrase ``slush fund''? Perhaps we could seek some elucidation of what was meant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend's point is addressed to the hon. Member for Croydon, Central rather than to me, although I agree that the phrase ``slush fund'' is hardly appropriate in this context.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, Central, who bears my name, is wrong both in theory and in practice. He is wrong in theory to say that the companies' investment in diversifications necessarily reflects profits made in their regulated activities. Companies' cash flow can derive not merely from retained profits but from debt that is incurred or from new equity issues. He is wrong in practice because, as we know, a number of the regulated monopolies raised considerable new capital after privatisation, especially debt capital--in the majority of cases, they greatly increased their gearing. It is therefore not right to say that the new investments were funded by retained earnings.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members:</B> rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I have an embarrassment of interventions, but the laws of gallantry prescribe that I give way to the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper) in the first instance.
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper </B>(Pontefract and Castleford): Is it not true that the utilities were able to indulge in so much gearing because they were privatised with very small amounts of borrowing? Their ability to borrow in order to finance future diversification was exactly owing to the way in which they were privatised, which is exactly why the windfall tax is necessary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Lady is right in so far as the companies bore an excessively low level of gearing in their nationalised days. If she knows anything about these things--I am sure that she does; she is a considerable expert in economics and business--she will know perfectly well that if a company has too low a level of gearing, the average cost of capital will be too high. That means that the threshold rate of return for evaluating new investment is also too high, so that too little investment is undertaken.
<P>
What happened in the days when the utilities were nationalised? Too little investment was undertaken. The utilities' experience represents almost the textbook model. It was a good thing that, under the regulators' pressure, they increased their gearing--
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Mr. Geoffrey Robinson):</B> rose --
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I will give way to the hon. Gentleman in just one second. I must apologise to the Committee. I hope that it is not a discourtesy, but some of my constituents are expecting to meet me very shortly. If I am late, I shall, of course, use as an excuse the fact that I could not possibly avoid answering the Paymaster General's questions. If I am not here for the completion of the debate, I hope that the Committee will forgive me.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I would be pleased if you, Mr. Davies, would stop pointing your pen at me, irrespective of whether you have to see your constituents, as I do not like being pointed at all the time. Please desist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> May I apologise and say that it was not intended as a threatening gesture?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I pick up on the intervention made by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper). Would the hon. Gentleman care to reflect on the fact that--
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): Put your pen down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am not pointing at Mrs. Winterton, nor would I dare point it at the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies). Would he care to reflect on the following--it is a serious point--and think about it for a second, if he can. If those companies had been sold with an adequate level of debt in them, debt which would have been paid for by the Government, there would be no need for the windfall tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that, in their nationalised days, those companies had insufficient debt, a consequence of the nationalisation regime introduced by the Labour party. That is where the credibility of his argument breaks down. In effect, he is now saying that if, for whatever reason, those companies had made less profit, the Government would not have looked to them for the windfall tax.
<P>
We have demonstrated that the windfall tax is, by its very nature, a discriminatory, arbitrary and restrospective tax. It follows that the Government could have imposed it on anyone. We also discovered this morning that the so-called objective criteria in clause 2, which supposedly set out the basis on which the tax is to be levied, were drafted--perhaps I should say crafted--to ensure that they ensnared a group of companies identified in advance--as the sacrificial lambs that the Government wished to attack.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's argument has broken down completely. The Government decided to levy a windfall tax; how it was to be levied and on what particular criteria were secondary considerations. I must not say that that was hypocritical: I am thinking fast on my feet, Mrs. Winterton, for an equivalent word. The hon. Gentleman is a little confused to suppose that it would have made the slightest difference if those particular companies had made less or more profit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I wonder whether my hon. Friend agrees that the list of criteria set out in clause 2 and schedule 1 supports a list that already exists, and that the criteria are proxy for a list of names. The Paymaster General surely knows that if they were so listed, because he could not guarantee that the class would be exhaustive and could not contain another name not in that list, he would be guilty of hybridity. That is the only reason why the Bill does not list those whom the Government have decided to target.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I thought that the Paymaster General accepted this morning that the only reason that the Bill was drafted as it is was to avoid a charge of hybridity. In substance if not in form, it is a hybrid Bill. In essence, therefore, it is a discriminatory Bill.
<P>
I know that the hon. Gentleman has a distinguished business record, but I believe that he is wrong. The assumption that if a company is more highly geared it is less profitable is extremely dubious. On the contrary, it means that its average costs for capital are lower, which means in turn that it probably undertakes more investment and that, over time, it should be more profitable than a company which is under-geared. Clearly, a company that is over-geared will have too high a risk attached to its activities. If a company has too high a volatility of earnings it might even go under in a recession. We are talking about companies that have moved from the nationalised sector to the private sector and therefore from an irrational and excessively low level of gearing to a commercial level of gearing that makes sense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend has touched on an interesting point. The reason for nationalised industries being consistently geared too low is that the Government of the day have to restrict their external finance limits because borrowing counts as public expenditure. That is precisely why the Post Office should be privatised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend's analysis and with his conclusion. I realise that the conclusion falls outside the ambit of our debate, Mrs. Winterton, but I shall list what falls within it. The principles have been established this afternoon. First, the Bill is discriminatory. Secondly, the only reason why it is not an overtly discriminatory hybrid Bill is that the Government have resorted to some clever drafting tricks to avoid that. As a result, the Bill is entirely hybrid in substance, but, through clever drafting by departmental officials, not hybrid in a legal sense. Thirdly, the Bill has been justified by the entirely spurious claim that it is designed to levy an exceptional charge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. It is in order for the hon. Gentleman to challenge the legality of the Bill on the grounds for hybridity when it has already been accepted by Madam Speaker?
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand that Madam Speaker ruled that the measure is not a hybrid Bill. However, I understood the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford to be making the case for it being hybrid in essence, but not legally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> As always, Mrs. Winterton, you have grasped perfectly the sense of my remarks. The Bill is justified entirely spuriously as being designed to impose a levy on exceptional monopoly profits. In practice, it will impose a levy on profits generally made by the companies. They will be subject to an invidious discriminatory tax.
<P>
Fourthly, when an opportunity was offered to the Government to implement their own principles and ensure that what was levied was purely the profits generated within the so-called regulated monopoly area, they passed up the invitation. That shows, once again, the fundamental contradiction between the Government's rhetoric and their actual practice. In other words, a considerable degree of insincerity hovers over the proposals under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> May I use this opportunity to repeat the sentiments that have been expressed and to say how pleased we are that you are in the Chair this afternoon, Mrs. Winterton, for what has already been a livelier sitting than it was this morning?
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) introduced the debate with much urbanity and good sense. I am sure that he will be winding up the debate after the Paymaster General's remarks, whose words I sense that the Committee wishes to hear. We understand the problems faced by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford and we wish him well in his journey.
<P>
I have a few points to make, some of which were fired mainly by the contributions made by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford to the debate. My first point concerns the Welsh border, for which I can claim a certain credibility alongside other Members of the Committee, not all of whom represent English constituencies. My wife is Welsh.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Can my hon. Friend tell the Committee whether his mother to whom he referred this morning is Welsh and also say whether his mother-in-law is Welsh?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The answer is: mother-in-law, yes; mother, no. Her maiden name is Jones, so I leave Members of the Committee to speculate further on that. However, I shall not get on to the subject of rugby football.
<P>
It is germane to our discussions to remember that not only Severn Trent Water operates into Wales and has a large part of its facilities there, but that Hyder--I hope that I pronounced that correctly; I think that I was using the Greek pronunciation rather than the Welsh--operates in England. It is important to emphasise the intermingling of the two economies and also the grave difficulties that would be posed if they operated under different devolutionary regimes. I shall not linger on that subject now; I simply wanted to say that, surprisingly, the companies are being penalised as the briefing that we have received shows.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) talked about the environment, a matter on which we have similar views. I share his wish for the water companies to have the highest possible environmental standards. By that I mean both service standards--such as quality of water, leakage control and so forth, which are important--and their long-term green commitment, which is strong. Severn Trent Water has briefed us, but I also have experience from my constituency of Anglian Water and Thames Water, both of which have considerable environmental interests.
<P>
All I would say on the assumption that it is possible to take money out of a company, certainly on anything like this scale, without doing something to that company, is that the effects are likely to be on areas of comparatively soft expenditure, further away from formal economic regulation--the bits one can get away with or postpone. That is more likely to have a long-term effect on the development of those programmes, so there will be a differential impact on those areas.
<P>
I want to say something about the National Grid company. One reason I did not intervene earlier is that I am not an expert in the electricity system. But it is interesting that the list that the Government compiled does not refer to the National Grid company. The Government's justification for that is that the regional electricity companies would suffer because they are shareholders in the grid. However, there is a certain logical inconsistency in that the Government are, in effect, penalising the grid through the regional electricity companies, while trying to say that that makes no difference to shareholders, whether they are companies or individuals. Both arguments cannot be sustained comfortably together. Clearly, there is an effect and the Government realises that.
<P>
I was interested in the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford, who has now left the Room. I shall reiterate the point that he was making. The Government have drafted the clause to target certain companies and presented those companies as categories, the effect of which--if not formally hybrid, as Madam Speaker has ruled--is nevertheless highly partial. I suggest that it is quasi-hybrid.
<P>
My next point is on non-regulated business--the subject of the amendment--as opposed to regulated business. Much of this debate has been about the inequity of the treatment of a regulated business within the categories in the Bill and that of another business that undertakes similar services outwith those categories. My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold gave the example of a private water service company privatised before the Water Act 1989, which would be unscathed by the tax, and a major new privatised company, which would be affected by it.
<P>
It seems possible to argue--if I were a lawyer, I should be more interested in doing so--that the inequity lies not so much in that difference of treatment, although it is real, as in the conduct of a series of unregulated activities by a water or other utility company and the conduct of similar activities by another company. The plain fact is that, however the money was acquired--the Government may adduce arguments about that later--if Hyder or Anglian Water runs a hotel, it does so in competition with other organisations. Those organisations may be companies which have no connection to the utilities and also run hotels. The same would also be true if they were running retail activities. All that should be taken into account as a principle of law; it should be done on all fours.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my hon. Friend think that, as a result of the Government's not accepting the amendment, there will be pressures on the companies involved to split their regulated activities and their non-regulated activities into different companies? If so, would the regulated utility be disadvantaged because it could not use the profits from the non-regulated activity?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed, that would be a further erosion of their capital base and of their ability to sustain some of the activities that we discussed. In any case, that decision should be taken by the company board on commercial and prudential grounds; it should not be enforced by regulation. It is possible that the Paymaster General will come back and say, ``It is too late; there is no point in shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted,'' in which case some of us will want to argue in a subsequent debate that, because the windfall tax has been set aside for a programme that is continuing and which is not likely to diminish in cost, there is a real risk that, in three or four years' time, the Paymaster General will ask for another tax. It will not be called the windfall tax; knowing the Labour party these days, it will be called the new windfall tax. If I were a board member of one of the privatised utilities that is the subject of the attacks in the clause and the schedule, I would seriously consider whether I might divest myself--not necessarily for commercial reasons but so as to protect the assets of future shareholders.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Does that not raise another issue about the Budget in that so many consequences arise from the Bill, including clause 19, that the Government did not intend and have not thought through? The privatised utilities have to change their whole way of investment and their business and commercial decisions simply on the basis of the clause. There are countless examples in the Bill of such unintended, unforeseen consequences, which will have an indirect effect on commercial activity in this country. The Government have pushed the Bill through so rapidly that they have not considered those consequences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I largely understand and agree with those sentiments. Having been in the House in different capacities for several years, I can say that it is not the first time that a Labour Government have done that. People who legislate in haste repent at leisure--as do the taxpayers. There is always a propensity to go hammer and tongs at legislation and not worry too much about the people whom one damages in the process.
<P>
The Opposition have sought to explain the inequities that will inevitably occur, however well the Paymaster General thinks he has drawn his legislation. We think that the Committee should be made aware of those inequities and that the Government should reflect on them. I remain hopeful that the Government will be sensitive to some of the points that we have raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that the Opposition have collectively made the case for the Government? The reason why the Government are moving ahead with the legislation and not disciminating as between regulated and non-regulated activities in the same company is to avoid the tax evasion that you described--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should like to draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that we do not refer to members of the Committee as ``you''. If the hon. Gentleman says ``you'', that means me, the Chairman. Would the hon. Gentlman dress his language in proper parliamentary garb and address the hon. Member for Daventry in the third person?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am sorry, Mrs. Winterton. I was aware of that but forgot; I have a slight problem with short-term memory loss, it appears.
<P>
The point that I was trying to make without falling foul of parliamentary rules was a simple one: if the Government introduced legislation that conveyed the message to a privatised utility, ``Don't worry, you won't get taxed if you push all your money overnight into Welsh hotels,'' that would be a fairly obvious source of evasion. The hon. Member for Daventry said earlier that that is how such things may be approached. The reason that this case is slightly different is that it is a one-off windfall tax.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Member for Daventry replies, may I ask that a leg be removed from a desk? I am most grateful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> May I first point out--I am sure that this was a slip of the tongue--that the hon. Gentleman referred to evasion. Nobody is in the business of evasion, and we certainly do not condone it. I think that he is talking about avoidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> That is what I meant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I accept that; that slip of the tongue is easily made. I am more concerned with the hon. Gentleman's substantive point.
<P>
It is genuinely surprising that none of the privatised utilities, which the hon. Gentleman seeks to castigate, has hit on the idea of separating themselves into two. I ask the Paymaster General a careful hypothetical question: if one of them had so done, what would he have done about it? He would then have been trying to attack a company that had no connection with economic regulation, and he would not have been able to tackle it with the windfall tax.
<P>
What may well happen is that the privatised companies will learn a lesson. Despite the confidence of the hon. Member for Croydon, Central--I respect his enthusiasm but have some doubt about whether he is being naive--it is more than possible when the money runs out that the Paymaster General will be back for more. If he is, he may find that companies have prudently taken action not for commercial reasons but to protect themselves from future depredations.
<P>
It is the capricious nature of the depredation of the tax that really sticks in our throats, and that is why I hope that we shall be advised to press the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I should like to make two brief points following on from what my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said earlier about why the national grid was exempted, which is just another example of the entire inconsistency and arbitrariness of the windfall tax.
<P>
Is not it true that Southern Electricity, for example, earned more than 10 per cent. of its profits in the past five years from dividends from the national grid, but is now to be taxed ex the national grid, and the national grid will not be taxed at all? No wonder the regional electricity companies throughout the country are jumping up and down and saying how unfair is the way in which tax is being levied. There is an enormous incongruity in the way that the National Grid Company has been treated--which, I must say before I get nasty telephone calls from directors of that company, is not to say that I favour its being walloped. That goes to show, however, that there is no conformity in the levying of the tax. The Government wanted to hit the privatised companies; they did not much care how they did it; they have dressed it up as a windfall tax for a welfare-to-work design.
<P>
Another point that arose during one of the frequent interventions on an intervention from the hon. Member for Croydon, Central goes to the heart of what the windfall tax is all about. The next target--as has already been hinted at in the Budget--is dividends. The hon. Gentleman asked what was the difference between taking money out of a privatised company through taxation and money coming out of that company through dividends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> May I just say that I did not say that?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) had the floor; he did not give way to you, Mr. Davies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Winterton. I apologise if I have misinterpreted one of the many interventions made by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central, but may I explain to Labour Members that the point of paying dividends is to induce shareholders to invest in shares? It is a principle of the secondary market that it is the other function of the stock market to put up further capital for the purposes of expansion, takeover, or whatever. That is entirely true of the privatised utilities during the 1980s and 1990s, which needed to raise further capital on the market to expand and to finance costly environmental improvement programmes to fulfil the privatisation conditions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend is an expert on how the market works. Does he agree with me that another adverse effect of the windfall tax will be that to make good the shortfall in their share prices, which will undoubtedly be necessary in the next year or two, companies may be forced to pay higher dividends in order to increase the share price, which will reduce still further their ability to reinvest?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. I do not wish to appear a kind of Celt basher--I am not able to name one member of my family from west of Offa's Dyke--but I fear that a classic case in point is that of the Welsh utilities before they merged to become Hyder. Because of disastrous expansion in areas in which they did not have competence, their share price fell back. The management, quite rightly, was selectively booted out, and the only thing that kept the share price up and the company on an even keel to provide a service to its consumers was the dividend that it paid. My hon. Friend is right: it had to pay a higher dividend to make the shares more attractive to its investors.
<P>
I am surprised at what the hon. Member for Croydon, Central, said, as he has some experience of business. In his company, a large, multinational division of Unilever, secondary capital was raised on the market, whether it was for takeovers, to expand research and development or for further research into ways in which that company could avoid the hon. Gentleman's Y-fronts being shredded in the Zanussi. That was a case in point because of the inadequacies of some of its products. The point I am trying to make is that it is all to do with improving the product or the service that the companies offer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> As a point of information--I am not going to bring up my Y-fronts--the comments to which the hon. Gentleman alluded earlier were not made by me. I did not come directly from Unilever to Parliament but started my own business in the meantime. The comments about Hanson and Zanussi are not therefore particularly relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am delighted to be better informed. Mine is a general point, that whether it is a private company or a public company, the stock market exists in a secondary function to raise capital for all manner of things. That is a prime reason why companies pay dividends. I am disappointed that Labour Members do not appear to recognise the stock market's very important function on behalf of companies, be they long-standing private industries or recently privatised.
<P>
It goes to the heart of the matter that Labour Members appear to have a fundamental problem about companies that make profits and companies that pay out part of those profits to shareholders who risk their capital in the first place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> We have had a good-humoured debate on the amendment, which is the first that has had some substance, on which I congratulate the Opposition.
<P>
In his opening remarks before lunch, the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) gave a general account of the merit of the amendment. I shall deal with matters that have arisen in contributions from Opposition Members and my hon. Friends.
<P>
I shall speak first to the remarks of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) who is not in the Committee at present. I am sure that the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) will take note of what I say. The hon. Gentleman was concerned that separate accounts should continue to be kept by companies for the regulated activities for the purposes of supervision thereof by the regulator. I am sure that that will continue to be the case. He was also concerned that the regulatory function should continue to be renewed and appropriately adjusted in the light of future circumstances, and a statement was recently put out by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
<P>
The shadow Chancellor, the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), in the Committee of the House, made the point that when Conservatives were deciding how to regulate the activities of the various utilities they came to the conclusion that regulating companies and their profits was not the best method. Rather, they would regulate them by linking the price of the utility or its product to the retail prices index minus a certain factor. That is right. I do not want to say that there is great scope for avoidance or shifting of profits, less still that any company might have indulged in that activity. The simple fact is that the lack of consistency that might exist between the different companies' reporting of their accounts would lead to distortions in the comparative elements in the accounts. It is much clearer to go for the one thing that they have in common--relating their product to the index. That replies to that specific point.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has made two contributions to our debate--one before lunch and one afterwards. He made a remarkable statement to the effect that tax tends to fall more heavily on those who earn more or companies that generate more profit. I have to tell him that that is a sad fact of life. If the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford were here, I am sure that he would agree with me, from personal experience, that it is that way.
<P>
I can tell the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham that when in a prior existence I was looking at a company in the United States that I was thinking of buying, the poor guy was in dead schtook because he could not make a profit. He had not made a profit for years and he kept saying that he could not wait for the day when he would start paying thousands of dollars to Uncle Sam. The hon. Gentleman should reflect on that and perhaps he will then understand that this tax, like any tax, inevitably will be heavier on those who have made more profits. In this case, it will be heavier on those who have made more excess profits.
<P>
I say to my hon. Friends, who have probably, and understandably, been bombarded with representations from certain companies, that if we set out to tax an excess profit and define the companies that fall under that tax and the basis on which their excess profit is calculated--none of which has been remotely challenged, technically, legally or financially, by Opposition Members or the companies--we can do nothing more than impartially apply the principles and accept the results. It is as simple as that. If the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has not yet understood that the more he earns--I am sure he is not into evasion or avoidance--the more tax he will pay, and that must be so, he has basic lessons to learn about the way in which our tax system works.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman therefore suggesting that all companies should be taxed on exactly the same basis, regardless of what sector they are in, the risk profile of the investment that they must make in research and development, their present size and the profits they were making three or four years ago, as is the essence of the windfall tax?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The element of retrospection does not normally come into tax matters. We have justified it in this particular context. In all other respects, all rules apply to all companies except for the different rates that apply to small and large companies. Because the Government are so keen on enterprise and on stimulating investment and because we have such confidence in the economy, we have reduced both rates, one from 33 to 31 per cent., and the other from 23 to 21 per cent. Otherwise, tax applies to everybody equally and so it must. That is the essence of this tax and of taxation as a whole.
<P>
In general, companies that are very profitable are, if they are sensible, saying in their hearts, ``Thank God we are profitable and pay tax.'' If the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has never had the experience of being in dead schtook and making losses, I hope that he never will, because people in that position ache for the day when they can make profits and pay tax. That, I am afraid to say, is the very simple answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The hon. Gentleman has said something very interesting. He said that he had a mandate in this one specific instance to levy a retrospective excess profits tax. Does that mean that he would totally deplore any further attempts by the Government to introduce a retrospective windfall tax on the utilities or any other sector in the future?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman will find that there is an amendment that deals with that specific point--it is one of the few successes that his hon. Friends have had in addressing me--and we can leave the matter until then. The Government will then make a clear statement on the issue.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Murphy </B>(Eastwood): Will the hon. Gentleman give way? [Hon Members: ``H F.''] Sorry, my hon. Friend. I am going to concentrate my short-term and long-term memory on describing the Chairman, Mrs. Winterton.
<P>
Will my hon. Friend comment on two issues? First, he mentioned companies' aspirations to pay the tax, based on success and profits. There is a direct parallel between companies' aspirations and those of the young people who will benefit from the one-off windfall levy. Many of them are out of work and have limited opportunities. They aspire to a position of employment, in which they will pay tax as well.
<P>
Secondly, does my hon. Friend agree that no less a person than Graham Hawker, the chief executive of Hyder, has made a striking endorsement of our strategy? He is reported to have said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If such a tax is introduced, I cannot think of a better way to spend it''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>that is, on the welfare-to-work programme.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I give you the Floor again, Mr. Robinson, it would be helpful for the Committee to know that interventions should not be too long. They should be merely interventions, not speeches and should contain no more than perhaps one point. I would also be grateful if the Minister could address me, rather than the far side of the Committee and his colleagues behind him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I did not mean any discourtesy to you, Mrs. Winterton, and I apologise. I have a habit of addressing the person to whom I am speaking and I shall have to stop it. If I have scored a first in my parliamentary career, I am happy to have done so--I could not have done so in more elegant and charming company. [Interruption.] I am more used to addressing my left wing over my right shoulder than my right wing over my left.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Murphy) made a valid point in respect of Mr. Hawker's remarks and I could amplify them a little in reply to some of the points that hon. Members have raised. Mr. Hawker also said some other interesting things. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Customers are not bearing the burden of the windfall tax.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>He also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We intend to continue our programme of customer rebates and discretionary environmental investment.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Those are the words of the chief executive of what I am led to believe is one of the companies that feels that it will be badly hit by the tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green (Ashford):</B> I am glad that Labour Members have now got hold of the letter from Hyder, which was clearly sent to all Members of the Committee some days ago, and that they have now indulged in some selective quotation from it. The Minister has quoted Hyder as saying that the &#163;282 million will not come out of its customers' pockets. If that is so, does he agree that the only other place it will come out of is Hyder's investment programme? Does he agree that that will damage the provision of services to customers in the long run?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am grateful for yet another telling intervention. I can read only what Mr. Graham Hawker says. He can speak for himself far better than I can and he covers all the points that the hon. Gentleman raised in the statement that Hyder put out on 10 July. The statement says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``businesses continue to develop well''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and notes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Hyder Services continues ahead of plan''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``electricity businesses remain strong without cost reduction plans ahead of target.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the course of our discussions with the regulator, it was quite clear that, in his view, the tax would have no impact on customer service, investment programmes, reopening the price cap nor, in our judgment, employment. I know that that is difficult for Conservative Members to swallow, but what the regulator said to us is what Mr. Hawker is saying in respect of his company and what, using those sources, I am informing the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> In that much quoted letter, Mr. Hawker also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The windfall tax has produced an arbitrarily high tax on Hyder and is neither fair nor equitable.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Paymaster General agrees with much of what Mr. Hawker says. Does he agree with that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Hawker speaks for himself. I am sure that any of the affected companies would echo those sentiments. We have defined the companies and the excessive profit in a way that has been unchallenged and we have the results. In government--in public life in general--entering into any discrimination is the one thing that cannot be done, which is why I cannot understand why Conservative Members continue with the mantra, which was started by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), that the measure is arbitrary and discriminatory.
<P>
We have defined the category, established the basis for the tax and applied it utterly indiscriminately. That is the only basis upon which we could have proceeded, which is why the tax has been so well received and accepted in the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Before the intervention of the hon. Member for Eastwood disappears from the scene, does the Paymaster General know that the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Rochdale (Lorna Fitzsimons) are previous general secretaries of the National Union of Students? One or two matters connected with student loans are under discussion. Can the Paymaster General give an absolute and unequivocal assurance that, even in the case of students such as the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Lady--they are obviously upwardly mobile and have come good--or in the case of Conservative Members who were students, he will not, in any circumstances, impose a retrospective charge on student support mechanisms?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will be guided by you, Mrs. Winterton, as to whether that question can logically lie in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I had to set the question up for the Paymaster General--I could not communicate directly with the hon. Member for Eastwood, as he will appreciate.
<P>
My point is that, once one is in the business of levying retrospectively, and if there is a need to raise revenue--there clearly is in relation to higher education finance--it might be sensible to consider charging those who have benefited particularly. I am not canvassing that, but am just saying that such a charge might be consistent with the principles that the Paymaster General has adopted in relation to the windfall tax on the utilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman will have adequate opportunity to take up that highly relevant matter with my hon. Friends--they have distinguished pasts and even more distinguished futures ahead of them in the House. We are pleased that they are members of the Committee.
<P>
In passing, I should dispose of a small matter concerning the national grid which was raised by the hon. Members for East Worthing and Shoreham and for Daventry. Unlike the companies to which the tax applies, the national grid was not privatised by flotation, so it does not come within the category. Moreover, as the hon. Member for Daventry said, the directors received dividends: their profits were augmented by those dividends, so they became part of the windfall levy and were taxed as such. No great issue arises in that respect.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford talked about the incoherence of the tax and said that it was applied regardless of performance. I think that he will find his words accurately reported in Hansard. The fact is that, whether the hon. Gentleman accepts it or not, the tax is strictly related to performance which has been measured by the profit made over four years. The profits in the first four years--before the price cap came up for review--were measured against what was anticipated at the time of the privatisation. A price-to-earnings ration of nine was used and applied--totally impartially--to achieve a result.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman just cannot question that or say that it is not related to performance--of course, it is related precisely to performance. I have said this before and will say it again, painful though it is to have to reiterate it: the companies that have made more excess profits than others are taxed more on the same basis. That is clearly right.
<P>
My hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, Central and for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston), who both spoke successfully in the House, made some good points today. My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North referred to the consistency and simplicity of what we are doing. That is precisely right--the measure is consistent and simple. The adjectives that Opposition Members have sought to apply to it are totally wrong.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibbs:</B> Is it not the very simplicity of the calculations set out in schedule 1, which I want to talk about in the substantive debate, that makes the whole tax unfair? The Government have gone overboard in their attempts to keep it simple.
<P>
Given that the tax applies to fewer than a dozen companies, and given the huge quantity of tax that is paid by any one company, surely it is worth a little complexity to give a degree of fairness? The way in which the tax is calulated in the schedule gives rise to enormous unfairness. We have heard about Hyder, but there are countless other examples--for instance, applying the same price-to-earnings ratio to different industries is grossly unfair. Surely the Government could add one or two extra clauses to give different PE ratios; that would not be much more complex, but it would be fairer. The very simplicity makes the tax unfair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am grateful for that intervention, but I am sad to say that if the hon. Gentleman--who I think is an accountant, or has affinities with that profession--checks the list, he will see that the number of companies is more than 30, not fewer than a dozen. If he can multiply his concept of complexity by one third then perhaps, on reflection, he will agree with me that simplicity has great merits, throughout life and in this situation in particular.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the advantage of complexity is that it provides all sorts of opportunities for tax avoidance and a lot of income to accountants?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I entirely agree. That is precisely why we cannot accept--though we are a long way from it--amendment No. 30. It would lead us in an unacceptable direction. It is also why we had to reject the recent intervention of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb).
<P>
The hon. Member for Maldon and Chelmsford, East has a most illustrious predecessor in his role as a talking Whip; to a lesser extent, as Paymaster General, I have an illustrious predecessor in a certain other former Minister who will remain nameless. The talking Whip to whom I refer--I am sure that you will correct me if I am wrong, Mrs. Winterton--who accepted the position as Whip on the condition that he could talk, is Lord Lawson. Those of us who had to sit and listen to his risible--in some senses--contributions know that he began a good tradition.
<P>
Lord Lawson, however, never in my presence gave such an almighty plug to any one company as the hon. Member for Maldon and Chelmsford, East did. What happened in the year of intimate exchanges between the hon. Gentleman and National Power, I shall leave to them to explain. In the end, I was not quite sure what point the hon. Gentleman was trying to make. It is clear that National Power has been able widely--and successfully--to diversify its activities. That brings us back to the heart of the clause, to which I shall return in a moment.
<P>
For someone as allegedly professionally competent as the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford to say that if a company is floated without any gearing and then gears up, it means that it was not undersold, is manifest nonsense. Of course it was. It is precisely that undervaluation at the point of sale that we are going to tax via these proposals.
<P>
National Power is delighted at how well it is doing. We hope that it and other such companies will continue to do well. They know that our best wishes are with them, but they also know that they had a damned good deal when they were privatised--they all know that it was a rip-off, but they all benefited from it. All that we are now doing--as you, Mrs. Winterton, would wish us to do--is to claw back for the state that which should have been put in the gearing on sale or in the price at the point of sale.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward)--I am not sure how many other Opposition Members have affinities with the other side of Offa's dyke--raised a point about a particular company, which he should find has been adequately dealt with now.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold raised several points about bids. We shall doubtless move on to that matter later. The hon. Gentleman spoke about competitiveness and the need for regulation: he welcomed a tight regulatory role and bemoaned the fact that there had not been sufficiently tight regulation. If he believes that, he should be voting with us because we are putting right what was wrong before. I shall therefore observe with great interest how the hon. Gentleman will vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I have some affinity with Wales, although it is not a personal link. I cannot claim that my mother, my wife or anyone else in my family is responsible--but I shall be doing more research on that later this evening. My affinity comes from the fact that we used to live in a house that looked over the river Severn into Wales: that is why I am so fond of it.
<P>
I raised the question about Hyder earlier this morning and I look forward to hearing the hon. Gentleman's response. The company is at a loss to understand why it was singled out in that way. As quotes have already been taken from Graham Hawker, let me add another:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The method of levying the windfall tax is exceptionally harsh on Hyder and Wales.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not know what it is that the Government have against the Welsh, but parts of their legislative programme certainly seem to be against them. Undoubtedly, Mr. Walker does not understand why Hyder is expected to pay so much when British Telecom, by comparison, is expected to stump up only &#163;500 million. Many hon. Members and many people in the country will also be at a loss to understand why a company the size of British Telecom is faced with a bill of &#163;500 million, while a company the size of Hyder is faced with a bill that is only about half that sum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman made a similar contribution before. The simple fact is that if he wants to challenge the basis on which we have constructed and applied the tax, he is free to do so. For the moment, we have decided the basis, the application and the concept and we shall apply them in a non-discriminatory manner. That is precisely what we have done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I wonder whether my hon. Friend has had the chance to consider the Ofwat annual report published yesterday. It stated that as a result of the acquisition of Swalec by Hyder:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Savings have turned out to be much more than expected and shareholders' dividends have risen. There has been no corresponding cut in bills.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does my hon. Friend agree that that quotation supports his argument?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. That is precisely the point that I was coming to and it provides the appropriate response to the hon. Member for Witney.
<P>
If we took into account only the profits of the regulated company, we would not have taxed the full windfall that resulted from companies having been sold too cheaply and having been subject to regulation that was initially too lax. Companies may have used their profits to invest in subsidiaries--as some have done--or to acquire a new business, which many have also done. To take account of the whole of the privatisation windfall, we must take the profits of the whole group into account. That is our fundamental view and the fundamental justification for our position. Any other approach would allow part of the benefits of company windfalls to remain untaxed and we cannot accept that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I appreciate that my speech was somewhat fragmented due to the numerous interventions from Labour Members. One important question that I asked the hon. Gentleman was whether he could give the Committee an assurance that the imposition of the windfall tax would not result in pressure for the current tight regulatory regime to be eased.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> That matter, as the hon. Gentleman knows, is already being dealt with by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's comments reflect the situation and will be taken into account. The regulatory regime must continue to act in an appropriate and tough way on the companies. The Government have made it clear that the tax has no bearing on the arrangements for the future regulatory regime agreed between the Department of Trade and Industry and the regulated companies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Bruce </B>(Gordon): The Paymaster General is clear about the purpose of the tax and why he cannot accept the amendment. The Government have not ruled out the possibility of future privatisations and will have to determine their flotation value. If they undervalue, as they say that the previous Government did--and I agree with that--how can the hon. Gentleman give an assurance that that would not be used as a justification for making a similar calculation at a later date?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> We have made it clear that this is a one-off tax on clearly described companies for a clearly limited period on a clearly defined basis. It is a one off, and will remain a one off.
<P>
We cannot accept amendment No. 30 because to do so would leave untaxed part of the essential windfall profit that we are rightly seeking to tax.
<H4><center>[Mr. McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): This has been rather a good debate, Mr. McWilliam, partly in your absence but not because of it. [Laughter.] We have covered a great deal of ground and it has been useful in getting to grips with schedule 1 and finding out the Government's intention.
<P>
Interventions from both sides of the Committee have been relatively constructive. I was particlarly pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and Chelmsford, East broke the customary vow of silence that goes with being a Whip. As the Paymaster General said, he was not the first to do so. The noble Lord Lawson started the trend and, nearer to home, I recollect the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) making lively contributions in previous Finance Bill Committees on classic cars. Indeed, he helped to build them earlier in his life--that is how he earned his living before being elected to the House. So there is a good tradition of talking and talkative Whips, and I hope that my hon. Friend will persist.
<P>
The main point to emerge from the debate is the unfairness of the way in which the companies are to be taxed. I refer not just to the core businesses where excess profits are alleged to have been made, but more generally to all the other businesses in the competitive world into which they have diversified since privatisation.
<P>
The Paymaster General said that it was entirely fair and proper that the tax should be levied according to the ability of such companies to pay. Therefore, the more successful and profitable companies should pay more. However, that ignores the issue of how the profits have been made. Surely the thinking behind the tax is that it should be levied on a certain sort of profit in a certain sort of company.
<P>
The Government maintain that the privatised utilities made too much money out of their main businesses, whether that was selling or distributing electricity, selling water or running a telecommunications network.
<H4><center>[Mrs. Winterton in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
In fact, schedule 1 goes much wider and will levy the windfall tax on all the varied activities and businesses carried out by these companies. The Paymaster General could at least have acknowledged the success of those companies in diversifying since privatisation. Privatisation released those companies' business and financial skills and took them into new activities for the benefit of their customers, work forces and shareholders. The Government also benefited because taxes were paid on those profits. Many water companies became involved in toxic waste management and treatment. That is a higly competitiveness business, which is not--and does not need to be--regulated. It would be absurd to try to regulate the prices charged by new subsidiary companies that take on new business interests.
<P>
Not only water companies, but electricity companies, took on associated areas of profitable activities. Some--but not all--of those companies succeeded. The problem with schedule 1 is that it sweeps all profits, from wherever they have come and however they have been made, into one formula. The schedule provides that one published profit should include all such operations, and levies a single tax.
<P>
The general thrust of what the hon. Member for Dudley, North said in an earlier contribution was that it was impossible to discover the profits arising from those diversified activities. In fact, one reason regulators for many such industries differentiate between core businesses and others is to stop the customers of mainstream activities paying for losses elsewhere. Regulators felt that, if those diversifications failed, it would be wrong for customers--be they water or electricity customers--to pay for those failures. The regulators go through the accounts or books of those companies to ensure that that is not happening. The various profits can be separated out and regulators can discover those profits' origins.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the profits shown in the Companies Acts' accounts are different from the profits shown to the regulators?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That may or may not be the case, but it does not invalidate my point. Schedule 1 could supply a different formula--one that requires companies or, indeed, regulators, to submit profits for each diversified company, as well as for the core activities. Those management accounts could be made available to auditors for inspection and could form the basis of a fairer tax that does not levy a windfall tax on other activities that take place in the general market-place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> Can the right hon. Gentleman think of any other examples of a tax being levied on management accounts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am giving an example of what could be done. The Government could ask for management accounts and have them audited--in other words, upgrade them to the level of statutory accounts. In any case, the regulators must satisfy themselves that the core activities are separated for profit-making purposes from other activities. The information should be available. I do not know whether regulators should use management accounts or call for a different type of statutory account, but the information exists and the schedule could incorporate that proposal.
<P>
The diversifications are highly varied, but I do not want the Committee to think that everything that those companies touch turns to gold. In South America, some water companies had ill-judged ventures in water purification and treatment.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In an earlier incarnation as a Foreign Office Minister, I travelled frequently to that continent, where I was pleased to see British privatised companies--previously state monopolies--looking and bidding for business. One example I chanced upon involved a water company that was bidding for an unpleasant contract to clean up the river flowing through Sao Paulo. People who have been to Sao Paulo will know that it is not only the largest, but the most polluted city in that hemisphere. It was said of the river that if a match were thrown into it, it would catch fire and if someone fell into it, he would not drown but dissolve. Cleaning up the river was a fairly formidible undertaking which, I was later told, had a sad outcome.
<P>
Not all the ventures of British privatised companies succeeded, but it was good to see their efforts to obtain business outside their core activities and outside this country. A more successful example, which I mentioned earlier, is that of Yorkshire Electricity. It made a &#163;17 million profit from an investment in Sweden. Clearly that business in Sweden was not regulated--how could it be? We would have no business regulating Swedish electricity prices. We should, however, be glad that a British company, probably using British engineers, is satisfying electricity consumers in Sweden to the benefit of the companies involved, their shareholders and, indeed, of the man who receives the taxes because diversified profits are subject to corporation tax in the normal way.
<P>
Another example of a successful diversification is that of British Gas. It moved into the world market and bought a share in a distribution company in Buenos Aires, which I saw when I was there. British Gas bid for an enormous project to take gas from Argentina into Santiago in Chile. Those who have been to Santiago will know that a pall of polluted air hangs over it as a result of burning dirty fuels. Heating Santiago by burning clean gas brought in from the other side of the Andes would bring an environmental benefit to the world as well as benefiting British shareholders and employees of an important British company. Under the formula set out in the Bill, that company will be taxed on its entire profit. That is what is unfair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> United Utilities diversified abroad, and it made a profit of 16&#183;5 per cent. last year. Hyder made a profit of 24 per cent. Is the right hon. Gentleman suggesting that such companies will experience hardship?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes. If a British company--whether privatised or not--makes a great deal of money out of a successful foreign venture, that money should not be subject to a windfall tax. The hon. Gentleman's proposition--that just because a company makes a large sum of money from a foreign contract, the Government can say, ``Corporation tax is not enough; we are going to levy a windfall tax''--is extraordinary. It is preposterous. I do not believe--as the Government do--that a windfall tax on core profits is justified, but if we must have the tax, other activities should be kept separate from it and not subjected to it. That is the purpose of our amendment.
<P>
Most diversified companies were set up after privatisation--they have nothing to do with the original flotation. Their success is a result of the release of the skill and enterprise of management staff after privatisation. Their success has nothing to do with underpricing or assets released at that time.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons </B>(Rochdale): Surely the logic of the right hon. Gentleman's argument is somewhat flawed. The companies accrued a huge profit from appropriate gearing and beneficial tax write-offs--no one has mentioned the green dowry that the water industry received--and they scattered it throughout the world; they did not invest it in their core business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> In an earlier exchange with the hon. Lady I pointed out that water companies invested large sums in their antique and run-down plants, which they inherited from the state. Frankly, the water industry suffered from decades of neglect in the state sector. The enterprise and energy of those working in the companies were released only when those companies moved into the private sector; they also gained access to the capital markets, in order to make the necessary investments.
<P>
We contend that levying the tax will be unfair. The Institute for Fiscal Studies described the windfall tax as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an arbitrary capital levy that falls on a group of shareholders in the utility companies, whether or not those individuals have earned high returns.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is bad enough, but it would be much worse if that arbitrary levy were also levied on non-core businesses, which need not--and should not--be penalised in that way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 50, line 20, leave out `sub-paragraphs (3) and (4)' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`sub-paragraph (4) and paragraph 6(3)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 3 and 4.
<P>
For the benefit of new Members, that procedure means that if there is a debate, they can contribute on all three amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> These are technical amendments which I hope will be passed with good grace by the Opposition. I announced in the Budget debate on 4 July that we would introduce an amendment intended to ensure that our policy of using only post-privatisation profits to calculate the amount on which the windfall tax is charged will be implemented as intended. I am sure that that intention commands the Committee's general support.
<P>
The windfall tax is charged on the difference between the value of a company calculated by reference to its profits and the value placed on it at the time of its flotation. The profits taken into account are normally those of the first four financial years after flotation, as has been said several times today already. Where a company was privatised too recently to have had four full financial years after flotation, a shorter period is used, taken from flotation to the end of the last financial year ending before 1 April 1997.
<P>
Where a financial year straddles flotation, the legislation provides for the profits of that year to be apportioned on a time basis to exclude profits attributable to the part of the year before flotation. However, it is possible in some cases for time apportionment to give an unfair result. That is where it would effectively bring into the calculation of the taxable amount a proportion of profits that properly relate to the period before privatisation.
<P>
The amendment provides for an alternative method of apportionment where a simple time apportionment would not produce a just and reasonable result. It provides for profits to be apportioned between the two parts of the year on the basis of how they actually accrued over the period, where that is fairer. That will ensure that profits attributable to that part of the year when the company was still in the public sector are not inadvertently taken into account.
<P>
I think that my remarks have been explicit enough to explain to all members of the Committee precisely what we are trying to do through the amendments. They do not impose a single solution on the companies involved, but give them the opportunity, when the full four years stipulation does not apply, to bring forward their reasons for using one or the other of two methods.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The amendment is an example of what we complained about on the Floor of the House. The Bill has been put together in short order following the general election and presented to the House. It is badly drafted and it contains some serious mistakes. These are not simple drafting errors that can be corrected during the Bill's course through all its stages, but defects that go to the heart of the windfall tax.
<P>
I should have expected the Minister to be a little more contrite in introducing such a significant group of amendments, which are an admission that the Government failed to get the Bill's drafting right. We are dealing with important large companies that have many thousands of shareholders. We required a little more explanation of how the mistake arose.
<P>
We are receiving many complaints from outside bodies about the Bill's drafting and the way in which it is being rammed through the House, and I should like to quote one or two of them. I am a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, but it is not for that reason that I give some prominence to what that body has said. The institute's first words on the Bill are:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are concerned about the very limited time that was allowed to consider the details of the Bill . . . . . we think it particularly important that adequate time is allowed to permit those outside parliament to identify potential problems and drafting difficulties and draw these to the attention of the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise so that, where necessary, Government amendments can be brought forward at Committee stage. This is clearly not possible on this occasion.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It points out that both main political parties--the point was recently emphasised by the Government--want to simplify legislation and make it more accessible to the tax-paying public.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The institute continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Enacting legislation after inadequate consideration is bound to create problems . . . representative bodies such as ourselves need several weeks to obtain views from our members, sift them to highlight the problem areas and discuss them with the tax authorities. A shorter time scale means that we are forced to rely on initial swift reactions to the Bill, which not only cannot identify all of the practical issues that more prolonged consideration inevitably brings to light but can waste time on areas which a deeper understanding of the Bill shows not to be problematic after all.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The same line of criticism was made by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland, which stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is very little time for considered, informed debate in a timescale which results in the Finance Bill being published and the Open Day for Customs and Excise being held on one day, the Indland Revenue Open Day on the following day and the passage of the Bill through Parliament in approximately two weeks. We are concerned about legislation being drafted and enacted in such a hasty fashion.
<P>
</UL></FONT>	We have yet to conduct a full and rigorous analysis of the proposed legislation but we trust there will be scope and time, if necessary, to remedy any deficiences in the next Finance Bill.''
<P>
Finally, the Institute of Taxation stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are also extremely concerned at the short amount of parliamentary time allocated to discussing the Bill.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Three of the major institutes which have traditionally always made a large and helpful contribution to our proceedings have complained of the inadequacy of the time allocated for parliamentary scrutiny. They state that the problem is not simply the hours that the House of Commons has allocated, but the compressed time scale. There is simply no time for outside bodies to engage constructively in detailed drafting, to make known their reservations, to publish their criticisms or suggestions and to have them considered by the Government and the Standing Committee. All who are interested in good Government and proper drafting of legislation should be worried by the comments to which I have referred.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): Would the hon. Gentleman like to read out paragraph 6 of the memorandum from the Institute of Chartered Accountants, and will he tell us whether in his long experience in this place any Finance Bill has ever been unamended by the Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Of course, and that is why I referred to drafting amendments, which are a perfectly normal part of our proceedings. I would expect such amendments, but the amendments before us are not trivial drafting amendments to tighten a clause here or clarify a schedule there. They are designed to make a major change to the way that important British companies are to be taxed. When Parliament uses the coercive power of taxation, it must be careful. Parliament arose as an institution to remove from the king the power of arbitrary taxation. It is Parliament's important function to ensure that taxation is imposed fairly and after proper consideration and consultation with those who are affected by it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> Is it not true that the previous Government introduced 170 amendments to last year's Finance Bill and redrafted an entire section?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I do not want to repeat myself too often, but I was saying that it is not the number of amendments that should worry a Committee--all Bills require amendments--but the significance and size of those amendments. It is one thing for a Government to tidy up a clause in order to correct and improve legislation--
<P>
Mr. Twigg: rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am answering the hon. Gentleman's point, if he will contain himself. When I have done so, I shall gladly give way again.
<P>
It is quite another thing to table a substantial amendment, such as this, without having properly consulted outside bodies and interests. That is why I read out the concerns expressed by outside institutes that have clearly not been consulted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman really suggesting that the tabling of 170 amendments is trivial?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I was not on the Committee that considered last year's Finance Bill but I did sit on Committees that considered the three Finance Bills before that, so I am familiar with the way in which Governments introduce legislation and accept amendments. Sometimes, they accept amendments on substantive issues raised by hon. Members. That is one of the Committee's functions. But I am slightly surprised that the hon. Gentleman is already excusing a mistake on such a scale and rushing forward legislation without consultation when a longer time scale would have been not only appropriate but entirely possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I was a member of the Commitee that considered last year's Finance Bill, and it is true that the Government tabled many amendments. But the fundamental difference between this year's and last year's procedure is that, last year, there was plenty of time to study those amendments, although there were many of them. Would not my right hon. Friend agree that the work of the Committee on this particular Bill, being a Finance Bill, is more important that the work of any other Committee because the other place has no power to amend Finance Bills?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend makes a telling point. In general, we do not have a unicameral system because we recognise the importance of legislation being subjected to the scrutiny of two Houses of Parliament. For money Bills and Finance Bills, however, we effectively have a unicameral system. Therefore, the obligation on the House of Commons and the Committee is greater.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that the likely consequence of the undue haste with which the Bill is being considered is that, in months and years to come, people will look back on the Finance Bill and say that it had fewer amendments than other Finance Bills and was, therefore, technically one of the worst Finance Bills? As a result, there will be too few amendments. [Laughter.] Labour Members may laugh, but these tax changes will affect companies, employment and people's jobs. If taxes are put into effect inefficiently because non-political, expert bodies have not had time properly to brief Commiteee members and contribute their expertise, it is likely that this Finance Bill will be one of the worst.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. We should at least be grateful for the fact that the deficiency giving rise to the amendment was spotted and has apparently been corrected. There would be more cause for concern if, having scrutinised the Bill, it transpired that problems were arising in our wake, possibly identified by outside bodies who, only at that stage, engaged on the substance of the Bill.
<P>
I do not want to be too critical of Government amendments in general because it is the Committee's job to try to improve legislation. In the usual course of a Finance Bill, amendments are tabled and accepted or rejected, but it is not normal procedure for amendments to be necessary as a result of the haste with which the legislation is prepared and presented to the House of Commons, and the compressed way in which it is rammed through on a guillotine motion, so that the Committee must sit on successive days. I am afraid that my close memory of these Committees only goes back as far as 1983, but I cannot remember a Committee sitting on successive days. Not only is it inconvenient for hon. Members that we are sitting on a Friday but, far more significantly, it is difficult for outside institutes--tax bodies and organisations such as the Law Society--to keep up with the progress through Committee of this important Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Member for Dudley, North referred to paragraph 6 of the Institute of Chartered Accountants representations, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We welcome the proposals to consult on changes that will be in the next Budget. We feel it important that such consultation starts quickly and results in the publication of draft legislation at an early date so as to minimise the period of uncertainty.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Is it not ironic that, in their first Budget, the Government--who waxed lyrical about their Green Budget proposals and the fact that they would consult--have given zero time for consulting such bodies? That is an appalling start to their period in office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> One of the things that we used frequently to hear from the Labour party in Opposition was the need to expose draft clauses before they were enacted to those who would be affected. This Government have indeed suggested that Budgets and Bills should be exposed, at least in part, so that they can be subjected to consultation. Why, then, at their first opportunity to deliver on all those pious hopes, have they failed to do so in such a spectacular way? They are pushing through the Bill on a guillotine motion with only 12 days between its publication and the completion of consideration in Committee. During the 18 years that we were in office, there was an average of 77 days between publication and the end of the Committee stage. That gave a great deal more time both for the House of Commons and for those outside to enagage constructively in improving the proposed legislation, which ought to be the aim of any Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): Perhaps I should remind the right hon. Gentleman of comments that I made on the Floor of the House namely that the timetable for this Finance Bill is identical to that for the 1993 Finance Bill under the Conservative Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I listened to the debates on the timetable motion. What is indisputably true is that the Government have, in their first two months, introduced three timetable motions, which is a much higher average than that during our 18 years in office. If they go on like that, they will use up their entire 18-year quota in their first six months. Is that what the hon. Gentleman suggests should happen?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> The right hon. Gentleman knows that I am not suggesting that. I am saying that the time scale of this Finance Bill is identical to that of the 1993 Finance Bill under the Conservative Government, of which I think the right hon. Gentleman was a member.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I remember the criticisms that were levelled at us by the then Opposition. I realise that the hon. Gentleman was not present at that time--he is a new Member, whom we very much welcome to the Committee--but he seems to be suggesting that all the criticisms that were voiced and ventilated by those who now inhabit the Treasury Bench were hypocritical, because the Government have failed at their first opportunity to correct what they then saw as an inadequate timetable. I am not clear whether the hon. Gentleman is trying to excuse what is happening now or whether he is suggesting that the criticisms that were levelled at that time were invalid.
<P>
<B>Mr Caplin:</B> rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will make further points in his own time, as I think that we have almost exhausted this one.
<P>
I want to end on a relatively constructive note. We shall not in future be critical of improving amendments, but we shall be vigilant about Government amendments that are tabled as a result of the undue haste not only of the Bill's progress through the House of Commons but of the preparation time. The Government cannot have had longer than from 1 May to First Reading to frame this legislation. To compound that speed by giving the Bill a swift passage through the House leaves us wide open to the allegation that we are legislating in haste. We therefore want to ensure that the end product conforms to the high standards to which we all strive.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> Could the right hon. Gentleman clear up the confusion that has arisen both from his comments and from those of the hon. Member for Ashford? I am not sure whether the criticism is that there are too many amendments or too few. Since my hon. Friend the Paymaster General signalled his intentions vis-a-vis the amendment clearly on 4 July, does the right hon. Gentleman agree there has been as ample time to consider it, just as there has been time to consider other features of the Bill that were outlined in the Budget statement?

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Our criticism is that we warned that the introduction of an important Finance Bill so soon after the general election would create problems--both in terms of drafting and in terms of encapsulating in a single Finance Bill all that the Government wished to achieve--something that we regarded as unnecessary. The Government have made the problem worse by introducing a Bill that was prepared in haste and doing so at the run, so that defects and mistakes are less likely to be picked up in Committee. That is our double allegation. Naturally, we are glad when mistakes are spotted and corrected, and we shall want to ensure that no more mistakes occur as a direct result of the haste with which the Government have proceeded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have spent night after night in this Committee Room listening to members of the Opposition, as they then were, deliberately delaying the progress of Bills. A timetable then had to be agreed. The difference between those circumstances and the present situation is that, as stated in ``Erskine May'', a reasonable debate had taken place. The difference between then and now is that, in this case, the Government have agreed a timetable motion in advance of the debate, so we do not know whether proper time will be given to our proceedings on the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the Opposition spokesman, the right hon. Member for Wells, answers that point, may I say that many such arguments were advanced on Second Reading? We are debating Government amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 and perhaps we could stock to the content of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Indeed, Mrs. Winterton. I shall rest with the point that what we said would happen is happening, as evidenced by the mistake in the schedule.
<P>
Will the Paymaster General say which companies will be affected by the change in the legislation? The amendments may be the result of representations that were made by one energy company, but we must know which organisation spotted the mistake. Was it the Government? Was it the company concerned? Will only one company be affected by the changes or will others be affected? If so, have they been written to and alerted to the consequences?
<P>
I have a slightly more technical question to ask. When introducing the amendment, the Paymaster General said that it might be possible under the amended schedule for profits to be apportioned on the basis of the way in which they accrued over the financial year. I understand the reasoning behind that, but who will calculate the apportionment? Clearly, normal published accounts for a year, say to 31 March of any one year, do not show when during those 12 months certain profits were made, nor does a balance sheet--a snap shot of a company's affairs--give any more information.
<P>
Who is to decide what accounts are to be the basis for that apportionment, and will, for example, management accounts be used? The Paymaster General was rather dismissive of my suggestion that management accounts, duly audited, might form the basis of a different method of taxation of diversified activities. How, then, will the apportionment of what could be called a lumpy accrual or profits over the year be calculated to the satisfaction of the Inland Revenue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> Perhaps I may come immediately to the substantive point--indeed, to what was probably the only point made that was relevant. Three companies could be involved which might wish to choose between a time apportionment and an actual accrual of the profits. When I picked up on the right hon. Gentleman's reference to management accounts, he was suggesting that management accounts could be the basis for the tax. He did not say that they would be subject to the normal statutory review and accounting procedures that would make them statutory accounts. Accounts, including management accounts, get translated into statutory accounts. There is no problem in that respect.
<P>
In this instance, the companies that might be affected will, if they choose, opt for one of the systems. They will have due regard, with their auditors, as to how, in which months or over what period to account for their profits--although most companies account for their profits monthly. That has nothing to do with a balance sheet, which, as the right hon. Gentleman knows is a snapshot of the accounts and tells nothing of the incidence of profit. The companies would be able, with their accountants, to see when the profits accrued and take a decision about which system was better justified and fair.
<P>
I take it from the tenor of the right hon. Gentleman's remarks that the Opposition do not wish to proceed to a vote on the amendment. We welcome that, because the amendments are purely technical. Those companies whose accounting periods straddle the year--we do not want to take in pre-privatisation profits--have the option to take one or the other system as they see fit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> New paragraph (5)(b) refers to circumstances in which:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it would be just and reasonable to make the apportionment on the alternative basis.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase ``just and reasonable'' appears throughout tax legislation. I wonder whether the Government have considered further amendments to schedule 1, applying that ``just and reasonable'' basis to many of the unjust methodologies that currently exist. For example, could not companies decide to opt for a just and reasonable basis if their accountants determined that a P ratio of nine, or some other aspect of the schedule 1, was unfair? The Government should consider making further amendments to allow just and reasonable options.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Would it not also be reasonable to consider some of the anomalies between companies identified in an earlier debate? Clearly, one company is being charged a great deal more than might reasonably be expected as compared with its apparent competitors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> We discussed all those matters in Committee in the House, on Second Reading and in the debate on the guillotine motion. Yet again, the Opposition have tried to spin out debate and to justify their opposition to the guillotine. Instead of accepting that there should be a sensible debate in the Committee of the whole House and in Standing Committee, with time allocated to particular items that needed it, they chose the irrational course of forcing a guillotine motion.
<P>
All we have heard today, without exception, has been a rehashing--you yourself, Mrs. Winterton, have referred to it--of the arguments made on Second Reading and in the debate on the guillotine motion. There is no point in our going over those points again. It is well known to all hon. Members that certain circumstances give rise to certain sorts of Finance Bill. That is why, when the Opposition were in government, they guillotined the longest ever Finance Bill after it had spent only five hours in Committee. What would Erskine May have had to say about that? Perhaps we should get a spade, dig him up and ask him. May we please have some remarks that are relevant to our debate and to important amendments which are designed to give to the Bill the meaning that was initially intended, which are technical and which are therefore to be approved?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is working himself up into a lather of indignation about a guillotine that was imposed after a Bill had spent five hours in Committee, how indignant should he or the Committee be about a guillotine imposed after zero hours of consideration in Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> What a telling point! I recall the hon. Gentleman being present on and off during our debate on the guillotine motion, when we went through those very points. [Interruption] I may have been out of order, I do not know; I am not an expert on such matters, Mrs. Winterton.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. To correct the Paymaster General, I was present throughout that debate and spoke in it, although I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman was present throughout.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am delighted to hear that the hon. Gentleman was present, but he must be absent in his mind if he does not recall all the points which were made then and which he is rehashing now. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman did not hear the points I made although perhaps I should not repeat them as I am not wholly versed in the methods of the usual channels of the House. The fact is, however, that we could not get agreement on the period that we should have for the debate on the Bill. In such cases one has no option but to impose a guillotine. If the former Government had adopted that approach--
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Murphy:</B> I disagree with my hon. Friend. However, he should not be too alarmed, let me redeem myself by saying that I disagree with him only in the sense that I think we have had more than just rehashing from Opposition Members: we had the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) talking about his no doubt picturesque views of the River Severn; the right hon. Member for Wells talking about the rivers of Bogota; the hon. Member for Daventry--who has just, on cue, returned--talking about his mother's, his wife's and any other member of his family's Celtic credentials. In my opinion that is not rehashing but time wasting. The Opposition's protestations would be more genuine and have more chance of being listened to if they could speak about their concerns rather than giving us a world tour of rivers or telling us about their family trees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sure that we were at no time out of order in discussing the amendment--if we had been, I am sure that you, Mrs. Winterton, would have called us to order. Anything that was said was intended to entertain members of the Committee, to elucidate them--as I am sure they would wish--about any potential clash of interest or to continue arguments that were well developed by my hon. Friends, by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and I hope--if I may say it with modesty--by me.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Indeed and indeed and indeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; in an attempt to rescue him and bring him back to the amendment, I would like to say that I think I heard him saying that only three companies would be affected by the amendment, allowing companies to opt for a time-accruals basis or an actual basis. Is he prepared to name those companies, because it would be very helpful for the Committee to know which they are?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> As you know, Mrs. Winterton, that information is available to the hon. Gentleman; he is free to pursue his inquiries with those companies and to find out their attitude to the amendments that we propose. I am sure that he will be enlightened by such a pursuit of information.
<P>
We have made it clear on Second Reading, in Committee of the whole House, during our debate on the guillotine motion that there is adequate time to consider the Bill. Instead of providing some well reasoned, critical amendments to scrutinise in our debate, the Opposition could not table even one amendment on the first and crucial clause. That is the sort of scrutiny of which the Opposition are capable--not even one amendment. The right hon. Member for Wells, who is, or was, a distinguished member of his profession, quotes other members of that profession at great length and says that there is no time to table reasoned amendments or to analyse the Bill. The Opposition have had days--weeks--to do that--[Hon. Members: ``Weeks?''] Yes, they have had weeks since the Bill was published. I think that they have had at least two and a half weeks.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being uncharacteristically dismissive of outside bodies that have no political axe to grind. Their mission in regard to the Bill is to clarify it and make it unambiguous and usable. They hold no brief for any political party, and they have strongly criticised the way in which the Bill has been brought forward and the time scale which has been laid down for it. The hon. Gentleman ought to recognise that those criticisms are well founded and sincerely meant. I think that he will regret dismissing them as posturing from outside.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> It is not outside criticism that I am dismissing; it is posturing from the Opposition Benches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I absolutely agree with the comments made by my right hon. Friend for Wells. It is important that our criticism is not seen as posturing, and, given the excitement of the Paymaster General in trying to put us right, it is important for us to put him right. The draft Bill was publsihed on 4th July , so we have not yet had a plural of weeks but one week and six days, so we are talking about less than two weeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I do not know what definition of weeks the hon. Gentleman is using. My view is that the amendments are necessary for clarity--to use the word used by the right hon. Member for Wells--and for the correct application of the meaning of the Bill. Instead of whingeing on like a group of little schoolboys about not having enough time to do their homework and to have it corrected by the headmaster or headmistress, the Opposition should get down to the job and propose some scrutiny. If they can improve the Bill let them do so; if not, let us clarify it, as the amendments are designed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It seems a bit much, when we are having to debate a substantive Government amendment tabled because the Bill was badly drafted in haste, for the Paymaster General to talk about the Opposition whingeing about the fact that there has not been not enough time for things to be done properly. We are discussing a part of the Bill that has had to be redrafted because the Government did not have time to do the job properly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The amendments should be accepted by the Committee. I have nothing to add to what I have already said, other than to say that we have many hours of debate ahead of us and much scope for improvement. All of us, especially the Opposition, can improve on our performances.

<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the First schedule to the Bill.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Gibb:</B> As this is my first substantial speech in this Committee, I shall reiterate the interest that I declared on the Floor of the House: I am a chartered accountant, a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and I write a six-weekly column for Accountancy Age.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Very good it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I thank my hon. Friend.
<P>
The formula in the schedule is a crude method of calculating the value of the companies to be used for the windfall tax. As the hon. Member for Dudley, North said, the Government's aim might be to keep the calculation simple. However, given the few companies involved and the large amount of tax that they will pay and despite what the Paymaster General has said, it is better to ensure fairness than to aim for simplicity and lose the fairness that goes with simplicity.
<P>
An example of the arbitrary, unfair nature of the calculation is that of regional electricity companies, to which my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham referred. The Paymaster General did not respond adequately to my hon. Friend's points. The profits of those companies, as calculated under schedule 1, include the dividends that they received from their ownership of National Grid. Those dividends were simply passed straight on to shareholders. The grid was then spun off into the direct ownership of shareholders by means of a dividend in specie. Because of that method of privatisation, National Grid escaped the imposition of this dreadful tax.
<P>
However, it seems grossly unfair that the windfall tax should be levied on the regional electricity companies on the basis of profits arising from dividends which they will no longer continue to receive. That goes to the basis of calculating the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Value of a disposal in profit-making terms''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the heading of paragraph 2 of schedule 1. That calculation uses the annual profit for ``the company's initial period'', as defined in paragraph 5, which has just been amended by the Government. Taking the average annual profit in the four-year period ignores any changes that there might be to those profits as a result of divestments or acquisitions.
<P>
There is no concept of continuing activity in the calculation. Notwithstanding the fact that the Government know that the regional electricity companies have disposed of their shares in National Grid, they still include in calculating the value of the company under the schedule income streams that they know will not exist when the companies are charged the tax. How can that be a fair method of calculating the capital value of a company? Surely, if hon. Members were to buy a company, they would not agree to that method of valuing it--a method in which a higher value is used even though the income stream that they would be purporting to buy would no longer be part of the company. No independent, arm's-length third party would put such a value on a company, and surely the Government should not propose to do so.
<P>
Treasury Ministers have given assurances that the regulators of the industries will ensure that the windfall tax will not feed through into higher prices. However, given that many of the companies involved will need to borrow to pay the tax as quantified under the schedule, how have the Government ensured that borrowing costs will not feed through to higher prices?
<P>
Privatisation has been enormously successful. Gas prices have fallen by 20 per cent. and telecommunications prices have fallen by 40 per cent. since privatisation. Indeed, Seeboard, which supplies electricity to Littlehampton in the eastern part of my constituency, has reduced its standing charge from &#163;44 a year to &#163;16, while the unit price has remained at 7.3p since privatisation. Those amounts are expressed in cash terms; if inflation is taken into account, that is an enormous reduction in the price of electricity to people in my constituency and elsewhere.
<P>
Southern Water, which supplies water and deals with waste water in my constituency, is about to invest &#163;53 million in a new sewage treatment plant, which is the first substantial waste water investment by the water industry for decades. It has occurred only because of privatisation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned Southern Water, which covers my constituency, too. He will surely be aware of the comments of Southern Water's executives that they do not object to the windfall tax or the purpose to which it will be put in the local area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> One cannot expect to extract the proposed sums of money from these companies and expect them to continue with their long-term investment plans or long-term plans to reduce the prices of electricity. Southern Water has superbly ambitious plans to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in waste water and fresh water improvements in its area in the years ahead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> As another consumer of Southern Water, I wonder whether my hon. Friend is aware that the chairman of Southern Water, which is now part of the Scottish Power group, said that the windfall tax will have an effect on the company's residual fund and inevitably affect the environmental projects that it has lined up for the future. The chairman made those comments to me personally only yesterday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was not aware of those comments but I thank my hon. Friend for bringing them to my attention.
<P>
How can the Government be sure that the calculation of the windfall tax in the crude manner set out in the schedule will not damage the capital spending programmes? What technical changes to the way in which the utilities are being regulated are proposed?
<P>
I make no apology for returning to a point I have raised before on several occasions: the nature of the calculations of the tax set out in the schedule makes it a tax on capital rather than a tax on income. I have already referred to my concern about retaliatory taxes from the United States but I am assured by the Paymaster General that discussions have been held with representatives of the United States Government and that there are unlikely to be repercussions on that front. It would have been helpful if the Paymaster General had told us that when I first raised the matter in the House of Commons some days ago. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman had forgotten about the meeting until his officials reminded him of it.
<P>
The way in which the tax is calculated in the schedule causes other technical tax problems. First, where shares in the utilities are held abroad, as they are in many cases, the shareholder will want to obtain double tax relief on dividends paid up in order to avoid double taxation. The Government seem to ride roughshod over the concept of double taxation, as we saw in clause 19, but because the windfall tax is based on profit and not on the capital value of the company itself, in most overseas jurisdictions the tax will not count as an underlying tax for the purposes of calculating the double tax relief available. As such, the dividend will be taxed abroad without any credit for the windfall tax suffered. The Paymaster General may dismiss that issue as a matter for foreign Governments, but it is a direct consequence of the ill-thought-out nature of the method of levying this tax as set out in schedule 1.
<P>
All that the hon. Gentleman has achieved with the methodology is to hand over to foreign jurisdictions through their tax systems the value that should truly belong to the United Kingdom entities and which would have stayed with them if he had thought longer and more thoroughly about the methodology in schedule 1.
<P>
Similarly, the non-UK resident shareholders of those utilities are effectively being taxed on the capital gain, which is in breach of most of this country's extensive range of double tax treaties. Have the Government addressed that point? Did they consider the extensive representations made by the Chartered Institute of Taxation, which suggested that both problems could be solved if the method of calculating the tax was a charge based on profit, but charged as a supplementary corporation tax? As we all know, the UK corporation tax is a creditable tax according to most double tax treaties.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My next point concerns the accounts. If there is a restatement of accounts for any reason, for example, there has been a fundamental error or one that affects the comparative figures, or there is a prior adjustment for year four which alters the comparative figures in year five, there is nothing in the schedule that provides for any amendment to the calculation of value. The schedule says in paragraph 5(2) that the calculation is based on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the relevant accounts for that year''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
According to paragraph 5(5):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In this paragraph references, in relation to any financial year of a company, to the relevant accounts are references to any such accounts for that year as have been or are delivered to the registrar under section 242 of the Companies Act 1985''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What will happen if in a subsequent period, a restatement is made to those accounts that is recorded through the comparatives in the later year's accounts but which ought, particularly if the numbers are significant, to be reflected in the calculation of the windfall levy? Given that there is nothing in the schedule to answer that question, will the Minister or the Paymaster General state the Government's policy, so that if such a restatement is made, the Inland Revenue and any taxpayer caught up in that problem will know what is the intention of the legislation? The Minister's statement will then become law, according to Pepper v. Hart.
<P>
Similar problems arise with extraordinary items in the accounts. Is it fair that they should be included in the accounts? Is it right to include companies that have made highly prudent provisions? Most chartered accountants will know that there is an element of subjectivity in setting up accounts and companies are asked how prudent they want to be. When one sets up a provision, it provides a debit to the profit and loss account and reduces the profit, so those companies that have prudent accountants will find that they have lower profits and therefore a lower windfall tax.
<P>
The schedule lays open the Government to challenge by the European Court of Justice on the grounds that the windfall tax constitutes an effective subsidy to other competing companies throughout Europe which are not subject to the tax. I understand the Paymaster General's point that he understands that the utilities are unlikely to take such legal action, but is it right that the Government are legislating to bring about unfair competition in Europe, particularly as this country more than any other has fought against such subsidies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It is instructive that we are now debating the schedule, which tries to quantify the privatisation windfall. Reading the schedule exposes some of the false and dangerous assumptions that lie behind much of the Bill and which are clearly shown in the schedule. I hope that we can explore some of them in the interests of satisfying the Paymaster General's desire for some genuine debate. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept the good faith of those of us who are new to parliamentary procedures and have come to the House with the possibly naive view that the purpose of Committees such as this is to scrutinise legislation and consider the detail. We wish to do that sensibly and it would have been helpful to have had more time to prepare. However, we have had the debate, so let us consider the quantification of the windfall as set out in the schedule.
<P>
At various points in the schedule, heroic assumptions are made that clearly lead to a degree of arbitrary taxation. That cannot be good for the companies and therefore will not be good for the provision of utility services or the country's economy. Paragraph 2(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subject to paragraph 4 below, the value in profit-making terms of the disposal made on the occasion of a company's flotation is the amount produced by multiplying the average annual profit for the company's initial period''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is arbitrary for some companies in defining the initial period is that the provision makes no allowance for any nominal profits that could have been ascribed to the company before privatisation. Clearly there will be an enormous change in the way in which a company operates before and after privatisation. The schedule, and, indeed, the tax, fail to capture the change in the way that any company will operate--the operation of what Keynes described as animal spirits.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. A Division has been called in the House so I will suspend the Committee for dinner. The Committee will sit again at 8.45 pm.
<P>
<H5>7.6 pm</H5>
