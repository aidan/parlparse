                           </span> Good afternoon, Mr Walker,
and, through you, good afternoon to the Committee. Before we adjourned,
we were discussing amendments 14 and 22 relating to clauses 2 and 3 on
the ability to search the contents of electronic devices and mobile
phones. We were debating the implications of such action, and I was
saying that, in some cases, it could be fairly innocuous but that, in
other cases, students or adults might have private information on their
mobile phones and electronic devices. We need to understand the
implications of the new provisions for the protection of teachers and
lecturers who might undertake confiscation measures and look through
information, deciding whether to delete it or otherwise, as well as the
implications for the privacy of the individual, whether a child or an
adult, and how it relates to their broader rights under other
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000014">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How
could teachers and lecturers prove that they had not misused the power
under the clause? What safeguards are in place for them in such
circumstances? The Minister will want to tell the Committee his
thinking on the matter and explain how teachers and lecturers can be
protected from accusations, as well as how individuals can be protected
from teachers and lecturers potentially misusing such powers. Not
everyone is a saint, and we must be absolutely clear that we have
minimised the potential for the powers to be misused. What safeguards
are in place? I understand fully the Government’s desire to
avoid bureaucracy, and we discussed that earlier. There is good
bureaucracy as well as bad bureaucracy. We need to wipe out bad
bureaucracy, but ensure that we do not take away protections afforded
by the good
bureaucracy.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000015">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I was appalled as the hon. Gentleman by the
swiftness with which I have become used to how such things are done in
Opposition, but it is not uncommon to draft an amendment in order to
discuss the principles of a clause. The Minister might point out later,
with the aid of legal advice, how flawed the amendment is. There might
well be flaws in some of our amendments. I accept that, but imperfect
as they might be, it does not take away from the fact that we need the
answers to the questions asked during our
debates.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000017">&#160;</a>

understand the need to avoid bureaucracy and to prevent the misuse of
electronic devices in our schools and colleges. I want to support the
Minister by saying that he is right that we should be concerned about
such misuse. We should be appalled and
concerned—<em>[</em>

                           <em>]</em> Even in
Committee, occasionally, Mr Walker, we should be concerned
about the potential misuse of mobile phones and electronic devices. I
had better check that mine is switched off, if I can find
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000018">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Such
devices are misused and there is that potential. We know of instances
of teachers being filmed without their consent during the course of
lessons, when pupils are deliberately acting up. Thanks to the
Conservative party, we know of some examples of teachers filming their
pupils without their consent, but we shall not stray into that area. We
know that pupils have misused mobile phones in order to film teachers
inappropriately, and that electronic devices and the use of images can
be used for cyber-bullying between pupils and by pupils of teachers.
Such behaviour is completely unacceptable, and the Minister is right to
think about how best to deal with the phenomenon which, obviously, has
become more prevalent in recent years, as electronic devices have
become more
sophisticated.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000019">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> One of the great benefits of this form of scrutiny
is when people such as the hon. Member for North West Durham bring
their personal experience to bear in the debate. In that spirit, in the
shadow Minister’s own professional career, were there ever any
instances when he perhaps exceeded the rules and abused his position of
power?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000020">&#160;</a>

all sorts of ways. To try and answer the hon. Gentleman in the spirit
probably intended, I suspect that I did things as a member of staff
that might not technically be correct, but nobody’s
perfect.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000021">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is up to the Minister to show that he has thoroughly thought through
the implications of his proposal as it stands. I offer him our strong
support in wishing to counter cyber-bullying and the misuse of
electronic devices, but we want to know that what he is doing here will
work and will not put anyone into any danger, fundamentally infringe
any important rights or increase the likelihood of legal challenge. We
are happy to work with him to consider how best to deal with the
issues, but through the amendments I want to probe in depth exactly
what the clauses do.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000022">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For example,
under the provisions, can teachers look through mobile devices at will,
albeit with some reasonable suspicion? Can they go right through such
devices? Or does the Minister expect that the head teacher or some
senior member of staff would have to be present while that was
undertaken? Should students have any particular rights of veto with
regard to certain files in a mobile device, were they present and able
to indicate their unhappiness about certain areas of the mobile devices
being explored? Let us bear in mind, as I have said all along, that we
are talking about adults and not only
children.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
that point, amendment 22 refers to further education—anyone from
the age of 14, possibly up to 18 and beyond. The National Union of
Teachers has, for example, expressed some concern in its submission
about that provision as it relates to FE. Sections 1 to 3 of the
Computer Misuse Act 1990, regardless “of an individual’s
motivation”, make it a criminal offence—I shall
paraphrase the list of three points—to gain access to computer
files or software without permission, such as using someone
else’s password to access files; to gain unauthorised access, as
above, in order to commit a further criminal act, such as fraud,
although hopefully that is not what we would be talking about in this
case; or to impair the operation of a computer or program, for example
with viruses or denial of service attacks. Again, we hope that the last
point would not be the provision relevant to us, and that we are mainly
concerned with the first
one.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Ministers
need to clarify how these provisions will relate to existing
legislation, particularly for college principals and other staff, who
are expected to seize electronic devices on which there might be
indecent imagery and other material. This relates to a point I made
earlier; could the Minister clarify for further education institutions
as well for schools whether staff would be liable for prosecution if
they opened and viewed such
material?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
NUT also says in its submission that, as the Bill does not afford the
same protection to college staff as it does to school teachers in
relation to malicious allegations, it is particularly important that
staff conducting searches in colleges are protected from potential
prosecution or litigation. I would like the Minister to deal with the
fact that college staff will not be protected by the Bill in the same
way as school staff, and yet they will be given exactly the same powers
in relation to searching through mobile devices and other electronic
devices belonging to their students. It should be remembered that
college staff may be dealing with
adults.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Does
the Minister envisage all teachers in schools having these powers? If
not, how would they be trained to ensure that they could handle
situations such as those described this morning appropriately? As the
clause stands, there is the potential for serious risk to student
privacy, and also a risk to staff culpability if they are not
well-trained or inadvertently view certain images. The amendment would
minimise these risks, and I look forward to hearing the
Minister’s
response.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000027">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">People outside
Parliament might have concerns when looking at the sort of powers we
are discussing, particularly those that try to bring legislation up to
date with regard to electronic devices. Many young people have access
to such devices throughout the school day, though whether or not
everyone thinks that is a great thing, particularly for much younger
students, is another
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
I first heard of this aspect of the Bill I was concerned that teachers
would, for example, be given the right to access data on a mobile
phone, which could include photographs, videos and all sorts of text
files, as the hon. Member for Cardiff West has already said. However,
having heard the evidence prior to entering this stage of proceedings,
what I found most persuasive was the argument that if staff have reason
to suspect that a device contains something untoward and do not have
these powers, the only thing that they can do is invite the police to
look at
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000030">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
a young person has a compromising photograph of another student that
they should not have taken—I am not talking about hard-core
child pornography, which is a completely different matter—and
there is reason to suspect that it might be used for a purpose such as
bullying or intimidation, even if that is not the intended purpose, my
concern is that the teacher has the power to deal with it without
recourse to the police. It is a hugely important issue for that young
person’s future career and development—for example, being
able to travel to some countries or enter particular forms of public
service—if they have a criminal record. That is where there is
perhaps scope for this power and that is why I have been persuaded
that, if it is properly circumscribed, it could have some
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000031">&#160;</a>

constituency instances of the police being invited into school in a
low-key way, to talk to some young people who might be at risk of
committing an offence—let us say—to talk to them about
their behaviour and to ensure that their behaviour was dealt with at an
early stage, so that there was no repetition. That is a very powerful
approach and it is a very useful way of correcting a young person who
might be about to go down a path that could lead to something much more
serious.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000035">&#160;</a>

for the Minister to set out exactly what the intention is behind this
measure, to reassure people that it is not a power that will be used
lightly and that it will be used only where there is reasonable
evidence to lead teachers to believe that they ought to step in. Of
course, as the hon. Member for Cardiff West has already said, if we are
talking about a serious criminal offence, the police would have to be
involved at that stage. There would be no alternative. However, I hope
that hon. Members will agree that there are different levels of

allowing us to think through exactly the sort of scenarios in which the
power might be exercised, and the difficulties and dilemmas that might
be created. Unfortunately, the amendment is limited, in the sense that
the cover that it would give a member of staff would apply only to the
examination of the data or finds, and not to erasure, which my hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff West talked about when he spoke to his
amendment. That may be because a separate subsection deals with the
issue of erasing material from a device.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are two
separate issues: the examination of material and erasing material,
which could lead to contentious considerations, such as whether a
member of staff would be right to erase material, and whether the right
material would be erased. If there is such a condition as e-dyslexia
for IT users, I have it. I can manage to delete a function on my mobile
phone, thinking I am coming out of it, which is why I am struggling to
get alarm functions working on my BlackBerry and so on. A teacher who
is not trained, but who has good cause to ask for, or take hold of, a
device might, in trying to go through it, come across something. There
can be difficulties, though, if people are unfamiliar with various
devices. Not all things that work a particular way on one brand of
device work the same way on another. People could get themselves into
trouble simply by trying to erase something that it might be correct
and justifiable to erase if they end up being accused of deleting far
more personal, family-related material. That is something that we need
to think about, given that in debating the amendments we are
effectively talking about all the implications of the wider
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000044">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments 14
and 22 relate to clause 2 in respect of schools, and clause 3 in
respect of further education institutions. We have to remember that
some of the atmospherics and circumstances will be quite different in
those two situations. Clause 2 has clear reference to school rules;
there is no equivalent reference in clause 3. In many cases, staff in
further education institutions might have less clear cover or guidance
at a corporate level from their institution. That is why we need to be
careful that when we legislate for what staff can do in those
situations, we do not assume that they will be covered by clear
guidance, well-publicised school rules and so on. Also, as many further
education institutions are multi-site, staff may not have guidance,
back-up or support immediately available to them. That might be a
reason why sometimes people will need to act on their own in a given
situation; I accept and realise that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000045">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The seizure of
electronic devices, the inspection or examination of them, and the
possible erasure of material brings me back to an issue that I touched
on the other day. In proposed new subsections (6E) and (6F) in clause
2, and proposed new subsections (6C) and (6D) 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 287<a class="bkMark" name="Column287">&#160;</a>
                           </div>in clause 3, the Bill provides for someone who has seized a device to
examine it, make a decision to return, dispose of or retain it, and
erase the material on it. I suppose that the erasure can happen in any
situation—whether the device is returned, disposed of or
retained.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is, however, no indication in clauses 2 and 3 of what the purpose of
retention might be; is it the need to bring the material to the
attention of college authorities, or other relevant authorities, if the
need arises? There might be circumstances in which a member of staff
believes it best to return a device as soon as possible, with material
erased, but wishes to retain a copy of the material as part of a wider
investigative effort on the part of the school or other
authorities—for example, there might be concern about ongoing
sexual harassment in a school or on a particular
site.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000047">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
must remember that as electronic devices change, they increasingly
become display rather than personal information devices, and tablets
and iPads are being used to splash posters. I have been told that in
the Northern Ireland situation they are being used for quick displays
of emblems that are deemed to be proxies for political expression and
identity, and can be used provocatively. We can understand how
pornographic images might be displayed on such devices, not for the
lewd gratification of the holder of the device but as a visual aid to
sexual harassment, with images perhaps being composited with
photographs. We can understand that there might be circumstances in
which teachers and other staff have cause to try to intercept devices,
and what they do with the material becomes
important.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000048">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
would like some clarification on whether the guidance that we are told
the Secretary of State will issue on the powers will delineate and
differentiate between retention of the device, for whatever purposes,
and retention of the material. I am conscious of the shadow
Minister’s point about how the law stands on people accessing,
viewing and even copying certain material, even if it is done with a
view to making it available to school, college or child protection
authorities, or to the police. We need to ensure that whatever the
extent of powers that we give, and whatever their purposes, certain
protections are there. The shadow Minister makes, I think, an honest
effort with his amendment to try to ensure that there are protections
for staff who will have to deal with many complex issues in myriad
circumstances, and we will not be able to predict or pre-empt them all
because technology will race way ahead of our imaginations. We
therefore need wider thought on the matter, and as the hon. Member for
North Cornwall said, it would help if the Minister gave us some
indication of how the Government envisage the guidance being sufficient
to cover many of those
points.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000049">&#160;</a>

would provide in the same way for sixth-form and further education
colleges. I understand the concerns on these subjects. The amendments
raise important issues about the Bill’s purpose, which is to
recalibrate—if I can put it that way—the balance of
authority in schools, and give rise to perfectly proper consideration
of how that should be mitigated in the interests of good practice,
privacy, and so on. Those are serious matters that should not be taken

clear in the evidence sessions—for the sake of brevity, I will
not go through this exhaustively—that mobile telephones are
increasingly being used in schools to harass and bully teachers.
Indeed, the hon. Member for Foyle has just made the point that mobile
telephones are not what they were; they can be used to display material
of all kinds. The shadow Minister acknowledged the growing significance
of cyber-bullying, which is clear from representations that we received
and from witnesses such as Sir Michael Wilshaw, who
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000052">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
ought to declare an interest, as the shadow Minister was kind enough to
mention his prior membership of the National Union of Teachers: I am a
member of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, which has surveyed
on cyber-bullying and found there to be a significant and growing
problem in
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">According
to Bullying UK, 14% of young people, or one in seven, have been
threatened or harassed via mobile telephones. Each of the 30 sixth-form
colleges that responded to a snapshot survey in February 2009 stated
that there had been instances of students being subject to
cyber-bullying at their institutions in the past 12 months. There is
not, therefore, much debate about the significance of
cyber-bullying.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Without a
specific power to delete inappropriate images, teachers and college
staff would be limited simply to delaying any bullying or harassment
for which the images might be used until the confiscated device were
returned to its owner. The provision is about changing good practice
and redefining what is appropriate in the light of the technological
changes that have altered the character of bullying. Such changes have
altered the nature of the worst examples of what pupils can do to other
pupils, students can do to other students, and staff can suffer at the
hands of the more malevolent among those they teach.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I want the
Committee to ask whose best interests are served if a teacher learns
that pupil A has taken an inappropriate picture of pupil B, but is
powerless to act when, at a later date, pupil A publishes that image on
the internet. Is it in order to prevent such situations? On balance, I
believe that is justified, and we should include a provision to that
end in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
number of issues have been raised to do with the character of the
mitigation that I have described. I shall deal with the second part of
the amendments, which we can clear up with appropriate rapidity, given
our determination to move through the Bill carefully but speedily. The
shadow Minister asked whether a teacher who searched a phone under the
provision and saw child pornography—which, clearly, is seriously
unlawful—would be left open to prosecution. The answer is no.

                           </div>I do not really need to add more, because that is well
supported in case law. In those terms, teachers are like other
professionals who might encounter material of that sort in the way that
we described. I know that this preoccupies the hon. Gentleman—I
will not say night or day, or in the still of the night, but it
certainly preoccupies him. He is right to ask the question. It is
important to say that in our view a teacher would not be subject to
prosecution in those circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000057">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes. I do think it is important that Ministers
respond to the proper enquiries of Committee members. I would be happy
to do that. Perhaps I can go one step further, and be more generous
than he was expecting me to be: I also think that in the guidance that
we said we would publish—this is implicit in what we are
debating—we need to give an assurance that we are clear about
the interface between this change in the law and the other legislation
referred to by the hon. Gentleman. We need to be clear about that
marriage, because the provisions do, as the hon. Gentleman suggested,
have a perceived connection with other pieces of legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I shall try to
buttonhole this aspect of the amendments once and for all. In the
circumstances that have been hypothetically described, it would be for
those bringing proceedings to prove that a teacher had acted
unlawfully. The teacher would seek to establish in their defence that
they had looked at data in the lawful exercise of the power given to
them under the provision. It would be for the court considering all the
facts of that case to come to a conclusion. This is a straightforward
matter, and the hon. Gentleman will know that a test of reasonableness
is well established in law. Indeed, he will have debated many Bills in
this House where that very test of reasonableness has mitigated what
might otherwise seem to be a power that could be used inappropriately.
I am happy to write on both those subjects, and I think that will
clarify them.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000060">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing to
write. Of course, the reasonableness test is well established. The
difficulty—I think Members on both sides of the House sometimes
feel this—is that what Members of this House regard as
reasonable is not always viewed in the same way by a High Court judge,
much to our frustration as law makers. Will the Minister also—he
may have been coming on to this—refer back to the intervention I
made on the hon. Member for North Cornwall about what consultation and
discussion there has been with the Information
Commissioner?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000061">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes, I will. In doing so, I draw the attention of
hon. Members to the memorandum that the Government submitted to the
Joint Committee on Human Rights, in which we set out how the provisions
are compatible with rights under that convention. I think that would be
a helpful element in the discussion.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000062">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One effect of
the amendment would be to restrict to senior members of staff the power
to act in the way that I think we all agree will sometimes be
necessary, given that circumstances have changed. The law already
requires the head teacher or college principal to authorise members of
staff before they conduct a search under the powers. The issue raised
in the exchange that we enjoyed about whether we are talking about all
staff, some staff, or one member of staff, is dealt with in the Bill,
in that the person exercising the power would be authorised to
do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Nothing in the
provisions would prevent a head teacher from authorising only senior
staff members if they thought it right to do so. There was some
discussion of that in the evidence sessions—the hon. Gentleman
will no doubt point it out if I do not anticipate his possible
intervention—but in the end, the decision lies with head
teachers and principals, and we should not prevent them from
authorising other staff if they judge it necessary and appropriate to
do so. They are, in the end, in a better position to take that decision
than we in the Committee Room can be.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In a sense,
the issue lies at the heart of our considerations. I will use this
opportunity to make the broader point that, as Disraeli said, duty
cannot exist without faith. Our duty, based on faith in professionals
and school and college leaders, is to trust them to exercise their
duties in a way that passes the test of reasonableness that I described
a few moments ago.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000065">&#160;</a>

couple of times that this is a philosophical step on the
Government’s part and that it is about giving powers and
trusting head teachers, but I am afraid that the Government cannot have
it both ways. The recent White Paper said clearly, “We will give
powers to head teachers. We won’t tell them what to
teach.” The very next line said, “You will teach reading
by teaching phonics.” Surely it is for the teacher in the
classroom to decide whether the child learns best with look and see or
with phonics. Yes, try phonics, but the Government cannot say that they
will give powers to teachers and at the same time tell them how to
teach.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000066">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> When I talked about training yesterday I was clear
that there were two issues. One is about giving powers around search
and restraint to teachers without training, which is very dangerous. I
would expect any teacher expected to search or restrain a pupil would
have adequate training. The second is about the cost of that training.
It is incredibly costly, ongoing and annual. I am interested to know
whether any additional funding will be going into schools to cover
those
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000077">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I did wonder whether such a view might emerge in
Committee. I took a look at the guidance on search powers issued by the
previous Government. They are rather different powers but, none the
less, are an acknowledgment of the need to provide teachers with
appropriate authority to take action in the case of what could be very
serious circumstances in schools. That guidance made it clear
that<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000078">&#160;</a>

symptomatic of appropriate management, and one would not disagree with
that. In the end, these are matters of

                           </strong> The Minister rightly referred to the fact that
the previous Government gave a great deal of trust to teachers in
dealing with search powers under previous legislation, of which
teachers were required to be
cognisant.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000081">&#160;</a>

powers we are talking about go considerably further, in that teachers
would be allowed to search pupils. There will be issues around contact
with the pupil, clothing, and what is allowed to be searched. The trust
issue was meant to relate to training perhaps not being necessary in
the past. However, the issue around costs would have been dealt with by
the previous Government, because obviously our budgets, as the
Government always say, were considerably more generous in spending on
education and other areas. In the current climate we are looking at
cuts.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000082">&#160;</a>

come to the data stored on an electronic device and their retention.
That important matter was raised in earlier discussions, and I want to
clarify our position. If a school keeps an electronic device, it will
become the data controller of the data on the device and must deal with
the information in compliance with the data protection principles under
the Data Protection Act 1998. I do not have a copy of the 1998 Act with
me, but, from memory, I believe that it defines eight principles
regarding the character of data protection. If it is helpful to
Committee members, I am more than happy to make available the relevant
information, so that they can be assured about the relationship between
those principles and what we are discussing today.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000088">&#160;</a>

clarity about the purpose, which is the matter raised by my hon. Friend
the Member for North Cornwall. The purpose is to give sufficient power,
with a test of good reason, to teachers so that they can act in a way
appropriate to deal with a significant and growing problem, the shape
of which has changed dramatically as technology has changed, and the
use of technology, both for good and malevolent purposes, has changed
with it. The appropriateness of the power is clearly set down in the
Bill, which says that there has to be “good reason” to
seize an item and examine any data. In the case of retaining or
disposing of data, again, there must be “good reason” to
do so. Further than that, the person concerned—the

not theirs? In the case of a school pupil, it might belong to their
parents and they have the use of it, or, in the case of somebody who is
in college part-time, the device might belong to their employer. A
device taken from a student might have material on it that belonged to
their parent, and the parent might mount a Max Mosley-style challenge
to the invasion of their privacy. Where would teachers be then? Are not
some of the points the shadow Minister raised worth further
consideration?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000092">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. He did not
make this point, but forgive me if I extend his argument: it might be
that students were using a device that the school owns, in the case of
a computer. The powers the teacher would enjoy in those circumstances
would be the same. Imagine someone using a computer to exchange
information of an inappropriate kind or send it to other pupils. The
teacher would need to act in the same way and with the same tests I
described to deal with it. The ownership of the device in those
circumstances would not be the salient point; it would be the behaviour
of the pupil in using the device for a purpose that the teacher
identified as
inappropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000093">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I take the Minister’s point, but it does
not answer the question, it sidesteps it. The clause is about devices
that are taken from pupils and then either retained, returned or
disposed of. It does not deal with school
property.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000094">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> But the point is that because it includes
retention, return or disposal, in the case of a device that did not
belong to the pupil but to another party—it might be the school
itself—clearly it would not be returned to the individual. It is
not really a question of ownership but of use. However, given the point
that the hon. Gentleman made about it possibly being someone
else’s phone, I am more than happy to look at that again on the
basis of what he has just described. Perhaps I can come back with
further
clarification.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000095">&#160;</a>

for Foyle has raised an interesting point and it would be helpful if
the Minister could deal with it now or later when he receives
inspiration. It is quite common for schools to allow students to have
mobile phones. It is also common for schools to ban them. Some schools
think that they have safety benefits and are good for keeping in touch
with parents. As the hon. Member for Foyle said, a mobile phone may
have been

parents in relation to material that may be contained on that
phone?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000096">&#160;</a>

amendments 14 and 22 and the Minister’s response, our concern is
that we are not sure exactly how the measure is going to work, because
we do not know the full extent of the guidance or regulations, or
whatever we are going to have. It would be very useful to have the
guidance on what can be deleted in front of us. The draft regulations
give extremely broad, permissive powers, but what the Minister has just
said means that we are being asked to take a leap of faith. He said
that duty cannot exist without faith, and asked us to have faith in
head teachers. I promise to show faith in him as a Minister in exactly
the same proportion that he  showed it to me when I was a
Minister in the previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000100">&#160;</a>

also said that a majority is the best repartee, and I cannot win a vote
if I press my amendments to a Division. However, it is a leap of faith.
We simply do not have the full picture of what the Government intend.
Perhaps we should be permitted to trawl through the Minister’s
BlackBerry to look at all the advice notes from his officials about the
legal advice. We could see whether counsel has indeed said that all
this is fine and that officials are unanimous in their view that what
the Government are attempting is sound, but I am sure that we would not
be allowed to do that. I think that that is probably enough product
placement for one debate, as we have already mentioned BlackBerrys,
iPods, iPads and the
rest.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000101">&#160;</a>

flaws that we would not actually want to put in the Bill. Given that
there is not going to be a clause stand part debate, we may want to
return to the issue on Report. We need more detail from the Government

do not intend to detain the Committee too long on this group of
amendments. The purpose of clause 3 is essentially to level the playing
field between schools and colleges on discipline and the power of staff
at further education institutions to search students. Consideration of
clause 2 probed and scrutinised many of the same principles with
respect to schools that we are now considering with regard to further
education colleges. I acknowledge that, during the evidence-gathering
session last week, witnesses, when questioned on this aspect of the
Bill, welcomed the clause. Sue Whitham from the Sixth Form
Colleges’ Forum said
that<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000117">&#160;</a>

would want the same powers that the Bill gives to schools, because we
are dealing in the main with 16 to 18-year-olds. On how those powers
are used, we would expect guidance, but we believe that the same powers
should be available to senior management in sixth-form
colleges.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000320">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Frank
McLoughlin, an esteemed and respected principal of a further education
college in London, agreed with that sentiment,
stating:<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“I

                        <p>Having
said that, Mr McLoughlin questioned whether he would use the power in
his college. He told
us:<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“I
have 4,200 young people in my college, but I cannot think of more than
a handful of occasions in the past 10 years that I have been the
principal when we would have wanted to use those
powers.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000322">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

concluded by

we have this curious situation where leading practitioners in the FE
sector state that they welcome the level playing field between schools
and colleges and they welcome the possibility of having such powers on
the statute book, but they could not envisage any circumstances in
which they would use the power. Indeed, they would see the exercise of
this power as a failure of leadership on their part. It appears that
this power would be used very sparingly and in very rare
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000121">&#160;</a>

to his feet led to such common acclamation across the Committee, for
giving way. I enjoyed the generosity of that tribute to him as well as
his discomfort in the receipt of it. He has just said that a witness
last week told us that he could only recall a number of times in recent
years when he would have used the power. The hon. Gentleman also said
that the witness went on to say that he could not imagine any situation
in which he would use it. My understanding was that the witness said
that he could see situations in which he would use it, from his past
experience, but they would not be very frequent. For clarity’s

legislation that is to be used in

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the debate on clause 2, we asked under what circumstances such a power
would be used, and that is the question that I would like the Minister
to answer. Where is the evidence that such a power is needed? Do not
the existing provisions under the 1992 Act, amended by subsequent
legislation, do what is really needed—and what we all
want—which is to provide an orderly and safe learning
environment for further education colleges? Can the Minister see any
specific distinction between schools and further education colleges
when it comes to the use of the power in clauses 2 and
3?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000124">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Chair of the Education Committee intervened earlier, and I hope that he
will intervene again or perhaps make a little speech of his own,
because I was very interested in his Committee’s report on
behaviour and discipline. The report suggested that there was little
evidence that such additional powers are needed, but I want to probe
the hon. Gentleman on whether he focused exclusively on schools, not
further education colleges. The report stated:<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000125">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Data
on behaviour currently collected by the Department does not fully
represent the nature of behaviour in schools—good or
bad—and the impact of that behaviour upon staff, pupils, parents

in schools today or whether there has been an improvement over time, as

Government state that one of the virtues of the clause is to level the
playing field between schools and colleges. I welcome that, given that
more and more children are now being taught in FE colleges. It is also
worth pointing out that there are differences. Post-16 education is not
compulsory, at least not at the moment. In many respects, young people
are not there through compulsion, but because they understand the value
of a good education that will allow them to achieve their ambitions. In
that context, it is to be hoped that there would be less disruptive
behaviour through, say, resentment at having to be at
college.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The same is
true of the Committee. We have had remarkably little bother so far,
largely because of your excellent chairing skills, Mr Walker, but also
because we all want to be here. The big difference is that, in the FE
sector, adults are being taught in a way that they are not taught in
schools. It is not clear from the way that the Bill is currently
drafted whether the provisions on discipline and search will apply to
people who are more than 18 years old.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 23
probes the Government’s intentions as to whether there is an
upper limit to the age of a pupil that would be subject to searches
under the powers in the Bill. While we welcome the equalisation of
policy between schools and FE institutions in this regard, the fact
that the latter cater for adults as well as young people means that
there is a need for absolute clarity in this provision. The Bill
extends powers to search in order to maintain discipline, and we assume
that the Government intended these powers to apply only to under-18s.
Can the Minister confirm
that?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me give a specific example. New subsection (2A)(a) states that
“alcohol or its container” could be taken. Does the
Minister envisage a scenario in which an 18-year-old has bought alcohol
legally, put it in his bag and taken it to college with the purposes of
drinking it off the premises later in the day—at a party or
whatever—but then has had his bag searched and the alcohol taken
from him, under the terms of this clause? Is that the Minister’s
intention? The amendment seeks to clarify the Government’s
intentions. It would be useful if the Minister could put on the record
whether the legislation includes adults aged 18 or over, as well as
children, who are defined in law as those aged 17 and under.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 21
seeks to ensure that staff conducting the search are trained to
maintain the student’s dignity and right to privacy, and in
methods that are appropriate for students with special educational
needs and disabilities. Those matters were touched on at length during
the 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>debate on clause 2, and in the group of amendments that we have just
discussed. The right to privacy is an important
consideration.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000138">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not wish
to return to matters discussed earlier—I am sure you would rule
me out of order if I did, Mr Walker—but I want to
probe the Minister on two specific, hypothetical questions. What would
happen if a student aged over 16 and in a relationship—even a
marriage or civil partnership—had intimate pictures of their
partner on their electronic device? Are they allowed to say to the
tutor, “On the grounds of privacy, I don’t want you to
search that element of my electronic device.”?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000139">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Similarly, a
17-year-old at college may be a parent. They may have pictures on their
electronic device relating to their children in the
bath—innocent, innocuous family fun and purely for the purposes
of the family. If the electronic device is searched, can he or she say
to the tutor involved, “I don’t want those pictures
looked at. They are extremely private family moments, and they have
nothing to do with this issue.”? It would be useful if the
Minister could confirm
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
the moment, new subsection (6C) in clause 3(4)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
person who seized the item may examine any data or files on the device,
if the person thinks there is a good reason to do
so.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000326">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
would question whether that was appropriate for a 17-year-old. As we
discussed earlier, does the Minister believe that the principal of the
college should be present in all cases? Does the student have a right
of veto over which files on a mobile device are looked
at?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
25 seeks to define key terms used in the Bill. The clause gives staff
in further education powers in relation to these terms, but does not
currently define them. It would sensible for the Secretary of State to
issue guidance on the definition of the terms contained within the
clause. Let me give the Minister two examples. The first term that
needs defining is “serious harm.” Section 224(3) of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003 defines “serious harm”
as<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“death
or serious personal injury, whether physical or
psychological”.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000327">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Is
that the legal definition that the Minister is working to? If the
member of staff is to make the decision that the conditions are
satisfied to allow him or her to dispense with the requirement that the
search must be carried out by a person of the same sex as the pupil, or
in the presence of a member of staff of the same sex, it is vital that
“serious harm” is properly defined in the Bill or at
least in
guidance.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000144">&#160;</a>

the Minister is aware, clause 3 dispenses with the requirement that any
search must be carried out by a person of the same sex as the student,
in the presence of a member of staff of the same sex as the student, if
the staff member believes there is a risk of serious harm. Many
stakeholders and members of the Committee have expressed concern about
searching schoolchildren. I suggest that there is equal if not more
concern about the searching young adults. For example, how appropriate
is it for a male member of staff to search a 17-year-old woman? To
safeguard students, and to protect staff, amendment 26 would therefore
reinstate the requirement for a witness to be
present.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000148">&#160;</a>

the amendments refer. I do not intend to be repetitive—you would
not allow me to be so, Mr Walker—and I do not want to delay the
Committee unduly, as the hon. Member for Hartlepool said. However, the
amendments draw our attention to specific matters that require proper
scrutiny. I will deal with a couple of things promptly, so that we can
then move on to the elements that the hon. Gentleman described as
requiring more careful

existing law does not allow a member of staff to search or seize
alcohol if the student is aged 18 or over. We are not changing that in
the Bill. I wanted to make that perfectly clear because the hon.
Gentleman cited the example of alcohol. Similarly, on the issue of
familial relationships with a married couple holding images of one
another, I think there would be no likelihood of harm resulting from
that. However, one would not want to make a blanket judgment, and there
would have to be a test of reasonableness. People can be married but
not necessarily on good terms, and marriage would not be a prerequisite
for any assumption—<em>[</em>

which he would do so. However, he prefixed that by agreeing with Sue
Whitham who had

a 17 or 18-year-old pupil in a school finds that their mobile device is
more liable to search under law than is the case for a 17 or

                           </div>and screening powers that were given. Pervading those considerations
over time is the very tension that the hon. Gentleman has drawn out
about how one deals with colleges and schools, given that colleges are
attended by many 16 to 18-year-olds as well as
adults.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000164">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To
pick up the point made by the hon. Members for Cardiff West and for
Hartlepool, the colleges say that they want equivalence in the sense
that they want the authority to use search powers when that is
appropriate. However, they are mindful that their different
circumstances might change the application of those powers in precisely
the way we were beginning to tease out. That is why—the hon.
Member for Hartlepool made this point perfectly reasonably—Frank
McLoughlin says he thinks that they should have the same powers,
although he could not imagine a circumstance in which he would use
them. There would need to be sufficient grounds for concern about the
changing nature of intimidation or bullying, for example, which do take
place in colleges, to feel that there has to be an appropriate response
in line with
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000165">&#160;</a>

years before being elected to another place across the water, if I may
call it that, the circumstances in which FE teachers find themselves
are obviously very different because of the age group. Although some of
the teaching unions and professionals who gave evidence to the
Committee may want equivalence for reasons of consistency, the
practical considerations of handling 16, 17 or 18-year-olds, or adults,
when using the restraint or search powers, for example, would make
things very
difficult.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000166">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman sets out well the nub of the
tension that I am describing. Schools have broader powers that allow
staff to search for prohibited items under the school rules. There is a
strong argument that there is scope within the behavioural contracts of
colleges to set out rules and expectations of what students can and
cannot bring into college. It is reasonable for us to expect colleges
to use such contracts in individual
situations.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000167">&#160;</a>

want to go on at length about the evidence on disruptive behaviour, but
just to give a flavour of it, more than half of the 30 sixth-form
colleges that responded to a snapshot survey reported an incident in
the previous 12 months in which a student or group of students had used
an item other than a weapon to cause damage to college property or the
personal belongings of a student or staff member, to cause harm to
another student or member of staff, or to commit an offence. Examples
include the use of screwdrivers to damage goods and
equipment.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000176">&#160;</a>

it in a waistband, a shoe or a sock. We know that this is a problem in

also says that specific guidance is needed so that colleges may support
the legislation, so this is an instance of colleges themselves asking
for guidance, even though I know that too much guidance may have been
issued by the last Government. I also know that my hon. Friend the
Minister is a great champion of the FE sector—there is no
greater champion of the sector—and that he will therefore want

point to the attention of the Committee more powerfully than I could

said:<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We

                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps I may
add at this point that it is easy to forget that colleges teach a
number of students in the 14 to 16 age range. The relationships and
collaborations between schools and colleges mean that colleges deal
with very young people as well as with people who are considerably
older. The survey by the Association of Colleges reports concern about
such things as the theft of mobile phones and other criminal activity.
Furthermore, college principals have said that they would like to have
some of the powers of school principals.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000184">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Like staff in
schools, college principals and authorised members of college staff
already have a statutory power—the one that I mentioned a few
moments ago—to search students without their consent, in certain
defined circumstances, for knives, weapons, alcohol, controlled drugs
and stolen items. Extending powers in colleges in a similar way to as
in schools will ensure that authorised college staff have the powers to
deal quickly and effectively with problem or extreme behaviour. It will
ensure that the rights of students and staff to study and work in
safety will be protected, regardless of whether they study and work in
a school or college.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000185">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let me just
emphasise that point. In dealing with such behaviour, it is easy to
focus on the individual concerned in the incident and to understate the
broader effect on the college or school
community.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000186">&#160;</a>

in Northern Ireland that was trying to maintain campus neutrality and
resolve contentions involving football displays and so on. Is the
Minister content that the clause would cover a situation in which, at a
further education institution with a cultural and ethno-religious mix,
and maybe a difficult and contentious environment outside, material is
displayed using an electronic device, as we said earlier, in a
deliberately provocative manner? Would the powers permit staff to act
against such material on an electronic device in that situation, taking
into account, as he said, the wider good and the wider impact on the
college population and environment?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000187">&#160;</a>

considerations. He is right to make it clear that what is described in
popular parlance as cyber-bullying is as likely to happen in a college
as in a school. We should not assume that it applies only to teenagers
and so on; it could happen to others. If such material were of the kind
mentioned by the hon. Member for Cardiff West—serious
pornographic material, for example—it would be an offence, as it
would be outside an educational institution.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000188">&#160;</a>

clarify the point—it involves another clause, but I hope that
you will not mind, Mr Walker—in those circumstances, I think
that a teacher would, of course, report the matter to the police. If
they suspected a serious criminal incidents—it might be an a
priori assumption, but if they none the less recognised the potential
for seriousness—I think that they would want to take the matter
to the police. Nothing that we are saying in the Bill prohibits that. I
think it appropriate that we consider the possibility, as the hon.
Gentleman suggests, that devices might be used to engage in unhealthy
or unsuitable activities, just as in

published in Denmark that were the subject of an awful lot of

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is an experienced and shrewd
Member of the House. He will know that legislation lays down a series
of principles that are then clarified in guidance. Judgments about the
detail, as we argued earlier, will be made by principals and head
teachers. None the less, it is as clear as crystal that if there

                        </p>
                        <p>action
would clearly be taken. The provisions include incitement to racial
hatred, harassment and a range of offences. When we think of offences,
we should not simply think of violent offences. A whole range of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 306<a class="bkMark" name="Column306">&#160;</a>
                           </div>offences that relate to bullying in a school or college would be
included. The hon. Gentleman might argue that they are at the extreme
end, but they are related none the less. Whether something was criminal
would depend on the character of the material. Certainly, we are
attempting to extend the power of those involved to take swift action
to deal with the possible effects of such malevolent intention and
action.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000192">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other point made by the hon. Member for Hartlepool was about the age of
students. I want to explore that a little further for the benefit of
the Committee. We are all aware that the age range of students in
colleges is far wider than in schools, and we should consider carefully
whether that should make a difference to how we frame the powers in the
Bill. We have had that debate. As we were saying about the tension
between schools and colleges, there is a perfectly reasonable debate to
be had about whether a line could be drawn at some point to say that
the powers should apply only to people beyond, or below, a certain
age.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We concluded,
after careful consideration, that we should not create that kind of age
barrier for two reasons. First, we believe that if a student is
carrying an item that has been used or is likely to be used to commit
an offence, it is entirely right that staff should have the same basic
power to deal with the situation irrespective of the student’s
age. If we agree, for example, that a 17-year-old should be prevented
from damaging property with a screwdriver, why not a 20-year-old?
Colleges tell us that they face the same problems as schools in the way
that I described earlier, so we believe that they should have the same
powers to deal with them. In addition, we believe that all students
under the age of 18 should be treated equally, regardless of where they
study. Their parents should have the assurance that their children
receive the same safeguarding in colleges as they enjoy in
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
this is a broad power that we will expect college staff to interpret
and apply within their institutions. We do not intend to spell out in
detail how it should apply in every situation. Colleges are responsible
institutions; they know what is appropriate to their individual
environments and are well equipped to judge the seriousness of any
circumstance. We are clear that we are providing a broad power for
staff to act swiftly when absolutely necessary. Searches will be not be
undertaken lightly. Colleges are staffed by highly-qualified and
committed professional staff. We trust them to interpret the provisions
sensibly, in a way that is appropriate to the age of the students
concerned, within their individual institutions and in accordance with
their colleges’ regulations and behavioural contracts. We
thought about whether a barrier on age or a limit should be set and,
for those two reasons, concluded that it should not.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 21
is linked to amendment 12, which the Committee discussed earlier in
relation to the conduct of searches. I understand the concerns behind
the proposed amendment. Students’ dignity and entitlement to
privacy should be sufficiently protected. Searches must only be carried
out with good reason, and those reasons are set out in the proposed
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I also
understand the additional issues that arise when carrying out searches
on certain pupils with special educational needs or disabilities. I am
particularly sensitive to that. For all my political life, including
when I was county councillor long before I first came to the House, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 307<a class="bkMark" name="Column307">&#160;</a>
                           </div>I have been very interested in special educational needs and disability
issues. I asked such questions when we discussed the legislation.
Again, the emphasis here must be on the appropriateness and the
sensitivity used by senior managers, teachers and lecturers in dealing
with those issues in line not only with legislation, but with guidance.
When the guidance is issued, we will address some of those
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000197">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
agree with my hon. Friend the Minister with responsibility for schools
that decisions about the training that is offered to members of staff
on searching pupils and students without consent are best made by
individual schools and colleges. I need to form something of a Hegelian
synthesis with the hon. Gentleman, because I felt just a frisson of
difference between us earlier, which caused me some
pain.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Good
heads and principals will want to ensure that their staff are trained.
That has been clear in my discussions with principals, and I know that
equivalent discussions have been taking place between my hon. Friend
the Minister and head teachers. It was clear that the responsibilities
that the Bill confers were not taken lightly by the witnesses in the
evidence sessions. It would probably not be appropriate to get into a
debate here about the funding of that, however. What the hon. Gentleman
said has been put on the record, and if I were to respond now I would
probably once again be chastised by the Chair. On that note, I had
better give way to the hon. Member for
Foyle.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000199">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In summing up on the clause, the Minister has
explained the rationale—as did the hon. Member for Hartlepool,
who tabled the amendments—behind achieving equivalence where
that was sought. Does the Minister believe that the clause takes enough
account of the real differences between a further education setting and
a school? Those differences include the age range, the fact that many
more people will be part time, possibly sponsored by an employer, and
the fact that far less time will be spent in
class.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000200">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Far
more of the time that a student spends at an FE college will be in a
less supervised setting and in a more open context than in class. Much
of the discussion on the previous clause presumed that we were talking
about a teacher in a class setting who was in charge of a class, but
that is not going to be the case in FE. The powers of search, for
instance, will involve possibly having to stop someone in a situation
that is very different from one that might occur in a school
classroom.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000201">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a good point, because the hon. Gentleman is
right that further education is diverse by nature, and colleges perhaps
all the more so. In essence, this is a permissive power, which will be
used appropriately. I have made the case about what I described as
sensitivity and appropriateness, because principals will have to make
judgments about the application of the power that are pertinent to
their
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000202">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman’s point about the difference between schools and
colleges could be made about the difference between different types of
college, or different types of school. Some colleges are small and
their offer is much more limited. Other colleges are extremely large,
with large numbers of part-time students, and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 308<a class="bkMark" name="Column308">&#160;</a>
                           </div>they offer a range of provision. The power is permissive, and it has to
be applied with sensitivity according to local
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000203">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> The Minister has just mentioned that the power is
permissive. Does he anticipate that principals of FE providers might
think, “This is a wide-ranging power that might be used a couple
of times every couple of years. The training on it, which is vital to
safeguard my staff, is expensive, so I am not going to use the
power,” and therefore it will lie idle on the statute book? How
often does he anticipate the power being used in that
context?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000204">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have been a school governor all my adult life,
and I remain so. As the hon. Gentleman knows, a school or college often
trains staff for a responsibility that might be exercised only
occasionally. School governors, managers and teachers—the same
would apply to the equivalent people in colleges—might be
trained to perform a particular function or task, which might be a
legislative requirement or a matter of choice by the school, but which
is not employed daily, weekly or monthly. We are talking about
authorised staff, and not every member of staff will necessarily be so
authorised. It would be a targeted competence, supported by appropriate
training, which is not out of line—certainly in my
experience—with what schools and colleges often do now. It is
not exceptional. In the end, such judgments about training will be made
locally.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000205">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                              </span>
                           </strong> If I may relate back to my own training, I
remember going on day release to do a university of Manchester
certificate in education, which covered several modules, none of which
was related to the subject area that we are discussing. Nevertheless,
they were an investment that the college felt it was important to make
at the time. Training has some value, but I want to bring it back to
the issue of age. A young female teacher dealing with a young female
pupil in a primary school is a different scenario from a 19 or
20-year-old part-time student who has come into college from the pub on
a Friday afternoon and wants to behave in a way that they see fit, but
the teacher does not. Restraining or searching somebody in that
situation is a different thing, and it can never be dealt with through
training. It needs the discretion and judgment that the Minister has
mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> I accept that once again helpful intervention from
the hon. Gentleman. We have reached synthesis, because the intervention
was a helpful illustration of the fact that, because circumstances
vary, heads and principals must be allowed to use discretion in how
they apply the power. I will go further and say that college principals
should not be hampered with over-prescription from central Government
about how they should train their own staff to use the provisions. They
should have the freedom to take decisions in the light of their
particular needs and circumstances. They need the flexibility to ensure
that their staff get the training that benefits them the most. Remember
that colleges generally employ professional security staff, who will be
specifically trained in the conduct of searches. It is usual for them
to carry out a search if one is
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
that basis, it may be useful to tell the Committee that a recent
survey, carried out by the Association of Colleges, showed that, of the
16 colleges that responded, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 309<a class="bkMark" name="Column309">&#160;</a>
                           </div>four had carried out searches of students over the past year, and one
had carried out 89 searches during that time. By the way, all the
colleges reported instances of cyber-bullying in that period. Security
in colleges—the point that the hon. Gentleman referred
to—is often a different matter from security in schools. The
discretion that we are allowing, in what I described as a permissive
power, will facilitate appropriate responses to meet those particular
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
my hon. Friend the Minister said this morning in relation to schools,
when the powers to search for weapons were introduced in the Violent
Crime Reduction Act 2006, which we heard about earlier, and when they
were extended to include alcohol, illegal drugs and stolen items in the
Apprenticeship, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009—we both
served on that Bill Committee, and it seems like yesterday—a
training requirement was unnecessary and was regarded as such by the
previous Government when that legislation was debated prior to
enactment. There is no difference between our perspective on this and
theirs.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
23 would ensure that all students in further education institutions
were covered by the new powers to search students without consent,
regardless of their age. I dealt with age earlier. As has been
mentioned, we agree that the extended powers should apply to all
students. That reflects the existing statutory power that enables
college principals and authorised members of college staff to search
students without their consent for knives or weapons, controlled drugs
and stolen items. As I also said earlier, other than for alcohol, which
is not illegal if in the possession of someone aged 18 and over, there
is no age limit placed on the existing search
power.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000210">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">From
memory—this is not a rhetorical device—I believe that
that matter was discussed around age when earlier powers were
considered and introduced. This, in those terms, may be seen as
something of a reprise or a cover version—to rise to the
challenge offered by the hon. Member for Hartlepool when he was
speaking about his immense, eclectic, renaissance record collection.
<em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> I made that assumption because I
know he is a man of immense taste and breadth. As drafted, the extended
powers cover both over and under-18-year-olds. Any specific reference
to over and under-18-year-old students is redundant, and therefore the
amendment is unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On amendment
25, I understand the hon. Gentleman’s concerns that searches
without consent in colleges be conducted properly and with regard for
the safeguarding of students. However, as my hon. Friend the Minister
responsible for schools mentioned, it is not necessary or desirable to
define those terms in guidance. College staff, like school teachers,
are intelligent, sensible people who will know exactly what those items
mean in an everyday sense. That is important because of what I said
earlier about things being used as improvised
weapons.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000212">&#160;</a>

survey I described mentioned screwdrivers, keys and other things. When
something has been sharpened and is clearly being concealed for a
purpose, and could be used as a weapon, we have to make the reasonable
assumption that teachers and college staff will use their judgment with
the mitigating test of reasonableness that I described
earlier.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000213">&#160;</a>

my hon. Friend the Minister rightly pointed out, most of the terms
listed have been included since 2007, when the power for schools and
colleges to search pupils without consent for knives and weapons was
introduced through the 2006 Act. That Act enabled colleges to search

it gave them the power to use force to conduct a
search.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
agree with my hon. Friend the Minister that terms such as
“search”, “reasonable suspicion” and
“force” were well understood then, just as they are well
understood now. Colleges are responsible and professional institutions,
and we believe that they will exercise these powers with the diligence,
responsibility and wisdom that I have found is the norm when I have
visited colleges up and down the country since becoming a
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000218">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
move rapidly to my conclusion. I do not want to miss this point,
because it is important illustratively in dealing with some of the
issues raised—perfectly properly—by other hon. Members. A
practical example of where the provision would be helpful is when a
member of staff leads a field trip. Suppose they learn that one of the
students, known to have a connection with the local gang, is carrying a
small penknife that he believes is necessary for protection as he will
be passing through another gang’s area. In that situation, it
would not be practical for college staff to restrain the young man
until another member of staff, or the police, arrived. It makes more
sense that the law allows a member of staff to search that person or a
bag he is carrying. My hon. Friend the Minister referred to that in
relation to
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000219">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Two
misassumptions—I put it no more strongly than that—have
risked permeating our discussion. The first is that this is about only
the search of a person, when it might be about something the person is
carrying. The second is that there is an inherent difference between
what is held on an electronic device, and what might be held on a sheet
of paper in a book or in a desk. Those are not fundamental differences
in terms of their likely effect. They are differences of method, rather
than a difference of intent or
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000220">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is not possible for us to predict in every circumstance when it might
be necessary for a member of college staff to search a student without
a witness, but it is right that they can take immediate action to
ensure the safety of all concerned when such circumstances arise. I do
not want to go exhaustively through this, because we debated it at
length in relation to schools. I would add that the extended powers
have been welcomed by the Association

interventions rather than my own speech, we teased out some real leaps
in the dark. The Minister does not seem to be aware of the
circumstances in which powers will be used. Thanks to successful
interventions by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff West, we teased
out the idea that there is a lot of tension in the equivalence between
schools and colleges. There could be a position whereby a pupil
attending a school facing exactly the same circumstance will be dealt
with in a different way legally from someone in a further education
college.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000222">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We now move on to clause 4 about the exclusion of
pupils from schools in England. The proposals shows the difference
between government and opposition. There is a lot of detail and I do
not intend to be as lengthy as the Minister in the previous discussion.
That was a bit more “Bohemian Rhapsody” than some of the
shorter songs we might have had from him. Nevertheless, it was an
important debate and a tour de force of its kind by the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000231">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause shows the difference between opposition and government, because
when in opposition, Ministers were saying very different things from
what they propose here. They said they wanted the head teacher to be
the captain of the ship. Whether that was Captain Bligh or another,
they wanted the head teacher always to be the captain whose decisions
on exclusions could never be
gainsaid.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>Mario
Cuomo

prose.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000335">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>In
this instance, we could perhaps say that the Ministers campaigned in
rhetoric and are now trying to govern in reality, because the proposal
they have introduced is different from that which I have just
described. They are talking about a system in which there is an
exclusion panel of sorts, but with different powers from the previous
one.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
certainly believe that no child should have their learning disturbed by
poor discipline in the classroom, and that exclusion should always be a
last resort. When we were in government, teachers were given strong new
powers to ensure order and discipline, as has been acknowledged in the
Committee, and we had plans to strengthen home-school agreements to
make clear the responsibility that families and pupils also have in
ensuring good behaviour. We believe that every parent should agree to
the school’s behaviour rules, by signing a contract each year,
and should face real consequences if they fail to live up to the rules,
including the option of a court-imposed parenting order. Parents are a
crucial part of the equation, and there is a sense that they have been
forgotten in parts of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
were also working to improve alternative provision for excluded pupils,
and later in the Bill we will come to some of the Government’s
proposals on that. We also believed that more needed to be done to
tackle bullying in schools, which, as the Minister said, is a
significant cause of bad behaviour, in particular by investing in
anti-bullying interventions, including those to tackle homophobic
bullying. I welcome the personal commitment of the Minister with
responsibility for schools on that. I know that he recently visited
Schools Out, and having addressed that audience myself—I was the
first Minister ever to undertake that visit—I pay tribute to him
for taking on that task. It is a positive thing for him to have done.
The Government have talked a lot about that issue, but we are yet to
see real
action.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause has the potential to reduce parents’ rights by abolishing
both appeals panels and pupils’ ability to be reinstated by an
independent body, and replacing them with a review panel that cannot
require reinstatement. That is the gist of the clause that we seek to
amend here. There is concern from parents and others about safeguards
for vulnerable groups, such as children with special educational needs
and groups that have disproportionate levels of exclusion. It is not
entirely clear how removing 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 313<a class="bkMark" name="Column313">&#160;</a>
                           </div>a pupil’s chance of being reinstated on appeal will play out
legally. That was a concern that we had when in government, and the
legal advice that we received was that the problem with doing what the
Opposition at the time wanted the Labour Government to do was that it
was likely that many of the cases could end up in
court.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000236">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we will discuss later, on amendment 35, not many pupils are reinstated
in the way sought by the clause. There has occasionally been some
exaggeration of the problem, but the size of the headline is not always
related to the size of the problem. In combination with clause 6, which
repeals the duty on schools to enter into behaviour and attendance
partnerships, and which the Committee will debate at a later date, the
clause might be seen by some people as a signal to parents and pupils
that once a child is excluded they could be written off. Is it the
Government’s intention to have greater numbers of young people
in alternative provision and, in effect, prevent them from ever
returning to a mainstream school setting? I am sure the Minister will
want to share with the Committee his thoughts on that accusation, which
some have
made.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000237">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister reassure us that the clause, combined with clause 49,
which changes the name of short-stay schools back to pupil referral
units—an issue mentioned by the hon. Member for Bedford on
Tuesday—and clause 51, which enables alternative provision such
as pupil referral units to become academies, does not indicate that the
Government intend that excluded children will not return to mainstream
education? Can he enlighten us on his intentions in this
clause?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000238">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have not heard a great deal about what the Government intend to do to
offer the kind of support and one-to-one assistance to help prevent bad
behaviour before it starts and to bring children back on track once
they have been excluded from school. It would be very useful to hear
from the Minister on that point. Obviously we will debate the details
of these points as we progress through the Bill, but in the meantime it
would be helpful if the Minister could set out now in some detail his
position on exclusions and on tackling bad behaviour before exclusions
become necessary, while ensuring the protection of vulnerable
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000239">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause creates these new exclusion panels, which do not have the power
to insist on reinstatement. Could the Minister explain why a head
teacher under any circumstances would refuse to carry out the
recommendation of a panel after it had recommended reinstatement under
his new provisions? Would a panel ever recommend the reinstatement of a
pupil because certain issues had not been taken into account or because
certain procedures had not been followed? Would it ever be unreasonable
to recommend the reinstatement? If the panel would always be reasonable
in acting in that way, because it has to consider whether this could be
challengeable by judicial review, does the Minister intend to allow
head teachers to be unreasonable in refusing to allow a pupil back into
the school? If he could square that logical circle for us we would be
very
grateful.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000240">&#160;</a>

                           </div>about the amendments because it is difficult to understand what they are
driving at. Amendment 34 talks about new powers for school staff in
clause 4 but there are no new powers in the clause. It is about the
independent review panel. So I should like to take the opportunity to
explain why we are removing independent appeal panels and replacing
them with independent review
panels.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000241">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
2008-09 just under half of all permanent exclusions were for violent or
abusive behaviour. The latest figures show that independent appeals
panels overruled head teachers on exclusions in a quarter of the cases
they heard. In the cases where the head teacher was overruled, one
third of the pupils were then returned to the school from which they
were excluded. We believe that is unacceptable, notwithstanding the
fact that the absolute figure we are talking about is relatively small
compared with the overall number of exclusions and the overall number
of
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000242">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
possible reinstatement of an excluded pupil, however rarely that
happens, can seriously undermine a head teacher’s authority.
That may create a deterrent to other head teachers that could prevent
them from excluding a child when it is right and necessary to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000243">&#160;</a>

which I have figures—640 appeals were lodged. That represents
about one tenth of permanent exclusions. Some 590 of those appeals were
heard, of which around a quarter—150 appeals—were
determined in favour of the parent. Ultimately, 60 of those pupils were
reinstated. Those 60 pupils can cause damage in one year to 60
different schools around the country. One pupil returning can hugely
undermine authority in a school in that year. I refer the hon.

will explore the reasons why that might not be so, including perhaps
whether the child’s situation was not fully understood. To

institutions in our country. They do not permanently exclude their

the Minister’s current contribution—I had to nip out
briefly. Does he genuinely believe that head teachers will continue to
use the same discretion as they do now, knowing that pupils could be
reinstated if a panel felt that they were wrongly excluded? Does he
make any distinction between a head teacher excluding a pupil because
they are a nuisance, and it is convenient to do so knowing that they
cannot be reinstated, and a pupil who—as in the case
cited—might be a genuine danger to other pupils and has used a
knife in the past? To exclude the latter would be perfectly
reasonable.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000252">&#160;</a>

know that the decisions they take about whether to exclude a pupil
permanently, or for a fixed term, have an important effect on that
child’s future. I have not yet met a head teacher who says,
“If a child comes into school dressed improperly, I permanently
exclude them. If their exam results look like they might damage my
league table position, I just exclude a whole class
permanently.” I have never come across a teacher who says that,
nor have I come across clear evidence that this happens. I do not
believe it is happening. It is important to trust head
teachers.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000255">&#160;</a>

therefore have extremely high regard for them. I am quite confused by

that head teachers would never exclude in a way that was inappropriate
or open to challenge and scrutiny—which an independent panel
would seek to determine—what is the purpose of retaining the

might be made, but it is important that parents have some recourse if
they believe that their child was wrongly excluded. That is the purpose
of the independent review panel, which thereby minimises the chance of
judicial review. That is the key point: there is an avenue for parents
to go down after they have been through the procedures with the
school’s governing body, and so on. They can have their day at
the independent review panel and that minimises the risk of judicial
review, but ultimately none of that process will undermine the
authority of the head teacher, and that is what we are trying to

picture the Minister is envisaging. Surely if he is concerned about the
head teacher’s authority, a panel that decides that a head
teacher has made the wrong decision and yet cannot reinstate the pupil
undermines the head teacher as much as a panel that says it was the
appropriate thing to do? I am unsure how the Minister thinks this will
avoid a judicial review process if a panel consistently finds that a
head teacher is making the wrong decisions. Surely that opens up more
avenues for judicial review, not less? It seems to be a confused
process.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000259">&#160;</a>

difference. Authority is not undermined by a panel recommending that
the governing body looks again at whether the child should have been
reinstated. The authority of the head is undermined by the child that
Sally Coates referred to, who having committed a very serious offence
then comes back into the school. That is what undermines authority, and
it happened on 60 occasions in 2008-09. Therefore, assuming
all of those cases were at separate schools, 60 schools have had their
authority undermined in one year. That is the problem that we are
trying to address with the

say, “This is the wrong choice for this pupil, but we cannot do
anything about it.” The young person’s educational

the decision, recommend that the body reconsiders it or, if it
considers that the decision is flawed, quash the decision and direct
the governing body to reconsider. Panels may come to one of three
conclusions. If it is the latter, and the governing body reconsiders
but decides that relations between the teacher, the head teacher and
the child have so deteriorated that despite the quashing of the
decision, it still does not want the child to be reinstated, the school
or academy will face financial penalties. The money will follow the

professional people, such as ex-head teachers, not Mrs Miggins off the
street. They have worked in schools and know the situations. Can the
Minister think of any other incident where an independent body of
usually similar colleagues and professionals would be disregarded after
it had been asked to look at decisions, or where nothing happens after
the decision made by a group of people, such as head teachers, is
judged to be incorrect by an independent
panel?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000263">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The decisions of the independent review panel will
not be disregarded. For example, if the decision is quashed, the
child’s record is changed so that the exclusion will not count
when they choose a new school. If a child has had two exclusions, the
parent will no longer be able to choose the new school that the child
will go to, but if the decision is quashed by the independent review
panel, that will not count as an exclusion. The child’s record
will be amended to show that they have not been excluded. Therefore, if
a decision is quashed by the review panel, there will be consequences
to alleviate the problem for the
child.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000264">&#160;</a>

too many of our schools, and we must take some serious action to
resolve that. Children are being seriously bullied—there were
20,000 calls to ChildLine last year, and some 340 of the callers were
contemplating suicide. We hear from teachers’ unions about the
low-level disruption that permeates our schools and results in nearly
half of young people leaving secondary education without English and
maths GCSEs. The problems that we are trying to address are serious.

excluded by the head teacher and governing body. That could create a
difficulty with safety in the school, with the rest of the school and

judicial review are often about reconsidering, rather than a direction.
We are trying to use the same approach with the independent review

Minister has made about the seriousness of bullying and other such
behaviour, but we need to test the proposal to see whether it works.
The hon. Member for Stevenage rightly pointed out that there are
financial penalties under the measure. The Minister has said that the
money will follow the pupil into the new placement. If a head teacher
refused to reinstate following the quashing of a decision, could the
financial penalty exceed the cost of that pupil’s education
after he had left the
school?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000269">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think that I mis-spoke earlier. The penalty will
go to the local authority, rather than follow the pupil directly to the
alternative provision. We have said that the figure will be in the

progress. I have said that we believe that an orderly and safe

committed to backing head teachers’ authority when
pupils’ behaviour warrants exclusion. The clause will remove
independent appeal panels, so that violent and disruptive pupils will
no longer be reinstated in schools. We still wish, of course, to ensure
that exclusions are carried out fairly and we want to provide
safeguards for vulnerable pupils.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000271">&#160;</a>

a fine of £4,000, plus the loss of the individual pupil funding,

ever met wants to do the best for all their pupils, regardless of a
child’s special needs or behavioural problems and so on.

unable to help that child with their behavioural
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000284">&#160;</a>

of the Bill—and we are only on clause 4. Will the Minister
explain why, with the provisions on searching pupils, there is the need
to provide powers that might be used rarely, but also the need to
recognise the fact that there might be exceptions when it is relevant
to do so? Is it not a concern, therefore, that head teachers might look
at their balance sheets and see a financial incentive to exclude
children with additional needs?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000285">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a judgment we have made, and we have talked
to head teachers about the penalty. If it is too high, there is the
worry of head teachers having that penalty imposed on them through no
fault of their own. Even head teachers who are determined to obey the
procedures for excluding a child, and who fully expect any appeal by
the review panel to go in their favour, might still be deterred from
excluding a child for fear of receiving a large penalty that would
affect the school. I think that the balance is right between imposing a
penalty for making a decision that is then quashed by the independent
review panel, and not deterring head teachers from taking the
professional decisions that they feel are in the school’s
interests.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000286">&#160;</a>

broadly the same manner as independent appeals panels. One important
new safeguard for vulnerable children is that parents will be allowed

Additionally, parents will be able to bring disability discrimination
cases on permanent exclusions to the first-tier tribunal. Parents may
continue to bring disability discrimination cases on fixed-term
exclusions to the first-tier tribunal, as they have always done.

want to support our head teachers fully to maintain classroom disciple
through excluding disruptive pupils when necessary, improving the

will be placed in more appropriate teaching environments. The clause
will help head teachers maintain discipline in their schools. There
are, however, no additional powers for school staff in the

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the consultation with heads that the Minister mentioned, to the best of
my knowledge the details are not on the Department’s website.
Can he share with us the details of how that consultation took place,
which heads were consulted and whether it was done simply through
associations or with all heads throughout the country? It was the first
I knew of that departmental consultation. I wonder if he could fill the
Committee in on the details. Can he share with the Opposition the
evidence sent into the consultation by the consultees? As part of the
consultation process that the hon. Gentleman had with head teachers
about the proposals, did the Minister also consult parents,
parents’ groups, young people, children and groups representing
them?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000299">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Our
exchanges revealed an interesting point about pupil premium. It
appears—perhaps the Minister can confirm this—that a
pupil excluded by a school, if the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 322<a class="bkMark" name="Column322">&#160;</a>
                           </div>exclusion is confirmed by the governors, can go along to the review
panel, which, if it finds that the pupil has particular needs that were
not taken fully in account when the exclusion was made, can send back a
quashing, as it is put in the Bill, of the decision made by the head
teacher and the governors to exclude the pupil, because insufficient
regard was given to the pupil’s circumstances; however, the head
teacher can then refuse to reinstate the pupil for some reason, despite
the fact that the review panel, using the sort of tests applied in
judicial review, has found that it would be unreasonable to do so, and
the head teacher taking that decision can be content that the pupil
premium associated with the pupil remains in his or her budget. Perhaps
I have misunderstood, but that seems to me to be a bizarre
outcome.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000300">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister said that he is keeping the matter under review, but I suggest
it needs more than a review. It would be perverse in the extreme if a
pupil was excluded after a review panel had judged that such action was
unreasonable and the pupil premium associated with that pupil remained
in the school budget. He referred to the figure of £4,000, which
will be the financial penalty or the fine—he is not allowed to
use that word, but I am—that the school will face for acting in
that unreasonable manner. I take his point about wanting to have
something that did not leave head teachers in an impossible position,
otherwise the proposal would be pointless, but why did he not say
instead—taking on board the point made by my hon. Friend the
Member for North West Durham—that the financial penalty would be
at least the sum calculated by the review panel to be necessary to find
the child a suitable placement with suitable support for whatever the
special needs that the panel found were so pressing that it quashed the
decision of the head teacher to proceed with the exclusion? That would
not be unreasonable and it would certainly not constitute a scuppering
of the Minister’s policy.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000301">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Consideration
should be given to the pupil’s interests, particularly if the
review panel quashed the decision to exclude the pupil because some
circumstances had not been taken fully into account. A financial
penalty that was guaranteed to at least cover the cost of finding a
suitable placement that meets the needs identified for the pupil seems
a much more logical way of looking at the problem. Did the Minister
consider that during the consultation, details of which we have not
seen? Did he consult on it with head teachers when preparing for the
Bill? Before we consider how to dispose of the amendments, will the
Minister respond to those
points?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000302">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Just for clarification and in an effort to be
helpful to the Minister, may I make it clear that the statement of
costs of children with SEN can be massive? Some local authorities have
£250,000 students. We are not talking about the statemented
costs. We are talking about the costs that would normally accrue to a
school for meeting the additional needs of a pupil, not those that
would come in addition to what any normal school would be able to
provide.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000303">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As ever, that is a very helpful clarification
from my hon. Friend. Given that the pupil and the review panel would
have just been through a close examination of his or her needs in
considering whether the exclusion ought to be quashed, a wealth of
information

                           </strong> I will write to the hon. Gentleman about the
consultation, but he should be aware that the White Paper clearly
spelled out the proposal for the independent review panel, which we
consulted on extensively. The decision on the £4,000 was a
balance of simplicity, avoiding complexity and bureaucracy, and giving
head teachers the certainty that the worst possible outcome if things
went wrong was a penalty of £4,000. Ultimately, the head teacher
has to ensure that his school can function within its budget, and when
taking decisions, he has to weigh up what can possibly go wrong. We
wanted to create certainty and simplicity, and a £4,000 penalty
is the best decision, taking into account the average age-weighted unit
of funding.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000305">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> One of the most important issues is transparency
and visibility of what goes on in schools. Opposition Members are right
to ask about situations in which someone is not behaving in the right
way. Those people may be a tiny minority, but we need a system that
deals with them none the less. As long as it is possible to see the
data, people will be able to assess the school. What are the
Government’s plans for publicising, on a per-school basis, the
data on children excluded for a fixed period or
permanently?<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000306">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We will come to those provisions in the course of
our debates, but my hon. Friend makes a good point. The problem with
exclusions is that the numbers on a per-school basis are very small,
and there is always a problem with publishing such small figures,
because the convention is that if there are less than a certain number,
we put an x in the published data tables, so that pupils cannot be
identified. We do that with GCSE results and all kinds of data
published by the Department. We are publishing ever more data about
schools, such as financial data, because we want to be as open and
transparent as possible about all the achievement and expenditure
figures available to the Department, which should also be available to
schools. I think that I

                           </strong> It is highly embarrassing. The Chair of the
Education Committee is correct about that—not that Government
Members were ever in the same position when in
opposition.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000310">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Before
I ask the Committee’s permission to withdraw the amendment, I
want to say that as the Minister confirmed, about 60 young people,
according to the latest figures we have available, will probably end up
in this position in any given year. If the Government majority is going
to put the measure through as it stands, the Minister needs to consider
whether he first wants to think carefully about what happens to the
pupil premium. He said that he will keep it under review, but he may
need to do more than that and think a bit more urgently about how it
works in the context of the
proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000311">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
he needs to look at the fine—he calls it the financial
penalty—and tie it more realistically to the needs of pupils who
are in those circumstances. I understand his desire to give the strong
message that head teachers have been given the authority that they said
they needed, but a young person’s life is involved in the head
teacher making that decision, which he is doing after a review panel
has quashed the exclusion. It is therefore probably pretty logical for
the financial penalty to bear some relationship to the cost of
providing suitable support to the pupil who is to be excluded despite
the review panel’s views. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1103117000312">&#160;</a>
