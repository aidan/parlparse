point of order, Mr. Bayley. I am grateful for that ruling,
which relates to my point of order and which I anticipated to some
degree. I would like to add, however&#151;and I seek your guidance on
this&#151;that a member of this Committee was apparently engaged in
dialogue with someone in the Public Gallery during that sitting, which

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000713"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):
						</b> I trust
that we are all refreshed and invigorated. By way of recap,
Mr. Bayley, clause 76 introduces a new definition of
independent educational institutions. The new definition includes
independent schools providing full-time education for pupils of
compulsory school age. It also includes part-time institutions that are
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column768" />Column number: 768</div>main provider of a child&#146;s education, as defined by the number of
hours of operation per week over a period of weeks in one
year.</div>
					<a name="0802298000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be
helpful if I took this opportunity to respond to some of the points
made when we opened the debate this morning, which were mainly about
home education and comments made by home educators in response to our
consultation. I will explain how current education law and proposed
changes in the Bill affect home educators.</div>
					<a name="0802298000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 7 of the Education Act
1996 requires the parents of every child of compulsory school age to
cause their child to receive&#151;by regular attendance at school or
otherwise&#151;efficient, full-time education suitable to that
child&#146;s age, ability and aptitude and to any special educational
needs they may have. &#147;Otherwise&#148; in this context may be
education at home or in an institution that is not registered as a
school.</div>
					<a name="0802298000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">During 2007,
we commissioned research to assess the number of children educated at
home. The researchers estimated that around 20,000 were known to local
authorities, but that there could be a further 20,000 or more who had
not identified themselves to their local authorities. A home is not an
institution, and our policy is clear. When parents deliver or supervise
education that takes place in the home, they are not conducting an
independent educational institution.</div>
					<a name="0802298000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">We clarified arrangements for
monitoring home education in November 2007, publishing the document the
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to,
&#147;Elective Home Education Guidelines for Local
Authorities.&#148; That underwent extensive consultation, generating
over 900 responses, most of them from home educators who have a keen
interest in legislation that could affect their freedoms. I am pleased
to say that home educators broadly welcomed the guidelines. Only 4 per
cent. of respondents to the consultation thought the guidelines
unhelpful.</div>
					<a name="0802298000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">A small
number of parents opt to educate otherwise than at school, using
unregistered settings where children are supervised and taught by
adults who are not their parents. Tyndale Academy&#151;which I
mentioned in response to questioning from the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton&#151;is one such institution. Tyndale has
varied its hours over the years, but its website currently states that
it is a tuition group that operates from 9 am to 2 pm, five days per
week. Earlier I named the other three institutions, which we have
referred to in parliamentary questions and
elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="0802298000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">In all four
cases, children attend for a substantial part of the school day and are
not supervised by their parents. If the institutions were registered
independent schools, they would be registered and inspected against the
regulatory framework introduced in September 2003, following the
Education Act 2002. That framework ensures that all children in
registered schools have suitable learning opportunities in a safe and
secure learning environment. The requirement to register part-time
institutions, which are not currently subject to any regulatory or
monitoring framework, will ensure that the same safeguards are in place
for children in those settings. Should such a part-time institution use
corporal punishment, for example, that would then be regulated and the
law outlawing corporal punishment applied. The clause applies to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column769" />Column number: 769</div>institutions that provide 12.5 hours for primary-age children and 15
hours for secondary-age children, for 28 weeks a year or more. That
equates to more than half of a typical school week for more than half
of the school year. The institutions are providing the majority of a
child&#146;s education, and it is therefore right that they meet the
minimum standards.</div>
					<a name="0802298000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
independent school standards are flexible and are adapted successfully
to a wide range of settings, including Steiner
schools, schools following the curriculum of other countries,
pupil-referral-type provision and schools that cater for children with
severe learning difficulties. There is no question of independent
schools having to follow the national curriculum or employ teachers
with specific qualifications, and therefore no reputable institution
should have difficulty complying with the statutory
requirements.</div>
					<a name="0802298000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to opposition from
consultees to extending the scope of regulation to part-time education
institutions. I agree that there was opposition, but it came mainly
from home educators who thought&#151;wrongly&#151;that the
proposals would affect home education. In our first consultation in
November 2006, 156 of the 175 respondents identified themselves as home
educators, individuals or &#147;others&#148;. Local authorities and
registered independent schools were in favour of our proposals.
Respondents who disagreed with the consultation proposals were worried
about how we would define &#147;a major part&#148; of a
child&#146;s education. My Department responded to those concerns by
issuing a second consultation in August 2007, which made it
clear&#151;we thought&#151;that home education was to be excluded
from the proposed changes. However, 50 per cent. of the responses were
from home educators who opposed the proposed changes because they
thought that the changes might restrict their freedom to come together
to deliver group activities as part of a home education programme.
There were also objections from sporting bodies which thought that
sport or other supplementary provision might be caught by the new
definition. Therefore, in drawing up the legislation we paid close
attention to those representations. The Committee will see that we no
longer attempt to define the main provider on the face of the Bill,
because that would be open to misinterpretation. Rather, the definition
works by reference to a lower bound of hours, as I have set
out.</div>
					<a name="0802298000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Bognor Regis referred to the policy statement on clause 76. It is
not the intention of the proposals to remove parents&#146; rights to
educate their children at home. Home education, supervised or delivered
by parents, either in the family home or elsewhere, and any
arrangements used by parents to supplement home education which do not
exceed the thresholds, will not be included in the regulatory regime.
Some parents supplement home education with provision that includes
group tuition by private tutors employed by parents, or tuition by
groups of home educators themselves, for drama, sport or music. Only
where a parent is delegating responsibility that exceeds the minimum
hours thresholds will that provision be subject to the regulatory
regime.</div>
					<a name="0802298000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further,
to ensure that no provision is unintentionally caught by the new
definition of independent educational institutions, clause 76 provides
for certain settings to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column770" />Column number: 770</div>excluded. Those exclusions will definitely apply to hospital schools, to
home tutorial services organised by a local authority, and to home
education&#151;a point I reinforce because some people involved in
that activity clearly find it difficult to believe what we say. More
detail is given in the policy statement that I circulated this week to
the Committee.</div>
					<a name="0802298000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
settings that either do not meet the proposed threshold or are not the
main provider will remain outside the definition of an independent
educational institution. Examples are summer schools, sports clubs,
music tuition, and revision and study support groups undertaken in
support of a child&#146;s main education. I say yet again, to be
absolutely clear, that we do not believe home education is affected by
the definition.</div>
					<a name="0802298000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that the proposals strike the right balance between protecting
children and ensuring that they receive a good education, and allowing
parents to make arrangements that they believe are in the best
interests of their child. They leave a parent&#146;s right to home
educate intact and ensure regulation for all settings in which a
material part of a child&#146;s education is delegated to others. On
the basis of those many reassurances and answers to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s many and varied questions, I hope that he will be
happy to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0802298000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000714"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> We may not think people are listening to our debate,
but during the lunch break I had a couple of e-mails from people who
were listening, regarding our proceedings just before lunch. There is a
concern among home educators that, if they form a group of parents to
educate their children collectively, and exceed 12.5 hours of primary
education or 15 hours of secondary education, they will
constitute an independent institution and will therefore require to be
inspected. The Minister confirmed that in his response. That is a
concern to home educators, because they do group together and provide
education on a collective basis, and they do not believe that that
should be considered a
school.</div>
					<a name="0802298000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000715"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> This Government have been responsible for the
parent-promoted Elmgreen school. It is the policy of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s party also to encourage parent-promoted schools.
Does he think that they should be
regulated?</div>
					<a name="0802298000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000716"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> Yes, because they are schools. Parents who get
together because they want to home educate their children&#151;which
they are entitled to do under the law&#151;do not wish those
institutions to become schools with all the expense that that would
entail.</div>
					<a name="0802298000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000717"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> How then would the hon. Gentleman differentiate
between a parent-promoted school and one where parents have come
together to form an institution for home
education?</div>
					<a name="0802298000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000718"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> It need not be an institution&#151;just parents
getting together to home educate their children. It is difficult to be
an expert in maths, geography and science. A group of parents may well
get together and collectively educate those children in one of their
homes, and this provision will mean that that will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column771" />Column number: 771</div>constitute an independent educational institution. That is why home
educators are concerned, and the Minister has done nothing to alleviate
that concern. As for health and safety, as one of my e-mail
correspondents this morning said, there is already plenty of
legislation under which local authorities can intervene if they feel
there are safety issues affecting
children.</div>
					<a name="0802298000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000719"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> I hope that it will help those listening if I say
that the regulation will exclude those arrangements where parents are,
collectively, as a sort of mutual organisation, educating each
other&#146;s children, and the parents themselves are present.
However, if it starts to look like an institution, I think it fair and
reasonable that it should be regulated as an
institution.</div>
					<a name="0802298000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000720"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> I do not think that that will alleviate concerns
either, because parents may well wish to employ specialist
teachers&#151;a music or piano teacher, for example&#151;to assist
with their tasks. When there are legislative changes, I like to know
what problem the regulation is seeking to solve. What problems has the
Minister become aware of that have led him to propose the clause? If he
can reply, I have a number of other questions on that
point.</div>
					<a name="0802298000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000721"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> To give an example, I am aware of one institution,
currently unregulated, that practises corporal punishment. That is
illegal and it should be
regulated.</div>
					<a name="0802298000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000722"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> That brings me to the real purpose of the clause,
which is to deal with one particular institution: the Tyndale Academy.
Because of that, it is dragging into these provisions 20,000 or 40,000
or&#151;according to some estimates, 50,000&#151;home-school
educators in this country. I do not have a view one way or the other. I
have not visited the Tyndale Academy. I have just received submissions
from it that I think ought to be aired. The principal of Tyndale
Academy, Ferris Lindsay, has written to my hon. Friend the Member for
Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) stating that the Department&#146;s first
step was to write to Tyndale in an officious manner, and that the
academy was threatened with criminal prosecution if it failed to
register within 30 days. After that threat was withdrawn, the
Department started consulting on the
measures.</div>
					<a name="0802298000677"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div>
					<a name="0802298000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principal
says that the academy believes that it is being victimised by the
Department in an officious, over-zealous way and that that has led to
this clause, which is designed to deal with only that one institution.
He states:</div>
					<a name="0802298000099"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
reason for such single-minded resolution on the part of the DCSF has,
we believe, been because of an unstated aversion to the discipline
policy at Tyndale.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
further
states:</div>
					<a name="0802298000101"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;With
parental permission, tutors at Tyndale are able to use a smack on the
hand to correct a persistently disobedient child. This sanction was
used about a dozen times during the academic year 2005-06. The
Department recognises the legality of the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column772" />Column number: 772</div>situation and, rather than prosecute the proprietor, it has sought to
embrace the provision at Tyndale under a framework that would render
the policy illegal.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
academy believes that that is a misuse of departmental power and
resources. There have been several hundred pieces of correspondence
between the Department, the school, the local authority and the Member
of Parliament for that
area.</div>
					<a name="0802298000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0802298000723"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Oliver Heald</b> (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con): Can my hon.

levels are like at that
academy?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000724"></a>Mr.

with good behaviour and academic
standards.</div>
					<a name="0802298000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister respond to the point that the institution can use minor
corporal punishment if it has parental permission, but that it will no
longer be able to do so if it becomes an educational institution,
because it will be subject to the rule that corporal punishment cannot
be used in schools? At the moment, as a collective of parents, it can
do that with their permission. Is that not the drive behind the
clause?</div>
					<a name="0802298000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000725"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I do not propose to get drawn into a specific
discussion on the Tyndale Academy because we are not proposing the
legislation merely to deal with one institution. As we have already set
out, it would currently apply to four
institutions.</div>
					<a name="0802298000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
set out previously to the Committee, our intention is to ensure that,
if a child is receiving the majority of their education somewhere that
could be defined as an institution, it is safe and secure. If any one
of those institutions were to operate at fewer than the number of hours
that we have specified, I have set out the circumstances in which that
would become unregulated activity. It is then up to those parents what
goes on there, as long as it is within the law with respect to

views expressed to me and others by the academy about the clause and
the activities of the Department over the last couple of years, which
seem to have been over-zealous and officious towards the school. It is
in a deprived part of London and is providing a much higher quality of

of the Bill restates Part 10 Chapter 1 of the Education Act 2002, with

to independent educational institutions in England. Chapter 1 of part
10 of the Education Act 2002, which sets out the current statutory
framework for independent schools in England and Wales, will be amended
by the Bill so that it no longer applies to independent schools in
England. In its place, the provisions in part 4 of the Bill will come
into force, subject to the will of Parliament. Those are the
substantive issues that we will come on to discuss in detail.</div>
					<a name="0802298000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current regulatory regime
set out in the 2002 Act will continue to apply to independent schools
in Wales, but hon. Members might have noticed that the Government have
tabled an amendment to provide a framework power for the National
Assembly for Wales&#151;I think that it is contained in a new clause
to replace clause 132. That will provide the legislative competence for
the Assembly to make legislation relating to the regulation and
inspection of schools in the independent sector. The framework power
will allow the Assembly to develop an approach to monitoring the
education provided in Welsh independent schools in a manner that meets
the needs of Wales. It will also enable the Assembly to make changes
comparable to those made for England if it decides after further
consideration and consultation to do so.</div>

very good management. Despite educating only 7 per cent. of children in
this country, rising to about 12 per cent. at sixth form, it achieves
62.8 per cent. of all A grades in A-level physics. There are similar
figures for biology and chemistry. As Christine Ryan, the Chief

contrast, has been heavily criticised by Ofsted, which complains that
49 per cent. of secondary schools are not good enough, to use the words
of the Government. Why the Government, therefore, feel it necessary to
legislate on standards of management and leadership in the independent

						</b> That is a suspicion that the most cynical would
have. When there are statistics available that show that, while
educating only about 10 per cent. of the population, independent
schools achieve 65 per cent. of the A-level A grades in the sciences,
there could be a view that the way to remove those benchmark
comparisons is to lower the standards in the independent sector. That
is if the people who oppose private education cannot abolish it
altogether, which is the view of a minority.</div>
					<a name="0802298000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ISC document goes on to say

					<a name="0802298000594"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we do
question why it is necessary for there to be a standard to this effect

caused concern amongst member

					<a name="0802298000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
quote from paragraph 81, the ISC&#146;s particular concern is that if
the standard</div>
					<a name="0802298000595"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is being
introduced to cope with poor management in a minority of non-ISC
schools, it might be argued that any standard aimed at this problem

because of the reason for its introduction, the Government was to set a

that.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
main concern expressed by the ISC about the new management standard is
that of homogenisation&#151;the point my hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Hertfordshire was alluding to. It says:</div>
					<a name="0802298000597"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ISC would have a
fundamental objection to any standard which sought to impose particular
styles of leadership or a framework or criteria which required schools
to conform to one organisation&#146;s view of how schools should be
managed. The RIA, for example, refers to schools being required under
the new standard to appoint particular
teachers.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Independent Schools Inspectorate itself therefore opposes this new
management standard. Page 9 of its written response
says:</div>
					<a name="0802298000598"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We do
not agree with the proposal as
drafted.</div>
					<a name="0802298000599"></a><div class="hs_brev">The ISI
framework for inspection already includes a requirement to make
judgements and report on the quality of a school&#146;s leadership
and management. Evidence from inspections shows that the management of
most ISC schools is of good quality, much of it excellent...Clear
mechanisms are already in place under the ISI/ISC system for ensuring
that any required improvements are made by the school following an
inspection.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the ISI goes on to
say:</div>
					<a name="0802298000600"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If no
other mechanism can be found for dealing with the small number of
schools needing improvement then the management standard would need to
be written in such a way that it did not weaken the expectation of high
standards already required in ISC
schools.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, it
makes the important point that</div>
					<a name="0802298000601"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The standard should not
require schools to operate a particular style of management, and care
should be taken to reflect the very diverse nature of schools within

					<a name="0802298000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern of
the independent sector about this new management standard is best
summed up by Jonathan Shephard, the chief executive of the ISC, who, in

said:</div>
					<a name="0802298000602"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is
a concern about creeping regulation and Ofsted-isation... if you
have Ofsted imposing a management standard on all independent schools,
then the way in which the schools are run will tend to conform with
that standard. You may or may not like independent schools... but
they do educate children at all levels of ability in a very good,
effective and workmanlike way. They do that because they are able to be
flexible and responsive and they have to answer to... parents,
children and universities. If you get a one-size-fits-all, increasingly
prescriptive manner from Ofsted...you may lose that flexibility
and independence and that is a very serious
worry.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Education and Skills

					<a name="0802298000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am astonished
by the hostile reaction to this proposal from the very respectable and
statutory body, the ISI. It is very surprising that the Minister and
the Department are proceeding with this measure, given the opposition
to it from the ISI, the very body that will be charged with
implementing and enforcing it. I wonder whether this reflects the
hostility to the independent sector from the Minister or the Department
or whether old Labour is simply exerting its influence in the dying
months of this Government. Amendment No. 123 seeks to delete the new
standard from the Bill. I hope that, on reflection, the Minister will
give it his support.</div>

							<a name="0802298000741"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> At earlier sittings, the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton introduced amendments on
behalf of the National Union of Teachers. He has now returned to a more
natural bedfellow in advocating so strongly for the Independent Schools
Council. He has been a passionate and consistent advocate of
independent schools in this House. I have no criticism of the standards
of members of the ISC. I have no wish to be vindictive, or any of the
other adjectives that he may have used, towards him. My Department has
considerable experience of the operation of the current regulatory
regime for all independent schools, not just those inspected by the ISI
or members of the ISC.</div>
					<a name="0802298000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulatory regime was put in
place through the 2002 Education Act. Standards have contributed to
raising standards across the board in the independent sector and that
is carried forward in the Bill. Inspections against the standards have
found that in poor schools sustained failure to meet the minimum
requirements is generally a result of weak and ineffective leadership.
To address that, clause 78 introduces an additional standard, relating
to the quality of leadership and management in an institution. The
Thomas Francis Academy, which is not a member of the ISC, I hasten to
add, had a case that went to the Care Standards Tribunal recently. It
was ordered that that institution should be removed from the register
and closed. There was discussion at the tribunal in that case about
weak management and leadership having caused the
problems.</div>
					<a name="0802298000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Putting
a new standard on the face of primary legislation will send a clear
message across the whole sector that effective leadership and
management are crucial to an institution&#146;s successful operation.
Inspection evidence shows that there is a need for transparent
standards that secure effective strategic management and leadership,
enabling institutions to meet the other required standards. The new
standard should also ensure that institutions introduce management
systems and other mechanisms to make and sustain improvements where
standards are not
met.</div>
					<a name="0802298000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
referred to the ISC&#146;s argument in oral evidence that it is a low
minimum standard and that it will encourage schools with high standards
to lower the bar, effectively coming down to a lowest common
denominator&#151;to the minimum required by regulation. I simply do
not accept that argument. Many independent schools are rightly proud of
their high standards of education, welfare and premises, which are well
above the minimum specified in regulation and in other
standards.</div>
					<a name="0802298000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Mr. Shephard intimated when giving evidence, the best
independent schools are not driven by the basic standards currently
regulated for, and set out in legislation. Rather, he said,
they</div>
					<a name="0802298000603"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have to respond to
three demanding constituencies: parents, children and
universities.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
absolutely confident that the high standards of management and
leadership currently enjoyed by those schools will continue,
irrespective of any change in legislation.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Gordon Marsden</b> (Blackpool, South) (Lab): I entirely agree
with the position that my hon. Friend takes. As it happens, I also
agree with the overall 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column778" />Column number: 778</div>consensus of comments on independent schools. Does he agree that, in the
current economic climate, a proportion of independent schools, albeit a
small proportion, whether or not they are members of the ISC, face
considerable economic pressure? In those circumstances, it is important
for the reputation of the sector as a whole as well as for the
protection of parents that minimum standards should apply across the
piece.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000743"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I certainly agree with my hon. Friend that it is
important to have minimum standards, so that parents can be sure of
that minimum. However, it is not a standard that everyone has to fall
to. In responding effectively to the market, which is what they
generally want to do, independent schools will seek to out-compete each
other on the basis of their standards.
</div>
					<a name="0802298000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also heard, in the
words of the witness and of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, that the new standards are a further sign of
&#147;Ofstedisation&#148;&#151;a slightly ugly word&#151;and
the &#147;creeping regulation&#148; of independent schools; the
word &#147;homogenised&#148; was used. For ISC-affiliated schools,
it will usually be the Independent Schools Inspectorate and not Ofsted
that considers the ongoing quality of leadership and management
standards in an institution. If necessary, it will be for Ofsted to act
on the basis of the evidence provided in these reports. That is
extremely unlikely for the 50 per cent. or so ISI-inspected independent
schools because, as we have heard, they all do an extremely good
job.</div>
					<a name="0802298000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new standard
is designed to address the failings of smaller, poor-quality
institutions, which are inspected by Ofsted. Unless we introduce the
new standard, Ofsted will be prevented from reporting on
leadership and management failings in those institutions, leading to
the prolonged regulatory action that we see now.</div>
					<a name="0802298000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not optimistic, but I hope
that my reassurances will have persuaded the hon. Member for Bognor

						</b> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that some
independent schools are inspected by other inspectorates&#151;the
School Improvement Service, the Bridge Schools Inspectorate and other
independent inspectorates. We are making provision in the Bill to allow
others to be approved and regulated to allow quality assurance. Does he
not see the merit in having a minimum standard that will have no impact
on Independent School Council members but which will give reassurance
across the whole
sector?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000746"></a>Mr.

						</b> The purpose of having an independent inspectorate is
that it can apply its own standards. We therefore have Ofsted
inspecting the inspectorate to ensure that inspections are carried out
in accordance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column779" />Column number: 779</div>with those standards. Provided we are happy with the standards of the
independent inspectorates, it should be left alone.</div>
					<a name="0802298000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The real concern is the phrasing
in the regulatory impact assessment that schools should be
&#147;required&#148; to appoint particular teachers. For example, a
school may not employ many qualified teachers, but instead employ very
well-educated people with first-class degrees from Britain&#146;s top
universities who are trained to teach in the way that the school
prefers. They would not have a PGCE or qualified teacher status, but
Ofsted may come along and say, &#147;I&#146;m sorry, you have to
have that.&#148; The whole ethos of the school, which is designed to
attract academically gifted people to teach, could be destroyed by a
specified requirement that they
conform.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000747"></a>Jim

schools?</div>

							<a name="0802298000748"></a>Mr.

						</b> The response to that is &#147;Yet&#148;. Our
concern is what comes down the line, once the legislation is in place.
The Minister accused me&#151;I do not regard what he framed as an
accusation in that way&#151;of being an advocate of independent
education. Yes, I am an advocate of independent education&#151;of
high-quality education wherever it is. I am an advocate of
knowledge-based education, wherever it is in the country. I am afraid
that in this country we have too little of that high-quality education,
which is part of the problem my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Hertfordshire alluded to and part of the problem affecting so many
aspects of life in this country. I spend a lot of my time advocating
high-quality state education, such as that at the Mossbourne academy,
which educates children from a very deprived part of London but
achieves results that are better than 95 per cent. of comprehensive
schools.</div>
					<a name="0802298000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue has
been aired widely. I am not happy with the response, but I am sure that
in weeks ahead the Independent Schools Council will continue to lobby
the Minister about how the measure&#151;if it gets through the other
place&#151;will be implemented. However, on the basis of the issues
that have been aired, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Inspector&#148; with &#147;Secretary of State&#148; in order to
maintain the current position, under which the registration and
regulation of independent schools lies with the Department. Schools in
the Independent Schools Council are inspected by the Independent
Schools Inspectorate, while those that are not members are inspected by

Ofsted.&#146;</div>
					<a name="0802298000606"></a><div class="hs_brev">But that is

					<a name="0802298000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consultation document was incorrect too, in a material way, when the
original version was published on 27 July, at the beginning of the
consultation process. It said at paragraph 2.23 that the rationale for
moving registration from the Department to
Ofsted</div>
					<a name="0802298000607"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has been prompted
by the transfer of boarding school and children&#146;s home
registration and regulation to Ofsted from CSCI from April
2007.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, that is
not correct. Ofsted does not register or regulate boarding
accommodation. That remains with the Secretary of State. What
transferred from CSCI to Ofsted was the inspection of boarding
provision. That is not a minor drafting error, but goes to the root of
the rationale for the whole policy, which, according to the
consultation document, is to rationalise the registration and
monitoring of the sector prompted by the transfer
of</div>
					<a name="0802298000608"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;boarding

April 2007.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Had
the paragraph been worded correctly, that this was prompted by the
transfer of inspection from the Commission for Social Care Inspection
to Ofsted, it would not make sense and would not justify the
rationalisation of regulation and monitoring.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column781" />Column number: 781</div>
					<a name="0802298000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government changed the
wording in the consultation document on 5 September 2007, but now the
paragraph is clear that the reason given for the policy does not make
sense. There are two errors of fact&#151;&#151;the one that I have
just explained and the fact that there will not be a unified strand of
regulation, registration and inspection. They are fundamental to the
whole explanation and thrust of the policy in the clause and undermine
it
completely.</div>

is the nature of the beast&#151;are often open to some
interpretation. If a school challenges whether or not regulatory
compliance is there or not and we want to be sure, we can go to the

					<a name="0802298000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The policy to
transfer registration and regulation from the Secretary of State to
Ofsted is not driven by the need to create a unified point of contact
for all registration, regulation and inspection procedures. It is not
driven by the transfer of functions relating to boarding schools from
the Commission for Social Care Inspection to Ofsted, because that
relates to inspection, not regulation. It is not good policy, because
it will remove an important separation of functions and instead set up
conflicts of
interest.</div>
					<a name="0802298000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once those
things are taken out of the equation, the only reason that is left is
efficiency savings. Paragraph 2.1 of the consultation document
says:</div>
					<a name="0802298000612"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that it would be more efficient to transfer the registration
and monitoring functions for education provision from DCSF to Ofsted
thereby creating a single regulatory body for independent
schools.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leaving aside
the obvious point that the measure will not create a single regulatory
body for independent schools, because Ofsted does not register or
regulate boarding, welfare and independent schools, let us look at the
simple efficiency argument from the point of view of the Government and
of tax payers.</div>
					<a name="0802298000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

one of the management issues that the Government do not understand.
They fail to understand human 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column783" />Column number: 783</div>frailty. They created a tax credit system that is too complex to be
administered smoothly, and they took responsibility for the monitoring
and supervision of banking away from the Bank of England, with which it
had been for centuries, and gave it to a new bureaucracy, the Financial
Services Authority. The FSA flunked its first test by merging Customs
and Excise with the Inland Revenue, not understanding that the academic
disciplines of the tax code are very different from VAT and excise
duties, to create the administrative shambles that is Her

is an implication in the proposals that the Department wishes to
transfer responsibility for regulation and registration as part of the

argue that this is not a reason in itself: administrative convenience
should feature low in any list of factors justifying reform of a
statutory regulator. We recognise that other functions of the Secretary
of State may have been transferred over the last few
years&#151;student loans, pensions, IT advice etc.&#151;but these
are, we submit, wholly different functions from those of a regulator.

did not mention whether the ISI was different from the ISC, but the
organisations were very different bodies based in different premises,
even though they were legally part of the same body. His point was that
the schools were not consulted, and that he was not allowed to consult
them. Although he had received the letter, was happy to read it and
could discuss it with Christine Ryan of the ISI, he was not allowed to
discuss it with ISC schools, which is how a representative body should
conduct itself. He could not just come up with an opinion of his own;
he needed to discuss the matter with the schools but could not
do so, because of the contents of the letter. A real

					<a name="0802298000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chief inspector will also be
responsible for approving certain changes to provision in independent
educational institutions. She will have broader monitoring and
enforcement powers under this clause, including powers to remove
institutions from the register. It will be the chief inspector who has
day-to-day contact with independent educational institutions.
Concentrating registration and regulation in one organisation will
reduce red tape, particularly for the 1,180 smaller independent schools
not in the Independent Schools Council or the Focus Learning Trust<b class="B">.
</b>Under current arrangements, non-affiliated schools have to deal
directly with Ofsted and DCSF. Many ISC schools already have a
relationship with Ofsted, as well as with DCSF, either because Ofsted
inspects boarding provision in ISC schools or because it registers or
inspects their child care provision.</div>
					<a name="0802298000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Overall, 2,019 out of 2,359
independent schools will see a reduction in bureaucracy as a result of
these changes. That is because, in future, they will deal with an
independent inspectorate and Ofsted rather than with an independent
inspectorate, Ofsted and DCSF, or because they will have to deal only
with Ofsted, rather than with Ofsted and DCSF. Importantly, the
remaining schools will see no increase in burdens and therefore will
not be disadvantaged. It will also be a more efficient way for the
Department and Ofsted to operate. Unlike at present, there will be no
need for paperwork and reports to be shuttled backwards and forwards
between the organisations, and Ofsted will be able to draw on the
significant body of expertise it has built up in this area. We have not
reflected that in the impact assessment, because the estimate of cost
savings 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column785" />Column number: 785</div>has not been made. It is a benefit, and the impact assessment tends to
focus more on costs than on benefits.</div>
					<a name="0802298000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth my saying, however,
in response to the exchanges we have just had, that I anticipate
significant savings. I cannot predict whether we will move from 18.2
members of staff to approximately 10, but savings will be made, because
Ofsted has well-established and substantial computer and other systems
to deal with its existing regulatory functions. Those systems can be
extended to cover independent schools work, and there will no longer be
the need for DCSF to retain separate systems.</div>
					<a name="0802298000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Staff at Ofsted can be deployed
flexibly to cover peaks and troughs across the full range of its
operations. It will no longer need to pass information to DCSF for
consideration. All deliberative and administrative work can be done
within the same organisation, and they can combine regulation of
boarding, child care and education in individual schools, cutting down
on duplication in cases where different inspectors check broadly
similar requirements for different
regulators.</div>

Williams:
						</b> The Minister has given the impression that this
is an act of kindness for the independent school sector, reducing their
red tape and the necessary number of engagements with
officials in his Department and at Ofsted. If such a neat
arrangement is appropriate for the independent sector, why does he not
consider legislating to streamline the regulation of the state sector
along the same
lines?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000762"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Regulation of state-maintained schools is carried
out largely by local authorities. There is a separate inspection by
Ofsted, which is an important part of regulation, maintenance of
standards and accountability in the maintained school system. I do not,
however, think that the two are directly comparable, because of the
important role of local authorities and their accountability to local
communities. I have no reason to doubt Miriam Rosen&#146;s statement
to the Committee that the transfer will result in the efficiencies that
I have set out. Ofsted has already put in place processes to deal with
the regulation of almost 100,000 child care providers and 2,000
children&#146;s homes. Setting aside the strong arguments for
reducing bureaucracy, which provide support for the proposals, I will
touch briefly on some of the other misplaced concerns that we have
heard.</div>
					<a name="0802298000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">One such concern
is that the transfer of registration to Ofsted and the other provisions
in part 4 of the Bill are part of a wider process of
&#147;Ofsted-isation&#148;&#151;a horrible word&#151;in the
independent sector. I want to reassure the Committee on two points.
First, I do not see Ofsted-isation in the negative way that the term
was meant or in the negative way that it sounds. Ofsted has an
outstanding reputation. One need only look at the statistics: last
year, about 30,000 inspections were conducted, and there were only 26
complaints to the independent adjudicator. That is the crux of the
discussion on part 4. I am striving to put in place a system that will
provide a better service to the majority of institutions in the sector.
Ofsted will be able to do 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column786" />Column number: 786</div>that, even for ISC schools, whose concerns were fully represented by the
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton.</div>
					<a name="0802298000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
I would not want Members to take from my arguments for Ofsted-isation
the belief that there are plans afoot to introduce greater regulatory
strictures for the independent sector. Part 4 is deregulatory,
concentrating operations in bodies that are best placed to deal with
them. The Secretary of State will continue to set the standards against
which independent educational institutions are judged. I agree that
flexibility and choice are important in the independent sector, and
that is why clause 90 provides for the Secretary of State to appoint
independent inspectorates for groups of independent educational
institutions. I am sure that we will discuss that later. The fact that
we are willing to let other inspectorates emerge does not smack of
Ofsted-isation.</div>
					<a name="0802298000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
arguments against the transfer have intimated that
some ambiguous or misleading wording in the
consultation documents renders the whole legislation and its rationale
invalid. I recognise that some of  the wording could be seen as
misleading. As soon as the wording&#151;to which there has been
reference&#151;on the regulation of the welfare provision was brought
to  the attention of officials in my Department, the
consultation document was altered on the website. However, the whole
consultation was not rendered invalid by a few
sentences.</div>
					<a name="0802298000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000764"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> In a minute. May I get my argument out first? The
consultation, when read in its entirety, made clear exactly what the
proposals were. The Committee will also be reassured to hear that none
of the organisations from which we heard evidence missed the
consultation. Of the 337 responses received during the consultation on
the transfer of registration, 257 were from ISC member schools. To say
that those schools were not consulted or that they did not hear about
the consultation is palpable nonsense. On 6 July 2007, Mr.
Shephard was offered the chance to go through the consultation document
with departmental officials. He never took up that offer. As 257 of the
337 responses, many of them in a standard campaign format, were from
ISC member schools, I would say that we have had full consultation with
that sector. The Independent Schools Inspectorate also responded in
full to the
consultation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000765"></a>Mr.

						</b> We are talking about the pre-consultation process,
not the consultation itself. If the wording in the consultation is
wrong, but is given as justification for creating a unified body, when
it will not do so, does the Minister not accept that that is not simply
a drafting error to be corrected, but exposes a fundamental flaw in the
whole thrust of the
policy?</div>
					<a name="0802298000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000766"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> What we were suggesting in the
whole consultation was perfectly clear, despite that inaccuracy, which
was corrected. I do not accept that the argument stands or falls on
that. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and I simply
disagree.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column787" />Column number: 787</div>
					<a name="0802298000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">One further objection to part 4
has been put forward, based on the so-called principle that
registration and inspection should be kept in separate bodies. It is
not clear to me where that principle is set down. It is certainly not
borne out by other examples across the public sector. In the health
sector, for example, the Healthcare Commission regulates and inspects
private hospitals and independent clinics against national minimum
standards set by the Department of Health. To use the ISC&#146;s
word, if it is a &#147;referee&#148; that the independent sector is
looking for, the sector can, I hope, be reassured.</div>
					<a name="0802298000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part 4 introduces new appeal
rights to the Care Standards Tribunal. We plan to extend the role of
Ofsted&#146;s independent adjudicator to cover complaints about the
quality assurance of independent inspectorates. Ultimately, the
Secretary of State, by laying regulations in this House, retains
overall responsibility for setting the regulatory regime in the
independent
sector.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000767"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> The Minister will recall that I asked Ms
Rosen about that. How will he accomplish the extension of the role of
the adjudicator? Will it be in legislation or is it an administrative
act? When will it happen, because it is clearly important that there
should be a
referee.</div>
					<a name="0802298000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000768"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I have just said that the Secretary of State, by
laying regulations in the House, retains overall responsibility for
setting the regulatory regime. Unless it suddenly occurs to me
otherwise, I would answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question by
saying that we will do that by regulation. The new appeal rights to the
Care Standards Tribunal against Ofsted decisions are set out in the
Bill. In my view, none of the arguments that have been advanced stand
up to scrutiny. Furthermore, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that we do
not need to regulate to extend the remit of the independent
adjudicator. It is something that we can do with Ofsted without having
to legislate.</div>
					<a name="0802298000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000769"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> Why then does the Minister not transfer the
registration regulation of the whole maintained sector, as well as
independent schools, to Ofsted, if it is going to be so efficient and
excellent?</div>
					<a name="0802298000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000770"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> My response would be similar to the one that I
gave to the hon. Member for Bristol, West earlier. Most of the
regulation of the maintained sector is carried out by local
authorities. The arrangements for the independent sector and for the
maintained sector are not
comparable.</div>
					<a name="0802298000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000771"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> Would not the savings be likely to be even larger?
Registration and regulation is taking place in 150 local authorities of
varying degrees of efficiency, from efficient Conservative to less
efficient Labour ones&#151;I say that tongue in cheek, but the point
is that there are 150 local authorities around the country. The
argument must apply tenfold to the efficiency of transferring that
requirement to Ofsted in comparison with the transfer of
responsibilities from 18 officials in the
Department.</div>

							<a name="0802298000772"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I am not quite sure whether the hon. Gentleman is
proposing that we move registration into local authorities or into
Ofsted. We are debating the registration of independent schools by
Ofsted.</div>
					<a name="0802298000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
Government, we are committed to rationalising the
complex pattern of multiple scrutiny that service
providers and some inspectors experience, and reducing the inspection
burden and the variety of approaches that are a feature of a system in
which many bodies perform similar tasks. The proposals in this part of
the Bill achieve that goal. Ofsted will be able to provide a better,
more responsive, more cost-effective service to many schools and
independent institutions, integrating the different strands of its
activity to provide the proverbial one-stop shop that we are so keen to
talk about in a variety of settings. In the light of the benefits to
the sector that part 4 will bring, I optimistically ask the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0802298000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000773"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> You will not be surprised to know,
Mr. Bayley, that I am not impressed by the Minister&#146;s
answer. In particular, I am not impressed by his responses on the
consultation process. We are talking about very respectable people: the
chief executive of the Independent Schools Council, and Christine Ryan,
the chief inspector of the Independent Schools Inspectorate. Both those
individuals, and the bodies they represent, are deeply unhappy about
the consultation and how it was carried out. The Minister should
reflect on that unhappiness. Whether or not those bodies were unified
at the time or legally separate is irrelevant. They are unhappy, and
the Minister should reflected on
that.</div>
					<a name="0802298000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to the
transcript of Miriam Rosen&#146;s evidence to the Children, Schools
and Families Committee on 12 December on Ofsted&#146;s work, Ofsted
was</div>
					<a name="0802298000626"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;surprised by the
opposition to these
proposals.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is that surprise that alarms me. There should not be surprises in
Government proposals at this level. Having worked at KPMG for 13 years
before coming to the House of Commons, I can say that the one thing
that was frowned upon was surprises. It is always a sign of poor
management when people are surprised by reaction to a policy. They
should have been aware in advance that there would be problems. Had a
proper pre-consultation process been in place, there would not have
been surprises.</div>
					<a name="0802298000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
not convinced, either, by the Minister&#146;s explanation of the
policy. He said that there will be no more regulatory strictures, and
that there this will be a more cost-effective service. He said that the
Government were integrating the strands of regulation, and that there
will be a one-stop shop. If that is the case, it applies most to the
maintained sector, which is inspected by Ofsted. I see no reason, on
the basis of what the Minister has said, why that should not be the
case under the Bill, and why he has not proposed moving the
registration and regulation of all 23,000 schools in the maintained
sector from local authorities to Ofsted. That system is bound to be
more efficient if what he said about transferring the process from the
DCSF to Ofsted is as efficient as he said. Perhaps it is the
Minister&#146;s view that the DCSF is deeply inefficient,
particularly while he is there.</div>

							<a name="0802298000775"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> It is, and I withdraw the remark. It was an unfair
comment.</div>
					<a name="0802298000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
thrust of his argument is that DCSF is inefficient in
its handling of regulation and registration compared with the way in
which that is done in local authorities around the country. That is
inconsistent, and does not make sense. None of the policy makes sense.
The people who use the current regime think it works marvellously and I
do not think we should change things when they are working well. It is
extraordinary, and I wonder, echoing the comments of my hon. Friend the
Member for North-East Hertfordshire, what the driver is behind this
policy. Perhaps the Minister is not aware of what it is. I do not think
it is good policy, and it will not lead to efficiencies. I would
therefore like to test the opinion of the Committee on amendment No.
124, which simply removes the words &#147;Chief Inspector&#148;
from clause 79, and replaces it with the &#147;Secretary of

conducting an unregulated educational institution as up to 51 weeks in

					<a name="0802298000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to probe the issue of material change and
what would constitute a change that was significant enough to warrant
an inspection. The size of Ofsted necessitates that it is a somewhat
bureaucratic organisation, so the fear is whether any change reported
to Ofsted as the new registration body for independent schools would
trigger an inspection, and that relates to the debate that we had about
Ofsted-isation.</div>
					<a name="0802298000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the amendment is
to try to get on the record the Minister&#146;s opinion on the degree
of change that would need to take place for something to be material,
because there is a fear that, once responsibility is transferred to
Ofsted, simply reporting a change could trigger an inspection&#151;at
the moment such a change would be reported to one of the 18.2 officials
in his Department who would record it and the school would just carry
on. That is not to say that those schools are frightened of inspection,
as they welcome it. They are concerned, however, about the bureaucratic
driver of that. If the Minster could give them some reassurance, that
would be
welcome.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000797"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Clause 87 allows the chief inspector to conduct
inspections when considering applications from independent educational
institutions for prior approval of material changes. In most
institutions, a material change will be the introduction of boarding or
a change to become specially organised to make provision for students
with special educational needs. Where institutions are specially
organised to make provision for students with special educational
needs, a material change will be any significant change in their
provision, as recorded in the institution&#146;s registered
details.</div>
					<a name="0802298000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
particularly important that safeguards are in place to ensure that new
boarding provision and any changes to provision for students with
special educational needs will not endanger the welfare, health and
safety of students. The thrust of the amendment would remove the chief
inspector&#146;s discretion to decide whether an institution
proposing a significant change should be inspected. It would restrict
the chief inspector by requiring her to refer to past cases that may or
may not be relevant when considering the merits of a specific
proposal.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column792" />Column number: 792</div>
					<a name="0802298000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I get the thrust of what the hon.
Gentleman seeks reassurance on, which is that the clause might allow
the chief inspector too much latitude to inspect schools for all sorts
of minor changes. I can reassure him that approval of a change is
required only where the change is material&#151;in other words, in
significant cases. Not all changes will require approval, and a large
number of changes will not require prior approval. Indeed, for those
institutions that are not specially organised to make provision for
students with special educational needs, the Bill reduces the number of
changes that count as material and so require approval by the chief
inspector. They will no longer have to get approval from the chief
inspector for a change in proprietor, address, the age range of pupils,
the maximum number of pupils or whether the school is for male or
female pupils or both. That is further deregulation for us to
celebrate.</div>
					<a name="0802298000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
changes that will require approval are the introduction of boarding
provision and the change to become specially organised for students
with special educational needs. Where a material change is proposed,
the chief inspector should have a free hand to inspect when she
considers it appropriate to do so, and she should not be restricted in
the way that the amendment sets out. I hope that the hon. Gentleman,
who is sensible, will withdraw the

information from fire and rescue authorities about fire safety,
information from the Health and Safety Executive and the environmental
health authority about the suitability of the premises, confidential
information received from parents or others, matters referred to in a
criminal background check on the proprietor of the institution, and any

					<a name="0802298000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where the
chief inspector is satisfied that the institution is likely to continue
to meet the regulatory standards once the changes are made, she must
approve the change. If she is not satisfied, she must refuse approval
for the change to be made. The chief inspector must inform the
proprietor of her decision. Information received from bodies such as
the fire and rescue service, the HSE and the environmental health
agency would routinely be shared with institutions. The amendment would
not change current procedures, which would then reasonably allow those
institutions to make the necessary changes to conform. However,
confidential information from parents, the Criminal Records Bureau,
social services or the police would not routinely be shared for obvious
reasons. Disclosure to the relevant institution would be determined
according to the circumstances of the case. In some cases it would
appropriate; in others, it would not.</div>

						</b> It will not surprise the Committee that I want to
resist this amendment. The debates on part 4 have used the language of
choice and flexibility. The argument goes that independent schools
should have the flexibility within the basic regulatory regime to
operate as their name suggests&#151;that is, independently. Indeed,
one witness described a parent&#146;s choice to educate their child
outside the control of the state as a human right. I do not
fundamentally disagree with the sentiment about choice and flexibility,
and that is why I am intrigued by the purpose and effect of the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0802298000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofsted is
the principal inspection body in England. The breadth of institutions
that it covers, including a significant number of independent schools,
gives it a unique perspective on the English education system.
Moreover, public confidence in Ofsted is high. The Government recognise
that choice and diversity are important in the independent sector,
precisely because it is independent. Parents of children in the
independent sector often desire a more tailored and detailed analysis
of their school than Ofsted can provide through inspections that focus
solely on regulatory standards. That is why the Education Act 2002
enabled the Secretary of State to approve bodies other than Ofsted to
inspect educational provision in independent
schools.</div>

					<a name="0802298000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Independent
Schools Inspectorate has inspected independent schools belonging to the
Independent Schools Council for several years. Since 2002, two further
inspectorates have been approved. The amendment would exclude one of
those. The Schools Inspection Service inspects schools affiliated to
the Focus Learning Trust and the Bridge Schools Inspectorate has just
been approved to inspect schools belonging to the Christian Schools
Trust and the Association of Muslim
Schools.</div>
					<a name="0802298000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other
hand, there are a considerable number of schools that choose not to be
affiliated to any particular group or organisation and who are not
inspected by an independent inspectorate. Such schools are inspected by
Ofsted and the Government believe that the option to have Ofsted as the
inspection body should be open to all independent schools. The
amendment would close off that possibility, replacing Ofsted and the
Bridge Schools Inspectorate with one organisation: the Independent
Schools Inspectorate. That would remove the choice that independent
educational institutions desire. In the light of my compelling
reasoning, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the

practice in allowing the chief inspector to arrange
for the publication of any inspection report she prepares following
inspections of independent educational institutions. Under the Bill,
the Secretary of State will continue to be able to prescribe the manner
in which the chief inspector&#146;s reports are published. The clause
does not require, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
said, the chief inspector automatically to publish inspection reports
carried out in response to a specific complaint, but it gives her the
power to do so. That is an important distinction, because it is easy to
see a situation where inspectors find no evidence to substantiate a
complaint, which may have been made maliciously. In such cases it is
unlikely that publishing the report would be appropriate, and the
clause gives the chief inspector the discretion to decide not to
publish.</div>

hand, there are circumstances in which the chief inspector may decide
that it is in the public interest to publish a report, even though it

inspection stemming from a complaint identified serious regulatory
failings, the chief inspector might decide that it would be appropriate
to publish the report so that parents were aware of the shortcomings of
the

that:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column797" />Column number: 797</div>
					<a name="0802298000632"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Chief Inspector has, during the

submit&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">an action plan.
The comment of the Independent Schools Inspectorate is that, for such a
school, that seems like a long period in which to require an action
plan and to allow the school to languish in that condition. Will the
Minister say why the figure of three years was put into the
clause?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000814"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> The clause sets out the circumstances in which the
chief inspector may take enforcement action&#151;under clause 101,
which we are about to come on to&#151;against the proprietor of a
failing independent educational institution. In order to take
enforcement action, the chief inspector must be satisfied that the
institution is failing to meet one or more of the regulatory standards.
However, to take enforcement action, one of two conditions must first
be met.</div>
					<a name="0802298000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the
proprietor must, as we heard, in the previous three years have been
required to submit at least one action plan, setting out how the
regulatory failings would be dealt with. Where that action plan was not
submitted by the required date, was rejected by the chief inspector, or
was approved but later not complied with, the first condition is met.
Alternatively, where the proprietor was required to submit an action
plan at least two years previously, and at least one inspection has
taken place since then and the chief inspector is satisfied that at no
time in the two-year period has the institution met all the standards,
the second condition is
met.</div>
					<a name="0802298000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problems
identified would not necessarily be allowed to go on for three years,
but it is important that schools be given time to put an action plan in
place. Three years is the period in current practice, but it would be
extremely unusual for Ofsted to allow a situation to carry on for that
long. I will reflect on whether three years bears my scrutiny. If I do
not raise the matter on Report and the hon. Gentleman wishes to do so,
I will come back with the answer as to why three years is right.
Indeed, I might even write to him and to the Committee if I believe we
need to set things out in more detail. As I understand it, however, the
clause simply reflects the present situation.</div>
					<a name="0802298000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause carries forward
provisions in existing legislation, but amends them to allow
enforcement action to be taken where institutions do not sustain
previous improvements or fail to meet all the regulatory standards. It

					<a name="0802298000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman raises an
important point about why we should worry about standards or
requirements beyond ordinary health and safety law for those providers
of education for 16 to 18-year-olds. There are important minimum
regulatory standards that we should put in place beyond health and
safety, particularly in respect of child welfare and child protection.
This is a good opportunity to do so.</div>
					<a name="0802298000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">In placing a new duty on all
young people to continue to participate in education or training until
they are 18, it is right that we take the power to set standards to
ensure that they are healthy, safe and supported wherever they choose
to fulfil the duty that we discussed at such length under part 1. In
many ways the provision is not a response to any specific evidence that
there is a failure on the part of those providers. It is much more a
consequence of raising the participation age through part 1. I hope, on
that basis, that the Committee will support the
clause.</div>

information at his fingertips. If no concerns have been expressed about
the way the system operates now and if there is no record of problems
relating to child protection, health and safety and welfare, the only
grounds I can see for introducing the clause is to establish
consistency. That may be sufficient of itself, but it is important to
know whether that is the only basis on which the proposal is being
made.</div>

						</b> It is about slightly more than consistency. As we
have discussed, new forms of provision will be developed by various
organisations from the third sector and elsewhere to engage people who
are particularly difficult to engage. There will be an expansion of
provision in an area where there are no statutory duties in respect of
safety and well-being. Consequential to raising the participation age
and to all the extra provision, it is also important&#151;beyond the
need for consistency&#151;to lay down statutory duties to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column800" />Column number: 800</div>safeguard the well-being of the especially vulnerable people we want to
engage. Any regulations laid, however, will be dealt with through the
affirmative procedure, after consultation, as set out in clause 118(2).

Members have long had an interest in special educational needs

Nottinghamshire in the 1980s, I was a fierce opponent of the Warnock
report and the Act that followed it&#151;passed by a Conservative
Government I hasten to add. That Act encouraged the wholesale
integration of children with special needs into mainstream schools. I
understand that the present Government remain committed to a policy of
including as many children as possible in mainstream schools. Partly as
a result of that, about 93 special schools have closed since
1997.</div>

						</b> The Minister might be right to say that there has
been something of a change of heart in recent years. However, when I
held the job of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton as the shadow Schools Minister, I remember fighting a
very fierce battle to ensure that children with special educational
needs were adequately dealt with in the mainstream. Too often, in the
specifics and the quantum of the provision made there, education for
such children is found wanting. I remain concerned that in particular
parts of the country there is an erosion of special educational
provision, which is critical for those children. In some areas there is
a mix of provision and parents can chose between placing their child in
a special school or integrating them into mainstream education; but
that option does not exist in many places in
Britain.</div>

							<b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): Something I gleaned from the
many years that I worked in a special school is that there needs to be
flexibility between mainstream schools and special schools. Some pupils
who fail in mainstream schools will flourish in a special school and
there are children in special schools who would like to try to survive
in a mainstream school. There must be flexibility in the system to
provide for those
circumstances.</div>

						</b> Even mindful of your generosity, Mr.
Bayley, I do not want to stray too far from the specifics before us.
However, my hon. Friend is right because there is often a misconception
that special educational needs are static. In fact, they are dynamic
because of the changing educational circumstances of the child and
because of their difficulties. Their disability may be a dynamic one
and their learning difficulties may change over time. It is therefore 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column802" />Column number: 802</div>important that there is a lot of fluidity in the system. For some
children, mainstream provision will be more appropriate some of the
time and at other times in their educational life special provision
will be more appropriate. That point is not often made and certainly
not made as well as it was by my hon.
Friend.</div>
					<a name="0802298000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remain
concerned about the erosion of special education. Even Baroness
Warnock, whom I mentioned earlier and whose report in 1978 started the
process of inclusion, said that her policy has backfired, leaving, in
her words, &#147;a disastrous legacy&#148;. According to a survey
for <i class="I">The Times Educational Supplement</i> in 2005, teachers believe
that up to 25,000 children in mainstream education in England and Wales
would be better off in special schools. The survey also found that four
out of five teachers and head teachers favour an end to special school
closures.</div>
					<a name="0802298000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
survey and others also reveal the paucity of training
for most teachers in mainstream schools, although they may well have an
interface with children with special needs. Too frequently, teachers
are ill equipped to deal with the challenges that we offer
them.</div>

special needs children. I hope that the Minister will say a word to
reassure those of us who believe that the education of children with
special needs must be and deserves to be a high priority for the

						</b> I am mindful of your words, Mr. Bayley.
I am mildly frustrated that that constrains me in responding properly
to the hon. Gentleman and reminding him, for example, that funding for
all pupils has increased by &#163;1,440 per pupil since 1997 and that
there has been a real-terms increase in funding for special educational
needs pupils of 66 per cent., or of other such facts such as that
18,000 children are taught in specially resourced provision within or
attached to mainstream schools, and that we have built or re-built more
than 100 new special schools in the past 10 years. However, I shall
address myself to the amendment to stay within the advice that you have
given us, Mr. Bayley, and resist any interventions that
might divert me further into responding generally on special
educational needs
provision.</div>
					<a name="0802298000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may help
to explain to the Committee why we are proposing to
transfer the responsibility for the approval of non-maintained special
schools to the chief inspector. Non-maintained special schools are
inspected on an ongoing basis, under exactly the same arrangements that
apply to maintained special schools. The chief 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column803" />Column number: 803</div>inspector is responsible for the ongoing inspection of all maintained
and non-maintained special schools. She is also responsible for
determining whether a school meets the required standards for notifying
the Department where intervention action is required, and for
monitoring schools requiring intervention to ensure that improvements
are made and required standards are met. Given the wide and expert role
that Ofsted has built up in relation to special schools, it is entirely
sensible that she should also have responsibility for the approval of
non-maintained special schools under section 342 of the 1996
Act.</div>
					<a name="0802298000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
consultation shows that the main organisation representing
non-maintained special schools agrees with our proposals. The National
Association of Independent and Non-Maintained Special Schools
states:</div>
					<a name="0802298000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Given
that it is current DCSF practice to refer most decisions on
registration and monitoring to Ofsted, the proposal does make logical
sense.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 154 would reject the transfer of the general approval function to
the chief inspector, but continue with the transfer of approving
school-specific arrangements. It would split approvals between the
Secretary of State and the chief inspector, creating a much more
complicated system than either that currently in place or that proposed
in this chapter of the Bill. The intention is that the chief inspector
will have responsibility for the general approval where a school meets
the required standards and responsibility for approving the
school-specific arrangements. Those arrangements will put functions
where the expertise exists and ensure that institutions need only deal
with one
body.</div>
					<a name="0802298000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 155
would allow regulations made under clause 127 to provide for the
Secretary of State, in addition to the chief inspector, to apply to a
justice of the peace for an order to close a school in an urgent case.
As I have said, the aim of the chapter is to simplify the regulatory
regime, concentrating the powers of intervention, monitoring and
inspection of non-maintained special schools where the expertise
lies.</div>
					<a name="0802298000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would confuse that process and would be counter-productive for two
reasons. First, a two-tier approach may delay proceedings. The
rationale for having the provision to make emergency orders is to act
quickly. Providing for the Secretary of State to apply for an order
would dilute the clarity of functions that the Bill introduces and
potentially delay an order being made because of confusion as to which
body should act. Secondly, it would be the chief inspector who
possesses the necessary evidence to support an application to the
justice of the peace, and it is therefore logical that she should have
that power on her
own.</div>

					<a name="0802298000635"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The 1998
Act as amended by the 2006 Act provides for a sixth-form pupil in a
maintained school to withdraw from religious worship. This clause
obliges the Secretary of State to make regulations to afford the same
rights to sixth-form pupils in non-maintained special
schools.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the
Government, we support the right of someone, post-16, to withdraw from
religious study. After all, it is compatible with other decisions made
by this House on the rights that young people have and are competent to
enjoy at the age of 16.</div>
					<a name="0802298000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, is it not ironic that
the Government believe that a person at 16 or 17 should be empowered to
withdraw from religious study because they are competent to make that
decision, yet do not believe that someone is competent, at that age, to
make a decision on whether they should participate in education per se?
It is the Government&#146;s contention that it is okay for someone at
the age of 16 to say that they do not want to study religion, but not
okay to say that they do not want to study everything else.</div>
					<a name="0802298000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems to me at best
paradoxical and at worst something altogether less desirable. Surely,
it is a contradiction which strikes at the very heart of the purpose of

their beginning until now&#151;almost the end&#151;I could not
resist the temptation to raise the issue again. We all want the ideal

current regulations for non-maintained special schools require

The Education and Inspections Act 2006 amended legislation for
maintained special schools so that sixth-form pupils in those schools
have the right to withdraw from religious worship. All we are seeking
to do in this clause is to afford those same rights to sixth-form
pupils in non-maintained special schools as exist in maintained special
schools. There is no justification for treating sixth-form pupils
differently just because they attend a different type of special
school.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000841"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> The Independent Schools Council has raised concern
about the clause, which abolishes the concept of approved independent
schools under section 347 of the Education Act 1996. The ISC points out
that approved
status</div>
					<a name="0802298000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provides parents
with the assurance that a section-347 school can meet the needs for
which it is approved and in which it specialises.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the July 2007 consultation
document, the Government say:</div>
					<a name="0802298000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Section 347 of the 1996
Education Act created two categories of independent schools, approved
and non-approved schools. Approved schools cater wholly or mainly for
pupils with SEN, and are required to meet additional standards. For
this reason, local authorities are able to place pupils in these
schools without seeking consent from the Secretary of State. The
standards were originally needed because independent school standards
were not in the past set out in a way that was helpful for special
schools.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column806" />Column number: 806</div>
					<a name="0802298000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">They go on to say:</div>
					<a name="0802298000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Since the Education Act
2002, higher standards have been set for the independent sector as a
whole ... We believe these new standards, together with an
improved inspection framework ... remove the need for a separate
category of approved independent
schools.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will then be
for the local authorities to assure themselves of the quality of
independent special schools that they use to provide education for
children with special needs.</div>
					<a name="0802298000685"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div>
					<a name="0802298000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its briefing
to the Committee, the ISC points
out:</div>
					<a name="0802298000636"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
concerned that most local authorities will not have sufficient
resources to enable them to take on the responsibility, effectively,
for assessing and monitoring the school as well as the individual
placement. At the moment, if a school is approved, the local authority
need not concern itself with...the organisation or standards at
the school: it simply needs to consider whether it can meet the
child&#146;s needs...Should local authorities have the resources
to carry out this new responsibility, they may seek to impose further
burdens on
schools&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="0802298000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">that is,
of course, if they have the capacity to carry out their individual
assessments. It goes
on:</div>
					<a name="0802298000637"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If local
authorities believe that they have additional duties to vet such
schools, there is a danger that they will impose additional checks
(quasi-inspections) and requirements on these schools which could
adversely affect their independence and increase the
costs&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0802298000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ISC
also points out in its written submission
that</div>
					<a name="0802298000638"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;none of the schools
approved under&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">section

					<a name="0802298000640"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has requested any
change to the existing system of approving schools or individual
placements...ISC would therefore question the need to make any
changes to a system which is functioning well&#151;our schools
believe that the Department&#146;s team dealing with s 347 approvals
provides an excellent service&#151;and has not experienced any
significant
problems.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is praise
indeed, again, for the Minister&#146;s Department. Paragraph 59 of
the written submission
says:</div>
					<a name="0802298000641"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Schools
see their s 347 approval as a quality standard or kite mark which
assures
everyone&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0802298000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
removing</div>
					<a name="0802298000642"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;this approval
mechanism, takes away this quality
assurance&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0802298000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ISC makes clear that the approval regime was introduced in the
Education Act 1981, in response to recommendations in the Warnock
report, to which my hon. Friend alluded. That report was critical of
the unregulated nature of local authority placements in independent
schools. The ISC goes
on:</div>
					<a name="0802298000643"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is,
therefore, a serious concern that by removing the s 347
approval mechanism, there may be a return to the previous system, which
was found to be in need of
reform.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a wider debate to be had about the tendency of many local
authorities, for reasons of cost and sometimes of ideology, not to
place children with special needs in special schools, or at least to
put barriers in the way and make it difficult for all but the most
persistent parents to obtain an assessment or statement of special
educational need and to get the placement that they seek.
Therefore,</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column807" />Column number: 807</div>
					<a name="0802298000644"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In one respect, ISC
recognises that the proposals may enable local authorities to place
children with statements of SEN in a wider range of independent
schools...However ISC would...fear that...local
authorities in practice would take the opportunity presented to reduce
the number of placements in the independent sector...or there
could be an increase in the number of students placed inappropriately
at schools which...may not offer the safeguards of specialism and
quality present under the current s 347 approval
mechanism.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0802298000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a real
danger, given that there is already a tendency in local authorities to
resist sending or allowing parents to send their children to special
schools, whether in the independent or the maintained
sector.</div>
					<a name="0802298000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ISC makes
the further important point that the special educational needs and
disability tribunal</div>
					<a name="0802298000645"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;can
only name the school if it is approved or if the Secretary of State
gives consent for the individual child to attend...If, in the
future, the local authority will be solely responsible for deciding
whether a school is suitable for a particular child, we would argue
that this creates a significant conflict of interest and places in the
Tribunal in an impossible position. It would seem inequitable for an
authority to, in effect, defeat an appeal against its decision by
saying that it does not consider the parent&#146;s preferred school
as suitable and that the Tribunal, therefore, could not place a child
there in any event. On the other hand, the tribunal is unlikely to have
sufficient evidence to allow it to assess whether the local
authority&#146;s judgment about the school is
sound&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0802298000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are multiple concerns expressed by the ISC which I have had the
pleasure of conveying to the Committee. The Minister needs to think
again about whether something that is working well should be removed
and abolished for whatever reasons he has for making this proposal in
the first place. I look forward to hearing his response to the
ISC&#146;s genuine
concerns.</div>
				
					<a name="0802298000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000842"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> I am hugely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
praise of my Department&#146;s officials, who indeed do a fine job.
The proposals to transfer this function are no reflection on their
professionalism or capability.</div>
					<a name="0802298000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">The requirement for independent
schools to meet additional conditions of approval when local
authorities are considering placing children with statements of special
educational needs was carried forward in the Education Act 1996. At the
time, that was intended as a means of protecting the most vulnerable
children with SEN. The introduction of the independent schools
standards in 2003, which all independent schools have to meet, has seen
a marked improvement in the standards that apply across the board in
the independent schools sector. Indeed, the standards against which all
independent schools are judged&#151;this is the significant
issue&#151;are now higher than those set out for approved schools.
The requirement to seek approval which marks out the separate category
of school is therefore simply legal and bureaucratic. It fulfils no
function whatsoever in providing additional safeguards for children
with special educational needs.</div>
					<a name="0802298000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of burdens on local
authorities, under current legislation, a local authority has to decide
whether an independent school is a suitable placement. The fact that an
independent school is approved under section 347 does not reduce an
authority&#146;s work in determining whether it is a suitable
placement for that individual. That duty on local authorities will not
change with the proposed changes in the Bill. They will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column808" />Column number: 808</div>still be able to access lists of independent schools that are specially
organised for pupils with SEN, describing what type of SEN the schools
cater for. They will then have to determine whether a school can meet
the individual needs of the
child.</div>
					<a name="0802298000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000843"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> I accept that point, but assessing whether the
school is a suitable institution for the child to attend is different
from having to assess the quality of a school. That places a whole new
burden on local authorities. They do not just have to ask whether a
particular type of school is right for a child with these particular
special educational needs. They now have an additional burden placed
upon them to assess whether that school is a good-quality school per
se.</div>
					<a name="0802298000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000844"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman, who I know is
assiduous, missed my point that all independent schools will have met
the standard for all independent schools, which is higher than that
required for an approved school. The local authority therefore does not
need to concern itself about the standard but simply about whether the
school is appropriate for the individual child. The proposed changes
will, however, remove the need for a local authority to seek consent
from the Secretary of State to place a child with special educational
needs in an independent school. Under current legislation, around 700
requests are received from local authorities seeking consent from the
Secretary of State for placements. The changes proposed in clause 129
will remove this burden on local authorities and we estimate that the
documentation to support a request for consent takes 350 days a year of
local authorities&#146; SEN officers&#146; time. This equates to a
monetary saving to local authorities of approximately &#163;120,000
per year.</div>
					<a name="0802298000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
requirement for a local education authority to seek consent from the
Secretary of State to place a child with a statement of special
educational needs in an non-approved independent school is an
unnecessary administrative burden.</div>
					<a name="0802298000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are safeguards in place
for parents of children with statements of special educational needs.
Where there are disagreements between parents and local authorities
about provision and placements of children with SEN, parents have the
right of appeal to the special educational needs and disability
tribunal. Decisions of the tribunal are binding on both parties. The
tribunal would still need to be satisfied that an independent school
was appropriate for the child. SENDIST already considers that and does
not rely on the mere fact of approval, for all the reasons I set out.
The tribunal stands in the shoes&#151;to adopt a
colloquialism&#151;of the local authority for that purpose.
</div>
					<a name="0802298000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am confident that
the existing statutory duties of local education authorities for
children with SEN, together with the strengthened guidance and improved
standards for the independent sector as a whole, remove the requirement
for a separate category of independent school and for local authorities
to seek consent for a child to be placed in an independent school. I
hope that the Committee supports the clause.

					<a name="0802298000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000855"></a>Mr.
Marsden:
						</b> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr.
Bayley, and apologise if I caused any unintended confusion. I very much
wanted to speak on this clause and associate myself with concerns that
have been expressed by the Special Educational Consortium and the
National Autistic Society about the clause as currently drafted
.</div>
					<a name="0802298000446"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should at least
consider whether the famous parliamentary law of unintended
consequences might at some stage come into practice with this
provision. The clause will formalise the practice whereby school
governing bodies direct students, including students with special
educational needs, to attend alternative forms of provision to improve
behaviour. Who, one might say, could be against that process? But the
Special Educational Consortium has real concerns that formalising that
practice will lead to students being removed from schools without
proper consideration of the impact of their special educational needs
on the behaviour
concerned.</div>
					<a name="0802298000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
the SEC, like myself, welcomed the proposal to extend the requirement
to stay in education or training to the age of 18&#151;not least
because of the potential benefits this will bring to young people with
learning difficulties and special educational needs. But the plain fact
is that statistics show that many disabled students and those with
special educational needs are already out of school by the age of 16 as
a result of exclusion, both formal and informal. Many more pupils in
that area have poor experiences of education. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column811" />Column number: 811</div>
					</div>
					<a name="0802298000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Liberal Democrat
spokesman on this matter and I were colleagues on the former Education
and Skills Select Committee, and we know from its inquiries on SEN and
bullying how this can be a particular issue. The statistics are
frightening. There are eight times as many exclusions of pupils with
special educational needs as of pupils without them, so one has to ask
to what extent do official exclusions create a
problem?</div>
					<a name="0802298000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is very
clear guidance set by the Department that such exclusions are illegal.
The guidance also recommends that, where all else fails, the school
should seek a statutory assessment or, for a pupil with a statement, an
early annual review. Again, the fact is that the high level of
exclusions of pupils with SEN suggests that those recommendations are
not being followed, so the SEC wants more effort and more measures to
keep disabled pupils and those with SEN in school, with a better
experience of school.</div>
					<a name="0802298000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">An important factor to take on
board here, I am sorry to say, is the very mixed reputation of some of
the pupil referral units to which children with SEN go. I make no
comment on any particular ones, or any particular areas, but,
nevertheless, the mere fact that children with SEN can be referred to
pupil referral units in company with young people who are there for
very different reasons, in very troubled circumstances, can also cause
a problem.</div>
					<a name="0802298000451"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
concerns are shared by the National Autistic Society, which has also
written to me. I declare an interest, because the issue of autism,
particularly Asperger&#146;s syndrome, is one that I had to deal with
several times in this respect in my own constituency. It says that the
number of children with autism who have been excluded, and excluded
repeatedly, is
worrying.</div>
					<a name="0802298000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
saying again that the school environment throws up a range of
challenges for pupils with autism, including those with
Asperger&#146;s syndrome, particularly at secondary level. The NAS
rightly reminds us that environmental triggers and disruption to
routine can lead to high anxiety in terms of peer relationship,
bullying and low self-esteem. The classic pattern for children with
autism who exhibit such challenging behaviour is that stress built up
from low-level bullying can often trigger a sudden disproportionate
response. That is the so-called row in the dinner queue syndrome, to
which Lord Adonis and others have referred.</div>
					<a name="0802298000453"></a><div class="hs_Para">The NAS asks for appropriate
safeguards to ensure that any underlying factors that contribute to the
behaviour are considered before a child is removed from the school
premises. The NAS and the SEC are concerned that one of the unintended
consequences of the clause is that the Bill does not make it clear
whether removing the pupil from the school premises would be regarded
as an exclusion or disciplinary penalty, as defined by the Education
and Inspections Act 2006, in which case safeguards would
apply.</div>
					<a name="0802298000454"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000856"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> When the hon. Gentleman was making his points about
pupil referral units, I was not entirely clear
whether he was making a distinction between different kinds of special
needs. I was once a governor of a special school where the youngsters
were EBD&#151; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column812" />Column number: 812</div>emotionally and behaviourally disturbed&#151;and of course, their
behaviour was difficult. I have also been a governor of a school where
the pupils had MLD&#151;mild learning difficulties&#151;and they
were quite different cohorts. Is he distinguishing between the two when
he talks about special needs?</div>
					<a name="0802298000455"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000857"></a>Mr.
Marsden:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to point out that
there are a range of differences, and I observe those distinctions. The
point that I was endeavouring to make is that it can be catastrophic if
someone with a severe autistic disability such as Asperger&#146;s is
referred to a unit that other young people attend for totally different
reasons. That is one of the factors that should be taken into
account.</div>
					<a name="0802298000456"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that there is a suggestion that in some circumstances there would be a
review mechanism, through regulations made under the Bill, after a
period of time. The problem with that is that, especially for the sort
of young people whom I am talking about, if they are referred
inappropriately to such establishments, the effects on that young
person could be catastrophic, particularly if they have to remain there
for some three or four weeks before it is established that that is an
inappropriate place for them to be. Therefore, if the Government intend
to continue with clause 133 in its current form, the NAS and SEC would
at least like consideration to be given to a proactive statement in
that respect, rather than a reactive one some 20 or 30 days
later. It is not a question of challenging the motives and the
intentions, but of considering the possibility of the law of unintended
consequences. I urge Ministers and their officials to reflect on the
real concerns that have been expressed by the organisations concerned,
which I am articulating today.</div>
					<a name="0802298000457"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000858"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> It is a reasonable test of a civilised society that
we should judge how it deals with its most vulnerable citizens.
Children with special educational needs are among the most vulnerable.
The proposals and briefings of the NAS and the SEC have done the
Committee a great service. I pay tribute to them and their work. I am
grateful for the chance to follow the hon. Member for Blackpool, South
who has also highlighted their
comments.</div>
					<a name="0802298000458"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to
me that the issues are these. The clause makes some sensible provisions
about exclusion, but the NAS and SEC wish for the particular
circumstances that affect so many children with special educational
needs, particularly children with learning difficulties, should be
taken into account in the application of those provisions.
Understandably, they suggest that we strike out the clause. I am not
sure that that is the right solution because it would get rid of what
are sensible provisions for most purposes and in most circumstances. In
responding, the Minister needs to have a convincing answer as to how
children with special educational needs are to be dealt with,
particularly those children whose cases the NAS and SEC have
highlighted.</div>
					<a name="0802298000459"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000859"></a>Angela
Watkinson:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that subsection (1)
of proposed new section 29A of the Education Act 2002 requires any
registered pupil to attend any place outside the school premises for
educational provisions to improve their behaviour? Is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column813" />Column number: 813</div>not the ideal situation to have a separate place
within the school in the pastoral care department? There a child with
special needs is not in a position to disrupt the education of their
peers, but has a place within familiar surrounds, within the school
building where they can have correctional improvements and
treatment.</div>
					<a name="0802298000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000860"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> My hon. Friend may have seen that kind of provision
working in her constituency, as I have in mine. She is right that there
are circumstances where it is much better to isolate the child but not
outside the school premises, with all that that means. That may be
particularly true with the kind of children that the hon. Member for
Blackpool, South spoke of and that the organisations that I mentioned
champion.</div>
					<a name="0802298000461"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000861"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend think that another problem is
that there has been a cutback in special schools and that for some
pupils with EBD a special school is a good option? It would be wrong
for a child of that sort to end up in a pupil referral unit, when they
actually need specialist support.</div>
					<a name="0802298000462"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000862"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I intend to speak about EBD at some length. My hon.
Friend is right. The biggest growth in statements is in EBD. The number
of children with emotional and behavioural difficulties seems to grow
inexorably. Almost by definition, there are discipline issues
associated with those children; they are challenging in the classroom
and difficult to teach. It is essential that we get the regime right
within mainstream schools, where we have children with those
challenges, and that we are clear about when it is better for those
children to be educated
elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="0802298000463"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
other groups of children as well as those with emotional and
behavioural difficulties that fall into that category. I am mindful of
children and young people with acquired brain injury, who display some
of the characteristics typical of children and adults with autism, like
the inability to concentrate, inappropriate behaviour and difficulty
forming relationships. Those are features of people with acquired brain
injury, which sometimes make it difficult for them to interact with
people supervising them and with their peers.</div>
					<a name="0802298000464"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Blackpool,
South mentioned this point, but it is worth amplifying. The National
Autistic Society emphasises that autistic children are frequently
bullied. That bullying can lead to a disproportionate reaction on their
part. That is what leads to the exclusion or disciplinary action.
Another feature of autistic children is that they are often encouraged
to behave in ways&#151;sometimes seeking peer group
approval&#151;that get them into trouble and identify them in a way
that is unhelpful and often unfair. The provision affects all kinds of
groups of children who might find themselves in circumstances that we
would not, as a Committee, judge to be reasonable. This part of the
Bill must at least be applied with sensitivity in that
regard.</div>
					<a name="0802298000687"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div>
					<a name="0802298000465"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are five
other things that I would like to say about this issue. First, the
issue is largely about the training and preparation of teachers. We
said earlier that many teachers find themselves ill equipped to deal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column814" />Column number: 814</div>with the challenges presented by special needs children in mainstream
schools. A reason to strike the clause out, were it not for its other
virtues, is that sometimes exclusion, removal or discipline is the
easiest reaction for a teacher who is not equipped to deal with the
challenges presented by an autistic child, a child with an acquired
brain injury or a child with another kind of learning difficulty, who
is displaying inappropriate behaviour, failing to interact with their
peers or reacting to authority in an unacceptable way simply out of
frustration. It is critical that we focus on the preparation of our
schools, head teachers and teachers and ensure that those who are
responsible for special needs policy in schools understand the policy
behind this part of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="0802298000466"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, there
is an issue about resources. By that, I mean not money, but the
physical resources alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for
Upminster when she talked about a separate area within a school where
people can be taken to be educated separately for a while. Much of this
issue is about not going down an avenue that leads to a cul-de-sac from
which we cannot escape. Once one has taken action that leads to a child
being taken out of school and possibly formally excluded, it is hard to
draw back. A process begins that has a degree of self-fulfilment about
it. It could end up at a destination that was not intended initially.
The capacity to take a decision that is not so definitive, but which
allows a child to be dealt with separately from the remainder of the
school for a short period will often be sufficient to satisfy that
child&#146;s needs, to protect the interests of their peers and to
allow the teachers to adopt the right
strategies.</div>
					<a name="0802298000467"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000863"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman is speaking in order,
but I remind him that we have just over 10 minutes to go and that other
hon. Members wish to speak in this debate. Whether we will get to
further debates is another matter, but he might like to abbreviate his
remarks if he
can.</div>
					<a name="0802298000468"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000864"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I shall finish my three remaining points, leaving
plenty of time for other hon. Members to contribute to the
debate.</div>
					<a name="0802298000469"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third point
is that it is very important that local authorities and others have a
clearly defined strategy on this matter. My experience of local
government as shadow Schools Minister, before I was elevated to higher
and further education, was that local authority practice in these terms
is variable. Some local authorities have very good, well-established
policies, while others are&#151;I am trying to choose my words kindly
and carefully&#151;considerably less thought through about these
matters.</div>
				
					<a name="0802298000470"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
fourth point is that it is very important that agencies such as the
National Autistic Society the charities that have expertise in this
field are properly involved in policy formation.</div>
					<a name="0802298000471"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I would simply say that
some of this debate arises from the wholesale integration into
mainstream education of children who should not be there. Although the
Government have taken, albeit faltering and grudging, steps down the
road that we have wanted them to take from the outset, I urge the
Government once again to share the Opposition&#146;s faith, passion
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column815" />Column number: 815</div>belief in special schools, which are very often the
best place to educate the sort of children of whom we are speaking.
They are secure environments, with high levels of expertise, where
those children most frequently find the opportunity to fulfil their
potential.</div>
					<a name="0802298000472"></a><div class="hs_Para">I strongly
endorse the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for Blackpool,
South and the briefings we have been given by some excellent agencies.
I hope the Minister, who must have this clause, will at least mitigate
its effects in the ways that we have
described.</div>
					<a name="0802298000473"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0802298000865"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): I shall try to gain the peer
group approval that the hon. Gentleman spoke about by being fairly
brief and not eating into the last 10 minutes that we have for the mere
40 amendments and new clauses ahead of us.</div>
					<a name="0802298000474"></a><div class="hs_Para">I add our support for the
comments made by the hon. Member for Blackpool, South; we share his
concerns about the clause. We hope that the Minister will respond
positively. Could he also let us know, if the clause is not to be
deleted or amended, what responsibilities the schools will have to
notify local authorities of any action they take under the
clause?</div>
					<a name="0802298000475"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000866"></a>Mr.
Heald:
						</b> I have two points to make. Woolgrove school in my
constituency is a special school that has an autism unit. The special
care and help that its staff are able to give young people with such
problems is fantastic. I hope that, rather than go down the route of
pupil referral units and similar temporary expedients, the Minister
will give due prominence in his policy making to having more units of
that sort. One of the problems is that there is not enough specialist
provision for autism and the wide spectrum it covers.</div>
					<a name="0802298000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">My other point is that I used to
be the governor of a very good special school for EBD youngsters. It
strikes me as very sad that that school is closed. It was an Inner
London education authority school, and one of the good things about
ILEA was that it had some extremely good special schools provision. I
hope that the Minister and the Government have learnt that it is a
mistake to close special schools, which have such fantastic staff and
the ability to help some of our most vulnerable
children.</div>
					<a name="0802298000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000867"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> A school governing body already has the power
under section 29(3) of the Education Act 2002 to direct a pupil
off-site for education or training. That was intended to enable schools
to send pupils to other schools or further education colleges to take
academic or vocational subjects that their own school could not
provide, but the power is also applied for a number of other purposes
that may go beyond that stated in the 2002 Act, and we should tidy that
up.</div>
					<a name="0802298000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know that some schools use the power for the purpose
of sending challenging pupils to various forms of alternative provision
without resorting to the more punitive exclusion legislation. I have
listened very carefully and will reflect on what my hon. Friend the
Member for Blackpool, South has said. Reliance on section 29(3) of the
2002 Act, where the underlying reason for transfer is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column816" />Column number: 816</div>behaviour related rather than instruction or training related, is
unsatisfactory. We cannot go further in guidance on the existing
legislation.</div>
					<a name="0802298000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want
legal clarity for school partnerships, such as the excellent Chesil
Educational Partnership in my  own constituency, to improve
behaviour and tackle persistent absence. Partnerships must be able to
transfer a challenging pupil between schools or from schools or
partnership-managed alternative provision without the parent&#146;s
consent, particularly when the parent is a major part of the problem.
The clause would allow governing bodies to do that and remain clearly
within the
law.</div>
					<a name="0802298000480"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000868"></a>Mr.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000869"></a>Jim

						</b> Let me make some progress. If I have time to give
way in the next five minutes, I shall certainly do
so.</div>
					<a name="0802298000482"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the arguments
that were made, quite properly, about pupils with special educational
needs and disabilities, the new power does not in any way relieve the
governing body of its duty to use its best endeavours to ensure that
the special educational provision is made for pupils with special
educational needs; neither does it relieve the local authority of its
duties to arrange special educational provision specified in
children&#146;s statements of SEN, if they have a statement. Guidance
on the new power will send strong messages about the extra
consideration needed for pupils with special educational
needs.</div>
					<a name="0802298000483"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy to
release the indicative regulations to the Committee before the report.
If my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South, subsequent to my
publishing those indicative regulations, would like to meet me to
discuss them and bring with him representatives of the NAS and the SEC,
I would be happy to have such a meeting to make sure that we get the
regulations right. I could then respond to all the other points that
have been made. I could respond to them in detail now but, given the
time, it would be better if I did not do
so.</div>

						</b> To pick up on the point made by the hon. Member for
Blackpool, South, if the child to be taken out of a mainstream school
and put somewhere else is autistic, does the Minister acknowledge that

							<a name="0802298000889"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> On a point of order, Mr. Bayley, I
would like to take the opportunity to thank you for the way in which
you have managed the Committee&#146;s proceedings. At times they have
not been easy, particularly today when there has been so much business
to complete. Last week we thanked Mr. Bercow when we knew
that it was his last time in the Chair.</div>
					<a name="0802298000566"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Clerks, the Official Reporters, the doorkeepers and the police for
facilitating the Committee&#146;s proceedings. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column831" />Column number: 831</div>I could not have performed my duties without the support of my invisible
and unheard officials, and I am grateful to them.</div>
					<a name="0802298000567"></a><div class="hs_Para">I extend my thanks to the hon.
Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for South Holland and
The Deepings&#151;a remarkable double act that I have worked opposite
before. I have tried to think of the appropriate analogy&#151;Little
and Large, Starsky and Hutch, Laurel and Hardy, or Marx and Engels.
Morecambe and Wise came to mind, as one of the hon. Gentlemen seems to
put the more into Morecambe and the other, on some occasions, puts the
wise into Wise. The Committee&#146;s proceedings would not have been
the same without the meandering of the hon. Member for South Holland
and The Deepings, as opposed to the comments of the straight man that
he works with. His meanderings took us to Proust, William Morris,
liberalism, his son and his wife, and were all part of the rich
tapestry and entertainment of the Committee.</div>
					<a name="0802298000568"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank the hon. Members
for Yeovil and for Bristol, West who provided robust opposition. They
are not so much a double act as a tag wrestling team, as I think this
is the only occasion when we have seen them in the room
together.</div>
					<a name="0802298000569"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, my
hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham, also helped me with the eight
clauses that he took through. During the course of this Committee he
became a father, and the football team that his constituency is named
after and he supports won a domestic cup, even though it is a less
important one. I congratulate him.</div>
					<a name="0802298000570"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have also had significant
contributions from the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire with
his obsessions, and great expertise and wisdom from my hon. Friend the
Member for Llanelli.</div>
					<a name="0802298000571"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been ably supported by the Whip. My hon. Friend the Member for
Worcester has, as ever, been very helpful to me and there has been
great support behind me, principally from my hon. Friend the Member for
Bridgend but also from my hon. Friends the Members for Hove and for
Llanelli and even, on one occasion, my hon. Friend the Member for
Blackpool, South.</div>
					<a name="0802298000572"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have not mentioned everybody because we all want to go home but I am
very grateful to them all. Again, thank you, Mr.
Bayley.</div>
					<a name="0802298000573"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000890"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Bayley. This has been an interesting Bill Committee, as all Committees
on which my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings
serves tend to be.</div>
					<a name="0802298000574"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank you, Mr. Bayley, for your objective and cheerful
chairmanship. I thank my hon. Friend for sharing the burden of
representing the Opposition viewpoint on the Bill. He has a charismatic
style that is welcome and he can always be relied upon to fill space
and time when needed. He is as much a part of the arts and crafts
movement as William Morris&#151;or at least a part of that era. He is
also a ferret when it comes to detailed scrutiny of Bills. His support
has been very welcome.</div>
					<a name="0802298000575"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my hon. Friend the
Member for Upminster for her assiduous whipping and her contributions
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column832" />Column number: 832</div>the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire
reflected my passion for phonics with his equally passionate concern
about reading standards. I am grateful to him for airing those concerns
so assiduously and so frequently. I am also grateful to my hon. Friend
the Member for Broxbourne for his friendly and always interesting
contributions to the debate.</div>
					<a name="0802298000576"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been pleasure dealing
with both Ministers, who have always been polite and as full as they
dare in explaining the clauses and opposing our amendments.</div>
					<a name="0802298000577"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, it has also been a
pleasure listening to the hon. Member for Yeovil, who shares so many of
our concerns about standards, and to the hon. Member for Bristol, West
in his later contributions to the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="0802298000578"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0802298000891"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Further to the point of order, Mr.
Bayley. I too thank you and Mr. Bercow for the way in which
you have chaired what I think has been a very good-natured Committee
over these past few weeks. I add my thanks to the Clerks, officials,
doorkeepers, policemen and <i class="I">Hansard</i> reporters, and all those who
have helped us with our proceedings.</div>
					<a name="0802298000579"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank those on whom
Opposition Members tend to have to rely&#151;those outside bodies who
provide and, as the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings
said, sometimes inspire to a great extent the amendments that we table.
I mention in particular the National Union of Teachers and
Barnardo&#146;s, who did such a job of inspiring that they may even
have helped to tweak elements of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="0802298000580"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the Minister, my hon.
Friend, if I may say so, and near neighbour the Member for South
Dorset, who was always extremely patient and constructive and very well
briefed. We hope to see him in this place for many years to come, if I
am allowed to say that without causing offence to anyone in my part of
the world. I thank his colleagues for their patience and for their
assiduous attendance, which sadly did not permit us to spring any
surprises on the Whips. I also thank the hon. Member for Tottenham who
was delivering his child&#151;or second child&#151;at the same time
as he was delivering, as Under-Secretary of State for Innovation,
Universities and Skills, most of the Bill, covering most of the clauses
very effectively.</div>
					<a name="0802298000581"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
this side of the Committee, I obviously thank my hon. Friend the Member
for Bristol, West, particularly for covering during the debates on
attendance notices when I was inadvertently absent and unable to move
one of my own amendments. He did an excellent job. I read his speech
today and it is far better than I could have managed.</div>
					<a name="0802298000582"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the Conservative members
of the Committee. We hoped to hear more about synthetic phonics, but we
enjoyed the contributions of the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton and for North-East Hertfordshire. The latter kept us on
our toes on the importance of reading, writing and, of course,
adding-up.</div>
					<a name="0802298000583"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were
grateful for the entertainment value and the acute observations
provided by the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings. Only
today I was looking at his biographical details. His chosen sport is
darts and we note the relevance of that to many of his contributions. I
was surprised to see that his main  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column833" />Column number: 833</div>hobby is listed as jam making, which I imagine is an activity that takes
some time and involves a great deal of lone activity&#151;we saw
evidence of that in his later contributions in the final stages
today.</div>
					<a name="0802298000584"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
had one moment of great optimism, Mr.
Bayley, when your fellow Chairman, Mr. Bercow, caught the
hon. Gentleman reading a book on liberalism during one of my speeches.
For a moment, until we discovered the nature of volume, I thought that
we could look forward with optimism to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
future political career. I hope that I can lend him a more constructive
book on liberalism to influence his future
contributions.</div>

Chairman:
						</b> I thank colleagues for their kind words about me
and my co-Chairman, and I will pass their comments on to Mr.
Bercow. Like you all, I am indebted to the Clerks, the <i class="I">Hansard</i>
reporters and all the staff who have made it possible for us to conduct
business in the Committee. I am indebted to you all for the wise words
and good humour with which you have conducted the debate on issues on
which sometimes there have been passionate disagreements. Most of all,
I am indebted to John Hayes for deciding that he did not need to raise
a brief point of order at this
point.</div>
