Chairman:
						</b> Following last week&#146;s oral evidence
sessions under my co-Chairman, Mr. Bercow, I welcome Members
back from the opulent surroundings of Portcullis House to the more
familiar territory of the Committee corridor and the more familiar
business of line-by-line scrutiny of the Bill. I trust that we shall
apply ourselves to that task with the required discipline. I have a
couple of announcements to make before we start. Members should feel
free to remove their coats, as it is important that you all feel
comfortable. I remind the Committee that money resolutions and Ways and
Means resolutions relating to the Bill are available in the room for
Members.</div>

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
1</h4>
					<a name="08042973000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Power
to remove documents for
examination</div>
					<a name="08042973000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08042973000352"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Dominic Grieve</b> (Beaconsfield) (Con): I beg to move
amendment No. 51, in
clause 1, page 1, leave out lines 6 to
11.</div>
					<a name="08042973000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I welcome you
to the Chair, Mr. O&#146;Hara? As far as acoustics are
concerned, the fact that it is much easier to hear people in this room
than it was in Portcullis House says something for our Victorian
forebears, so it is rather pleasant to find ourselves here, even
without the modern facilities.</div>
					<a name="08042973000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 1 will give a power to
remove documents for examination. I say to the Minister at the outset
that I have tabled some amendments to clause 1, all of which are
probing and, I hope, will provide the Committee with an opportunity of
seeing and understanding what the Government intend to do in that
area.</div>
					<a name="08042973000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
rather long-established principle of English law that the right to the
privacy of one&#146;s papers is sacrosanct, except where statute or
the necessities of bringing prosecution give the state power to seize
documents. That was established long ago in the case of Entick
<i class="I">v.</i> Carrington, which is the sort of case that one learns about
as a law student and is thereafter permanently engraved on one&#146;s
memory. As I recollect, that case involved a Secretary of State, Lord
Halifax, who seized an individual&#146;s papers. The courts came down
fairly strongly against him in the 18th century, arguing that papers
were some of the most important things that an individual could
possess. In a country that is governed by the rule of law and where
documents may be of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>importance for legal reasons if for nothing else, it is easy to see
where that principle originated. It is also enshrined in the European
convention on human rights, certainly in respect of the clauses that
outline the rights to property and privacy with regard to private
documents.</div>
					<a name="08042973000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
trying to seize material that is linked to terrorism and successfully
bring prosecution, I fully accept that that rule needs to be tempered.
The nub of the matter on which I seek the Minister&#146;s
clarification is this: what extra powers do the Government seek other
than those in ordinary criminal law, which already gives the police the
power, under a warrant, to seize documents that might be connected with
the commission of an offence? It seems that the Government&#146;s
intention in clause 1 is, in those areas where it might be necessary,
to seize documents to ascertain whether they are of a kind that can
then be seized for the purposes of prosecution.</div>
					<a name="08042973000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">When one looks at subsection
(1) in that regard, one will see that three of the provisions cited are
linked to the Terrorism Act 2000. I am sure that the Minister will
correct me if I am wrong, but I was under the impression that the 2000
Act already made provision for that type of preliminary seizure for
ascertaining whether a document was linked to terrorism. In those
circumstances, the first probing amendment that I tabled for the
Committee&#146;s consideration questions whether it is necessary for
those three provisions to be covered. Can the Minister explain that a
little? I dare say that he may, at the same time, take the opportunity
to explain more about the general thrust of the clause, and we can then
go on to consider the amendments that we have tabled on other aspects
of the
clause.</div>
					<a name="08042973000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042973000353"></a>The
Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing
(Mr. Tony McNulty):
						</b> I join the hon. and learned
Gentleman in welcoming you, Mr. O&#146;Hara, to the
Committee. I also concur with him in welcoming everybody to this room
rather than to the dainty little room in which we had the public
evidence sessions. It is a pleasure to stand to speak. With your
indulgence, Mr. O&#146;Hara, we are moving close&#151;as
I promised last week&#151;to a session for the Committee on intercept
as evidence and coroners. I think that it will be on 7 May, which will
hopefully be convenient for all Members who wish to avail of
it.</div>
					<a name="08042973000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I entirely agree
with the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s opening remarks about the
principle of law and the privacy of papers. I hope that we will show
that that concern is reflected in this set of clauses. I also hope that
we will show that the reason for this and other clauses, which is not
simply to enhance or grow the police&#146;s capability to seize
papers, but to seize papers to then ascertain whether the police have
the right to seize them, is the correct focus. However, it might be
useful&#151;as he implied&#151;if I talk a little about the clause
and then come back to the amendment, because that will put matters into
context, with a commensurate reduction in my ramblings on a clause
stand part
debate.</div>
					<a name="08042973000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 1
introduces a power for the police to remove a document for examination
to ascertain whether that document can appropriately be seized. The
police can remove the document to another place, such as a police
station, and retain it there until the examination is complete. The
power is limited to documents found during a terrorism-related search.
The power gives the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>police lawful authority to take a document away for examination, to
determine whether it can be seized. Hon. Members can work out for
themselves examples of where that might be appropriate.</div>
					<a name="08042973000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The police can already seize a
document found during a search where they have reasonable grounds for
believing that the item is authorised by the search power or warrant,
has been obtained in consequence of the commission of an offence, or is
evidence in relation to an offence. The power is to cover situations
where no reasonable grounds exist. For example, where the police have
conducted a search and find a document in a foreign language, they will
not have been able to demonstrate fairly that they have reasonable
grounds for believing that it might be
evidence.</div>
					<a name="08042973000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power
was first suggested by the Northern Ireland Office following the
expiry, in July 2007, of a similar power that applied only to Northern
Ireland and allowed the removal of a document to ascertain whether it
contained information useful to terrorists. The police support the new
power being extended to the whole of the United Kingdom and to allow
examination of whether a document is evidence of wider terrorist
purposes. People will understand that clause 1 establishes that
principle, and elements of the clause detail the time frame for
ascertaining whether seizure is appropriate, as do other clauses that
we will discuss in relation to other
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08042973000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
of the power is therefore to allow the removal of documents to
ascertain whether the threshold for seizure&#151;usually reasonable
grounds for belief&#151;is met. If the police found a document in a
foreign language, they would need to remove it for translation before
an officer could form the reasonable grounds for belief that the
document was a terrorist publication, for example, and seizure of the
document could take place. Without that power, the police may not be
able to take possession of documents that might amount to significant
evidence of a terrorist threat. The power may be used only when a
search is carried out under the terrorism-related search powers of
clause 1(1). Those allow for documents to be seized, but apply
thresholds for such
seizures.</div>
					<a name="08042973000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would limit the power to documents found under the searches
listed in clause 1(1)(d) to (f): searches for evidence of the
commission of weapons-related offences; searches in relation to control
orders; and searches for terrorist publications. The searches under
paragraphs (a) and (c), which would be removed by the amendment, fall
into two categories. The first category includes section 43(1) and (2)
of the Terrorism Act 2000, which allows for the search of suspected
terrorists before and on arrest. Both searches allow for seizure on
reasonable suspicion. It is important that the power to remove
documents is attached to those powers, for the reason already given
that the current threshold for seizure might not be met for a document,
the initial nature of which is entirely
obscure.</div>
					<a name="08042973000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
category includes the search power under paragraphs 1, 3, 11, 15, 28
and 31 of schedule 5 to the 2000 Act, which allows for searches that
take place as part of a terrorist investigation. Other than the powers
under paragraphs 28 and 31, which relate to Scotland, those powers are
covered under part 2 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act
2001.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>

						<a name="08042973000354"></a>
							<b class="B">David
T.C. Davies</b> (Monmouth) (Con): The Minister is making a
compelling case. However, if the power to remove documents that might
be written in a foreign language is necessary to investigate terrorist
offences, will the same power not be necessary to investigate organised
crime, which is also international? Why is there a disparity between
the proposals for terrorism legislation and the current legislation for
organised
crime?</div>
					<a name="08042973000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042973000355"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman knows that the Bill relates
only to terrorism. He makes a fair point, and I am not sure whether the
matter was covered in the serious and organised crime legislation from
last year. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome says from a sedentary position that it was not covered, but I
will double-check
that.</div>
					<a name="08042973000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
power under the clause is needed in addition to existing powers because
effectively we are lowering the threshold for removing documents for
examination. That will allow the removal of documents not only that the
constable is authorised to search, but that might turn out to be
evidence of terrorist involvement. As hon. Members know, we are
lowering the threshold only momentarily. We will come on to discuss the
timing. It is important not only that the clause stands part, but that
it stands without the amendment. I hope that I have explained broadly
the new power to remove documents, why I think the clause should
prevail and why the amendment should
not.</div>
					<a name="08042973000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042973000356"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Before I call the hon. and learned Member for
Beaconsfield to reply, I judge that in responding to the amendment the
Minister in effect gave a clause stand part argument. I therefore give
notice that I shall move clause stand part formally. If hon. Members
wish to comment on the clause, they should do so during this
debate.</div>
					<a name="08042973000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042973000357"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I have no objection to that course of action.
During discussion of the coming amendments, we will be able to look at
the subsequent detail. The Minister has outlined the principle of the
clause and I am content with that. As I indicated at the outset, I will
not resist the clause in its
generality.</div>
					<a name="08042973000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has made some important points and I come back to one,
although it may feature in the next group of amendments. As I
understand it, he has acknowledged that we are dealing with the removal
of documentation with no requirement of even reasonable suspicion that
it is terrorist-linked. Effectively, this is a blanket power in a
terrorism search to remove anything until the authorities&#151;that
is, the police&#151;have satisfied themselves that it is not
terrorism-related and therefore not open to seizure.</div>
					<a name="08042973000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to
me that that raises several issues to which we can return in a moment,
and that is why I will not labour my remarks at this stage. First, is
removing the reasonableness test that normally applies warranted? Could
it not be argued that if one goes into a place where one starts
collecting material, and one has a reasonable suspicion that there is a
terrorism-related matter concerning those premises, it probably is
reasonable to remove documents which one cannot immediately identify?
Therefore, removing the reasonableness clause might be going too
far.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="08042973000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second question, to which I shall return under the next group of
amendments, concerns the absence of time limits. The third
matter&#151;I raise it now because I am conscious of the fact that I
did not table an amendment on the issue&#151;is about allowing the
individual whose papers have been taken to retain a copy, which does
not appear to be expressly provided. The more I listen to the Minister,
the more I begin to think that the provision of a copy might well be
one of the key things that the person concerned ought to be
doing.</div>
					<a name="08042973000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it has not
been shown that such papers are terrorist-related, and if the
individual concerned has not been arrested&#151;because, otherwise,
other powers would kick in&#151;the Minister must guard against legal
challenges. I can well foresee a charge being mounted by a person who
argues that his private papers have been seized when there is nothing
wrong with them, and that quite a long time afterwards he has still not
heard whether the police are going to hand them back. From the
Minister&#146;s point of view, the danger is that if those documents
were required for some legal purpose, claims for damages could be made
against the police and the Government if the Government have not got
that right.</div>
					<a name="08042973000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
come back to those details again under the next set of amendments. I
thank you for your indulgence, Mr. O&#146;Hara, in
allowing me to stray a little bit on the generality of the clause, but
it seems to me that those are the key issues. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div>

it there until the examination is
completed.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08042973000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the face of it, this is a blanket power for a constable who comes
across any document, the contents of which cannot reasonably be
ascertained by looking at it immediately. That would include, for
example, a document in a foreign language that he cannot read or, for
that matter, any document that may be encrypted on a computer. The
constable could take it away and retain it until such time as the
examination is completed. There 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>is no time limit and there is no requirement of
reasonableness in respect of the seizure actually taking
place.</div>

therefore be grateful if the Minister could deal specifically with the
issue of the reasonable grounds and whether it is required to be put
in. Amendment No. 57 would alter subsection (2) to
read:</div>
					<a name="08042973000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where a
constable who carries out a search to which this section applies finds
a document that he has reasonable grounds for believing is one that may
be seized, he may remove the document to another place for the purpose
of ascertaining whether the document is one that may be seized and
retain it there until the examination is
completed.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08042973000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I find it
difficult to see how the introduction of the notion of reasonable
grounds would create problems for the police in such a setting. The
police might go along to a house and find a document in Arabic which
may be either an al-Qaeda wish list of the things they would wish the
individual to do in this country or a bill for a restaurant in
Peshawar. If the constable cannot himself read what the document says
that must be reasonable grounds for believing that it is one that may
be seized. I would therefore be grateful if the Minister would explain
why the concept of reasonableness appears to have been taken out of the
section.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): I agree with the
hon. and learned Gentleman that the reasonableness test has already
been applied in respect of the warrant for the initial search, and
therefore it is reasonable to suppose that a constable may reasonably
suspect anything that is found and may wish to remove it. However, does
he see any compatibility in this part of the Bill with the PACE code B?
The two seem out of kilter. His amendment, and that in my name and that
of my hon. Friend, would put the Bill back into
conformity.</div>

							<a name="08042973000362"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. The Bill
is out of kilter, and that is precisely why I wanted to highlight the
issue. While I am conscious that we are dealing with terrorism and that
people have anxieties about terrorism&#151;that is why we have a
Counter-Terrorism Bill to give special powers&#151;every departure
from the ordinary processes of criminal law gives me a slight shiver,
and I need good justification for such departure. My hon. Friend the
Member for Monmouth correctly raised the point, &#147;If terrorism,
why not organised crime?&#148; The answer is that for organised crime
you still have to have a reasonableness test. Organised crime in many
ways impacts severely on the well-being of the citizens of the country.
That is why, when I come across something of that sort, I ask myself
whether it is for the Government to justify the departure from the
reasonableness test because, on the face of it, it is difficult to see
how the test will provide any sort of fetter or inhibition on the
ability of the police to do their job in that
context.</div>

							<b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): I welcome you,
Mr. O&#146;Hara, and I am sure that we will have a
constructive exchange under your chairmanship. I welcome the fact that
the Minister started by offering the briefing on intercept and coroners
matters.</div>
					<a name="08042973000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is difficult to follow the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield,
who has carefully set out the reasons for amendment No. 57. The wording
of our amendment No. 1 is identical to that in
amendment No. 57. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div>crux of the matter&#151;as the hon. and learned Gentleman set
out&#151;is the reasonable grounds for believing that a document may
be seized. A number of members pointed out that without the test of
reasonable grounds the Bill would be out of kilter with existing
legislation. I hope that the Minister will explain why he believes that
that is justified, and whether the test&#151;if it were
included&#151;would impose any constraints that the Committee may
not  be aware
of.</div>
					<a name="08042973000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042973000364"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> On that point, yes it would, because the thrust
of the amendment negates the clause. Members need to
understand&#151;as I am sure that they do&#151;that this is not
about fishing. It is not a carte-blanche&#151;PACE and everything
else aside&#151;for the police to go fishing just because it is a
terrorist case. I urge members to read the set of clauses carefully. It
is about allowing seizure where there are no reasonable grounds, for a
period of only up to 96 hours. The hon. and learned Member for
Beaconsfield was wrong to say that there is no time limit. That period
is precisely to ascertain whether the police can establish reasonable
grounds, given the obscure nature of the document, to seize it in the
normal legal fashion. That is all. The Committee needs to read all five
interlocking clauses, which go through other points that the hon. and
learned Gentleman made about copies and all the other elements,
including the record of seizure and legal privilege. In that context,
reinserting &#147;reasonable grounds&#148; would make the five
clauses a nonsense and negate them entirely. This power is about the
temporary removal, in these obscure situations, of reasonable
suspicions, grounds for belief and the other assorted reasons why
police can seize a
document.</div>
					<a name="08042973000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take the point that the document could be a restaurant menu from
Peshawar, al-Qaeda&#146;s latest top 10 or something else. However,
these measures are about refining and clarifying the law. I do not
accept the point half made by the hon. and learned Gentleman that on
reasonable grounds, the police can take whatever they like in any
circumstances. We are discussing a temporary, limited power to seize
documents, the origin and content of which are obscure, take them to a
police station, translate them and establish whether they can
appropriately be seized on reasonable grounds. I accept everything that
has been said about privacy of
papers.</div>
					<a name="08042973000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would negate this power entirely. I say in the nicest way possible that
the hon. and learned Gentleman should take the shiver out of his spine
because it is not appropriate. This measure is not a sledgehammer
cracking through the rule of law in any way, shape or form. He should
be aware, as he clearly was not from his introduction, that there will
be time limits and that clear records must be kept. Everything
interlocks across the five clauses. Where appropriate, PACE and
guidelines will be amended and discretion will still depend on the
reasonable and temperate manner in which the police must exercise their
powers.</div>
					<a name="08042973000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assure the Committee that this power is not about weakening the legal
grounds for seizure, other than saying in reasonable circumstances,
&#147;We have come across certain documents. We think that they may
be important to this terrorism case, but we do not know. We cannot on
any reasonable grounds seize them legally. Let&#146;s have 48 or 96
hours&#148;&#151;as one of the later clauses says&#151;&#147;to
ascertain that. We can then either return them or seize them legally on
grounds of reasonable suspicion.&#148;</div>

							<a name="08042973000365"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I agree with the Minister that changes to PACE will
be needed. It will be extremely helpful to the Committee if he
indicates whether he is prepared to make those changes by amendment to
primary legislation in the later stages of the Bill or to publish the
draft changes to the PACE code. That would give some reassurance to the
Committee on the point that he has
raised.</div>
					<a name="08042973000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042973000366"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> That is an entirely reasonable point. Whenever
leading in a Committee, I have tried to ensure that whatever hangs off
the Christmas tree, such as subsequent codes of practice, guidance or
statutory instruments, is made available at least in draft or outline
form to the Committee. I give that undertaking. We will make clear the
amendments to PACE in the way that has been done since it was
introduced in 1984. I will eschew the offer of more primary
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08042973000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
PACE codes, the practice that will result from the adoption of the
legislation is that the powers should be used only in efforts to locate
evidence of offences connected with terrorism and officers should not
remove any more material than necessary. That will limit, in this very
serious area, the scope for the police to go fishing and say,
&#147;It&#146;s in French. Get the lorry round and we&#146;ll
take the lot.&#148; Members of the Committee have made an entirely
serious point about that. With your indulgence, Mr.
O&#146;Hara, that is why subsequent clauses will put serious time
limits on seizure. In the first instance that will be 48 hours and, by
exception, it will be 96 hours. That is it. There will be no other
extension beyond that. Quite rightly, there are clauses about how we
will deal with documents that could accrue legal privilege. There must
also be a very clear record of the
seizure.</div>
					<a name="08042973000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the limited time, it is not appropriate to talk about copies being left
with the person whose documents are seized. The hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s notion that this is for however long the police want
is simply erroneous if one reads the appropriate clause. There is, at
least in part, the reasonable notion that this might be just another
excuse to go fishing through the PACE codes. I take the point made by
the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome very seriously in that regard
and will seek to bring something forward, whatever else is added on to
the Christmas tree, at least in summary, if not in draft and if not in
full.</div>

why they are written in some sort of cipher or encryption, we are back
on the territory of routine law. If they are written in Tolkienesque
runes and the guy is a plumber there might be reasonable grounds to
assume that he is seeking to hide information and therefore reasonable
grounds to seize them in the normal fashion. This is just about asking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>whether further exploration of the document, be it encoded, in a
different language or in whatever form, will reveal whether it is legal
for it to be seized in the normal fashion on the basis of reasonable
suspicion. I think that that is eminently reasonable in that regard. I
was not knocking plumbers or Tolkien when I used that
example.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042973000370"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> That is entirely the point. As the hon. and
learned Gentleman says, very often there will be entirely reasonable
grounds. But we are talking possibly about encryption and certainly
about language where we think, &#147;Hello, it&#146;s in Arabic so
it must be suspicious.&#148; But it could be no more than the duty
free list for a flight to the Gulf or the Urdu version of the menu from
the restaurant round the corner, which has kindly produced its menus in
Urdu as well as English. All this does is afford the police the
time&#151;48 hours&#151;to say, &#147;I think, but I cannot hand
on heart say, with reasonable suspicion or an appropriate belief, that
this document is in accord with the warrant and the grounds for the
search in the first place. May I have 48 hours and no more to explore
that?&#148;</div>
					<a name="08042973000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Gentleman is right. It was in the 2000 Act, but only for
Northern Ireland. I had a nice chat with the hon. Member for Lancaster
and Wyre last night. He told me how he routinely used this law in some
of the searches in a professional context. That is fair and reasonable.
All we are saying is that the Government, with cross-party support, are
deconstructing the entire terrorist and security legislation framework
for Northern Ireland, given the peace process. But we would be remiss
and irresponsible if in the course of that process with our Northern
Ireland colleagues we did not ask whether there were any elements of
that security framework that would be useful and efficient in our
current broader threat of and fight against terrorism. This falls into
that
category.</div>

search a property, what is wrong with getting the trucks in and going
through
everything?</div>

						</b> Because it relies on the word
&#147;reasonable&#148;. Hon. Members can work this out for
themselves. It is not in all circumstances reasonable to say that
because the constable cannot ascertain the contents of a document for
whatever reason&#151;different language, runes, hieroglyphics or
whatever&#151;by definition it must be reasonable to seize that
document lawfully. It could be an &#147;Encyclopaedia
Britannica&#148;, but in Arabic or French rather than English. That
is not meant to demean our officers: they do a splendid job, but are
not multilingual.</div>
					<a name="08042973000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
that this set of clauses does is set parameters within the rule of law
that state that the police should be afforded at least some
time&#151;in this case, 48 hours, but that can potentially be
extended to 96 hours&#151;to explore lawfully whether there is
anything in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>content that might give them reasonable suspicion to seize it, and then
they will keep it. If that is not the case, it should quite rightly go

fulsome&#151;I was in Ireland until rather late yesterday evening, so

provided me with considerable reassurance, and the fact that it
operated in that fashion in Northern Ireland also indicates that it
will not be misused. I want to reflect on this matter in view of the
Minister&#146;s comments. I can see that there remains an argument
for putting reasonableness in, and I am not sure that it would have all
of the downsides that the Minister is anxious about. On the other hand,
I am also pretty well satisfied that what he is putting forward in this

amendment. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain the
necessity of having subsection (4) in the form in which it has been
placed in clause 1. I assume it is because of an anxiety, but what is
the basis of that anxiety? If it were not included, the powers of
seizure could not start to operate at a time when the police had
subsequently decided that they wanted to seize the
document.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042973000376"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> As I understand it, that is entirely the case. As
I said earlier, all that clause 1 affords the constable is the power to
remove the document&#151;rather than lawfully seizing it&#151;to
another place for 48 hours, up to 96 hours, to translate it or do
whatever else he needs to do with it to ascertain whether there is
reasonable suspicion to seize it. Without that subsection, there is no
second phase to that process. Having removed the document and
established that there might be reasonable grounds for seizure,
subsection (4) is necessary to allow the legal process to continue so
that the seizure is lawful, as the honourable and learned Gentleman
suggested. It is worth reading out, because the obscure relativism of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>the English is wonderful, although there are other examples in the Bill
that are real peaches. It
states:</div>
					<a name="08042973000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
a document is removed under this section a constable has the same
powers of seizure as if it had not been removed and any matters
discovered on examination after removal had been discovered before its
removal.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08042973000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
wonderful English legalese at it best, but its import is precisely as
the hon. Gentleman suggests. The 48 or 96 hours is a temporary step out
from the due process, to establish whether there are reasonable
grounds, etc. The seizure process needs to be ongoing, and all that
subsection (4) does is to confirm that the seizure is lawful or that
reasonable suspicion was not grounded and therefore the documents are
to be returned. It is as simple&#151;in its language&#151;as
that.</div>

							<a name="08042973000378"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> In the context that I have described, the five
clauses hang together. Clause 2 creates a new offence of wilfully
obstructing a constable when he is exercising the power under clause 1
to remove documents for examination, pending lawful seizure or
otherwise. That will help to ensure that the power can be used
efficiently and effectively by deterring potential obstruction of the
constable. It is a summary offence, punishable by up to 51
weeks&#146; imprisonment in England and Wales, 12 months in Scotland
and six months in Northern Ireland. The sentence limit in England and
Wales will be six months until section 281(5) of the Criminal Justice
Act 2003 comes into force, when it will be 51 weeks. The purpose of the
sentence is to act as a deterrent to obstructing the constable. The
penalty for the offence is no less than that for similar offences of
obstruction, for example, under section 47 of the Terrorism Act 2000
and section 26 of the Immigration Act 1971. Imposing a sentence of any
longer than that would be disproportionate to the nature of the
offence. It is difficult to conceive of circumstances where simply
obstructing an officer removing a document could justify, say, three
years or more in
prison.</div>
					<a name="08042973000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
individual were involved in terrorist activity he would be charged with
a terrorist offence, and if convicted dealt with appropriately for that
offence. It is unlikely that a person would be charged with the lesser
offence of obstructing a constable were he guilty of the more serious
behaviour. If it is clear that there is no terrorist involvement, there
is no reason for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>individual to be treated differently from any other non-terrorist
suspect. Interlocking with all the other elements of this part of the
Bill, that is appropriate and
proportionate.</div>

Grieve:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister. I do not disagree
with anything that he said. However, I wish to raise a more general
point, which probably does not require to be touched on in this Bill
but which I think has some bearing on the matter. The Minister
has, I understand, confined obstruction to physical obstruction
or attempting, I suppose, to chuck a document in the dustbin. One of
the issues that we have had to consider on a number of
occasions&#151;as he is aware&#151;is encryption keys and encrypted
material. Some of the material that we are concerned with here is, or
could be, encrypted material that is downloaded from a computer. I
would be grateful if the Minister could tell the Committee how the law
stands on that. My recollection from past debates on the subject is
that there has been anxiety as to whether the penalties are stiff
enough in respect of non-co-operation of that kind. That is why I
tabled some amendments to the clause, although I am aware that they are
totally deficient because they would require Crown court and not
magistrates court procedure. While the Minister has reassured me
completely regarding what I would call the old-fashioned offence of
obstruction&#151;as I think it is generally understood&#151;I
continue to be anxious that we have a proper regime in place, which
provides a sufficient deterrent for somebody thinking that an easy way
out is not to provide encryption keys when encrypted material has been
seized.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Wallace</b>
							<b class="B">:</b>
						I want to follow on from my hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and ask the Minister whether
he is satisfied by the severity in the clause. The consequences of
obstruction during a search can be quite severe, especially the
obstruction of forensic evidence. A vast proportion of terrorist cases
obtain convictions on the basis of forensics, rather than other types
of evidence. There are also many cases where forensic evidence fails
because the evidence has been corrupted by contamination. A suspect
could damage the evidence and so opt for the lesser offence of
obstructing evidence, rather than that which could be proven by the
forensics that they
disrupt.</div>

spoken to any proposals. The hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield
has rather elegantly interpolated an entirely spurious debate in terms
of the Bill, but one that it is very important to have on
counter-terrorism. As he is in order, we must be
too.</div>
					<a name="08042973000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. and learned Gentleman asked whether the arrangements for ensuring
that a key to encryption is provided are adequate. An anxiety was
expressed in our evidence sessions by the Metropolitan Police
Commissioner that the tariff was insufficiently high to allow for
remanding a suspect in custody, rather than bail being given by a lower
court. That is a genuine concern because some of us see custody as an
answer if it is impossible to interpret encrypted material in the
period allowed for pre-charge detention. I would be grateful for the
Minister&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>view on whether we are right about the ability of a
court to detain somebody who wilfully withholds the key to encrypted
material that might be of evidential value in a terrorism
case.</div>

							<a name="08042973000382"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> The bail point should be pursued. I am aware that
Sir Ian made those remarks. As I understand it, under section 49 of the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, five years is the maximum
tariff for such an offence. We can explore elsewhere whether that is
appropriate. For our purposes, there is no power under the Bill for the
police to demand the key to un-encrypt a document. That is partly
because we have the RIPA
powers.</div>
					<a name="08042973000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful for what the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said about
the reasonableness of a charge of obstruction. I do not entirely agree
with the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre because if the obstruction
becomes more serious than is described by the hon. and learned Member
for Beaconsfield, other charges may kick in. If the offence turns into
wilful assault or something else, the relevant charges will
prevail.</div>
					<a name="08042973000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Lancaster and Wyre is right in his broad point about the
ability to utilise forensics in terrorism cases and that is dealt with
elsewhere in the Bill. In the narrow field of clause 1 and the
temporary seizure to establish the legality of formal seizure,
obstruction as outlined is entirely right. As I think I said last week,
we have finalised, produced and have in place the statutory instruments
and codes of practice necessary for the part of RIPA that deals with
encryption so that it works effectively. We agreed quite rightly with
the industry that that had to be done in a practical way for it to be
effective, rather than on a whim or exhortation from the Palace of
Westminster, which would cause enormous difficulties in the
practicability of establishing the
charge.</div>
					<a name="08042973000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Lord knows that I do not want to challenge an established QC, rather
than a more recent one and I congratulate the hon. and learned Member
for Beaconsfield again for attaining silk. I use the term
&#147;Friend&#148; loosely, but my hon. and learned Friend the
Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) said on Second
Reading that in effect, under common law and the rule of law, the
Government have indefinite detention powers on encryption because if a
judge in a trial instructs an individual to give the key to un-encrypt
a database, it is contempt if he fails to do so, and he can be
imprisoned for contempt for ever. The judge will call him up every now
and then to ask whether he is able to behave. If the answer is no, the
judge will say, &#147;Well off you go.&#148; My hon. and learned
Friend alluded to the fact that that was entirely indefinite and that
that was the way to deal with such
cases.</div>

							<a name="08042973000383"></a>Mr.

						</b> The hon. and learned Member for Medway is
absolutely right. The only problem is that that is on the basis that
the case comes before a court. If the only basis on which the
prosecution is likely to be brought is contained in the encrypted
material, the judge will not have the opportunity to coerce the
defendant in that
fashion.</div>

encryption 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>is dealt with elsewhere, I think that the obstruction offence under the
clause is appropriate and proportionate. I repeat that I accept some of
the concerns that hon. Members have. However, clauses 1 to 5 hang
together for the limited period in question and I think that they are
appropriate. Hon. Members can see how they will assist searches related

between the proposals and the operation of the Criminal Justice and

privileged documents, such as the time required to determine whether an
item should be seized, the number of persons that are required to carry

<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> The Minister huffs and puffs and
says &#147;No,&#148; but the Home Department has already lost a
case on this specific point. It would be wise for the Home Department
to at least consider the possibility that occasionally it may be wrong
in advance of going before a court. He will know about Regina <i class="I">v</i>.
Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Daly, 2001, a case
about the blanket seizure of documents in the context of the Prison
Service. The House of Lords unanimously held that including legally
privileged documents in that was a breach of the appellant&#146;s
right under article 8(1), quite apart from other provisions. Therefore,
if we can safeguard the Government&#146;s intention in that respect
while maintaining the rights of the citizen under human rights
legislation, that would be to the advantage of what the Minister is
trying to achieve, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>rather than to its detriment. The provisions will achieve very little if

Grieve:
						</b> I agree entirely with the general thrust of the
points made by the hon. Members for Carshalton and Wallington and for
Somerton and Frome about the importance of clause 3. If we do not get
it right, I have no doubt that there will be a successful challenge
under the European convention on human rights. I am not even sure
whether one would even have to go to the European convention on human
rights, because the principle of protection of legal privilege is so
well established in common law that it would probably be feasible for
the judiciary to express concern that the entire fairness of the trial
process had been vitiated and thereby bring a prosecution to a close.
It is very much in the Government&#146;s interests to get that aspect
of the clause correct.</div>
					<a name="08042973000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder whether amendment No.
56, which I tabled, does not go closer to meeting the issue that the
Government have got to deal with than the approach set out in amendment
No. 2. Notwithstanding the need to separate privileged and
non-privileged material, the Government must ensure that there can be
no contamination of the fairness of the trial process, but amendment
No. 2 would provide only a series of requirements or hoops to be leapt
through before one could start dealing with the material in the first
place. That is not to suggest that there is anything wrong with the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, but if we were dealing, for example,
with encrypted material or material that was a mixture of both
privileged and non-privileged content in a documentary form&#151;we
are really talking about computerised records in this regard&#151;it
will be difficult for the requirements in amendment No. 2, such as
those relating to time,  to be dealt with satisfactorily. That
is the point that I am putting forward, but I do think that that is a
real issue. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response to
amendment No. 2 and, in due course, amendment No.

point about the ECHR, I did not huff and puff. The points that he made
are important, as indeed are those that were just made by the hon. and
learned Member for Beaconsfield. I do not take issue with the import of
what they suggest, but those matters are better dealt with through
amendments to PACE code B. We want to consider placing the criteria for
seized material as an example of some of the things that might be
considered when dealing with removed material, but that is better done
in the PACE codes than on the face of the Bill. That is certainly the
case with regard to the

substance of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment&#151;I think that
it is better done in PACE code B&#151;there might be a case for
looking in more detail at his amendment, so as to get the import and
principle of the notion either on the face of the Bill or in the codes.
I accept the starting premise that it goes somewhere. I am not
convinced that the PACE codes are the appropriate place for it; I know
that that is different from the 2001 Act. I take very seriously the
points made about the import of legally privileged

is not to say that I am rash enough at this stage to resist the
amendment of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington and accept
the amendment of the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield. I assure
the Committee that I will take away and consider the thrust of the
subsequent amendment because the matter is so important. I think that
the issue should be covered in an amendment to the codes and that it
should be looked at in some detail to establish the parameters. In the
case of the searches, I am not inclined prescriptively to limit in the
Bill&#151;in the way suggested by the amendment&#151;the ability to
search and seize in what is, in these five clauses, speculative
activity. &#147;I think that I might have reasonable grounds to seize
this document&#148; is the thrust of our deliberations. In that
spirit, I resist the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment&#151;not
because he is a Liberal but because of the nature of the
amendment&#151;and ask to take back and consider, if the Committee
allows me, the thrust of the next amendment from the hon. and learned

						</b> Before the hon. and learned Gentleman concludes, I
think that what I heard him say was that he accepted the principle of
what we were saying, but he does not believe that it should be in the
Bill, but in PACE. If that is the case, it is hard to see why what he
describes as the limiting effect of our amendment in the Bill will be
any less limiting if it were in the PACE codes of conduct instead. That
does not seem to make sense to me. If he accepts that there is a
rationale for being very circumspect about the use of the
powers&#151;and I think that he does accept that and he is right to
do so because it might help to avoid subsequent litigation through
ECHR&#151;what is the substantive difference? He is perfectly
entitled to say that the Government have changed their minds since 2001
and think that it would be better to put it in PACE rather than in the
Bill, but not to say that that would have a different
effect.</div>

McNulty:
						</b> Thank you. I repeat that in this case, in the
context of these five clauses&#151;I am not talking about a general
parallel between this and the other legislation&#151;it would be
unduly prescriptive to define 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>the parameters in the Bill in the way in which the amendment does. That
is why I was trying to establish the distinction between this amendment
and the subsequent one that raises the broad principle, which I
endorse. I will seek to return to the Committee to say whether the
issue would be more appropriately placed in amendments to the code or
in an amendment on Report because the thrust is on the principle. The
parameters suggested in the amendment, while going to the point of
principle that we all share, are unduly prescriptive in a search
activity that potentially is more speculative than otherwise would be
the case given what we have already discussed as grounds of reasonable
suspicion. Remember, even in the context of privileged documents, we
are talking about seizing documents for a very limited time to
establish their import and substance and whether it is appropriate and
lawful to seize them in the normal fashion having established what the
contents are. So, it is slightly narrower than the broader face of
things in the other legislation. That is how one is able to agree the
principle but not the prescription and solution to the principle in
this law. Not unnaturally, I favour my solution. I favour the solution
of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, given that we all
agree with the initial principle, less than the solution of the hon.
and learned Member for Beaconsfield. I have said, in the emollient
spirit that I come to this Committee with, that I shall look in more
detail at the one I favour second to my own&#151;that of the hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington&#151;and I shall not entertain
at all that of the hon. and learned Gentleman, not for partisan reasons

subject to legal privilege is removed under subsection (2) or retained

					<a name="08042973000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have indeed already touched on amendment  No. 56, but I should
like to say a few words more about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>it. I am helped by the fact that the Minister has already raised one or
two of his concerns. Granted that there was once a power in this area
concerning Northern Ireland, we are nevertheless legislating in a new
field. The Minister has acknowledged that the power is a general power
for the seizure of documents. We have discussed reasonableness. The
Minister has made quite a persuasive case why reasonableness should not
come into the picture. So the possibility of legally privileged
material being picked up in the course of this type of investigation
must be real. If so, my personal view is that simply to leave it to
PACE codes is perhaps not adequate.</div>
					<a name="08042973000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to put in the Bill how
the material is to be handled. The Minister acknowledged in his
responses on amendment No. 2 that if he gets this wrong, the
consequences for a potential prosecution of an individual for a
terrorist offence could be catastrophic. That is not in his or the
prosecutor&#146;s interests at all. We need reassurance about what
will happen if a document that appears to contain legally privileged
material is to be separated from a document which may, or is thought
to, contain material that might be used in evidence in a case against
the individual as a potential terrorist or one involved with terrorism,
or indeed for any other purpose of apprehending terrorists. We need to
be reassured that the one will not contaminate the
other.</div>
					<a name="08042973000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am perfectly
alive to the reality of how criminal investigations are carried out. I
was a prosecutor and I did a great deal of prosecution work. I have
worked with police and Customs and Excise prosecuting teams. Unless a
special provision is made, there is a risk of the officers in the case
becoming aware of the content of the legally privileged material that
they have seized unless the message is rammed home to them that it has
to be treated in an entirely separate fashion. The consequences of that
are really serious. That is why we need to make special provision for
the possibility that legally privileged material is seized and that a
separate department deals with it at that stage. Effective Chinese
walls will be required to ensure that the contents of that material are
never revealed to those who are carrying out the
investigation.</div>
					<a name="08042973000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the point. If we get it right, it will allow the system to work
successfully and avoid the challenges that I can all too easily imagine
being mounted in a criminal trial. If we get it wrong, there will be
endless scope for lawyers&#146; points to be made and the risk of a
finding of infringement of the ECHR or of trials collapsing. We cannot
speculate on the endless possibilities of what legally privileged
material might be found and what it might be
about.</div>
					<a name="08042973000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
reasons, I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 56, or at least to
assure us that there will be something on the matter in the Bill rather
than in the PACE provisions. Simply having it in PACE is not enough, in
view of the wide power to seize documents that we are conferring on the
police. I hope that the Minister responds positively. I shall listen to
what he says, but to encourage him, I think that I might be minded to
press the amendment to the
vote.</div>

between the Minister and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div>hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield. Amendment No. 56 would improve
the Bill and ensure that the Government&#146;s intents and purposes
are more fireproof to challenges from human rights legislation.
Crucially, it would prevent a trial from being vitiated or collapsing
because legally privileged material has seeped out. I hear what the

Bill.</div>

rather than this one, for which I apologise again&#151;that I think
that the matter can be adequately covered in the PACE codes. However, I
heard what the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield said, and I
think that I alluded to the fact that I was almost with him before he
spoke. So I shall vote with him, too. <i class="I">[Laughter.] </i>No, not
really.</div>
					<a name="08042973000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
start from the principle of being convinced that the PACE codes are
appropriate. I would resist over-prescription, as I did in relation to
the previous amendment, but I accept that this matter is important. I
have made it clear that some elements of the amendment are not terribly
useful, such as the implication that one and only one person would be
able to examine a privileged document and could not secure any
assistance. That might not be the intention, but it appears to mean
that the only person who could see the legally privileged material
would be the officer deciding whether it would be reasonably
practicable to separate it from non-legally privileged material.
However, by that stage the document would have been removed or
retained, and the decision that it was not reasonably practicable to
make the separation already
made.</div>
					<a name="08042973000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are some
difficulties with the amendment, but given what the Committee has said,
I am happy to take back my position about suitably amending the PACE
codes, consider the import of what the hon. and learned Gentleman said
about having a safeguard in the Bill, and make an appropriate
suggestion on Report that will hopefully satisfy hon. Members. As the
hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said, there is not a lot between
us, but even if I suddenly have a Pauline conversion and accept the
thrust of the amendment, which I may, I certainly do not accept its
wording, for the reasons that I have given. However, I shall give it
further consideration. I am very open either to putting a safeguard in
the Bill or making it much clearer why the PACE codes are appropriate.
It is not a contentious issue, and I think that we agree on the broad
principles, so let us see where we can go from here. Before Report, I
would be happy to make as clear as I can what I think the solution is.
It will follow the premise of making amendments, where appropriate, to

when I lead on a Bill. So, in that spirit, in the light of the further
work to which I referred and my promise to discuss the matter in more
detail on Report, I ask that the amendment be
withdrawn.</div>

amendment would confine the revelation of the contents to one person
only. That was not the intention and nor do I think that it is what
would be achieved&#151;we are in danger of straying into matters of
arcane drafting here. The intention&#151;this is what I think would
be achieved&#151;was to confine such revelation to anyone involved
specifically in the task of separating out the two documents. It would
prohibit any contents subject to legal privilege from being revealed to
anyone other than those specialists carrying out that work.</div>
					<a name="08042973000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister was a bit
bolder, he could accept the amendment, because he could always amend it
again on Report if he wanted to. If he could give me a categorical
assurance that he will amend the Bill itself, rather than adopting any
other approach, I would not press the amendment to a vote. However, I
detect&#151;I do not criticise him for this&#151;that he wishes to
keep open the option of amending the PACE codes, which I think is
insufficient. Without wishing to be confrontational, at this stage the
Committee might like sensibly to register its view, which could provide
an incentive for the Government to do what we would
like.</div>

examination, it turns out that the thrust and the spirit of the

However, at the moment, I do not know whether that is the case, which
is why I am resisting the amendment. I am not splitting hairs and it is
not arcane to suggest that the amendment could be read as I alluded to.
We could find ourselves in a strange situation if the Committee votes
down the amendment. I might make further inquiries and decide,

right&#148;, but I could not bring it back on

back the principle of what the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield
suggested regarding whether to establish more firmly why the matter
should go in the PACE codes, or come back with some formulation of
words for the Bill that captures the import of what he suggests. I have
established, rightly, I think, that, for at least the reason that I
outlined&#151;and the other that the horse had bolted and was long
gone from the stable by the time of the thrust of the last
amendment&#151;it is not practical in the first instance to remove
the legally privileged element. None the less, I will take that back to
consider whether some other formulation captures it or might link the
Bill more strongly with the code. Therefore, despite the stunning
victory, the import and thrust of the debate is not lost, because it
will potentially enhance the import of  clause 3, which I urge
the Committee to allow to  stand

						</b> I apologise on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member
for Newark, who has had to leave to attend a funeral. Although the
amendment also stands in my name, it was tabled by
him.</div>
					<a name="08042973000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">We come to the
issue of the records of removal that we touched on when discussing
clause 1. The Minister pointed out that the provisions were relevant to
the remarks made about that clause, for which I apologised to
him.</div>
					<a name="08042973000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
raises the concern about whether a time limit within which the written
record should be produced should be inserted into the Bill. The current
wording is &#147;reasonably practicable&#148;, which I simply say
would often be within a much shorter period than  24 hours. If
a police officer is doing his job properly, a written record should be
made contemporaneously with the work. I would regard that as good
police practice. Equally, it is not necessarily a bad practice to
provide a finite limit. I acknowledge that the way in which the
amendment has been drafted removes the reasonable practicability test
and replaces it with &#147;24 hours&#148;. A possible approach
would be to add &#147;and in any event within 24 hours.&#148; I
therefore simply throw this in as a probing amendment to ask the
Minister whether, despite the reasonable practicability test, there
should be a finite time limit within which a record should be
produced.</div>
					<a name="08042973000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 58 concerns the copy that must be provided within a reasonable
time. That brings me back to my concern in relation to clause 1 that a
reasonable time should be a very short time indeed, because of my
anxiety about the consequences for an individual who loses control of a
document that might be of great utility to him. Unlike the seizure of
material when the police are satisfied of a suspicion that there is a
terrorist purpose and that there is good reason for not allowing the
person to keep a copy, we are dealing with situations in which no such
imputation of wrongdoing might arise. I wonder what is considered to be
a reasonable time. My anxiety is that we could end up with court
challenges if the police hold on to material and give assurances that
they will produce copies, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div>try to wriggle out of doing so because they are concerned that the
document might turn out to be capable of being used for a criminal
purpose.</div>
					<a name="08042973000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled
amendment No. 58 because the clause raises a difficult issue and I want
to tease it out. If there is nothing criminal on the face of a
document, but the police want to take it away and look at it, the basic
rule ought to be that there are no grounds for not supplying a copy
immediately so that the person is not placed at a disadvantage by not
having it. It is only at the point of seizure that the issue of
depriving somebody of the possession of such a document arises. To what
extent will the reasonableness test be used as an excuse to ensure that
a person does not have a document until the reverse burden of proof has
operated to show that it is completely
innocent?</div>

Heath:
						</b> I entirely support the intention of the two
amendments in the names of the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield
and the hon. Member for Newark. I agree, however, that amendment No. 81
would increase the time available to a constable, in normal practice,
to make his record, which cannot be the proper intention. I am grateful
to the hon. and learned Gentleman for accepting that. As the Bill says,
it should be done,</div>
					<a name="08042973000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as
soon as is reasonably
practicable&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08042973000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
it might be sensible to have an outer limit as to what is reasonably
practicable, for the avoidance of doubt. Having said that, I am worried
that any time limit will be interpreted as a prescription for how long
it should be, rather than as an outer limit. Therefore, it would be
more helpful for the Minister to indicate his expectation in terms of
police practice, and his interpretation of &#147;reasonably
practicable&#148; in such
circumstances.</div>

					<a name="08042973000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I knew
that, if I remained emollient all day, hon. Members would soften me up
in the end. I agree broadly with what the hon. and learned Member for
Beaconsfield says. If I thought that the amendment was seeking to
restrict, in any fashion, the time that the police had, rather than at
least give us a benchmark to the effect that any reasonable person
would determine &#147;reasonably practicable&#148; to mean
&#147;within 24 hours&#148;&#151;that is a fair point&#151;I
would be a feeble Minister captured by the lawyers and officials,
obliged to ask that we stay within the notion

reasonable: one-nil to the hon. and learned
Gentleman.</div>
					<a name="08042973000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must
resist the second amendment, however, because I think there is
confusion. It is not about a copy of the document, but about a copy of
the record of the seizure of the document. The hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s points on the import of the document to the
individual and on the notion that, in the first instance at least,
there is no criminal dimension afforded to it at all&#151;we are
talking about 48 or  96 hours, during which it can be
established whether it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>is reasonable to take things on the ground of reasonable suspicion, and
so on&#151;are covered by clause 6. That clause allows access to the
taken documents&#151;I use &#147;taken&#148; specifically to
avoid confusion with seized documents&#151;if they are as important
as he
suggests.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042973000436"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> The Minister makes a valid point, but I am not
sure that we are talking about the same thing: one is the document and
the other is a copy of the document. I realise that, in many cases,
having a copy of a document is as good as having the document itself,
and I can see that it is easy to blur the two concepts. However, the
fact that the Government draftsman has treated a copy in record of
removal separately from access to documents makes me think that two
separate issues can arise here. The purpose of access to a document may
entirely different from the purpose of having a copy of a document. I
assume that if the Government had not intended that, they would have
run the two things together. That is why I treated the copy as a
separate, distinct issue from having access to the document
itself.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042973000440"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> There seems to be some degree of confusion in this
debate, when we start talking about documents and copies of documents.
What I had understood us to be talking about here is not the copy of
any document, but simply the copy of the record that documents had been
taken, which is a quite different matter. It seems to me that the
Committee is getting confused if it considers the matter in a different
way. Does the Minister
agree?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042973000441"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Of course I agree, having just made that point
myself when I was intervened upon at length. In that context, it is
entirely reasonable, as the element that we seek to amend suggests,
that the constable must provide the copy</div>
					<a name="08042973000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;within a reasonable time from the
making of the request.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08042973000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I think that that provision is
entirely appropriate. As the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield
was in part suggesting, I would have thought that good police practice
would be that that copy of a record of the seizure would be forthcoming
as quickly as possible. Given the nature of the timing, I would
absolutely resist a provision that it be provided within six hours
because I do not want&#151;this is important for the individual
concerned&#151;a situation where six hours becomes the norm, when the
copy of the record of seizure might be very important for the
individual to carry on his normal, lawful business. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>would resist that proposed change, because the notion that provision
within six hours may well become the norm rather than contemporaneous
or more instant, as the clause suggests, is more than

						</b> Perhaps this is not the right occasion, but I was
hoping that the Minister might be able to provide us with a little more
detail about what the record must contain. I know that some detail is
set out in clause 4, but I would like to know more about subsection
(2)(a), which says the record must &#147;describe the
document&#148;. At some point in the future, will there perhaps be a
little more detailed explanation of the depth that that description of
the document will go into? I ask that because, clearly, the document
could be a large file with 1,000 pages in, which requires description
in full, or there could be descriptions of the sections of documents,

document&#148; is an appropriate way of laying out the record,
because that would cover, as we have suggested throughout our debate, a
multitude of sins. &#147;Describe the document&#148; would cover a
description of the document sufficient so that both the police officer
who seized it and the person whose document it was recognise that that
is the document that they are talking about, which is entirely
reasonable. When seen in the context of all the other elements of the
record, it is an appropriate record of the withdrawal of the
document.</div>
					<a name="08042973000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Remember
too that the measure deals with the removal of a document for a short
period of time to establish whether there is indeed reasonable
suspicion to seize it lawfully. In that context, this is an appropriate
record. I would resist any attempt to restrain, codify or prescribe
what the description should be, but it should clearly be a description
that both the police officer and the person whose document it is
understand and recognise as an appropriate description of the
document.</div>

not to accept the Minister&#146;s largesse. May I explain that the
amendment had originally been tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
Newark? I indicated when I opened the debate that I thought it had a
potential flaw. On the whole, I would have preferred the wording to be
&#147;as soon as reasonably 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>practicable, and in any event within 24 hours&#148;. As I indicated, I
would normally have assumed that good police practice would be to write
out a list and hand it to the person as they were leaving the premises.
Anything that suggested otherwise might send out a rather odd
message.</div>

although I wanted a finite period for the reasonable practicability, I
do not think that simply putting down 24 hours and thus encouraging the

and the Committee. Perhaps this is illustrative of the fact that I
regret that my hon. Friend is not present. However, if the Minister
were to say that he would table an amendment on the basis of

remove a document for examination during the course of a specified
terrorism-related search to ascertain whether it is one that can be
seized.</div>

technicality. Don&#146;t worry about it.&#148;&#151;has the
effect of requiring the officer to describe the owner or occupier of
the premises searched, or the person searched, if he is able to do so.
As currently drafted, the clause says that a description must be given
irrespective of the officer&#146;s ability to do so, and that the
record of removal of a document must state the name of the person, if
known, who is or appears to be the owner or occupier of the premises 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>searched, and the name of any person who appears to have custody of the

requires him to include a description of the person. The amendment
means that if the constable cannot give a description of a person, he
does not have to give one. It would cover, for example, the search of

Heath:
						</b> I want to explore a little more the point made by
my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington. I entirely
accept that the Minister does not want to prescribe in precise detail
how the record of the document seized is put together, but what is the
consequence if the record is misleading or incorrect? What if it omits
documents that have been seized or wrongly describes them for the
purpose of the record which, after all, is what the potential
defendant&#151;they are not accused at this point&#151;from whom
the seizure has been made relies on to ensure both that he knows what
documents have been seized and what documents should be returned to
him.</div>
					<a name="08042973000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
what the answer might be, but does it invalidate the terms of the
original warrant if the description is incomplete or incorrect? What
if, for instance, a constable mistakes a document in one language for a
document in another and puts the wrong description on it? That is quite
possible if he is not familiar with the languages. One of the main
reasons for removing the documents may well be that he or she cannot
read them. What would be the consequences if a record of seizure is
incorrectly  made
out?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042973000456"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Unless I am corrected, I think that the point is
moot. First, once the process has finished, either the document will be
an entirely innocent one that was not properly seized in the first
place and so it will be returned forthwith to its owner, which is what
these two days about; or it will be a document that has been
appropriately seized and it will then be logged in far more detail in
the appropriate fashion to secure the potential evidentiary trail. If
either of those two occurs, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern falls
or is redundant.</div>

							<a name="08042973000457"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> The Minister is absolutely correct. The point at
issue is the continuity of evidence&#151;the trail. That has to be
accurate in order to found any prosecution in due
course.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042973000458"></a>Mr.

						</b> Yes, to pursue the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
example, if the document is in Farsi but it has been wrongly ascribed
as Urdu, and upon further investigation it is seen to be the Peshawar
restaurant menu and it is returned to its owner without further concern
or disruption, so be it. If it turns out to be a key al-Qaeda document
and the Farsi expert brought in had some difficulty but soon
established that it was not Farsi but Urdu, and once it was finally
translated it was found to be a document that was more than
appropriately seized, then it would be logged in the evidentiary chain
and the case would be built up or otherwise.</div>
					<a name="08042973000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that this is a
concern. There would be more concern if, as the hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington said, we over-prescribed on the Bill what the
description should be. Even in that case, given that this is but part
of a process to establish whether it is lawful to take the document, I
do not think that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns are justified or
should cause him to lose any
sleep.</div>

amendment is probing. We may touch on some of the ground that my hon.
Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome, taking the example of a
misleading record. We are trying to establish whether there is any bar
in place to stop a 48-hour extension being sought if there are any
breaches of the recording procedure during the original 48 hours after
a document has been taken away to be considered. That could include how
the document has been handled, or a privileged document being looked at
by somebody who is not party to assessing whether the document is
relevant.</div>
					<a name="08042973000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would ensure that everything is done by the book in the first
48 hours, as one would expect. It would give the additional pressure or
encouragement of the sanction that if there had been a clear breach,
such as many significant mistakes in the record of removal, the
extension would not be allowed. I hope that the Minister will consider
the amendment and go into greater detail about how this measure will
operate, such as whether there are safeguards for the first 48-hour
period or sanctions if the rules are clearly
breached.</div>

though we are talking about a mere 48 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>hours, these are important matters. I have some sympathy with the idea
that it should be in the Bill that an officer from inspector upwards
must clear in his or her own mind that the criteria and safeguards
implicit in clauses 1, 3 and 4 have been adhered to. However, I cannot
accept the amendment because I see no reason why the provisions of
clause 2 on obstruction should form part of that assessment. The issue
of obstruction is entirely separate, for reasons that we have
discussed.</div>
					<a name="08042973000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">That it
should be in the Bill that an officer at the rank of inspector or above
should make it clear whether the provisions of clause 1, the
implications for legal privilege in clause 3 and the requirements for
the record of removal in clause 4 have all been followed in an
appropriate fashion as part of his determination of whether there
should be an extension is a fair and reasonable point. I will look at
that and come back to it on
Report.</div>
					<a name="08042973000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
the notion that the inspector should consider in full whether there has
been a crime of obstruction in that process was an inadvertent drafting
error, but for that reason I cannot accept the text of the amendment. I
am happy to take away its spirit and see if we can put the safeguards
implied in clauses 1, 3 and 4 in the Bill as part of those criteria.

Grieve:
						</b> These are probing amendments so that we can tease
through what the clause provides for. Perhaps I can come back to what I
said a moment ago when I was getting befuddled about the question of
the copying of documents. The matter concerns me and I have been
raising it as a recurrent theme throughout the morning. I think that
this is now the right time to discuss it.</div>
					<a name="08042973000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">In clause 6, provision is made
for a person to have access to the seized documents. It is obviously an
important principle because those documents belong to the individual
concerned. I can envisage that there may be circumstances in which,
although the seizure of the documents may not yet have taken place, the
police&#146;s suspicion that the documents are terrorist 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div>related is such that they may be reluctant even to allow the person to
have access to them. As I understand it, the architecture of clause 6
and its subsections is to provide circumstances in which access can be
denied.</div>
					<a name="08042973000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
highlight a few points. If the person involved is not under
investigation for any offence, what is subsection (3)(b) aimed at? One
would expect the measure to be covered by subsection (3)(d), which is
deals with facilitating the commission of an offence. That is really
the nub of the two
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08042973000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I
could flag up something else for the Minister to explain. Access to a
document may be required for different purposes. What is envisaged by
the word &#147;access&#148; in that context? Does it mean that one
may go and look at the document; that one may, if it is possible,
photocopy the document so that one can use the copy even though the
original might be retained; or simply, that one may go and look at it
behind a glass screen so that one can see that it is still
there?</div>
					<a name="08042973000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
lack of clarity in clause 6, which is not tackled by my amendments.
Perhaps we could deal with that in clause stand part, or, if we want to
avoid a stand part debate, we could deal with it here. Talking about
the rights of access brings me back to one of my earlier points. In
many cases, a person may be completely comfortable&#151;or may not
make a big fuss&#151;when a document is taken away as long as they
have a copy from which they can work. As far as I can see, I do not
think that there is a provision that allows the person to have a copy
even if the original has to be retained, but I may be wrong about that.
Will the Minister take the opportunity to deal with those
points?</div>

6 makes provision for certain persons to have access to documents
removed for examination under clause 1. Although removal of a document
for a period of up to 96 hours may have little or no impact on some, I
recognise the point that, for others, the document concerned may relate
to important business, family or other matters. I think that that is
perfectly reasonable, which is why clause 6 provides for the right to
supervise the access. It is made clearer in the explanatory note, which
says:</div>
					<a name="08042973000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clause 6
allows a person referred to in subsection (2) to have access, on
request, to a document retained under the provisions of clause 1, under
the supervision of a
constable.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08042973000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Gentleman is entirely right that the measure is not about
affording a photocopy or other copy of the document, but about access
other than in relatively, but reasonably, limited circumstances. I
understand the spirit of the amendments, which are rightly intended to
seek clarification on the functionality and purpose of an important
safeguard.</div>

					<a name="08042973000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that access is not granted if the officer in charge of an
investigation has reasonable grounds for believing that it would
prejudice criminal investigations or proceedings, or that it is sought
for a nefarious purpose such as to interfere with a prompt and
effective investigation into terrorism-related offences or to
facilitate further offending. As the hon. and learned Gentleman
implied, the amendments are intended to limit the circumstances in
which access can be refused. Their result would be to enable access
that might hinder investigations into criminal offences already
committed or facilitate the commission of new
offences.</div>
					<a name="08042973000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
consider that each of the reasons for limiting access set out in clause
6(3) is required. Subsection (3)(a)(i) is required to cover the
original investigation, for example a search under proposed new section
7A of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, conducted to see whether a
person subject to a control order has absconded. Subsection (3)(a)(ii)
covers the investigation of the document in question, so that access
may be refused if, for example, it would prejudice the process of
examination by slowing it down and taking it outside the time scales
for retention&#151;48 hours in the first instance, or 96 hours
ultimately.</div>
					<a name="08042973000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3)(b) covers matters relating to the investigation of an offence, such
as if it were thought that access would tip someone off about the
documentation seized, meaning that other evidence of the offence could
be covered up. Subsection (3)(c) covers the prejudice of criminal
proceedings, the justification for which speaks for itself. Subsection
(3)(d) covers matters related to the facilitation of an offence, for
example access to a document that might contain information about
potential terrorist
targets.</div>
					<a name="08042973000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Committee will know, similar restrictions on access to documents seized
are provided in section 21(8) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984, on the prejudice of investigations or criminal proceedings. I
accept the notion that, even with clause 1 agreed to, we are still in a
twilight zone of establishing whether it is appropriate to seize the
documents in question in the first place. We need to be mindful of
that, even in the context of restrictions of the right to access,
albeit supervised. I take the thrust of what is suggested in the
amendments, but to lose subsections (3)(b) and (3)(d) would be
disadvantageous to the intention of the Bill. I therefore ask that the
amendments be
withdrawn.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanations
and accept them entirely. I can see that the amendments could have the
consequences that he has described. I am grateful to him also for
having outlined a little more clearly how the clause is
designed  to
operate.</div>
					<a name="08042973000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
we will consider an amendment on appeals in a moment, but perhaps this
is an appropriate moment to return to the generality of the clause,
which is whether an express provision should be made so that, for
example, the police might provide a photocopy of a document that
somebody needed. I appreciate that that might be a very rare
occurrence, partly because of the very short period of time involved,
but it troubles me slightly. There must be a potential risk that the
police 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>will inadvertently seize a document that is required
the following morning for a pressing legal reason. Such things can
happen.</div>
					<a name="08042973000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
possibility is to allow for discretion to provide copies, but obviously
only if the police were satisfied that that would not conflict with any
provision of subsection (3). The second, which I shall come to in
relation to the next amendment, is to have a mechanism to provide for
an appeal if there are urgent grounds for challenging the retention of
documents for a short period of time, or if there is a pressing need
for a document. I simply throw that in as something that the Minister
may like to consider before
Report.</div>

but I will give that undertaking in the context of amendments Nos. 82
and 83, which dilute the provisions that the police need as a backstop.
I will explore, unhappily not at the moment although I would like to,
the notion of some general&#151;albeit discretionary in the context
of clause 6(3)&#151;provision for the photocopying of documents where
practicable. I say that in the context of our discussion about what a
document is: a copy might take more than the 40 or 96 hours prescribed
by this part of the Bill. In that spirit, however, I repeat that all
elements of clause 6(3) are necessary to do that with
confidence.</div>

the crown
court.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08042973000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I have already touched on the lack of a system of appeal, it is right
to highlight it. I fully accept that 96 hours is a short time and the
Minister is right that, generally, it is difficult to think that
anybody will be deeply inconvenienced by losing documents for that
time. But is it right as a matter of principle that there should not be
liberty to apply to the court? That is a powerful interference with
private rights&#151;for a good reason, but an interference
nevertheless. If that right were to be abused or used frivolously,
having a system by which an appeal could be raised seems
sensible.</div>
					<a name="08042973000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
specifically chose the Crown court rather than the High Court because
the matter could probably be dealt with speedily there. That would not
provide for an emergency application at a weekend, but on any weekday
there would be Crown court judges around who could take a view as to
what the problem was. That would also help to resolve the problem posed
by somebody saying, &#147;Actually, you have taken away the contract
document that I require to conclude a contract on which I am going to
make a profit of &#163;50,000 and which I need for tomorrow morning.
What are you going to do about it?&#148; The danger that I perceive
is that if such an event were to take place and the documents were
retained, there would be fertile area for lawyers bringing claims for
damages. It would be wise for the Government to put in a system for
protecting themselves against that&#151;I admit,
remote&#151;contingency. That is what the amendment is
about.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08042973000472"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Clause 6, as already suggested, provides that
those people set out in subsection (2), or their representative, may,
on request to the officer in charge of the investigation, be granted
supervised access to a removed document while it is being retained. We
cannot allow unfettered access to material that is the subject of a
police investigation. Therefore, where granting access would affect
police investigations, it is wholly appropriate to deny access to the
removed
material.</div>
					<a name="08042973000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. and learned Gentleman suggests an amendment that would insert a
right of appeal to a Crown court judge should the request for access be
refused. That is an unnecessary step, in the context of both the power,
under which a document can be removed for a maximum of 96 hours, and of
the safeguards already proposed. In addition there is the potential
safeguard of a copy being provided for that limited time. In
recognition that the power is wide-ranging, as we have all concurred,
we have added a substantial number of safeguards&#151;found in the
clauses&#151;which include protection for items subject to legal
privilege, a requirement to make a record of the removal, strict time
limits for the retention of documents under the power, access to the
documents by specified persons, and prohibition on the photocopying of
documents by others. In addition, I might come back with a provision
regarding a copy for the individual if required, within the context of
the safeguards for the police under clause 6(3). Given the proposed
safeguards, we do not feel that the amendment is necessary.</div>
					<a name="08042973000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
the example suggested by the hon. and learned Gentleman. If the
documents removed dealt, in a foreign language, with a contract behind
which might be a pending profit, it would be incumbent on the
individual to help the police in every regard by explaining precisely
what the documents are. If an entirely legitimate potential profit of,
say, &#163;50,000 was pending, I would have thought that the
individual would move heaven and earth to assist the police. If, given
the substance of other documents and evidence seized as part of an
investigation, the police have even a remote notion that a document,
once translated, and any subsequent profit, could prove to be evidence
of acts preparatory or precursor activities to terrorism, it would be
right and proper for them to maintain their position. In the context of
the 96-hour limit, the caveats and the ability to access documents now
provided for in the Bill, an appeal process to the Crown court would be
a trifle excessive, so I ask him to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08042973000473"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I am mindful of the fact that I do not wish to
complicate matters that do not need to be complicated. The Minister
makes a perfectly valid point: the period provided for is short, so an
appeal process to the Crown court might not be the right approach.
However, if the Government are so certain that the substantial power in
the clause will not cause loss to individuals, they should put it in
the Bill that, if, when the documents are returned, somebody can
demonstrate a loss, the Government will pay compensation and damages to
those who have suffered it&#151;I notice the permanent officials if
not blanching, looking askance. However, we have had this before in
criminal justice
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08042973000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
reconsider the whole architecture of the clause, which is why I intend
to withdraw the amendment. It is important that the police
have  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>the necessary powers to prevent terrorism through
the seizure of such documents and that people do not have unreasonable
rights to interfere and ask for documents to be returned, or even for
photocopies to be made. However, the logical conclusion of interfering
in such a private right is that provision ought to be made to pay
compensation, in the extraordinary circumstance that the interference
leads to a person suffering loss.</div>
					<a name="08042973000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I normally accept that
principle over resorting to litigation under the ECHR, which might
otherwise be the solution. In a sense, the idea of putting in an appeal
procedure was to avoid that. With a quick appeal procedure, someone
could go to a judge and say, &#147;Look, you have got this terribly
wrong, and my interpreter can show to you immediately that this is what
it is and that I need it by 12 o&#146;clock today.&#148; That would
ensure that such problems do not occur. I accept that those
circumstances are likely to be very unusual, but nevertheless history
shows that unusual things happen. Having said that, I beg to ask leave

McNulty:
						</b> The clause is very straightforward and provides
that documents removed under the clause should not be photographed or
copied unless they are in electronic form and a copy is needed to make
them visible and legible, which I think is an entirely appropriate
further safeguard against the improper use of the power. I do not know
whether the provision will now have to be amended, in the light of my
earlier emollience, to say that we could&#151;notwithstanding the
safeguards for the police under subsection 6(3)&#151;probably afford
a copy of the document to the individual. I am not sure what the
interplay is between the two things, given that the provision prohibits
the photocopying and photographing of the documentation. I shall have
to look at that. However, in my limited knowledge at the moment, I
commend the clause to the
Committee.</div>

Grieve:
						</b> I had not intended to intervene, but I want to
clarify something that the Minister said that perhaps I misunderstood.
I assumed that the provision was designed essentially to ensure that,
if documents were returned, the police had no power to retain copies. I
assumed that that was what the Minister intended and what the provision
achieved. The only power to produce copies seemed to me to be in the
investigative process of downloading what appears to be on computers.
As long as that is so, I have nothing more to worry

						</b> That is so. Perhaps I over-egg the pudding in
saying that I do not know how that relates to what I conceded on. If
the seized document is retained but an individual is afforded a copy of
it, clearly, if it is an electronic document, it will be given in paper
form. The provision also makes it clear that every copy held in that
form, purely for legibility, is to be destroyed subsequent to the
return. I was concerned only with the interplay between that and my

about who will make that determination. Will a senior police officer be

Minister will know, in respect of counter-claims on property that comes
into the possession of the police, there is already legislation on the
statute book called the Police (Property) Act 1997, which would
normally trigger an application to a magistrates court, where both
parties could argue and the court would make a finding. Is it at all

real dispute about whose document it is. As the hon. Gentleman rightly

not least in the context of getting the police out of what may be an
invidious position. If the Police (Property) Act 1997 were included to
dispel or determine such disputes, that might be better. For now, I am
broadly comfortable with the clause as it is. As the hon. Gentleman
implies, in the overwhelming number of cases, it will be absolutely
clear, a matter of the record, or the dispute may be highlighted at the
record stage. We can deal with it in that way. He made a good point,
and I shall look at the matter further, but I am content with the

that officers can say, &#147;Oh, great, we get another period of time

fingerprints and non-intimate samples of individuals subject to
control orders, and, crucially, to ensure that they are in line with
existing procedures for the country
concerned.</div>
					<a name="08042973000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">To demand
authorisation from an inspector or above in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland would create an unnecessary difference between the current
framework under PACE and that for control orders. The review of PACE
public consultation exercise has clearly shown that the current
framework works effectively. To introduce a further tier to the
framework would cause confusion and place unnecessary demands on
operational resources. Therefore, we do not believe that there should
be an exceptional level of authorisation for the collection or use of
fingerprints and non-intimate samples for individuals subject to
control orders. The power to take fingerprints and samples in clauses
10, 11 and 12 is simply about regularising control orders with existing
powers in the respective jurisdictions. This is not a case of
decreasing or increasing the level, but of making control orders
reflect wider
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08042973000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
think it appropriate to debate the larger issue of levels of
authorisation contained in PACE and its Northern Ireland equivalent in
this narrow context. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s wider point about
moving the level from inspector to constable may be an appropriate
concern, but it is not appropriate here. All we are seeking to do is
plug a little gap in control order legislation within the existing
jurisdictional parameters. I might have had some sympathy with
him&#151;I do not, as it happens&#151;on the wider issue of whether
it is time that PACE and its Northern Ireland equivalent should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>go up to the Scottish level and insist that an officer of inspector
level or above is involved in fingerprints and
samples.</div>
					<a name="08042973000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clauses
under discussion are very narrowly defined and relate to an oversight
in the control order legislation. We are seeking the power to take
fingerprints and samples from those on control orders. In seeking to do
that and no more, it is entirely reasonable to do so within the
prevailing jurisdictions of England and Wales, Northern Ireland and
Scotland. The broader debate that the hon. Gentleman wants to have is a
perfectly reasonable one, although I do not agree with it, but it is
not for this
discussion.</div>
					<a name="08042973000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, under the 1995 Act, in Scotland the taking of some, but
not all, samples requires the authorisation of an officer of the level
of inspector or above. To avoid confusion, clause 11 mirrors that
standard requirement rather than any differing standard. On a narrower
point of detail, it is worth noting that the amendments would go beyond
the position in Scotland in two respects. If the intention was to
mirror Scotland, the amendments are flawed. First, in Scotland,
authorisation from an inspector is required in relation to only some,
not all samples. The amendments propose that the level should be that
of inspector for all such samples. Secondly, in Scotland, authorisation
from an inspector is not needed for a constable to require an
individual to attend a police station to have a sample taken. The
amendments propose that there should be such authorisation in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland. For practical as well as more general
purposes, I do not like the amendments. I consider them flawed and
inappropriate in this narrow context, although I accept the wider
debate.</div>
					<a name="08042973000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the PACE
review and consultation that has been ongoing for the best part of a
year and which is about to come to fruition, we invited interested
parties, practitioners and the public to set out the agenda for
changing PACE significantly, should they so choose. The level of
authorisation for the taking and retention of fingerprints and samples
was not raised in response to that, nor in subsequent detailed
discussions with stakeholders from across the criminal justice system.
Given the narrow thrust of these measures, I ask that the amendment be
withdrawn. I say cheerfully that there is a wider argument to be had
about PACE, which, remarkably, as the review has shown, has stood the
test of time very well since 1984, despite successive amendments to it
over the years. On reflection, before the dash to lunch, let us throw
the amendment out with alacrity and move
on.</div>

					<a name="08042973000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge the
Minister&#146;s comments about the need for a broader debate. I think
that he referred to the need to raise the standards in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland to those in Scotland, so perhaps we can return to
that at another point. He said that there were concerns that that would
raise undue burdens. Before I withdraw the amendment, will the Minister
clarify whether any concerns have been raised with him from Scotland on
the undue burden that is caused by the need for an inspector to
authorise the taking of fingerprints and
samples?</div>

McNulty:
						</b> The Scottish system has been the Scottish system
for so long that no concerns have come from it about undue burdens due
to authorisation from inspectors. That is what prevails and always had
prevailed, prior to and including its codification in PACE. My point
clearly was not that there was an undue burden in going to the level of
inspector for authorisation. It was that, given that we are filling a
little gap relevant to control orders, it is appropriate that the
measure reflects the existing jurisdiction.</div>
