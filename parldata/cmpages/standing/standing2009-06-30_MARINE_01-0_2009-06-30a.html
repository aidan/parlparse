Chairman:</b> Before we begin, given the weather, hon. Members
may remove their jackets, or other such items of attire so as still to
allow a sense of decorum. I cannot speak for my fellow Chairmen, but
that ruling prevails while I am in the Chair. I have a few housekeeping
announcements. All Members should ensure that mobile phones, pagers and
BlackBerrys are turned off or switched to silent during Committee
sittings. I remind the Committee that there is a money resolution in
connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room.
Adequate notice should be given of amendments if they are to be
eligible for selection: for a Tuesday sitting, amendments must be
tabled by the rise of the House the previous Thursday; and for a
Thursday sitting, they must be tabled by the previous Monday. As a
general rule, I and my fellow Chairmen will not call manuscript or
starred amendments.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div><a name="09063048000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I say,
Mr. Gale, what I delight it is to serve under your
stewardship on such an important Committee? The Bill has been long
awaited by many, not only in this House, but in the other place, where
it has progressed and been improved through several months of intense
scrutiny. The Programming Sub-Committee&#146;s debate on agreeing the
way forward for scrutiny of the Bill reflected the collaborative
approach that was adopted in the other place and that, I hope, will
prevail in the Committee as we proceed with the Bill. We have tried
strenuously to avoid the necessity of putting in knives and guillotines
in order to have a free-flowing debate, and I think that we now have,
in a much improved Bill, ample opportunity to get right to the core of
what it is about.</div>
<a name="09063048000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
particularly welcome the agreed approach to getting to the meat of the
Bill and to the planning, licensing and conservation aspects before
proceeding to other matters. We also plan to reserve sufficient time
towards the later part of our discussions in Committee to look in depth
at coastal access. I hope and anticipate that the spirit of
constructive engagement will continue throughout our
deliberations.</div>
<a name="09063048000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like simply to reiterate what the Bill is about: our relationship
with the seas and the coastal environment. That is critical to us as a
nation, but it also sets the scene on how we as a nation intend to lead
in what we do for our marine and coastal environments. I would like to
repeat my thanks not only to Members in this House and in the other
place who have contributed to an excellent debate so far, but to the
15,000 or so members of other organisations who responded to the
consultation on the Bill, for which they have been waited for some
years. We could say that it has effectively taken six years of
pre-legislative scrutiny to bring us to the Committee today.</div>
<a name="09063048000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look
forward to a constructive engagement through the course of our
deliberations and hope that we can give the Bill a good debate at all
stages. We on this side of the Committee are certainly willing to give
it extra time and to go late into the evenings, with your approval, Mr
Gale, to ensure that we have adequate time for
discussion.</div><a name="09063048000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09063048000355"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Richard Benyon</b> (Newbury) (Con): I would like to echo the
Minister&#146;s welcome to you, Mr. Gale, and look forward
to your help and guidance throughout this process. As he said, there
have been lengthy discussions on the Bill in another place, but I hope
that the programme motion will allow us to tease out a few key areas of
debate to improve the Bill. For many people who have contacted us, the
key aspect is the establishment of marine conservation zones and the
nature conservation elements in the Bill. We obviously welcome some
changes made in another place, such as the inclusion of the words
&#147;ecologically coherent&#148;, if not in the Bill itself, then
in the statement laid before the House. Such changes are most welcome,
but there are areas where we need time to clarify just how those
conservation zones will be achieved and in what time scale. There are
many other aspects of the Bill that we will cover in the meat of our
debates, as the Minster
said.</div><a name="09063048000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have concerns about the provisions on coastal access, although not
about the principle of achieving greater access to coastal Britain, on
which there is much agreement. We will be seeking time to secure a
better balance in certain areas. We will seek clarification on privacy,
liability and biosecurity. We have introduced 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>and will continue to introduce a range of amendments: some probing, some
seeking to underline and secure concessions in another place, and
others to make more fundamental changes to the Bill. As I said on
Second Reading, we seek, in all cases, to adopt an attitude of
co-operation and consensus, as was the case in another place. There
will be times when we will not agree but, let us be frank, if the
marine part of the Bill were to go on to the statute book today it
would be a giant leap forward in marine conservation and would create a
framework to address an area of our environment that has waited too
long for the protection it
deserves.</div><a name="09063048000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09063048000356"></a><b class="B">Andrew
George</b> (St. Ives) (LD): May I, too, welcome you,
Mr. Gale, to our proceedings as one of our Chairmen until we
rise on 16 July, as I assume we will use all the time available to us?
Although I entirely agree with the Minister and the hon.
Member for Newbury on the need for further probing and fine tuning,
basically we are pretty happy with the Bill and its general direction.
If it were implemented tomorrow, we would be pleased and proud with
what we already
have.</div><a name="09063048000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
a number of issues need to be teased out further. I am sure that the
Minister accepts that industries with interest in the marine resource
and conservation bodies want reassurance on a number of issues that
need clarification. I hope we will retain the co-operative and
consensual approach which has been a feature of the debates on the Bill
so far.</div>
<a name="09063048000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
and I have a great deal in common. We are both Celts and we share a
medical condition in which we take an interest. The Minister also owes
me a favour because I helped him out when he was found without any
trousers one day&#151;more of which we will debate as the Committee
proceeds. Beyond that, Mr. Gale, I hope not to take
advantage of the favour the Minister owes me.</div>
<a name="09063048000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope we
will persuade the Minister on a number of issues during debate on the
Bill. I also hope the Minister will not approach the measure with the
intention&#151;as is often the case with Government Bills&#151;of
defending to the hilt the Government&#146;s red lines, irrespective
of the strength of the arguments. I hope rather that he will approach
it with an open mind, listen to the strength of the arguments, be
prepared to compromise and accept that fine tuning might result in
further amendments to the
Bill.</div><a name="09063048000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09063048000357"></a><b class="B">Martin
Salter</b> (Reading, West) (Lab): I was going to say how much
I was looking forward to serving on the Committee but the prospect of
continued medical bonding between the hon. Member for St. Ives and the
Minister is too horrible to contemplate. I hope that is the last we
hear of it, Mr. Gale. I am sure you will clamp down on that
kind of
nonsense.</div><a name="09063048000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
reiterate that this is an excellent piece of legislation, and I welcome
the commitment to the broad principles given by both Opposition
parties. Many other Members and I worked closely with the Minister and
his predecessor Ministers to see the legislation reach the stage it
does today. I put on the record a slight concern, for the
Minister&#146;s ears in particular. A number of
us&#151;particularly my hon. Friends the Members for Southampton,
Test and for Plymouth, Sutton, the hon. Member for Broxbourne and
myself&#151;worked long and hard on the Joint
Committee.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>The Bill has been the subject of extensive scrutiny, and the work of the
Joint Committee must not be mothballed, it has to be a point of
reference. There might be times when, on an all-party basis, we will
come up against Whitehall red lines, but going back to some of the
deliberation that took place in the Joint Committee might give the
Minister strength to push back some of the red lines that need to be a
little less starkly drawn, particularly on nature conservation and sea
fisheries issues that we will discuss. However, the programme motion is
broadly sensible, and I think that we can meet the timetable we have
set ourselves, precisely because of the extensive scrutiny that both
Houses have already had the opportunity to engage
in.</div><a name="09063048000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

housekeeping issue, mainly for the benefit of the Officers of the
House. I am conscious that there is considerable public interest in the
Bill, and, as always, we have managed to find the largest Committee
Room with the smallest Public Gallery. I am also aware that there might
be some people representing lobbying organisations who will wish to be
here for most, if not all, of the Bill proceedings. If those people
would quietly identify themselves to the Officer on duty&#151;I am
not allowed to see the Gallery from here&#151;I personally have no
objection to their sitting in the Press Gallery, which, as you will
note, is
unoccupied.</div><a name="09063048000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Resolved,</i></div><a name="09063048000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">That,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000361"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> For the benefit of the Gallery, we all need to
keep our voices up. Any of us who attend the 1922 committee in this
room know that it is impossible to hear from the back, and I shall
therefore try to ensure that people in the Gallery can hear
me.</div><a name="09063048000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
44 outlines precisely what a marine policy statement is and our
amendment seeks to ensure that it includes a duty to further
sustainable development, rather than merely contribute to it.
&#147;Contributing to&#148; infers a finite involvement in
sustainable development, while &#147;furthering&#148; signifies a
continuous effort towards its achievement, which is what is needed for
the effective management of, and planning for, our seas. As the marine
policy statement is to be the overarching policy that will inform
marine planning in all UK waters, it is crucial that we endow it with a
sufficiently robust
objective.</div><a name="09063048000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of amendments 1 and 2 is similar to that of amendment 9. They
relate to part 1 of the Bill, but have been grouped with amendment 9
because they refer to exactly the same wording, but in the context of
the creation of the Marine Management Organisation. They will ensure
that the MMO has a sufficiently robust objective to be responsible for
&#147;furthering&#148; rather than</div>
<a name="09063048000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;making a
contribution to the achievement&#148;</div>

development.</div>
<a name="09063048000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Making a
contribution&#148; is relatively benign wording, and
&#147;furthering&#148; would make it a more important statement in
the context of sustainable development. The MMO is being marketed as
the one-stop shop for marine management, and as such should take a
leading rather than a contributory role in sustainable
development.</div><a name="09063048000325"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000362"></a>Andrew
George:</b> Amendment 29 has been tabled in my name and that
of my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, and its
purpose is to probe what we mean by sustainable development. While I
appreciate and very much support the intentions behind amendment 9, it
presupposes, as does the Bill, that we know what we are asking the Bill
to achieve in terms of sustainable
development.</div><a name="09063048000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the DEFRA website, sustainable development is defined very much in
global
terms:</div><a name="09063048000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
goal of sustainable development is to enable all people throughout the
world to satisfy their basic needs and enjoy a better quality of life,
without compromising the quality of life of future
generations.&#148;</div><a name="09063048000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree that we need some basic conceptual terminology that can take us
forward in a debate without having constantly to redefine what we mean.
The term &#147;sustainable development&#148; is broadly understood,
albeit that it is rather fluffy at the edges. The concept is that it
does not compromise the ecology of the resource that we are trying to
protect while at the same time allowing some development within the
environment. However, nowhere in the Bill is there any definition of
how we achieve the balance between development and conserving that
ecology resource.</div>
<a name="09063048000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s argument for not including a definition of
sustainable development is that it would lock the Bill into one
definition, which could not be updated in the light of future
developments. I understand that, but  it must be possible
somewhere at least to establish a  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>benchmark below which sustainable development will not allow the
ecological resource to fall. I hope that the Minister will be prepared
to acknowledge that sustainable development must mean that we are
trying to achieve at least the maintenance, if not the enhancement, of
the marine conservation zone.</div>
<a name="09063048000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have to begin by acknowledging that the purpose of designating a marine
conservation zone is to protect something that it is there and, because
past activities within it may have degraded the marine biodiversity of
the area, to enhance it. We certainly do not want to allow that marine
ecology to fall below its current level. It is not asking too much to
expect the Minister to acknowledge that that is what we are trying to
achieve. If he is not prepared to accept a definition in the Bill
itself, I hope that he will at least reassure me that there will be
strengthened wording in the guidance that will accompany the
Bill.</div><a name="09063048000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000363"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> None of us wants to see almost the first decision
of this Committee to be caught up in controversy or unnecessary
division, but the Minister will have to give some ground on this issue.
I remind the Minister and the Committee what the Joint Committee said
about this issue. The Whips may also want to bear in mind that the
names of three Labour Members are attached to the recommendation. Page
22 of the Joint Committee report reads:</div>
<a name="09063048000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Environment Agency argued that the MMO should have a duty to further
conservation of marine flora and fauna and to secure compliance with
the Water Framework Directive requirements and objectives in
transitional and coastal
waters.&#148;</div><a name="09063048000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Britain
has signed up to the water framework directive, so we are going to have
to go down this road anyway. The Government really should not be
willing to push back on the issue. On page 22 of the Joint Committee,
recommendation 39, which a number of us put our names to,
states:</div><a name="09063048000052"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have no doubt, from the weight of the evidence received, that the
statement of purpose of the MMO is ambiguous both in terms of the draft
Bill and in the policy framework which the Government
envisages.&#148;</div><a name="09063048000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not believe that anybody here wants the statement of purpose to
remain ambiguous. It may be, as the hon. Member for St. Ives has said,
that that can be resolved in guidance. It may be that that can be
resolved if the Government accept the amendment which stands in the
name of the hon. Member for Newbury, and to which my name is
attached.</div><a name="09063048000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
recommendation 40
states:</div><a name="09063048000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Beyond
this high-level objective, we also consider that clear duties should be
set out on the face of the Bill to ensure that the new organisation
works to meet the aspirations which Parliament has set for it. We
recommend that these include a duty to further sustainable development
and we suggest that this be based on the eco-system approach to
managing the marine
environment.&#148;</div><a name="09063048000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
arguments are overwhelming, and I will be very interested to hear the
Minister&#146;s response.</div>
<a name="09063048000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09063048000364"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): The proof of the
pudding is in the eating, and the Bill needs to have real teeth. The
Bill needs to be the champion of the marine environment. In the future,
when we see projects that may make perfect economic sense, we want
to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>be able to say, &#147;No. They make economic sense, but the cost to
the marine environment is too high.&#148; That is what I, and the
hon. Member for Reading, West, are seeking to achieve as part of the
Committee. The sea&#151; the marine environment&#151;needs
a real champion. It is time for the House and its Members to step up to
the plate and ensure that that is exactly what
happens.</div>
<a name="09063048000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000365"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am very glad to begin with the part 3,
which concerns the new system of marine planning. That is a key
manifesto commitment, and the marine planning proposals form the heart
of the Bill. This strategic approach to how we manage what goes on in
our seas is absolutely fundamental to our deliberations. Let me recap,
because the issue goes to the heart to the debate that we have just had
and the very worthwhile contributions that we have just
heard.</div>
<a name="09063048000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
we have done in the Commons and the other place is clarify the
arrangements for scrutiny of the draft marine policy statement by the
approved legislatures, including Parliament. We have placed a
requirement in the Bill for the draft marine policy statement to
undergo an appraisal of sustainability. We are also able to commit to
carrying out a strategic environmental assessment, as the hon. Member
for Broxbourne has mentioned, of the draft marine policy statement as
part of that appraisal of sustainability. We have placed new reporting
duties on marine plan authorities. As we will discuss, in the other
place we decided to accept the duty placed on marine plan authorities
to seek to ensure that marine plans are prepared for all marine
regions, where the marine policy statement governs
planning.</div><a name="09063048000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000366"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> One concern relates to the Severn estuary barrage.
I am afraid and concerned that, very early on, the MMO will be
overridden to allow the barrage, in its worst construct, to go
ahead.</div><a name="09063048000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000367"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Within the Bill there are provisions to
ensure that that sort of cross-border working operates effectively. We
also need to ensure an effective relationship between the marine
planning system and the terrestrial planning system, and between
national infrastructure projects and what we need to do to conserve the
very best of our seas. We will return to point, which is valid, as the
Committee
proceeds.</div><a name="09063048000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to the amendments, which are worth while and which explore the
crux of the issue. Amendment 9 relates to whether we use the words
&#147;contributing to&#148; or &#147;furthering&#148;, which
was subject to a great deal of debate in the other place. The
amendment, tabled by the hon. Members for Broxbourne, Clwyd West, East
Devon, Newbury and Upminster, proposes replacing</div>
<a name="09063048000062"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;contributing to
the achievement of sustainable development&#148;</div>
<a name="09063048000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">with
&#147;furthering&#148;. Committee members will be aware of the
extensive discussions in the other place on very similar amendments,
which related to the MMO&#146;s general objective in clause 2. I
accept that this context is slightly different&#151;we are talking
about wording that defines the permitted content of a document rather
than an objective intended to inform an organisation&#146;s actions.
However, to some extent, that is part of the problem with the
amendment.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div><a name="09063048000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">To explain,
policies set out in a document cannot themselves further sustainable
development, unless applications are made and decisions are taken in
accordance with those policies that result in real changes in activity
in the marine area. In the same way, the MMO alone will not be able to
achieve sustainable development, because there are so many other actors
and regulators in the marine area that also need to contribute. We need
to do this together, and that is part of the essence of the
Bill.</div><a name="09063048000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the marine policy statement, which we are talking about
here, is to ensure that the actions of all those public bodies and
regulators are aimed  at the same objective. We share that same
objective  here, which is each organisation making its
individual contribution to achieving sustainable development in the
marine area. Clause 44(1)(a) makes it clear that each and every policy
in the MPS, if implemented, contributes to sustainable
development</div>
<a name="09063048000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000368"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> Will the Minister, at some stage in Committee,
define &#147;sustainable development&#148;? We have sustainable
communities and all sorts of &#147;sustainables&#148; but it is
almost becoming a glib phrase. What is
it?</div><a name="09063048000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000369"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Indeed. That goes to the heart of the
problem with putting a definition of sustainable development in the
Bill. Years ago I was lecturing on the subject and we looked at various
definitions. Everybody knows the triangle of sustainable
development&#151;economic, environmental and social&#151;but there
are varying definitions of what it means. Do we have weak or strong
sustainability? Jacob&#146;s definition varies from others. The
problem is defining it now, when sustainable development is a changing
concept. We understand the broad parameters, and I can give the hon.
Gentleman and Committee members our definition.</div>
<a name="09063048000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">What do we
mean by sustainable development? The UK Administrations have adopted
five shared principles that set out the basic framework for
sustainability: first, living within our environmental limits;
secondly, achieving a just society, which means a just society for all
those concerned with marine conservation and for those whose
livelihoods depend on the sea; thirdly, a sustainable economy;
fourthly, good governance of the marine environment, which is what the
Bill is about; and, finally, there is sound science. Those five
principles underpin what the UK Administrations have collectively
signed up to. Hon. Members may not have seen the document yet, but we
have also expressed those principles in our high-level objectives for
the marine area, which we set out recently and will underpin the marine
policy statement.</div>
<a name="09063048000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09063048000370"></a><b class="B">Linda
Gilroy</b> (Plymouth, Sutton) (Lab/Co-op): I have been looking
at &#147;Our seas&#151;a shared resource. High level marine
objectives&#148;, which seems to set out what the Minister is saying.
What status do the objectives have? I am struggling to understand what
harm there would be in accepting the
amendment.</div>
<a name="09063048000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000371"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Indeed. I am happy to proceed on that
point because it is a vital argument that needs fleshing out. I shall
turn to the legal status of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>objectives in a moment. As my hon. Friend knows, we have tried to bring
forward a lot of guidance as we have debated the
Bill.</div><a name="09063048000326"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="09063048000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debate over &#147;furthering&#148; or &#147;contributing
to&#148; the achievement of sustainable development is, in some ways,
a misunderstanding of what sustainable development means. It is not a
state of being in one time; we cannot say, &#147;Today we have
achieved sustainable development, so we&#146;ve done with it,&#148;
or, &#147;Our seas are in a state of sustainable development,
let&#146;s sit back.&#148; Instead, sustainable development must be
seen and defined as an ongoing process of ensuring that all our
actions, including decisions on development and conservation in the
marine area, are sustainable in the long
term.</div><a name="09063048000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
wording of the Bill makes it clear that each policy and each action by
all public authorities must pull in the same direction, making its own
individual contribution, right across the board to ensure that the
marine area is used in a sustainable way.</div>
<a name="09063048000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns were
expressed in the other place that the obligation for a marine policy
statement
to</div><a name="09063048000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;contribute
to the achievement of sustainable
development&#148;</div><a name="09063048000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">could
be met simply by including policies on the establishment of marine
conservation zones. I want to make it clear that that is neither our
interpretation nor our intention. Members of the Committee should have
received a copy of the high-level marine objectives, to which I have
referred. As I pointed out, those objectives have now been agreed by
all the various UK Administrations and Ministers, and they will
underpin the MPS as we take it forward.</div>
<a name="09063048000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09063048000372"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Hugo Swire</b> (East Devon) (Con): I am sure that the Minister
agrees that the harnessing of wave power and tidal power is in its
infancy in this country but it is likely to grow. Those forms of power
would be regarded as sustainable development and sustainable energy.
However, does he not see that, further down the line, there will be
increasing tension between the commercial needs of the developers of
wave power and wind power and the marine conservation
zones?</div>
<a name="09063048000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000373"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> No. What I see in the Bill is the
opportunity to streamline decision making. The agreed marine policies
for the high-level objectives and marine policy statements, followed by
the marine planning from the four Administrations around the UK, will
give clarity and certainty. In addition, the MMO and the way in which
we are reforming licensing will provide a much more streamlined
process, so that people will know where marine conservation zones are
and where there are areas in which we need to protect important flora,
fauna and so on. The Bill should enable better, more streamlined
decision making and that is why it  has been broadly welcomed
by those who are interested in development, as well as by those who are
interested in conservation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000374"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> I promise that this is the last time that I will
interrupt the Minister, because I know that he wants to make progress;
I am sure that all parties want to make progress. He said that
decisions will be based 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>on sound science. On that basis, I cannot see how the Severn estuary
barrage can progress beyond the point where we are now. The Severn
estuary is one of the most precious environmental sites in Europe and
indeed the world, and he has just acknowledged that that status will be
a major factor in the decision-making process. Can he therefore tell
the Committee here and now  that the Severn estuary barrage, as
currently envisaged by the DTI or whatever it is called now, will not
go ahead?</div>
<a name="09063048000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000375"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Nice try, but
no.</div><a name="09063048000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000376"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> All I can say is that the hon. Gentleman
will know that, under European habitats directives, our concerns are to
ensure that if any of the five and a half ideas on the proposals that
exist were to proceed, they would do so in the light of the very
special environmental status that the Severn estuary has.</div>
<a name="09063048000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wanted to
address the issue that was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for
Plymouth, Sutton about the legal status of the high-level objectives.
The statement of the UK Government with the devolved Administrations
within those high-level objectives is a statement of policy, and the
MPS will be based on the framework laid out within that. It does not
have the legal status, as she will know, of being part of primary
legislation, but that is material to the debate that we are having. It
is pertinent that we have chosen to bring that statement forward during
the course of our proceedings, to clarify our
intentions.</div><a name="09063048000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to turn to the amendment 9. Beyond the philosophical arguments
about sustainable development and the wording of
&#147;furthering&#148; and &#147;contributing to&#148;, there
is a concern about the legal precedent that would be set by the
proposed amendment. The drafting of clause 44 will almost certainly be
familiar to members of the Committee from more than 70 other Bills and
Acts, including, most recently, the Planning Act 2008 and the Local
Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill, which will
shortly return to this House on Report. The drafting is a consistent
use of a legal formulation relating to sustainable development that has
developed over many years to form a legal precedent. I therefore have
deep concerns that a different formulation in relation to the marine
policy statement would imply to the courts that this Committee and
Parliament intend the MPS to have a different purpose from the
terrestrial planning documents, with which the statement needs to
integrate and synthesise. There is therefore a genuine concern relating
to legal
precedent.</div><a name="09063048000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000377"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> I am listening to the Minister&#146;s argument
with care. Will he quote the part of the Government&#146;s response
to the Joint Committee in which deep concerns were expressed, as I
suspect that they were not expressed? If there are deep concerns, they
relate to the advice given to us by the Environment Agency, which we
charge with helping us develop policy, and to the concerns of the
Committee
itself.</div><a name="09063048000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000378"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I will try to respond to my hon.
Friend&#146;s question if I am able to drag the Government&#146;s
response from some inspired corner. Certainly, our strong 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>advice is that, if the Bill took a different approach from the clear and
well-understood legal precedent that has been established over a number
of years, that would lead to a potential legal interpretation that the
intention behind the provision differs from our interpretation of
&#147;contributing to&#148; sustainable development in 70 other
measures.</div>
<a name="09063048000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following the
concerns raised in the other place, we amended the Bill to place an
express requirement on the policy authorities to carry out an appraisal
of the sustainability of the policies proposed to be included in the
MPS. That is significant, because the new requirement means that
policies in relation to marine plans may only be included if the
sustainability appraisal indicates that it is appropriate to do so. I
can also confirm that, having carefully considered the points raised by
their lordships during their debates, and in the light of the
advice  of our lawyers, the UK Government and devolved
Administrations are now able to commit to undertaking a strategic
environmental assessment of the draft MPS within the terms of the
European Union directive on the strategic environmental assessment of
plans and programmes. That is significant, because it bolsters and
strengthens our approach to sustainable development. It also puts it in
the context of the Bill and does not jeopardise it by overstepping the
mark and setting up what would be a diversion from what has been
established by legal terminology. I hope that I have clarified our
commitment to ensuring that the MPS contains policies that, taken
together across the board and individually, make a genuine and positive
contribution to sustainable development in marine
areas.</div><a name="09063048000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000379"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> A final point. The Minister is again rightly
focusing on sustainable development. What will happen in those areas in
which development has already been proven not to be sustainable? I am
thinking in particular about fisheries. What will he do to redress the
balance in such areas? Has he provided for that in his opening
statement?</div><a name="09063048000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000380"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Not in respect of the amendments under
discussion, but we will come to that issue, not least when we discuss
aspects of conservation. Running through the Bill is the intention to
protect our most special habitats and all the different types of flora
and fauna on the sea bed. Socio-economic factors may also be taken into
account. The hon. Member for East Devon has spoken about issues such as
wind and tidal energy, and we must also consider marine stream energy,
dredging, the laying of cables, oil energy and so on. The protection of
the very best of our marine environment runs through the Bill; we will
turn to that again later, but the Bill allows for socio-economic
factors to be taken into
account.</div><a name="09063048000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issues covered by amendment 29 relate to the discussion that we have
just had. The amendment was tabled by the hon. Members for St. Ives and
for Brecon and Radnorshire, and seeks to place a definition of
sustainable development in the Bill. It provides, for the purposes of
part 3, that sustainable development means the conservation of marine
flora or fauna, marine habitats or types of marine habitats, or
features of geological or geo-morphological interest. Since the marine
policy statement to be prepared under part 3 sets the context for all
marine plans and all decisions by public authority, whether those
decisions are taken under the Bill or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>under the exercise of any other powers&#151;that is what the Bill
does&#151;the amendment would effectively mean that the objectives of
any marine plan or any decision that could affect the marine
environment should be conservation and conservation alone. The policy
of conservation alone would apply to the whole UK marine area, not just
those areas identified as requiring designation as a marine
conservation zone. Naturally, in the light of the discussions we are
having&#151;and this goes to the meat of the Bill&#151;what I
cannot do is support an amendment that would undermine the entire
purpose of the marine planning system and, perhaps, even the entire
Bill, which is meant to help us ensure that the marine area is managed
in a way that is sustainable over the long term. That cannot simply
mean conserving or enhancing natural features, important as that is.
The marine resources around the UK are also vital for our economy, and
it is not necessary or appropriate to cease our exploitation of them.
That would not benefit anyone.</div>
<a name="09063048000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">If all
decisions, as proposed in the amendment, had to be taken in accordance
with documents concerned only with maintaining or enhancing the
conservation of existing natural resources, how could we in future, for
example, license any fishing activity, or dredging, or the development
of renewable energy installations that might cause limited damage to
existing natural resources? As an illustration, even the installation
of a farm of wind turbines, to help us reduce our carbon footprint and
combat climate change, involves activity that does not conserve or
enhance the natural geology and geo-morphology. Clause 58(1) requires
public authorities to take decisions in accordance with the MPS and
with marine plans</div>
<a name="09063048000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unless relevant
considerations indicate
otherwise&#148;.</div><a name="09063048000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have carefully structured these provisions on the MPS and marine plans
so that it should rarely be appropriate for public authorities to rely
on this exception. Licensing and other authorities must in appropriate
cases be able to take account of the economic and social needs of the
UK, and they would need to rely on relevant considerations and
exceptions, as well as the MPS and the marine plans, but that would be
increasingly undermined if the amendment were accepted. That issue was
considered extensively in the other place and I stand by the arguments
made there by my noble Friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. There are many
different definitions of sustainable development, and there have been
quite a few attempts to define what it is. I do not believe that the
absence of a definition in the Bill is a problem. Having a definition
in the Bill that might differ from how the term is used, for example,
in international law might lead to inconsistency and
challenge.</div>
<a name="09063048000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
development is to be sustainable, it must be sustainable not only for
the environment but within the triangle I described earlier, which
provides the basic parameters of sustainability and sustainable
development. It has be sustainable for those humans who live and work
in it, not least hon. Members&#146; constituents who rely on that
environment. That is why the policy set out in the marine policy
statement should contribute to environmental sustainability, including
the need to designate an ecologically coherent network of marine
conservation zones and other designated sites, and protect our rare,
threatened and representative species and habitats. It must also
contribute to the sustainability of the UK&#146;s economy and
society. As my noble Friend said in Committee in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>the other place, the UK&#146;s present understanding of the meaning of
sustainable development is set out in the UK sustainable development
strategy. There are five shared principles which provide the framework
for sustainability: living within environmental limits; and achieving a
just society, a sustainable economy, good governance&#151;in this
respect, in a marine environment&#151;and sound science. Those are
good principles to underpin sustainable
development.</div><a name="09063048000327"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
pm</div><a name="09063048000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000381"></a>Andrew
George:</b> The Minister will understand that the purpose of
the amendment relates to marine conservation zones, not marine planning
as a whole. This is the most appropriate part of the Bill in which to
mention sustainable development, so a definition is clearly required.
My problem with the Minister&#146;s response thus far is that he now
appears to be replacing one piece of conceptual
language&#151;&#147;sustainable development&#151;with five
competing pieces of conceptual language, which make the whole thing
even less pin-downable, for want of a better expression. Whether we are
&#147;contributing to&#148; or &#147;furthering&#148;
something, the fact that that something is a set of five competing
conceptual issues makes the whole process a great deal more
frustrating&#151;the Minister must understand that. It would be
enormously helpful if he would at least attempt to pin this matter down
a little
more.</div><a name="09063048000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000382"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I understand what the hon. Gentleman says,
but this goes to the very heart of what we mean by sustainable
development and how we articulate that in the Bill. Going forward on
the principles that underpin sustainable development is a good
approach. It would be a retrograde step to pin down one concept of
sustainable development at the moment. Over the past 20 years, the
definition of sustainable development has changed. Alternative
definitions have been tried, then put back in the cupboard as new ones
have come forward. However, the underpinning principles, difficult as
they are, are the right ones. Those principles were originally defined
in terms of the social, environmental and economic triangle and are
enshrined in the agreement between the four Administrations. Here we
have a different language, but it is about balancing the protection of
our habitats and the protection of the constituents off the Welsh coast
and the north-east of England who might want to bring forward energy
projects. That is what sustainable development is all about; it is not
purely
conservation.</div><a name="09063048000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09063048000383"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Roger Williams</b> (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD): Surely what
the Minister says about the five principles that underpin sustainable
development is similar to saying that the whole of a building is the
foundations. The foundations are important, but we have to see what the
building looks like and how we can use it. That is the point that was
made by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives. The underlying
principles are one thing, but what sustainability is is another, and
that is where we are trying to get
to.</div><a name="09063048000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000384"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I sort of see where the hon. Gentleman is
coming from, but the foundations are critical here. As has been
mentioned in the opening  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>comments, this is very much a framework Bill that puts in place the
right mechanism to take forward the sustainable development of our
marine environment. That is the core part of the Bill. We are not
trying to paint the house, but to allow the marine plans to be brought
forward, and the inshore fisheries and conservation authorities and the
MMO to introduce byelaws. We have sound foundations and the Bill and
the guidance that supplements it articulate exactly what we mean by
sustainable development. I suspect that we might be dancing around a
concept here&#151;whether it is better to say &#147;contributing
to&#148; or &#147;furthering&#148;&#151;when actually we are
aiming at the same end.</div>
<a name="09063048000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
this second amendment, going down that line would lead to the
opportunity of challenge, because it goes against what we have in 70
Acts. The agreed form of words, and what we mean by sustainable
development, is well enshrined in law. I genuinely understand the
purpose of the amendment. We are trying to get to the same end, but I
am arguing that the measure will give us that end, particularly when it
is underpinned by those
principles.</div><a name="09063048000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 1, as I said on Second Reading, we already have a strong
objective for the Marine Management Organisation. In the other place,
Lord Hunt went into great detail about why we feel that amendments such
as this, which require the MMO to further rather than to make a
contribution to sustainable development, are not appropriate. I do not
want to repeat what Lord Hunt said, but I will make a few key points to
reinforce the reasons. First, we already have a strong objective for
the MMO, which received much attention in the other place and was
strengthened as a result of that scrutiny. We have brought in a new
power that allows the MMO, in pursuit of its general objective, to
contribute to the achievement of sustainable development and take any
actions it considers necessary or expedient for furthering its social,
economic or environmental purposes.</div>
<a name="09063048000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
Secretary of State will give guidance to the MMO on how it is to ensure
that it makes its contribution to the achievement of sustainable
development. That guidance is currently being drafted, and it will be
agreed by the cross-Government sponsorship group for the MMO. That
guidance will then be subject to scrutiny by Parliament, ensuring that
the MMO acts on behalf of all those with an interest in the
seas.</div><a name="09063048000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000385"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I really cannot have Members wandering
about the Room chatting to each other&#151;there are lovely green
benches outside provided for that.</div>
<a name="09063048000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000386"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Thank you, Mr. Gale. The
guidance will be drawn up in the context of the high-level marine
objectives and the draft marine policy statement, which will set out
the four Administrations&#146; agreed policies for contributing to
the achievement of sustainable development in the UK marine area. I
therefore believe that it is through statutory guidance that the
MMO&#146;s role in relation to sustainable development will be laid
out in detail.</div>
<a name="09063048000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I do
not think that the amendment will make a practical difference to how
the sea is managed. The words &#147;making a contribution to&#148;
are appropriate, given that the MMO, working within a framework of a
UK-wide marine policy statement, will not be able to achieve 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>sustainable development on its own, as I said earlier. Although the MMO
has a critical role, the actual achievement of sustainable development
in the marine area will be the focus of a partnership effort by all the
agencies and authorities concerned with how the seas are managed. That
includes other delivery bodies, regulators, devolved Administrations
and the vast range of users of the sea and its resources.</div>
<a name="09063048000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are confident that the package of amendments made on Report
in the other place significantly strengthened the Bill, and we were
pleased to hear those amendments being generally welcomed by all
parties at that stage. Indeed, the hon. Member for Arundel and South
Downs (Nick Herbert) said on Second Reading that he and his colleagues
were pleased that the duty to require the guidance relating to
sustainability criteria to be consulted on and laid before the House
had been added to the Bill and that those criteria would be
strengthened as a result. I think that those were appropriate words to
say.</div>
<a name="09063048000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
why the amendments have been raised again, not least because Lord
Taylor of Holbeach and Earl Cathcart in the other place put their names
to the Government amendments on the MMO&#146;s general objective. On
those amendments, which strengthened what we have done, Lord Taylor
said:</div><a name="09063048000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
clear from the addition of my name and that of my noble friend Lord
Cathcart to them that they have our support... The other
amendments in the group are also extremely welcome and go a long way
towards addressing our concerns about the drafting of Clause 2. The
Government have also decided that legislative consistency means that
they cannot accept &#147;furthering or promoting sustainable
development&#148; in the MMO's duties, but, as the noble Lord, Lord
Greaves, said, the new power to further the three pillars of
sustainable development will be critical to ensure that the MMO can
make a real difference to our marine
environment.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 5

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000387"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> I am still waiting for the Minister to inform the
Committee why the Environment Agency got it wrong when it said that the
MMO should have a duty to further the conservation of marine fauna, for
example, as I quoted earlier, and why the Joint Committee got it wrong.
I specifically asked him to inform us what the Government&#146;s
response to the Joint Committee was, because he said in his response
that that could seriously undermine the Bill. If it is as serious as he
suggests, that will be reflected in the Government&#146;s
response.</div>
<a name="09063048000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000388"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for raising that
point again. In the Government&#146;s response to the Joint
Committee, we ruled out defining sustainable development on the face of
the Bill for the reasons I have laid out, but we did say that we would
consider how to clarify the MMO objectives, which is what we did in the
other place. I want to reiterate what we have done and how it has been
welcomed. We responded to the Joint Committee not by defining it in the
Bill, for all the reasons I have given, but by strengthening and
clarifying what we would do in terms of the marine management
objectives.</div>
<a name="09063048000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000389"></a>Martin

response, rather than interpret it? I feel that it is the first time he
may have seen it.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="09063048000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000390"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> No, it is not. Paragraph 3.1.9
states:</div><a name="09063048000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are currently considering whether and, if so, what changes could be
made to meet Joint Committee and public consultation requests to
clarify the MMO&#146;s purpose and it&#146;s general
objective.&#148;</div><a name="09063048000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
listened and brought forward changes on the back of
that.</div><a name="09063048000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000391"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> May I put it to the Minister that that hardly
justifies the statement that the amendment, which has cross-party
support and which would replace &#147;contributing to&#148; with
&#147;furthering&#148;, seriously undermines the structure of the
Bill? The Government response goes nowhere near that point. Does he not
agree? The answer is
yes.</div><a name="09063048000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000392"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> We responded to the Joint Committee by
bringing forward clarification on what the MMO should do to contribute
to the achievement of sustainability. There is also what we signed off
on the high-level policy objectives and what will come through in the
marine policy statement. My hon. Friend is right that the legal
precedent aspect was not picked up at the time, but I am picking it up
very quickly now. We are faced with a long legal precedent as
sustainable development has been a concept for quite some time. It is
enshrined within another 70 pieces of legislation and its
interpretation in the law courts is very clear. Therefore, if we chose
to adopt a different form of wording here it would be interpreted that
we mean something
different.</div><a name="09063048000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09063048000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09063048000393"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): My hon. Friend
makes a strong point about the comparative read-across of wording in
the Bill with other pieces of legislation that have or may have a
bearing on it. Schedule 5, however, is only relevant to the
Bill and does not read across to other Acts. An amendment to that
schedule, particularly to paragraph 7, could reflect the substance of
this amendment. If he tabled such an amendment on Report he might
secure a great degree of cross-party
support<i class="I">.</i></div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000396"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I think that is a very good suggestion. I
am minded to look at whether we can do that. Paragraph 7 in schedule 5
refers to the sustainability appraisal, which is what I have been
talking about. There is a way to clarify this without setting out a
different legal approach in the
Bill.</div><a name="09063048000115"></a>

Irranca-Davies:</b> Before I give way, my hon. Friend also
mentioned the Environment Agency. Could I make a clarification here as
things move on apace? My understanding is that the Environment Agency
has accepted the strengthening of the MMO objective and it is no longer
seeking any change to that objective. In fact, I was pleased to meet
the Environment Agency in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>the last week or so and I discussed that issue with them. The
Environment Agency recognises how far we have come.</div>
<a name="09063048000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I am
more than willing to take that point about schedule 5 away and consider
it, because it might be a way forward. I think that we are aiming to do
the same thing here; it is just that the way of doing it must not
challenge what has been established by some quite significant legal
precedents.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000399"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> I commend the approach outlined by my hon. Friend
the Member for Southampton, Test. As a signatory to the amendment, I
would be very happy if the Minister were to take that approach,
assuming that we can build consensus across the
Committee&#151;judging by the body language of my colleagues, we
might be able to do so.</div>
<a name="09063048000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000400"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I have been through this matter in some
detail, and I understand where the Committee is coming from. We need to
get the approach right. However, we do not want to jeopardise the whole
nature of the Bill, which is about protecting and conserving the very
best of our marine environment while at the same time ensuring that our
approach to sustainability does not unnecessarily jeopardise those who
make a living from the sea.</div>
<a name="09063048000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been a
very good debate. We will certainly take that point away and see what
we can do. Meanwhile, I urge the hon. Member for Newbury to withdraw
the amendment, for the reasons that I have set
out.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000404"></a>Andrew
George:</b> Thank you for your guidance and advice,
Mr. Gale. I am grateful to you for
that.</div><a name="09063048000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
listened to what the Minister has said, I regret to say that I am more
troubled than I was when I raised the issue. During the debate,
particularly with regard to the definition of &#147;sustainable
development&#148;, the metaphor of building a house and having sound
foundations was used by my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and
Radnorshire. I must say that the five pillars or bricks on which
sustainable development and the policy of respecting and
&#147;furthering&#148; or &#147;contributing to&#148;
sustainable development are based are not really solid pieces of rock,
so I am not reassured that we are building a sound and stable house. A
lot of the issues are, in fact, shifting sands&#151;they are rather
woolly and fuzzy around the
edges.</div><a name="09063048000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
emphasis on economic sustainability, for example, as opposed to
promoting justice or not living beyond limits is important. Those
concepts are all concepts that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>could tilt the house one way or another, so that it becomes worse than
the leaning tower of Pisa, depending on the shifting emphasis that is
part of either the popular or political discourse at any particular
time. Therefore, I must say that we are not building a sound house. The
fact is that the five pillars or building blocks, as it were, on which
sustainable development is to be furthered or contributed to are rather
uncertain.</div>
<a name="09063048000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
the Minister that the only rock among the five pillars&#151;it is a
very important rock, indeed&#151;is that of sound science. Sound
science is pretty immovable. Even these days, when there is apparently
a growing enthusiasm for creationism, there is still the rock of sound
science. Clearly it must be emphasised in the way in which this policy
and the concept of sustainable development must be either furthered or
contributed
to.</div><a name="09063048000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cynics
will say that in a future scenario the Government could easily
emphasise one concept more than another, and we could end up with, not
a balanced objective outcome, but a politically driven outcome on
sustainable development and on what that means for whether a
development is permitted, licensed or
protected.</div>
<a name="09063048000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000405"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am a little worried that we might be
getting caught up in a subsequent debate on conservation and marine
conservation zones. The essence of what we are debating is sustainable
development and how we achieve it. That will go across the MMO, marine
planning and so on&#151;it underpins the Bill. There will be a
different debate, when we come to marine conservation zones, about how
conservation is shot through those and about how socio-economic factors
may be taken into account. I am worried that here, in this debate, we
may be misunderstanding the issue slightly and trying to enshrine in
the Bill conservation rather than sustainable development, which would
imbalance the Bill significantly. Marine conservation zones are a
different
debate.</div><a name="09063048000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000406"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I accept the Minister&#146;s point, but the
problem is that this is one of our main opportunities in Committee to
debate the issue, to understand what is in the Minister&#146;s mind
and to discover what standards on sustainable development future
Governments, the MMO and other agencies will be held to. I accept that
we will have opportunities to come back to specific aspects of the
Bill, such as the furtherance of objectives and programmes and the
nature of licensing activities within marine conservation zones. Having
said that, clause 44 refers to &#147;sustainable development&#148;.
Whether we are talking about &#147;furthering&#148; or
&#147;contributing to&#148; it, unless we are clear about what
&#147;it&#148; is, I will remain troubled that we may be seeking to
&#147;further&#148; a woolly conceptual issue. Frankly, whether we
&#147;further&#148; or &#147;contribute to&#148; it is
inconsequential in the scheme of things. The hon. Member for Newbury
may wish to pick up on that point in his closing
remarks.</div><a name="09063048000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, I appreciate that we will have an opportunity to examine
specific aspects of what &#147;sustainable development&#148; means
and at getting the balance right&#151;I accept that there is a
balance. However, I remain more, rather than less, troubled as a result
of the debate. I hope that the Minister will reflect on the matter. I
also hope that we can discuss the issue as we proceed, and perhaps come
back to the guidance and table further amendments on
Report.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div><a name="09063048000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000407"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> Beginning with amendment 29, tabled by the hon.
Member for St. Ives, in the piles of documents on the Bill in my
office, I have seen a definition of sustainable development
somewhere&#151;it could have been in the White Paper or the Green
Paper. It involved flow charts and was as clear as some of this debate
has been on the direction that this is
going.</div><a name="09063048000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for St. Ives,
but I am concerned about how his amendment would impact on the Bill.
Therefore, I am persuaded by the Minister&#146;s arguments. The
definition appears to ignore socio-economic principles. It would reduce
the flexibility of marine conservation zones, and it ignores the role
of marine planning in, for example, climate change mitigation and
proposed wind farms. While conservation is the primary objective of
MCZs, we should not completely ignore socio-economic
elements.</div><a name="09063048000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been persuaded by many of the non-governmental
organisations&#146; arguments. Indeed, as an old landlubber, I have
been educated and even entranced by the information with which they
have provided me about the diversity and beauty of our seas, and so
much more. However, on the issue under discussion, the Bill is
correctly balanced, and it would not be right at this stage to support
the amendment, even though it is an honest attempt at trying to define
sustainable development in accordance with section 117, which is
important.</div><a name="09063048000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have made progress on amendment 9, as well. Will the Minister assure us
that he will follow the recommendation made by the hon. Member for
Southampton, Test to use paragraph 7 of schedule 5 in order to meet the
amendment&#146;s
objectives?</div><a name="09063048000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000408"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> On the comments made by the hon. Member
for Newbury and the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for
Southampton, Test, the issue is important in terms of not only legal
precedent, as I have mentioned, but the devolved Administrations and
others being content with our treatment of the Bill. On schedule 5, I
will write to the members of the Committee to explain and clarify how
we intend the Bill to drive sustainable development forward, and how
that is linked to other related areas. That may be of significant help
to members of the Committee in order to explain clearly how the Bill is
underpinned by sustainable
development.</div><a name="09063048000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000409"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> If the Minister confirms that that will involve
the insertion of words into paragraph 7 of schedule 5, I shall not
press the amendment further at this stage, but I seek clarification.
For example, he has talked about semantics in the sense that the
document&#146;s policies cannot &#147;further&#148;, but they can
&#147;contribute to&#148; sustainable development. The Minister
needs to provide more comfort on that. Also, will he clarify that he
will come back to us on the legal advice that he has received? It may
be that 70 Acts use the wording that he has proposed, but that does not
necessarily prevent synergy with other types of legislation. Will he
clarify whether schedule 5 will be
amended?</div><a name="09063048000305"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000410"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Bearing in mind the work that has already
taken place on the Bill, as well as the way in which the issue under
discussion would impact not only on us, but also on devolved
Administrations, which is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>one of the key facets, I make it clear that we will not amend schedule
5, because that would not be right or proper. However, I am happy to
explore the issue further with devolved Administrations and others to
see whether there is any scope on the matter, and I will return with
the results at a subsequent stage. I do not think that the Committee
wants us, even when we take today&#146;s debate into consideration,
to make a decision that would lead to Scotland, Wales or Northern
Ireland claiming that we had unbalanced what they considered to be a
good and clear way forward on sustainable development. So I am happy to
make that commitment, as opposed to saying that we will bring forward
the amendment to schedule 5
now.</div><a name="09063048000329"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000425"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The Committee will note that throughout the
selection list there are a number of clauses that do not have
amendments. I propose to call those clauses by number and rattle
through them. If any Member wishes to speak to any of those clauses,
please indicate and I will then stop. Otherwise, I shall move them en

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
45</h4><a name="09063048000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Preparation
and coming into effect of
statement</div><a name="09063048000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000426"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I do not intend to detain the Committee long. My
reading of subsections (1) and (3) is that there is a potential
conflict between them. They also effectively allow the Secretary of
State to overrule his compatriots in the devolved Administrations if he
or she fails to come to an agreement with them when, initially at
least, preparing marine policy statements. There are some important
issues here, particularly regarding migratory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>fauna and other species, where a devolved Administration will clearly
have an interest in what the Secretary of State is capable of doing in
the waters within their own jurisdiction. For that reason, I seek the
Minister&#146;s reassurance that there is an acknowledgement that the
Secretary of State has, in effect, an overruling power in that regard.
That is irrespective of how carefully the clause is worded, and of the
fact that subsection (2) states that the Secretary of State must at
least show that they have consulted &#147;the other policy
authorities&#148; during the process of any amendment to the
MPS.</div><a name="09063048000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
scenario I am painting is that the Secretary of State will come to an
agreement with &#147;the other policy authorities&#148; to bring
forward a plan on which there is agreement. Shortly thereafter,
however, having failed to persuade those other policy authorities of
his or her views on the matter, the Secretary of State will simply
bring forward an alternative policy statement and ignore the
consultation process.</div>
<a name="09063048000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to you, Mr. Gale, for allowing me to raise this issue and I
look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>
<a name="09063048000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000427"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I can give the hon. Gentleman the
assurance he seeks. The opening words of the clause, in subsection (1),
make clear our intention that an MPS should be prepared
by</div><a name="09063048000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all
the policy authorities, acting
jointly&#148;.</div><a name="09063048000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is what we are trying to get at in the clause, and it is quite a win
for the Bill. It is the approach that we and the devolved
Administrations are committed to, and it will provide the best
foundation for a comprehensive, joined-up and effective planning
system.</div>
<a name="09063048000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, as
the hon. Gentleman rightly points out, we must acknowledge the
realities of devolution, and the Bill does that. The devolved
Administrations may from time to time espouse different policies from
those of the UK Government regarding some of the matters being devolved
to them, and it would be within their right and power to do so. Despite
all the genuine good will&#151;there is real good will on this issue,
and the best of intentions&#151;it is not possible to require in law
that we must all agree. Otherwise, we risk not having any MPS at
all.</div>
<a name="09063048000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that
reason, as the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, the clause enables the
Secretary of State to proceed without the involvement of the three
devolved Administrations and to act alone if necessary. The Secretary
of State must always be involved in preparing and adopting any MPS.
That reflects the importance of having an MPS in place to set out the
strategic policy framework, even if it is not the joint statement we
would always wish to have.</div>
<a name="09063048000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must say
that that is not our preferred position. Therefore, the clause requires
that the Secretary of State formally invite &#147;the other policy
authorities&#148; to participate before reluctantly taking any
decision to proceed alone.</div>
<a name="09063048000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000428"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b><b class="B"> </b>If a devolved nation decided to go down a
different policy route, how would that decision interact with the
Marine Management Organisation, for instance? Would the MMO take
cognisance of the devolved Assembly&#146;s policy, or would it have
to react to the policy that the Secretary of State had signed
off?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div><a name="09063048000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000429"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> No, the MMO will always have cognisance of
what is happening in border areas with other authorities. As the hon.
Gentleman will know and as was debated in the other place, in Wales
many of the MMO&#146;s functions have been taken directly into the
Welsh Assembly Government, as was their wish. However, the MMO will
need to integrate fully. If there is a fundamental breakdown beyond the
powers that already exist in the Bill, there is, under the Government
of Wales Act 2006, recourse to the powers of the Joint Ministerial
Committee, and so
on.</div><a name="09063048000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause makes it clear that only one MPS can exist at any time; that is
the good way forward on this issue. Therefore, when we introduce a new
MPS it will replace the previous one, thus avoiding the possibility of
multiple, potentially conflicting statements.</div>
<a name="09063048000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for St. Ives is absolutely right to say that we want to move
forward together&#151;that is the big win within the Bill&#151;but
there is the possibility for the Secretary of State to take action
himself.</div>
<a name="09063048000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000430"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his response.
What this debate highlights is the potential Achilles heel in clause 45
in cases where the policy authorities fail to achieve any kind of
agreement. A migratory species that depends on the marine environment
within the designation of one of the policy authorities could migrate
into the waters of another. We can see what might happen if there is a
failure to reach agreement where a potential conflict of interests
exists. The clause could allow the Secretary of State to take the upper
hand and dictate the terms to the devolved Administrations.</div>
<a name="09063048000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
matter of concern, whether the emphasis is on allowing or enabling
certain economic activities that may have a detrimental impact on the
waters and marine habitats of a devolved Administration, or on
operating in a different manner and therefore perhaps damaging the
economic prospects of a devolved Administration. I do not propose any
amendments or a way forward, but the Minister might like to reflect on
this issue. The fine minds and creative brains behind the Bill and
those who have been engaged in the associated discussions may come up
with some further thinking on this issue; nevertheless, it is an
Achilles heel. Thank you, Mr. Gale for allowing me to raise
it, as it remains
unresolved.</div><a name="09063048000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

widely welcomed concession given on Report in the other place to place

it clear that the timetable set out in the statement of public

appraisal of sustainability alongside the preparation of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000437"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> The Government amendment is a minor technical
amendment that will ensure that the requirement placed on the marine
plan authorities by the other place to seek to plan for all areas works
as intended. Lobby groups are concerned that we maintain that provision
in the Bill. I am pleased to report that having listened to the views
that they and other interested parties expressed in the other place, we
and the devolved Administrations have concluded that we fully support
the principle behind the amendment. I have tabled this minor amendment
to slightly redraft and clarify the original provision without changing
its intended effect, and I hope that the Committee supports
it.</div><a name="09063048000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000438"></a>Andrew
George:</b> My two amendments are probing, primarily to pursue
a theme that applies throughout the Bill. That theme is the extent to
which Government quangos, whether they are the MMO or other Government
agencies, can determine the activities within any local authority or
sub-regional area without sufficient or adequate consultation with the
terrestrial local authority in the coastal area concerned. The purpose
of the two amendments&#151;particularly amendment 32&#151;is to
ensure that the Government have cognisance of the existence of local
authorities and that those authorities have local strategic plans that
apply to the coastal areas. Each local authority on the coast
establishes policies that have, or seek to have, an impact on the local
economy, whether in the furtherance of tourism and the holiday trade,
in the furtherance of the maintenance of local industries, such as
fishing, diving or marine exploration, or in the furtherance of other
activities that relate to either a local industry or tourism. What
happens beyond the control of the local authority has an impact on the
local authority
itself.</div><a name="09063048000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendments is simply to raise issues that I hope the
Minister is prepared to reflect on. I do not intend to press the
amendments, but I am interested in the Minister&#146;s response,
particularly regarding the broader theme of seeking to ensure that
democratically elected local authorities in particular, which have a
clear interest in the future of the marine resource on their coastline,
have a say in decision taking under the
clause.</div><a name="09063048000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000439"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> Amendment 24 is a welcome redrafting of an
Opposition amendment tabled in the other place, creating a requirement
to seek to ensure plan coverage throughout the United Kingdom waters,
where a marine plan statement is in effect. I am pleased to support the
amendment.</div><a name="09063048000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also support the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for St. Ives,
because they have been backed by a number of organisations that have
spoken to me as well, particularly the British Marine Federation. That
body argues that there is a need for an integrated relationship between
marine and land use planning in order to reduce the loss of land sites
that are important for access or boating facilities&#151;for example,
recreational harbours or slipways and associated parking and boat
storage. This is, therefore, a good probing
amendment.</div><a name="09063048000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000440"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I thank the hon. Members for St. Ives and for
Newbury. I understand that amendments 31 and 32 replicate an amendment
tabled by Baroness  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>Miller of Chilthorne Domer and Lord Greaves in Committee in the other
place, but as my noble Friend Lord Davies of Oldham explained at the
time, there is no need for specific provision in the Bill enabling the
creation of sub-regional marine plans or marine plan areas. We entirely
agree that planning authorities must be able to plan in the most
appropriate way for any given area. Clause 51 already enables the
marine plan authority to divide its marine planning region into marine
plan areas however it sees fit. Those plans, however, are not set in
stone, so the authority may prepare new plans at any time, either to
divide the region differently or even to prepare additional plans for
smaller areas within existing marine plan
areas.</div><a name="09063048000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
32 would place within the definition of a marine plan the requirement
that it must have regard to all other plans and strategies on the
coast. Hon. Members will be aware that paragraph 9(2)(h) of
schedule 6 already contains a requirement that marine plan
authorities, when preparing a marine pan, must have regard to</div>
<a name="09063048000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
plan...prepared by a public or local authority in connection with
the management or use of the sea or the coast, or of marine or coastal
resources.&#148;</div><a name="09063048000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
will include local development plans, shoreline management plans, river
basin management plans and, when prepared by a local authority, estuary
management plans. I believe that that provision is clearer than the one
set out in the amendment, which does not limit the other plans or
strategies to which the marine plan must have regard to those with some
relevance to the marine
environment.</div><a name="09063048000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09063048000197"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000441"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> I declare an interest as a member of the governing
council of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. I wonder whether
the RNLI has been consulted in any of
that.</div><a name="09063048000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000442"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> That obviously relates to plans that are to come
in the future, but we certainly envisage that there should be the
widest possible consultation in any planning structure, and in the Bill
we have made it clear that we do not seek to limit the consultations
that are to be held and want to ensure that, when we devise marine
plans and marine plan strategies, there is the widest possible public
consultation. Clearly, the RNLI will be a relevant body in many
cases.</div><a name="09063048000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
32 would place an unnecessary additional burden on the resources
available to marine plan authorities. Furthermore, paragraph (3) of
schedule 6 goes beyond the requirement set out in paragraph (9)(2)(h)
to have regard to other terrestrial plans and strategies by requiring
the marine plan authorities to</div>
<a name="09063048000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;take all
reasonable steps to secure that the plan is compatible
with&#148;</div>
<a name="09063048000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">plans developed as part
of the terrestrial planning  system. Clearly, that goes beyond
a requirement merely to have regard to such plans. Provisions in clause
62  will enable a marine plan to be challenged before
the  courts if a marine plan authority failed to
comply  with that compatibility requirement or to have regard
to  the other plans mentioned in paragraph (9)(2)(h)
of  schedule 6.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div><a name="09063048000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will take
this opportunity to reassure members of the Committee that the
integration of marine and terrestrial planning at the coast has been of
fundamental importance to the development of our proposals from the
very beginning. The land and sea, as the hon. Member for St. Ives has
pointed out, are inextricably linked. Many actions on the land have an
impact on the sea and vice versa. For that reason, it is important that
the planning and management of both areas is as integrated as possible,
with both systems working effectively together to enable seamless and
holistic management of the area. To that end, we have worked
extensively with the Local Government Association&#146;s coastal
issues special interest group, the Royal Town Planning Institute and
numerous key stakeholders to understand how best to enable the
integration of marine planning with what happens on land and to
identify the most appropriate mechanism to involve local authorities in
that process.</div>
<a name="09063048000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities already lead in the planning and management of the
terrestrial components of the coast and in the development of the
previously mentioned local development plans and shoreline management
plans, and invariably they are instrumental in the partnership
development of estuary management plans. Local authorities contain a
wealth of specialised and knowledgeable skills and expertise, which the
MMO will need fully to incorporate, utilise and build on throughout its
marine planning process and beyond into the majority of its functions.
Importantly, local authorities also represent the interests of their
communities and implement the will of the locally and democratically
elected representatives. Therefore, I assure hon. Members that full
local authority involvement in the marine planning process will be key
to the successful implementation of marine planning from the early
stages of development through to implementation, monitoring and review.
The provisions within the Bill will support and encourage the
integration of planning systems  at the coast and will go
further than is proposed in amendment
32.</div><a name="09063048000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
31 is not necessary, too, as the result that it seeks is already
achievable under the current drafting and could therefore cast doubt on
how existing provisions should be interpreted. In light of those
reassurances, I hope that hon. Members will withdraw their amendments,
as they indicated that they
would.</div><a name="09063048000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000443"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. There is no need to withdraw them, as
they have not been
moved.</div><a name="09063048000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000444"></a>Andrew
George:</b> Thank you for reminding me that I have not moved
my amendment, Mr. Gale. My intention was to probe this
issue, which we might come back to on Report. I do not know what I need
to do next, under the rules, so I seek your guidance, Mr.
Gale. Must I move the amendments to entitle myself to seek to do
something on
Report?</div><a name="09063048000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000445"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It is worth clarifying the position for the
benefit of all members of the Committee, one or two of whom have
indicated to me that their knowledge of procedure is a little rusty.
That probably goes for the Chair as well. We move only the lead
amendment, and it is open to any other Member to seek to move any other
amendment that is grouped with the lead amendment, but the Chair
requires notice and will then decide whether to take that. Any
amendment that is moved  in Committee is unlikely to be
selected for debate on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>Report, so the fundamental principle is that if you wish to come back to
something, you should not push it in Committee and should then take a
further look at it on Report. I hope that that clarifies the
position.</div>
<a name="09063048000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000446"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I am very grateful to you for that explanation,
Mr. Gale. Perhaps by accident, I have managed to pursue the
right strategy on this occasion. Of course, I do not wish to move the
amendments because, having listened to the Minister&#146;s response,
I might like to come back to the issue on Report.</div>
<a name="09063048000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">A theme that
runs through the Bill is that we are quango-ising decision taking with
regard to the intertidal zone and the marine resource. I am troubled by
the issue of democratic accountability for decisions that are taken in
areas reasonably adjacent to the coastline in relation to what the
Minister has referred to as the seamless provision in the Bill
regarding what one might argue is the intertidal zone itself. I remain
unconvinced that the Government have quite got the balance
right.</div><a name="09063048000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that amendment 32 would place an unreasonable burden on
resources&#151;I think that that was the terminology that she
used&#151;but democracy places a burden on resources. That is the
nature of democracy, as we know from the cost to the taxpayer of
maintaining the House of Commons and ensuring that we have a
democratically accountable body to take decisions. Equally, the
terrestrial authorities&#151;the local authorities&#151;have a
clear interest in future development on the coastline and in
maintaining the integrity of local development plans and the frameworks
in which they operate, and the Bill should take cognisance
of
that.</div><a name="09063048000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
by failing to acknowledge further the role and importance of locally
democratically elected local authorities, the Bill appears to
contradict a number of the Government&#146;s other stated intentions
and aims to ensure that there is local democracy as set out in the
Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill, which is
currently going through
Parliament.</div><a name="09063048000331"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000447"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman and other members of
the Committee that we fully intend to involve the local community and
local authorities, as well as business people and other people with an
interest in the marine environment, in the preparation of each marine
plan. The proposal will require a full public consultation on the draft
plan that is created. There will be no lack of engagement. We are very
clear that we want a rigorous consultation process and for the MMO to
have full regard to it when preparing its final plan. As I said
earlier, that is why we believe that local authorities are very
important. We believe that local authorities are a key partner not only
in the consultation process, but in the actual implementation of the
plan that follows
it.</div><a name="09063048000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000448"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her
intervention. However, that, of course, does not preclude the
conclusion of that consultation and consideration ignoring and
overruling the interests of the local authority. On behalf of those
local authorities with an interest in the coast and in the intertidal
zone in particular, that is the concern that I want to articulate to
the Minister. While the processes described in the Bill would allow the
marine authorities to go through the motions, the local authorities
could be ignored in that process. Having said that, I have had the
opportunity to air the issue. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>The lack of democratic accountability, in some respects, is a theme that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000449"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I beg to move amendment 10, in
clause 71, page 48, line 30, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1A) This
decision shall be made within 16 weeks of the
application.&#146;.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">Assessments
must be considered and a decision reached within three months. There is
a requirement that onshore planning applications are considered within
16
weeks.</div><a name="09063048000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(1) outlines the conditions for granting licences. Our amendment
requires that assessments must be considered and a decision reached
within 16 weeks. As the Bill stands, there is no time limit on the
consideration of marine licence applications. Without committing marine
licensing authorities to a certain time scale&#151;I am happy to say
at this stage that I am relatively flexible on what that time scale
should be&#151;we are leaving the system open to massive backlogs and
delays. Considering the potential lists of activities that will require
a licence, it is important that we do not open up small businesses, in
particular, to a potential loss of earnings through the lack of a
licensing time
scale.</div><a name="09063048000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment also considers the renewable energy industry. Time is of the
essence for marine developers. They may be funded by venture capital,
and delays cost money. Unless we insist on some sort of defined time
scale, it is conceivable that important developments that will play a
great part in dealing with our renewable energy commitments will be
affected.</div><a name="09063048000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000450"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> I have some sympathy with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment to put a time limit on dealing with
licence applications. The explanatory statement mentions onshore
planning applications, but does the same requirement apply to onshore
licence applications? There is a slight difference between planning
applications and licence
applications.</div><a name="09063048000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000451"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I am seeking to develop a degree of consistency. I
am not entirely certain what the requirements are on the whole range of
onshore licensing, but we certainly have a well developed and accepted
system of time limits in relation to planning. I do not see why we
should not impose that on marine licence applications. Other countries
do that as
well.</div><a name="09063048000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000452"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> My hon. Friend is making a point with which I have
some sympathy. There also seems to be nothing in the clause about an
appeals process. Given that, as my hon. Friend has said, many of the
applications will be funded by the private sector and that time costs
money, should the Bill not also contain something about an appeals
process if, for whatever reason, the initial application is
refused?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div><a name="09063048000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000453"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point, and this may be
an opportunity to tease out of the Minister whether we can expand the
amendment to include that sort of requirement. Other countries seem to
manage in terms of marine management licensing. I was interested to
read that South Africa has a legal framework that requires
environmental impact assessments to be considered and a decision
reached within three months. I therefore hope that the Minister will
look favourably on imposing some sort of time
limit.</div><a name="09063048000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000454"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before we go down that road, may I draw hon.
Members&#146; attention to clause 73, which may cover part of the
issue that has just been raised? I do not want to have the debate
twice; if you have it now, that is fine by
me.</div><a name="09063048000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000455"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> I have a certain amount of interest in the
issue, and I have sympathy for the amendment. My interest arises out of
onshore licensing by Government authorities and the way in which that
must be done to a standard in order to ensure that the environment is
safeguarded. Imposing a specific time limit should in some way reflect
the complexity of the application, because my experience is that the
conditions that are put on a licence must be both practicable and
enforceable. On a large pipeline that went through Wales, for example,
there should have been a statement at each stage of the crossing of
various streams in relation to how adverse effects on those streams
could be mitigated, but such statements were not included as conditions
in the
licence.</div><a name="09063048000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
I have some sympathy with the suggestion of the hon. Member for
Newbury, certain minor applications should be dealt with on a shorter
time scale than larger ones, which needs to be reflected in the scale
and complexity of the application. That would help in our future
deliberations, because we will later discuss clauses on enforcement.
Does the licensing authority have the necessary capacity to ensure that
it can enforce the conditions? It is one thing to put a condition on a
licence, but it is another to enforce it when a rather large
organisation that is pushing ahead with a development has more of an
eye on completing that development than on complying with the
conditions.</div><a name="09063048000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman has raised a good issue, and I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s response, but the issue involves an option of
proportionality that depends upon the size and complexity of the
applications.</div><a name="09063048000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000456"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Let me say first that we agree with the
sentiment behind the amendment. In fact, one criticism of the current
licensing system is that applicants are uncertain about when their
applications for a licence will be determined, and we are certainly
looking to improve that in the Bill. To pick up the points made by the
hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, however, an arbitrary time
limit in the Bill is not the way to proceed, and I will explain why in
a moment. None the less, I think that we can do something about the
issue.</div><a name="09063048000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
has been said, the activities and developments that the marine
licensing regime has to encompass are incredibly varied in scale and
nature. They include everything from jetties built at the bottom of
people&#146;s gardens to pilot offshore energy schemes,
aggregate  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>dredging, harbour developments, laying submarine cables and pipelines,
and the creation of artificial reefs, which is something that we are
hearing more about.</div>
<a name="09063048000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The varied
nature of such projects is matched only by their size and complexity
and sometimes by the controversy over what they involve, which can go
from the insertion of a few piles to the construction of a huge marina.
Projects also take place in a wide variety of environments, which can
be miles out to sea, in intertidal areas, in marine conservation zones
or in sites that are protected under European legislation.</div>
<a name="09063048000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">For each
application, the licensing authority will have regard to the need to
protect the environment and human health and to prevent interference
with other uses of the sea. It will also factor in marine plans,
socio-economic issues and anything else that it considers relevant. All
those factors will be unique to every application and will need to be
given the due consideration that they deserve and which is required
under law.</div>
<a name="09063048000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09063048000457"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Jones</b> (Clwyd, West) (Con): I take the
Minister&#146;s point, but do not similar considerations apply to
onshore planning applications? Is it not the case that a sensible
developer will understand that the statutory time limit for such
planning applications frequently cannot be adhered to and will allow
the determining authority more time? The difficulty here is that no
time is stipulated, so it is not possible to have such a
negotiation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000458"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> That is why I think that there is a way
forward, although it does not necessarily involve including a time in
the Bill. One drawback of putting something in the Bill is that the
tendency might be to find the longest time limit to take account of the
most complex projects in the most complex environments. We need an
intelligent and flexible way forward that gives industry more certainty
about the consideration of applications and that allows the proper
analysis of the various factors in
projects.</div><a name="09063048000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several
other issues arise at a practical level. Many applications received by
the Marine and Fisheries Agency do not contain sufficient detail,
supporting information or a full consideration of the facts. Having an
arbitrary time in the Bill is therefore a
difficulty.</div><a name="09063048000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
some instances, the licensing authority has to go back to the applicant
to request further information. What do we do in those situations? Do
we stop the clock? In other instances, the authority has to commission
further evidence from scientific advisers such as the Centre for
Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science. In the odd case, the
evidence may be collectible only at certain times of the year, because
of the seasonal nature of the
environment.</div><a name="09063048000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
will happen if the time frame is missed? Should the licensing authority
be obliged to grant the licence? If that is done, say, before evidence
is gathered, we risk possible infraction of a number of European
directives, which will require appropriate analysis. Those are tricky
issues.</div>
<a name="09063048000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such details
should be decided in conjunction with the bodies that I have mentioned
and put in the secondary legislation that governs the applications
process. To that end, I am pleased to say that we will publish a
consultation paper on 1 July that includes a suggestion for target time
frames, and all Committee members will receive a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>copy of that paper. The licensing authority will come to an informed
view about the nature of the application right at the front of the
process and give the developer target time scales for the various
stages of the process, recognising that different applications have
different
complexities.</div><a name="09063048000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
suggestion in the consultation is that we state at the outset what the
time scale should be. We think that that is a way of building
flexibility into the process in an intelligent and tailored way to give
applicants the increased certainty that they are looking for, without
being unrealistic about some of the complex demands in our marine
environment.</div><a name="09063048000332"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="09063048000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000459"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> Will the Minister say what sanctions against
failure to determine are in an applicant&#146;s hands in such a
case?</div>
<a name="09063048000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000460"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> In response to the intervention from the
hon. Member for East Devon, there is an appeals procedure in clause 73,
which the Secretary of State is required to use, so that facility is
there already.</div>
<a name="09063048000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consultation
is the correct way to get this right. There can be a full debate over
the summer and we welcome contributions from all stakeholders. We will
discuss the details in depth with industry, scientific advisers and
other consultees, all of whom have important inputs and contributions
to
make.</div><a name="09063048000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000461"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> Under clause 73, which is titled &#147;Appeals
against licensing decisions&#148;, the appeal power is against the
decision, not against non-determination. The Minister might like to
consider
that.</div><a name="09063048000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000462"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I shall allow debate on clause
73, in so far as it is relevant to this clause, because the two are
clearly intermingled. However, if the Minister is happy with this, that
will be on the understanding that when we get to clause 73, we will not
debate it
again.</div><a name="09063048000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000463"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> In that case, Mr. Gale, it
might be worth my while to reflect on clause 73, which obliges all
licensing authorities to establish appeals mechanisms against their
licensing decisions. The appealable decisions are listed in clause
71(1), namely refusing to grant the licence or to grant it subject to
conditions.</div><a name="09063048000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reasons why the appeals mechanism is open only to applicants, not third
parties, are twofold. First, clause 68 requires the licensing authority
to publish notice of a marine application or to require the applicant
to publish notice of it in a manner calculated to bring it to the
attention of any persons likely to be interested. The licensing
authority is obliged under clause 69(3)
to</div><a name="09063048000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have
regard to...representations which it receives from any person
having an interest in the outcome of the
application.&#148;</div><a name="09063048000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
70 allows the licensing authority
to</div><a name="09063048000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;cause
an inquiry to be
held&#148;,</div><a name="09063048000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">for
example when there are particularly controversial or complex cases.
Therefore, there is sufficient opportunity during the application
process for third parties to get their views factored into any
decision.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div><a name="09063048000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, it
is important that marine developments are not held up unnecessarily by
a large number of appeals lodged by third parties who simply disagree
with the licensing authority&#146;s decision. Appeals can be costly
in terms of time and resources, not only for the applicant, but also
for the regulator. If we want this improved, expedited licensing
system, we cannot afford for it be clogged up by handling appeal after
appeal.</div>
<a name="09063048000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 73(3)
lists the types of provisions that will be made by order that will
establish an appeals mechanism and the procedure that must be followed
in conducting an appeal. We do not want to prescribe the procedural
detail in the Bill as we consider the appeals mechanism to be integral
to the marine licensing decision-making process, which is itself to be
prescribed by regulation. We want to consider stakeholders and the
public in that process, including what they think to be appropriate
procedures, time scales and grounds for
appeal.</div><a name="09063048000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
appellant body may be different in each devolved territory to that used
for MMO licensing decisions. Enabling such detailed provisions to be
made in subsequent regulations allows each Administration to tailor the
process to complement and reflect its decision-making procedures. I can
give assurances that the UK Government will enable appeals against MMO
decisions to be heard by an independent body. The order will be subject
to the affirmative procedure.</div>
<a name="09063048000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
non-determination, as the licensing function is to be delegated to the
MMO, the Secretary of State has the power under clause 100 to direct
it, and there is also scope for judicial review. Therefore, there are
opportunities to challenge the body for not delivering in the
time
scale.</div><a name="09063048000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consultation will commence tomorrow. It is a good opportunity for
industry, Committee members, stakeholders and the wider public to
engage properly in the debate. The intention behind the debate is
right. We want to give certainty and clarity through proper dialogue
with stakeholders, including industry. The secondary legislation will
reflect the outcome of those discussions and I will welcome Committee
members&#146; views on the subject. With this reassurance, I urge the
hon. Member for Newbury to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09063048000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000464"></a>Andrew
George:</b> With regard to clauses 71 and 73, I seek
reassurances about when a licensing activity clearly impinges on the
coast itself and the local authority.  I am concerned that some
activities&#151;whether offshore wind development when cables are
coming onshore, or activities at sea where service vessels need to be
brought onshore&#151;clearly require planning permission from a local
authority as well. There must be some joint operation and consultation
between the coastal authority and the MMO when licensing the activity.
It concerns me that there appears to be no provision for that, and nor
has the co-ordination of the licensing and the appeals process been
envisaged.</div>
<a name="09063048000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000465"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I refer the hon. Gentleman to clause 68,
which deals with notice of applications and those bodies and persons
that need to be consulted in the process. There is no way in which
local authorities or others&#151;those in not only the marine
environment, but the adjoining terrestrial environment&#151;could not
be engaged, particularly, as the hon. Gentleman quite rightly says,
when applications are relevant to them, such as pipeline or grid
connectors.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div><a name="09063048000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that
reassurance, I say to the hon. Member for Newbury that we are
sympathetic to what he says. We are bringing forward the consultation
tomorrow to allow stakeholders to get engaged and to give some
certainty about time frames. I hope he will feel assured enough to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09063048000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000466"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
clarification. As he rightly points out, there is a wide variety of
applications in the marine environment but, as hon. Members have said,
there is also a wide variety of applications on land&#151;everything
from a loft extension to a nuclear power station. We have methods that
allow a time limit in such
circumstances.</div><a name="09063048000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to you, Mr. Gale, for reminding me about clause
73. It was in my subconscious mind and you brought it to my conscious
mind. I notice that there is no reference in that clause to a time
limit on appeals. That is a very important point. Given that the
Minister has announced a consultation, it would be wrong to press the
amendment at this stage, but I hope to return to the matter on Report.
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000467"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I beg to move amendment 11, in clause 75,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000468"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 12, in
clause 75, page 51, line 24, at
end add</div>
<a name="09063074000007"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;&#147;maintenance
dredging&#148; means the removal of accumulated sediments from
harbour channels and berths undertaken on behalf of or by harbour
authorities, marinas, yacht clubs and port facilities to ensure a safe
depth of water for navigational purposes and the removal of sediment to
restore adequate flow of water to mitigate risk of flooding or protect
a sensitive
habitat.&#146;.</div><a name="09063048000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000469"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> Clause 75(2) lists the conditions under which a
marine licence is not needed for dredging or spoil
disposal:</div><a name="09063048000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
the activity is undertaken by or on behalf of a harbour authority,
and...that the activity is authorised by, and carried out in
accordance with, any legislation falling within subsection
(3).&#148;</div><a name="09063048000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
wish to insert a new
condition:</div><a name="09063048000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
the activity is maintenance
dredging.&#148;</div><a name="09063048000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would ensure that low-risk maintenance dredging was exempted
from the licensing system. The explanatory notes to the draft Marine
Bill stated that low-risk dredging activities, such as maintenance
dredging, would become exempt under the new Bill. However, there is no
specific commitment to that in this Bill, as amended in the other
place. The Government have committed to consult on exempting
maintenance dredging beyond the context of activities carried out by,
or on behalf of, harbour authorities, thus ignoring the vital
maintenance dredging carried out by marina and port operators. Harbour
authorities are not always best placed  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>to carry out maintenance dredging and offering them a specific licensing
exemption appears to give them an unfair advantage in a competitive
market. For example, many harbour authorities have recreational
moorings as a source of income. The harbour authority would be exempt
from obtaining a maintenance dredging licence, but a marina in that
harbour would be required to gain the appropriate licence, which would
force it to raise mooring fees to cover the
cost.</div><a name="09063048000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Exempting
all forms of maintenance dredging would reduce costly bureaucracy at a
local level and ensure a level playing field for coastal communities.
Maintenance dredging does not involve the removal of river or sea beds,
but the removal of accumulated sediment blocking navigation channels,
and any environmental impact is therefore minimal. Amendment 12 would
add a definition of maintenance dredging to the list of definitions in
subsection
(4)(a).</div><a name="09063048000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000470"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I wish to make a few remarks about clause 75 and
the amendments. Although I have some sympathy with the purpose and
sentiments behind the amendments, my experience of working with coastal
local authorities when dredging to maintain a safe and navigable
channel is required is that one cannot undertake that work without
considering the consequences for the wider hydrological system of tidal
flows and other water courses that serve the estuary or the harbour
that is being dredged for the safety of vessels using it. In such
circumstances, as I have had the opportunity to look into them, it is
appropriate to consult Trinity House, which has a range of important
expertise, on navigable safety. Matters pertaining to Natural England
also come into play, particularly if the estuary or harbour in question
is a designated site of special scientific interest, or has another
designation because the environment must be protected or
considered.</div><a name="09063048000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the level of the local authorities that, in many instances, provide the
required dredging licences, there is the question of what happens to
the dredged material. It is important to consider where, for example,
sand or sediment that is excavated on to a dredging barge is deposited.
It might be placed temporarily on land and then deposited elsewhere
within the hydrological system to replace sand that will be lost from
another area in the vicinity of the area being dredged. The
consequences of dredging one area has a knock-on effect, particularly
in a sandy environment such as on the dunes&#151;the towans, as we
know them&#151;and sometimes in areas a number of miles
away.</div><a name="09063048000333"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="09063048000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000471"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> The hon. Gentleman is perhaps referring to his home
town and the Hayle estuary, which has to be dredged regularly, thereby
affecting the towns around it. Is he saying that hoops would have to be
gone through every time the Hayle estuary was dredged? If the marina
development there ever goes ahead, it will no doubt need to be dredged
more than it is at the
moment.</div><a name="09063048000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000472"></a>Andrew
George:</b><b class="B"> </b>Hayle harbour authority is responsible for
maintaining a safe, navigable channel for harbour users, but that is
not the only instance in which dredging takes place for such a purpose.
A time-limited licence applies. A licence is not needed every time a
boat goes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>out to dredge the channel, but it applies for a period during which
dredging activity may take place. That dredging clearly has an impact
on the wider marine environment, not just on the area being
dredged.</div><a name="09063048000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that the Minister be aware that allowing a laissez-faire
approach in some harbours and estuaries would mean that, where the
harbour authority responsible for maintaining the safe, navigable
channel goes ahead with its dredging activities without consideration
of the consequences in the area around it, that would result in
denuding sand and sediment from other areas, because it would be
dredging those things from its own channel. That would also have
knock-on consequences for the marine wildlife. In some
circumstances&#151;for example, when dredging a harbour or estuary
that may have historical and archaeological remains in
it&#151;heritage bodies may need to be consulted as
well.</div><a name="09063048000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I understand the purposes of the amendment, we need to press forward on
this issue with some
caution.</div><a name="09063048000273"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000473"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I thank the hon. Members for Newbury and for St.
Ives for raising points that are live and important for a number of
operators. There has been some uncertainty on the part of industry
about whether the new licensing system will place disproportionate
burdens on operators that regularly carry out vital dredging
activities, which is why it is seeking an exemption for maintenance
dredging.</div><a name="09063048000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
noble Lords in the other place rightly sought assurances from the
Government that any exemptions from the licensing regime would be made
with regard to the need to protect the environment and human health,
and prevent interference with legitimate uses of the sea and other
relevant factors. I may not be able to offer a general exemption for
maintenance dredging today, but we are actively exploring the extent to
which we can exempt low-risk dredging activities from the need for a
marine
licence.</div><a name="09063048000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to ensure that operators doing the necessary work of keeping
navigational channels clear of silt and other debris can continue to do
so without unnecessary regulatory burden, but still with adequate
regard to the impact of their activities. Under the Bill, all forms of
maintenance dredging will become licensable for the first time.
However, the Bill is about applying regulatory controls proportionately
to the risk and impact of the marine activity on the environment and
human health, and on other uses of the
sea.</div><a name="09063048000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
many cases, maintenance dredging has gone on in the same place for
years without discernible impact, and we do not want unnecessarily to
burden industry in those instances. It is right that maintenance
dredging carried out by or on behalf of a harbour authority, and in
accordance with a local Act or harbour order, should not have to be
licensed under the Bill. As competent authorities, harbour authorities
have a statutory duty to undertake activities in accordance with the
relevant environmental obligations, and they are able to carry out such
activities without the need for consent under the current
regime.</div>
<a name="09063048000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
want to ensure that all other operators who are not subject to those
statutory duties carry out maintenance dredging and other activities
safely and with sufficient regard to the environment and other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>risks. We want to ensure that a licensing authority has the information
it needs to make sound and sustainable decisions on the licence
applications it receives, including determining whether activities
being undertaken in its area&#151;whether they are licensed or
exempt&#151;are likely to have a cumulative
impact.</div><a name="09063048000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
we are looking to use the exemptions order-making power in clause 74 to
find a middle ground&#151;an appropriate mechanism that will keep the
regulatory burden to a minimum, while maintaining proper and
appropriate standards of environmental protection, which was the
concern raised by the hon. Member for St. Ives. Those standards include
controls to ensure that activities will not compromise the achievement
of other environmental objectives, such as those under the water
framework directive. The exemptions order will come into force at the
same time as the new licensing regime.</div>
<a name="09063048000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
licensing regime is not just about excluding or including activities.
The Bill provides flexibility so that, if we choose to exempt an
activity, we can place conditions on the carrying out of that activity
that must be satisfied before it can be considered exempt. For example,
we may want to look at whether we can exempt maintenance dredging
carried out using lower-impact techniques such as hydrodynamic
dredging, which involves the use of water jets to move sediment along
the sea bed.</div>
<a name="09063048000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will be
looking to make use of the Bill&#146;s flexibility and we will
explore whether mechanisms such as registration or authorisation are
appropriate to use where we choose to exempt low-risk activities, so
that a licensing authority can retain sufficient overview of the
activities being carried out in its
area.</div><a name="09063048000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Newbury rightly pointed out, we are just about to
launch a public consultation on our approach to those exemptions,
including proposals for potentially low-risk activities such as
maintenance dredging, which may be appropriate for exemption from the
need for a marine licence. We are also looking to find the best ways of
regulating those low-risk activities, whether through a form of licence
or through a general or conditional exemption. Any decisions will be
made in light of the responses to that consultation, further discussion
and sound evidence.</div>
<a name="09063048000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000474"></a>Andrew
George:</b> In the definition of what may or may not be
considered &#147;dredging&#148;, the Minister referred to the use
of water jets as a means of simply moving sediment on. As far as the
definition of dredging is concerned for the purposes of the Bill
itself, am I therefore right in understanding that sluicing might also
be considered dredging, or have I misunderstood
that?</div>
<a name="09063048000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000475"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> Yes, it would. I have been advised that, under
the maintenance dredging protocol for England, that would be the
case.</div>
<a name="09063048000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000476"></a>Andrew
George:</b> Would sluicing be considered dredging?</div>
<a name="09063048000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000477"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> Sluicing would be,
yes.</div><a name="09063048000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also have to pay regard to our European environmental obligations when
we are considering licensing, as well as the other relevant
international conventions to which the UK is a signatory. I welcome 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>the participation of people and organisations in the consultation when
it is launched; it will be a great opportunity to have an input into
the Government&#146;s policy.</div>
<a name="09063048000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">I now turn to
amendment 12. As hon. Members are perhaps aware, maintenance dredging
is not a legally defined term. Some have sought to define it for the
purposes of implementing various measures or controls, and I am aware
that there are two such definitions. One is in the maintenance dredging
protocol for England, which is an informal industry code of practice,
and the other is used by the Marine and Fisheries Agency in the course
of its existing consenting functions. The agency defines maintenance
dredging
as:</div><a name="09063048000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Material
(generally of an unconsolidated nature)
arising:</div><a name="09063048000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">from
an area where the level of the seabed to be achieved by the dredging
proposed is not lower (relative to Ordnance Datum), than it has been at
any time during the preceding 10 years, or from an area for which there
is evidence that dredging has previously been undertaken to that level
(or lower) during that
period.&#148;</div><a name="09063048000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
will not surprise hon. Members that that definition is slightly
different from the one used in the maintenance dredging
protocol.</div><a name="09063048000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a licensing authority considers it appropriate to exempt maintenance
dredging generally or conditionally&#151;I have said that the
Government&#146;s intend to use exemption orders made under the power
in clause 4 to do that&#151;we will of course be looking to define
the activity more precisely. In doing so, we may want to determine more
exactly who should and should not be allowed to carry out maintenance
dredging operations without a licence. That may or may not be the
approach taken.</div>
<a name="09063048000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current
exemption in clause 74 allows dredging and associated deposits to be
carried out on behalf of harbour authorities in accordance with the
local legislation or harbour order. As competent authorities, harbour
authorities have a statutory duty to undertake these activities. The
Bill is about regulating proportionately and in accordance with the
risks that each activity poses. It would be a backward step if we gave
operators who have no statutory duties regarding environmental
protection a carte blanche to carry out those dredging activities
without any kind of environmental control.</div>
<a name="09063048000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some dredging
disposals bound for sea disposal may contain contaminated sediment, and
it is vital that proper environmental assessments be undertaken and
adequate measures subsequently taken to prevent harm to the environment
and human health, or to prevent interference with other users of the
sea&#151;a point raised by the hon. Member for St. Ives. We will need
to  consult thoroughly and take all scientific evidence into
account before making an exemption order. If maintenance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>dredging is thought to pose a low risk, I hope we can come to some
consensus on how to define it. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman
to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09063048000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09063048000478"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> The hon. Member for St. Ives made a good point
about the potential impact on the hydrology of the area in question,
but what we are talking about here is often small-scale dredging
operations, which are vital for local businesses. He made a point about
spoil disposal, where it is done and how it relates to other areas.
Again, that is important, but I urge the Committee not to legislate on
the basis of the most indolent and stupid managers of marinas or
similar environments. Otherwise, we will go down a regulatory path that
could limit the rights of sea anglers to fish in certain areas. I know
how that would excite certain members of the Committee. One or two sea
anglers might do some stupid things, but 1.3 million of them do
not.</div>
<a name="09063048000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must be
careful how we regulate. We also have to bear in mind the costs for
small marinas and other leisure activities. These are not large
income-yielding businesses. These are often highly marginal and if we
over-regulate, it could impose a burden that could make some of them
unviable. With this Bill we should be encouraging leisure and tourism
activities. We have to think of the path of least resistance when it
comes to regulation such as this. To impose levels of bureaucracy on
very small-scale operations would be a
mistake.</div><a name="09063048000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s comments are well made. Here we are again in a slight
state of flux as the Government go out to consultation. Clearly, it
would be the wrong time to press the amendment. She talked about the
need for proportionality: that is a key word. As for the definition of
maintenance dredging, I urge her to look at the definition we have
provided, rather than the current opaque one, which seems to entail
looking at more than 10 years of data on the sediment in the estuarial
environment. That seems an extremely complex way of defining
maintenance dredging. With those thoughts in mind, I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09063048000295"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
