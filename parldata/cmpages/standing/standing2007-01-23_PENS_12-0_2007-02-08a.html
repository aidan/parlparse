							<b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): Welcome back to the Chair for
the final furlong, Mr. Gale. We have just five fences to
clear before we have an opportunity to get home before, as you say,
Britain freezes over.</div>
					<a name="07020838000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning we were discussing
public sector pensions, and I invited members to back the
recommendation of the cross-party Work and Pensions Committee. We
touched on the rather limited nature of the reforms that the Government
have so far made to the public sector pension architecture, and the
rather different things that Ministers have said in different places
about their enthusiasm for reform.</div>
					<a name="07020838000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is fair to acknowledge that
a number of the public sector pension schemes have been reformed
recently. Some of the reforms are still in the process of being agreed
and to a small extent these will trim the cost of public sector
pensions in the years ahead. Nevertheless, the figures that I gave this
morning for the rising cost of public sector pensions were the costs
after reform. So there is still a significant increase in the
costs.</div>
					<a name="07020838000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a result of
the manner in which the Government have sought to deliver many of the
reforms, many injustices have arisen. For example, for a Government who
claim to be very female-friendly in their pension policy, it is rather
odd that it has been agreed that all existing public sector employees
will be grandfathered in relation to their ability to take public
sector pensions at an early age. Even individuals who had not joined
the public sector when the agreements were struck with the Government
will be grandfathered in that sense, or one might say
pre-grandfathered.</div>
					<a name="07020838000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
people who will pay the price of these reforms, therefore, are the
individuals who will join the public services in the future. The reason
why that may be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 409</div>unfair to women is that women are far more likely to have career breaks;
they may be in the public service now but may need to take a career
break and return to it in the future. As I understand it, many of those
individuals will lose their entitlement to retire early at 60 and find
themselves disadvantaged compared with male members of the same public
services who joined at precisely the same time.</div>
					<a name="07020838000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for
Northampton, North raised this morning the important differences
between many of the public sector schemes, and I think it is worth
touching on them for a moment. It would be wrong to think that all of
the schemes are the same in their characteristics and costs. That is
one of the reasons why it would be particularly sensible to establish a
commission to look into the issue so that we distinguish clearly
between those public sector pension schemes that are more unaffordable
and those that are more affordable.</div>
					<a name="07020838000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth saying that, of all
the public sector pension schemes, only two to my knowledge are funded
and therefore have a funding discipline. One of them is the local
government pension scheme and one of them is our own, although a sense
of discipline in our own is somewhat undermined by the fact that the
taxpayer simply fills up the hole in the funded scheme, whatever that
may be. The hole at the moment approaches a contribution of 27 per
cent. of our salaries. I have managed to ask a number of parliamentary
questions recently on how the employer contribution rate varies between
schemes. In other words, this is the percentage of salaries that
effectively are contributed by the general taxpayer. This seems a more
sensible way to look at affordability and fairness issues in public
sector pensions than simply looking at the issue of the unfunded
liability, which does not necessarily tell us very much in terms of how
sustainable and affordable public sector pension schemes are.</div>
					<a name="07020838000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there is an enormous gulf
between the employer contribution rates for different schemes. When
comparing the public sector and private sector pension schemes and
assessing whether or not they are fair, it is sensible to compare the
employer contribution rates of both. We know that, in crude terms, the
private sector has a lot of defined-contribution schemes, where average
contribution rates are about 7 per cent.&#151;the Minister might have
a better figure on that. The average contribution rates in private
sector defined-benefit schemes are about 13, 14 or 15 per cent.,
whereas the lowest public sector employer contribution rates are about
13 or 14 per cent. Such rates apply to the pension schemes for local
government, teachers and nurses. At the top end, the employer
contribution rate to the judges&#146; pension scheme is slightly less
than 30 per cent. of salary. The figure for the MPs&#146; scheme is
slightly less than 27 per cent., and the scheme figures for the police
and the firefighters are 24.6 and 26.5 per cent.
respectively.</div>
					<a name="07020838000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an enormous gulf between the different schemes. Some may require
relatively little adjustment and reform in the future such as the local
government scheme, which is funded and appears to have quite a low
employer contribution rate, whereas it appears that others will need a
lot more reform. In discussing reform of the larger and, apparently,
more expensive public 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 410</div>sector schemes, we need a debate about how long we expect people in the
public sector to remain in work in the
future.</div>
					<a name="07020838000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Traditionally,
the pension schemes for firefighters, police and the armed forces were
expensive because individuals who went into the schemes in those
professions had low retirement ages. Until quite recently, it was
possible for a police officer who joined when they were 18 and a half
to retire at 48 and a half with a full pension. That represents an
interesting public policy issue for the Government. At a time when we
are trying to encourage people to work longer, should we expect people
in the public services who have physical and demanding jobs to be able
to access a pension relatively early on in their working lives or
should they be looking to make other changes and to take up other
employment opportunities?</div>
					<a name="07020838000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The same
things apply to other areas, such as the armed forces. Understandably,
people do not necessarily stay on in the SAS or in other strenuous jobs
until they are 65, 66 or 67. In the previous armed forces pension
scheme, it was possible to retire with a full career pension at 55.
Those who had completed 16 years as an officer or 22 years in the
ranks&#151;I am not sure why an officer was able to retire six years
earlier than somebody in the ranks, but those were the
rules&#151;were entitled to an immediately payable pension.</div>
					<a name="07020838000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are some big issues to
address, including the costs of different schemes; how long we should
expect people in the public services to work; and whether we should
continue with final salary schemes, which can be very inflexible in
terms of labour mobility, or whether we should move to career averaging
schemes. Given that we have had such an extensive debate on pensions,
it seems bizarre that we should be leaving out proper scrutiny of this
particular area.</div>
					<a name="07020838000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I should have
thought that there was a lesson to be learned from the Pensions
Commission. We brought in an independent and respected group of
individuals representing a range of opinions and experiences&#151;in
this case, the unions, business and academia&#151;to report on this
area. Such a group is in a strong position to look into contentious
issues and clear the confusion that often exists about the statistics
and the facts. It can then make recommendations for reform that can
command the sort of cross-party support that will be needed to make
such contentious changes much easier in the future.</div>
					<a name="07020838000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am little surprised that the
Government have been so conservative and so unwilling to move in this
area. I can only think that there is nervousness about the guarantees
that have been given to the public sector unions. I hope that in the
near future there will be a more positive Government line on the issue
and a greater willingness to open up the public sector schemes, in the
cause not of devaluing them to the lowest common denominator in the
private sector but of ensuring that they are affordable and sustainable
in the future. They should be fair to hard-working public sector
employees and to those working in the private sector who are paying
increasing amounts of tax to fund the public sector while the value of
their own pensions dwindles away.</div>

Penrose:
						</b> I am pleased to hear it. I will not repeat the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s excellent tour d&#146;horizon on the matter,
but I will re-emphasise one of the points he made and add some others.
It is important to remember that the commission proposed by the Select
Committee would not be some kind of quango to which a difficult
decision could be shuffled off so that it was kicked into the long
grass by the Government. We proposed something along the lines of the
Turner commission, which is a heavyweight, academic and seriously
well-qualified body, to clarify and improve the quality of debate on
pensions.</div>
					<a name="07020838000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Yeovil said, rightly, that too often this topic is
politically controversial and the so-called debate ends up being a
shuffling of people&#146;s prejudices. The Turner commission managed
to move away from that and turned the wider pensions debate into a
structured, logical, evidence-based process. It was an essential part
of the Government&#146;s managing to fashion an admirable degree of
political consensus on a very difficult issue which successive
Governments have found impossible to solve.</div>
					<a name="07020838000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Public sector
pensions are no less controversial and complex than others. The hon.
Member for Yeovil explained some of the differences between the
schemes, and I am sure there are many that he did not mention.
Constructive and careful laying of the groundwork would be an essential
first step if an intelligent decision&#151;perhaps even a
consensus&#151;were to be achieved. That is why the Select Committee
suggested the new clause, and I commend it to the Committee. I hope
that hon. Members on the Government Benches can bring themselves to
support it and that Opposition Members will also vote for the new
clause if the hon. Member for Yeovil decides to divide the Committee on
it.</div>
					<a name="07020838000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Government have been admirable in establishing the wider pensions
consensus&#151;a process in which many people participated. The new
clause gives them an opportunity to underpin and strengthen that
consensus if they get the issue right. But if they duck it, or allow a
debate on public sector pensions to be just a shuffling of
people&#146;s prejudices, there is a risk that the moral authority
that has been created around the pensions issue will be eroded. The
Government, as the employer of people who work in the public sector,
need to be seen to be putting their own house in
order.</div>

								Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): I am listening to
my hon. Friend, as is the whole Committee, with great interest. He
makes some valid points; we do not want to become two nations in
respect of pensions. Was it a consideration of the Select Committee
that a commission such as that proposed by the hon. Member for Yeovil
would be very careful about retrospective legislation? Many of our
constituents are rightly concerned about that
matter.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020838000304"></a>John
Penrose:
						</b> That is clearly one of the critical issues that a
commission such as that proposed in the new clause would have to deal
with. My hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that all of us will
have been lobbied by public sector employees of one sort or another in
the past over the question of their pensions, their pay and
conditions, and in particular the question of retrospectivity on their
accrued pension rights to
date.</div>
					<a name="07020838000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">To come back to
the point about moral authority, if the Government, as the lead public
sector employer, cannot put their own house in order, the moral
authority created through the good work that has been done in
constructing the pensions consensus that we have today will be eroded.
It will be very difficult for any Government, be it the current
Government or potentially a Conservative Government, to say credibly
that a consensus on pensions is being maintained, if with one breath
they are lecturing the voters as a whole&#151;and the private sector
world in particular&#151;about the importance of adjusting retirement
ages and so on to ensure that pension schemes are sustainable and
sensible, and with their very next breath taking a slightly different
approach to public sector pensions, or perhaps ducking an important
issue in relation to them. It is essential that there is seen to be
some fairness between public and private realms, and it is essential
for the Government to take the lead on this, because otherwise their
ability to lead the pensions debate overall will be
damaged.</div>
					<a name="07020838000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Yeovil and my hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Bedfordshire made a point that I want to emphasise as crucial above all
else. Put simply, it is that we run the risk here&#151;there are
already straws in the wind of the debate&#151;of creating a
two-nations system. We run the risk of having two systems, one public
and one private&#151;the public one being, in the minds of private
sector workers, overly generous, with a series of schemes that they
could not possibly aspire to themselves, while public sector workers
are concerned that they will end up losing out on rights that they have
fought long and hard to accumulate over time. That would be
extraordinarily divisive and would inevitably be an opportunity for the
shuffling of prejudices that we have already
described.</div>
					<a name="07020838000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">If, on the
other hand, we have a commission that is designed to shed light on this
complicated and potentially divisive issue, we shall have an
opportunity to avoid that two-nations approach. By creating the
analysis and providing the structured debate that we have enjoyed from
the Turner commission, a commission could save this Government, or a
future Conservative Government, a great deal of pain by ensuring that
any proposals that it makes&#151;to be judged by the Government on
their own merits&#151;are properly thought through, carefully
balanced, and above all fair between the private and public sectors. I
hope that the Committee will support the new
clause.</div>

						Between
the hon. Members for Yeovil and for Weston-super-Mare, we have just
been treated to a variety of arguments in favour of the commission that
the new clause advocates. I shall summarise them and then try to
respond. I sense that the argument of the hon. Member for Yeovil turned
largely on the call for more facts and, as he put it, overcoming
confusion, whereas that of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare was
slightly different and slightly more moderate&#151;it was about
improving debate on the issue. He spoke about shedding a bit of light
on the matter, and suggested that there were, perhaps, inconsistencies
between private and public sector pensions. In response, let me deal
with the arguments that have been advanced for going down this
road.</div>
					<a name="07020838000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
remind the Committee that a number of mechanisms already exist in order
to ensure the transparency of public sector pension scheme financing,
and to allow scrutiny of the schemes by Members of this House and of
course the wider public. Resource accounts covering the major public
service unfunded pension schemes are produced annually, and are
publicly available. Actuarial valuation reports for the main public
service schemes are produced every three or four years and are also
publicly available. These documents are prepared to the highest
professional standards, and the fact that they are made public ensures
transparency and provides the opportunity for detailed
scrutiny.</div>

resource accounts and scheme valuation reports, which both look at the
accrued rights of scheme members, the Government annually evaluate the
financial sustainability of spending on public service pensions in the
long-term public finance report issued by the Treasury. The latest
report, published alongside the pre-Budget report last December, makes
it clear that long-term spending on these pensions is affordable and
sustainable. It increases from the current figure of 1.5 per cent. of
GDP in 2005-06, to an expected 2 per cent. in 2055-56, which is
somewhat different from the figure given by the hon. Member for
Yeovil.</div>

						</b> Of course the information that the Minister is
describing is available, as it was for all the other sorts of pension
and the entire pensions system, which was considered by the Turner
commission, which was not established simply to review that
information, but to frame and analyse it and make proposals. That was
the vital building block on which the current pensions consensus was
constructed.</div>

						</b> Yes, but my point was that this information is
available for anyone to look at and assess&#151;indeed, they
regularly do. There is also an issue about what additional information
an independent commission could have to do its analysis that does not
already exist. I am not sure that there is any unique insight that
could be brought, because the information needed by the commission to
do its assessment and consideration is already published and available,
as I have explained.</div>

Penrose:
						</b> The point that I was trying to make is that it is
a question not of what information is available but of what the
commission does with it. The value of the Turner commission was in what
it did with the information that it received and the analysis that it
created, providing the foundation stone for the consensus.</div>

							<a name="07020838000309"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Yes, but I am afraid that I think this analogy
is quite weak when subjected to intense scrutiny, in terms of what we
asked the Turner commission to do, which was a very long-term piece of
work on a fundamental review of policy on pensions provision. That is
something quite different from crunching numbers on accounts within
public sector pensions, and I am not convinced that the analogy holds
up.</div>
					<a name="07020838000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the measures
that we already have in place to ensure the transparency of the public
sector pension schemes, it is not clear to me what an independent
commission could
add.</div>
					<a name="07020838000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind hon.
Members that we have been keeping all major public service pension
schemes under review since the pensions Green Paper was published in
2002. As a result of these reviews, reforms in the major public sector
schemes have been proposed, and they will ensure the long-term
sustainability of these public service schemes. Reforms will introduce
safeguards to ensure that schemes remain affordable and sustainable
into the future. The cost-sharing mechanism will ensure that any future
increases in costs will be shared fairly between employers and
employees. The cost-capping mechanism will impose an upper limit on the
employer&#146;s contribution and thus the potential cost to the
taxpayer. Those reforms address, I think, the point made by the hon.
Member for Weston-super-Mare about a potential two
nations.</div>
					<a name="07020838000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, I
hope that the hon. Member for Yeovil is persuaded that we have the
necessary mechanisms in place to ensure that scrutiny of public sector
schemes can and does take place. I also hope that I have assured him
that we have the right reforms in place to ensure the sustainability
and affordability of these schemes in the future. I therefore hope he
will agree to withdraw the
motion.</div>
					
					<a name="07020838000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020838000310"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his brief summary
of the Government&#146;s case. It was a little briefer than I was
anticipating, given that we are talking about 2 per cent. of the whole
of Government expenditure. He made, I think, three points, and I shall
deal very briefly with
each.</div>
					<a name="07020838000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s first point was that there was lots of information
already hanging around out there in the resource accounts that we could
all trawl through. The Work and Pensions Committee called for
an</div>
					<a name="07020838000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;independent
commission to evaluate the future terms benefits of financing public
sector pensions&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07020838000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
requires not only figures but some kind of evaluation. The hon. Member
for Weston-super-Mare put it quite well when he pointed out that the
Minister&#146;s arguments on those points could have been used
against establishing the Turner commission, and are presumably the
automatic default of all Governments when invited to set up
commissions. I hope that the Minister will not rule out for all time
going down that route, given the success of the Turner model.</div>
					<a name="07020838000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister&#146;s second
argument was that we were not talking about all that much
money&#151;it was affordable and sustainable. He talked about an
increase from 1.5 to 2 per cent. of GDP, which is slightly lower than
the figures that I have seen of 2.1 or 2.2 percent. Without
splitting hairs over the odd 0.1 or
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 415</div>0.2 percentage points, I still fail to see how he can be so casual about
sticking on an extra 0.5 per cent. of GDP when every time the poor old
hon. Member for Northampton, North pops up with a sensible and prudent
amendment that would spend the odd half a billion pounds there is
hysteria from the Front Bench. The Minister is talking about &#163;7
billion.</div>
					
					<a name="07020838000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020838000311"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the figures
I gave in relation to public sector pensions and the rise over that
period are entirely consistent with overall pension spending, which
will rise from 5 to 6.5 per cent. of GDP by
2050?</div>
					
					<a name="07020838000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020838000312"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Well, if the Minister looks at the bottom line on
state pension expenditure, as we have discussed a number of times, he
will find that the share of the state pension architecture will fall
from 6.2 to 6.1 per cent. over the next decade. At the same time, the
share of public sector pensions will go from 1.5 to 2 per cent.
according to his figures.</div>
					
					<a name="07020838000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020838000313"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Perhaps we can clarify this confusion once and
for all&#151;I hope so. The hon. Gentleman needs to focus on two
lines of the published table. At the bottom of the table, which can be
found on page 101 of the regulatory impact assessment, there is a line
entitled &#147;Total pensioner benefit&#148; that starts with 2008
at 6.2 per cent. and ends with 2050 at 7.3 per cent. He will see that
along the way there is a reduction in the figure of 6.2, as he has
mentioned, to 6.1. As we have explained to him a number of times, that
is the result of the equalisation process. If he moves three lines up
to the line entitled &#147;Total Pension Benefits&#148;, which
takes out of consideration issues to do with housing and council tax
benefit, attendance allowance and disability living allowance, and
focuses on the pension benefit element, he will see a line that begins
with 5.1 per cent. of GDP in 2008 and rises to 6.5 per cent. by 2050.
The dip to 5 per cent. lasts for only three years&#151;2010 to
2012&#151;which emphasises my point that that dip is down to the
equalisation process that will take place at that
time.</div>
					
					<a name="07020838000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020838000314"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I cannot remember now whether that was a speech or
an intervention.</div>
					
					<a name="07020838000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020838000315"></a>James

					<a name="07020838000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020838000316"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> A Lawsesque intervention, perhaps.</div>
					<a name="07020838000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I rest my case. The Minister
has acknowledged that the bottom line of page 101, which lists total
pensioner benefits, reads &#147;6.2, 6.2, 6.2&#148; and then goes
down to &#147;6.1, 6.1, 6.1&#148;. It does not increase above that
level until after 2020, and that is my point. Over that period, while
total pensioner benefits are going sideways to down, the expenditure on
public sector pensions is going up, up and away. It is no use the
Minister saying that we will strip out this or that&#151;we are
looking at the total pensioner benefits. Even if we go to &#147;Total
Pension Benefits&#148; and ignore some of the other stuff, that line
does not go up until after 2020 either. I do not think that that is his
most powerful argument.</div>
					<a name="07020838000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a contrast between the
prudence or mean-mindedness in investing in the state pensions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 416</div>architecture, which is supposed to be there for every single one of our
fellow citizens, and the totally relaxed attitude to blowing away
another 0.5, 0.6 or 0.7 per cent. of GDP when it comes to the benefits
for public sector workers, including us.</div>
					<a name="07020838000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third point is the one that
the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare made in his good speech, pointing
out that we are in danger of having two-nation pension provision in the
future. Not only will the public sector have pension schemes with much
higher levels of pension benefits and contributions, but they will be
relatively low-risk because they will be based on final salary. We
might find that people in the private sector experience the undesirable
and contrasting effect of the enormous transfer of risk from employers
and the state to individuals themselves, along with much lower levels
of contribution. If anything will undermine the sense of consensus on
pensions, it is that grave sense of injustice, which already
exists.</div>

Indeed, the Secretary of State confirmed to the Select Committee on
Work and Pensions that he recently visited Sweden, and saw for himself
the orange envelope that is distributed to pensioners there.</div>
					<a name="07020838000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our Government are looking into
the matter as a result of its having been raised in the Select

Government anticipates that DWP will continue to provide information
about different types of pension saving, and this will include personal

develop an evidence-based information strategy for communicating
information about pensions and personal accounts over the next
year.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020838000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is welcome,
because the more people know about how much pension they are likely to
end up with in retirement, the more likely it is that they will be

there is a great deal of uncertainty about how much people are going to
receive in retirement, and that adds to individuals&#146; complacency
and lack of interest in their own provision.</div>

difficult big Government IT projects can be. My hon. Friend the Member

Government were looking into the matter a few years ago, but discovered
that such was the complexity of the pensions system, with all its
means-tested benefits, that it would be extremely difficult and
dangerous for the Government to make forecasts about people&#146;s
entitlements. He said&#151;I am sure that the Minister will confirm

to clarify whether the Government&#146;s ultimate objective is to
ensure that in future people get an indication of both their state
pension entitlement and their personal entitlement, including personal
accounts. Alternatively, do the Government feel that at some stage they
might pursue the obligation in relation to the state pension forecasts,
and impose obligations on those who provide occupational and personal
pensions to provide separate forecasts for those? This is a probing new

					<a name="07020838000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
is about the pension credit disregard. It would require the Secretary
of State to bring forward a report no later than 1 April 2008 on the
labour market disincentive effects of the operation of the pension
credit system for people over the age of entitlement to pension credit
who are in employment. The new clause is a probing amendment, to see
whether the Government will respond to the recommendations of an
earlier Work and Pensions Committee report on pension credit, back in
the 2005-06 Session, in which the Committee repeated its previous
recommendation that the Government should reconsider the treatment of
earnings and pension credit, taking particular account of the number of
pension credit claimants who might wish to engage in paid work. The
point is that currently large numbers of people who pass the age of 60
have a pension credit entitlement. The disregard for work for those
people who receive pension credit is &#163;5 a week, but it has not
been changed for quite a number of years.</div>
					<a name="07020838000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">An important part of the
Government&#146;s solution to low incomes in retirement seems to be a
quite reasonable expectation and aspiration that people should seek to
work on for longer, at ages that are traditionally associated with
retirement. It seems ironic that, because of the operation of the
means-tested pensions system and the pension credit, there is quite a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 420</div>
						powerful disincentive for people in that situation
to carry on working. The Select Committee recommended that the
disregard, which has remained static for so long, should be reviewed.
If it is not to be reviewed, it would be interesting to know whether
the Government have any other ideas about how to remove the
disincentives for people in those
circumstances.</div>

					<a name="07020838000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
relates to state pension age equalisation. Men aged between 60 and 65
get pension credit because we have to make it available to men and
women at the same age. We had to choose between the ages of 60 and 65
and we decided to go for 60.</div>
					<a name="07020838000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Tuesday, we had a good
debate on the overall issue of the state pension age, but I want to
correct something that I said during it. The hon. Member for
Weston-super-Mare asked me to confirm whether the projected increase in
life expectancy for non-manual workers, based on the DWP&#146;s
extrapolation from ONS data, meant that the gap in life expectancy
between manual and non-manual workers was projected to narrow. I
replied that the gap had narrowed in the past and, if extrapolated
forward, would continue to narrow. I am afraid that that was completely
wrong. The truth is that the life expectancy gap between manual and
non-manual workers has grown in the past 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 421</div>few years; I was looking at the projected decrease in the life
expectancy gap between people in Scotland and
England.</div>
					<a name="07020838000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						ONS
projections indicate that life expectancy for the average man in
Scotland will increase more rapidly than elsewhere in the UK. Although
the life expectancy gap between men in England and in Scotland
increased between 1980 and 2006, it is projected to narrow between now
and 2050. The figures suggest that longevity may improve more quickly
among manual workers, whose life expectancy is currently below the
average, although I would not wish categorically to state that that
will be the case, given the absence of robust
data.</div>
					<a name="07020838000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Let
me return to the substance of the new clause. As I said, pension credit
has to be available to men and women at the same age and is therefore
available to men at age 60. Clearly, the availability of the guarantee
credit element of the pension credit can be perceived as a disincentive
to work for men aged 60 to 64. Although unemployed men in that age
group are technically of working age and are entitled to claim
jobseeker&#146;s allowance, they are also entitled to choose to claim
pension credit. By so doing, they bypass the conditionality elements of
jobseeker&#146;s allowance that would require them to engage actively
with the labour market.</div>
					<a name="07020838000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The income that such men
receive is less than what they would earn from working full time, by as
much as &#163;46 per week for those working 30 hours per week at the
minimum wage. However, the pension credit system enables men over 60,
some of whom may face considerable barriers to work, to withdraw from
the labour market. As I said, pension credit is available for men at
age 60 because of the provisions on equal treatment with women in the
State Pension Credit Act 2002. That Act links the qualifying
age for the guarantee element of pension credit to women&#146;s state
pension age, so by 2020 pension credit will no longer be available to
working-age men and its labour market disincentive effect will have
been nullified.</div>
					<a name="07020838000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s policies for increasing the labour market
participation of older workers centre on increasing the choice and
opportunities for individuals to work and plan for retirement. In line
with that approach, pension credit is one of the qualifying benefits
for the new deal 50-plus. So although pension credit claimants are not
required to search for work, they are free to do so and are eligible
for extra support through Jobcentre Plus.</div>
					<a name="07020838000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The hon.
Member for Yeovil raises an important issue: extending working lives is
an important goal. If we succeed in increasing the employment of older
workers by 1 million, we will also increase GDP significantly and
reduce poverty. I understand the valid reasons behind his amendment. I
shall be happy to come back to the House if there are further
developments, although I do not think that a full report would be
justified at this stage. As we have said before, we are constantly
considering our policies on extending working lives. If the hon. Member
for Yeovil or the Conservative Front Bench have any suggestions, we
would be happy to look at them. With that, I urge him to withdraw the

points&#151;it all sounded quite exciting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 422</div>and unexpected. I was anticipating the normal knockabout stuff. We heard
a degree of discomfort from the Minister. He said that this slightly
anomalous situation will be extinguished in the fullness of time by the
women&#146;s pension age equalising with the male pension age; in the
meantime we are left with the slightly odd situation where the
Government are trying to encourage people into employment but allowing
them to take the pension credit from age 60 and, through the operation
of the means-tested benefit system, creating a disincentive to their
taking employment.</div>
					<a name="07020838000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister is clearly in some
discomfort as a result of the tension between the reality and
Government policy. He did not say anything about the possibility of
increasing the disregard, unless I missed that. It does not look as if
he wants to intervene on me now to clarify that. I will simply have to
accept that the door was not slammed completely in my face. I will have
to pretend that it was a triumph and I will return to this at a later
stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): I beg to move,
That the clause be read a second
time.</div>
					<a name="07020838000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
touches on people&#146;s inability in retirement to get the
carer&#146;s allowance&#151;an issue that has been of great concern
to my constituents, especially women. The change proposed in the new
clause could be made by regulation, but it is important to debate the
subject now.</div>
					<a name="07020838000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I understand
the reasons for saying that people on the state pension should not get
carer&#146;s allowance because it is not payment for caring, but
replacement of lost earnings. As pensioners are judged not to be
working, they cannot get replacement of lost earnings. That is bitterly
resented both by people who have looked after their spouses for a
number of years and who lose their carer&#146;s allowance once they
reach retirement age and by people looking after disabled children. I
have had a number of cases of women who are looking after adult
children with learning difficulties, mental health problems, or
physical disabilities.</div>
					<a name="07020838000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">People feel a great sense of
injustice. For a number of years they have cared for others. They have
often given up work and made it their life&#146;s work to look after
a spouse, but suddenly when they reach retirement age they hit the
buffers and their income goes down, often just at the point when the
need more money. At the same time, if they have mobility impairment,
they cannot get access to the mobility components of disability living
allowance.</div>
					<a name="07020838000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Let
me give an example of someone who is particularly hard hit by this
combination of factors. A woman in my constituency had spent all her
working life with Barclays. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 423</div>She gave up work early to look after her husband, who was in very ill
health. I cannot remember exactly what her benefits were, but she
certainly got carer&#146;s allowance. When she reached the pension
age she lost that. At about the same time the car that she used to
drive her husband to his hospital appointments broke down completely.
She came to me because she could not afford to get it repaired. She had
all those difficulties getting to the appointments and her income had
gone down because she had lost part of her allowances. In struggling to
work out what to do, it also transpired that she had very severe
mobility impairment herself, because she had profound disabilities to
her feet. However, she had never got that assessed and had never
claimed any disability benefits, which she would almost certainly have
got. Because she was also retired, she could not get those benefits,
either.</div>
					<a name="07020838000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The mere fact
of reaching a certain age, plus the accident and the car breaking down,
had turned her from being the mainstay of her family and for a
neighbour who was ill as well, with a modest but reasonable level of
income, to somebody whose income had gone down, who had lost her
mobility, and who was completely unable to access any help from the
state, purely because of her age. She resented that most
bitterly.</div>

							<a name="07020838000354"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> It is extremely helpful to have a real-life
example, but will the hon. Lady explain in a little more detail why
that lady&#146;s income had gone down? Was she not in receipt of a
pension or pension credit that might in some way have compensated for
the loss of her carer&#146;s
allowance?</div>
					
					<a name="07020838000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020838000355"></a>Ms
Keeble:
						</b> I was going to come to that. No, she was not in
receipt of that. I cannot recall all the details of her exact
circumstances, but the two things that really grated with her were,
first, that she had lost her carer&#146;s allowance and, secondly,
that she had gone through her life with a very severe disability that
she had, quite remarkably, managed to hide. When she was driving the
car, her feet could not reach the pedals properly; she needed a
properly adapted mobility vehicle, so how she managed to drive
everybody around to all the appointments, goodness knows. However,
purely because of her age, it was impossible to start to resolve any of
the difficulties. The problem was not just her income, but the
well-being of a number of people who were dependent on her and who were
affected by what happened. She was one of the people who found herself
most aggrieved about the retirement age cut-off point for certain
benefits.</div>
					<a name="07020838000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Quite a lot
of the debates throughout this Committee stage have been about
people&#146;s changing lives and circumstances, particularly those of
women, and the way in which the pension system should adapt to become
fit for purpose and to meet people&#146;s needs in those changing
circumstances. Among the arguments that have been made is, first, that
there should be equity and that women&#146;s role in the workplace
and as carers should be recognised much more substantially, and
secondly, that people should go on working for longer and should not
regard retirement as some sort of cliff edge that they go off and spend
the rest of their lives as semi-citizens.</div>
					<a name="07020838000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I welcome
that, and certainly my constituents have always had the most remarkable
work ethic. Both men 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 424</div>and women have worked and have done so post-retirement, so it seems
particularly unfair that we are saying to people that they should not
regard retirement age or state pension age as the end of their lives
and they should carry on working and participating&#151;we even have
a new deal for older workers&#151;but we then say, &#147;By the
way, you are not going to get carer&#146;s allowance, and if you
suddenly become disabled, and your mobility decreases, you are not
going to be able to get help there.&#148; That seems to be an
absolutely basic inconsistency.</div>
					<a name="07020838000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My hon.
Friend the Minister will remember that, in response to my amendment
that proposed spending an extra &#163;14 billion, he said that the
research had shown that people wanted the biggest increase in income
directly after retirement. That surprised me, because I thought that
people wanted more money when they were older, but that is what he said
the research showed. Having a cut-off point for carer&#146;s
allowance and disability benefits therefore seems to be particularly
counter-productive. On the mobility components, people now have the
positive expectation that they will be mobile when older. They do not
expect to reach retirement, put their feet up and never drive a car
again.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07020838000274"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07020838000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rule about
the overlapping benefits runs counter to that. I understand that, of
course, people can get the carer&#146;s component of pension
credit&#151;some 200,000 people do already. It would be helpful if my
hon. Friend would say whether there is any information on
under-claiming because, until this Committee, I did not know about the
disability or carer&#146;s components. I have done a huge amount of
take-up work in my constituency in order to encourage people to claim,
and if there is under-claiming, we need to ensure that people know
about those
components.</div>
					<a name="07020838000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
everybody gets pension credit and some only get the savings element. I
am not sure whether the carer&#146;s component can go to those who
only get the savings credit. However, quite often, although a husband
might be disabled or ill when older, he could still have a good income
from a work pension. It by no means follows that the carer, or couple,
will always be entitled to the carer&#146;s component of pension
credit. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would respond to that
point. In particular, will he explain the rationale for the cliff edge
that means that when someone retires, although they might be expected
or encouraged to continue to work, they will not continue to benefit
from support to replace lost
earnings?</div>

						</b> The hon. Lady is, of course, generally right, but
in our advanced scientific times, we do read the occasional story in
the newspapers of such things happening. However, I take the general
point that she is quite rightly
making.</div>
					<a name="07020838000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
specific amounts of money, I understand that in 2006-07, carer&#146;s
allowance is &#163;49.65 a week, which is a significant income for
many pensioners; losing it would be a real blow. As the hon. Lady said,
it is possible for those entitled to carer&#146;s allowance to
receive the carer&#146;s addition in pension credit, which I think is
&#163;26.35 a week, when they become entitled to a state retirement
pension. That represents a net loss of income of &#163;26.30 a week.
One would hope that that would be more than made up by the receipt of
state retirement pension&#151;although that will obviously vary from
case to case&#151;or, perhaps, by the receipt of pension credit. Will
the Minister, when he responds, address what action the Government are
taking to help more people take up their entitlement to the
carer&#146;s addition within pension credit?</div>
					<a name="07020838000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">That issue has been raised by
the Select Committee, when Jim Dickson of Lancashire county
council&#146;s welfare rights service gave evidence on that point and
specifically called for greater liaison between the carer&#146;s
allowance unit and the Pension Service. He also made the practical
point that, in order to be entitled to the carer&#146;s addition in
pension credit, pensioners have to fill in the complete carer&#146;s
allowance form as if they were applying for that allowance, when they
are obviously not entitled to it if already in receipt of state
retirement pension. Perhaps a simplified form could be organised for
people who are already in receipt of state retirement

						</b> No; that would be a huge spending commitment. If
the hon. Gentleman is proposing to get rid of the overlapping benefits
rule, I hope that he will tell us how he would fund that. We would
probably all love to go that far, but it is a question of cost, is it
not? So, I am not proposing that but focusing on the important issue of
ensuring maximum take-up of entitlement&#151;for, as the hon. Member
for Northampton, North quite properly said, many people do not realise
that they can get the carer&#146;s addition. They know that they are
not entitled to carer&#146;s allowance and think,
&#147;That&#146;s it&#148;; many then suffer a loss of income
that need not be as severe as it is. The issue is: how can we get the
carer&#146;s allowance unit and the Pension Service dovetailing
together to ensure greater take-up? I look forward to hearing what the
Minister has to say.</div>

Pension Service plans to introduce an additional question in the
pension credit application process to identify relevant carer
responsibilities in order to invite the customer, where appropriate, to
claim carer&#146;s allowance using a new, shortened claim pack

						My hon.
Friend the Member for Northampton, North is a long-standing and
passionate campaigner on the issue of carers, and I am grateful to her
for giving us an important opportunity to debate carer&#146;s
allowance. This goes to the heart of what carer&#146;s allowance is
for. Some people regard it as a payment for caring, but that is not the
case when it is, in fact, a benefit that provides income maintenance
for people who are unable to work full-time because of their caring
commitments; that is an important distinction.</div>
					<a name="07020838000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">When Barbara Castle introduced
what was then invalid care allowance she told the House that it
would</div>
					<a name="07020838000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide new,
non-means-tested help for those of working age who are deprived of the
opportunity to earn their living and who have no rights under existing
contributory insurance schemes.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>,

					<a name="07020838000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Carer&#146;s allowance, the successor
benefit to the ICA, is designed to provide an income to a person who,
because of caring commitments, cannot work full-time. Conceptually,
that puts it on a par with other benefits that step in to provide help
when, for some reason, the mainstay of an income from work is not
available. There are several benefits, such as the widowed
parent&#146;s allowance and incapacity benefit, for which the outward
contingency may differ but whose purpose, replacing income, is a
constant. In those circumstances the overlapping benefit rules operate
so as not to duplicate
payment.</div>
					<a name="07020838000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
describing a fundamental principle of insurance. If my hon.
Friend&#146;s car were stolen and burned, she would not expect to
receive the value of the car twice over just because she had had it
insured against both fire and theft. In the same way, a person 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 427</div>not working for two reasons&#151;because of caring commitments and
because of having reached state pension age&#151;should not expect to
be paid twice in full. I appreciate the fact that an individual can
work and still receive the state pension, but that does not alter the
fact that the purpose of the state pension is to provide an income in
retirement.</div>

						</b> Does my hon. Friend accept that a lot of women do
not get the state pension? They might have got carer&#146;s allowance
but not qualified for the state pension. The idea that when they retire
they necessarily get the state pension does not work, which is one
reason why there is such a grievance among so many women about the fact
that when they hit retirement age they hit the buffers and lose
everything.</div>

						</b> At the risk of having to correct myself again, if
carer&#146;s allowance gives people more than they would get from the
state pension and they are not entitled to pension credit, they can
keep their carer&#146;s allowance. In answer to my hon.
Friend&#146;s main point, which was valid, the majority of women in
that situation would be able to claim pension credit, including the
carer&#146;s element of it. That is how we deal with the situation of
women such as those whom she talked about. I hope that I have avoided

consider, which has driven the debate on women&#146;s pensions, is
equity. If a woman works but does not qualify for a state pension, she
might then lose her carer&#146;s allowance. Although her husband
might have a reasonable pension entitlement, she will therefore have
little or no income despite having been completely financially
independent for all her adult
life.</div>

thrusts of the Bill is to give women independence in retirement. My
point is still valid: a woman in that situation would at least be able
to keep getting the same amount of carer&#146;s allowance. If her
state pension were less than she was getting in carer&#146;s
allowance, she would keep the latter. We have introduced
that.</div>

assure my hon. Friend that we are sympathetic to her aim of recognising
the contribution of carers. Indeed, a large part of the Bill is about
doing exactly that. I am sure that the debate on the matter will
continue on Report and in another place. The carer&#146;s credit
provisions that we are making and the reduction in the number of
qualifying years to 30 will make a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 428</div>great difference to people who care, whether for children or for those
who are sick or disabled. As a consequence of the Bill it will be
possible to build up a full entitlement to the state pension entirely
through caring contributions throughout one&#146;s life. That is an
important
change.</div>

					<a name="07020838000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said this
morning that a couple of dogs had not yet barked in the Committee. This
is one of the two dogs&#151;the other was the issue of public sector
pensions. I was tempted not to raise this particular issue because it
has not been fundamental to the debate on the Bill and was a relatively
modest part of the Pensions Commission proposals. Yet when we consider
how much money is at stake in pension tax relief and how devastating
the Pensions Commission&#146;s second report was in its criticism of
the Government on this matter, it would seem a little odd to complete
our debate without at least touching upon this issue. In that report,
the Pensions Commission concluded that pension tax relief is costly,
poorly focused and not well understood. It is also true&#151;and I
anticipate that we will hear this from the Minister in a few
moments&#151;that the Pensions Commission said that it would be quite
complex to change pension tax relief and did not make recommendations
for immediate changes.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 429</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020838000378"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that the report
actually said, on page 319, that it was &#147;very
complex&#148;?</div>
					
					<a name="07020838000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020838000379"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Yes, it said it was very complex but also that it
would not recommend changing it in the short term&#151;in other
words, in the next few years. It did not say that it was so complex
that people of the Minister&#146;s brilliance and all those in the
civil service, the Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions
could not start doing some work on this in order to produce a better
system.</div>
					<a name="07020838000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, I
hope that the Minister will not use that as an excuse not to take this
issue full-on, although I fear that he might. I anticipate a speech in
which he will say that this is a matter for Treasury Ministers, not for
his Department. He will say that this is extremely complex and
difficult to deal with, that other changes to the regime of pension tax
relief are taking place and that it would be imprudent to introduce
other measures at the same time, as it might destabilise them. I have
seen this speech outside; I have read it.</div>
					<a name="07020838000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite all that, I will not be
knocked off course. Not only did the Pensions Commission come up with
this devastating criticism, but the right hon. Member for Birkenhead
(Mr. Field), in his evidence to the Work and Pensions
Committee, said he very much hoped that this issue would be pursued.
The Select Committee itself asked the Government to look into
that.</div>
					<a name="07020838000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I want to
find out from the Government today is not the bit about the
complexity&#151;because I know that bit, have already read it and am
probably going to hear it again&#151;but whether the Minister agrees
with the conclusion of the Pensions Commission report that this tax
relief is costly, poorly focused and not well understood. The main
issue will not be whether it is costly or well understood, because we
already have information on that, but how focused, fair or unfair it
is. We have Government figures on the cost of pension tax relief and
they are pretty significant, which is another reason why we could not
leave this whole debate without airing the issue.</div>
					<a name="07020838000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2005-06, the net cost of
pension tax relief, after clawing back the money on tax from pensions
in payment, will be approximately &#163;14.3 billion. That must be
something north of 1 per cent. of GDP, which is quite a lot of money.
That figure has increased by almost &#163;2 billion since 2004-05. It
is up by something like &#163;5 billion from 2001-02, which is a
pretty significant increase.</div>
					<a name="07020838000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">If some of this week&#146;s
newspaper reports are correct that the demand for pension products is
increasing as a consequence of the recent simplification of pension tax
relief, we may find that the net cost of pension tax relief continues
to rise quite rapidly in the future. Therefore, it is quite a large
element of total tax relief and very large in relation to this whole
debate.</div>
					<a name="07020838000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also know
from the Pensions Commission&#146;s excellent second report that
pension tax relief is not well understood. Page 317 of the report
provides two very useful charts, which show basic rate and higher rate
taxpayers&#146; understanding of how pension tax relief works. Almost
half of basic-rate taxpayers had no idea about their entitlement to tax
relief on their pension contributions, 26 per cent. thought it would be
better 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 430</div>than the basic rate and only 17 per cent. got it right at the basic
rate. Higher rate taxpayers, as one might expect, were a little better
informed about the enormous benefits of tax relief to them, but even
there only 28 per cent. got it right that they would get a 40
per cent. rate of relief. Almost the same figure as for basic rate
taxpayers, 27 per cent., could come up with no idea at all about what
the tax relief was
worth.</div>
					<a name="07020838000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that we
can establish that tax relief is costly and that it is not very well
understood. The issue is whether it is well focused and fair. Before I
get an intervention, I should point out that it is a reasonable
presumption within our tax system and, as I understand it, most other
tax systems of developed economies that there should not be a double
taxation of pensions. One should not be taxed on the income used to put
into a pension and again on money as it is drawn out. That principle,
in one way or another, is embedded in our whole savings regime.
However, the Pensions Commission&#146;s point was that we do not seem
to have that kind of tax neutrality in relation to our existing system
in the UK but, rather, an unbalanced system that seems to give greater
relief to one proportion of the population. In crude terms, something
like 50 per cent. of the tax relief goes to the top 10 per cent. of
income earners and 25 per cent. to 2.5 per cent. of the income earners.
That would not necessarily matter, if that simply reflected the amount
of participation in pension savings by those two groups and the need
therefore to neutralise the effects on taxation. However, it seems to
be not simply neutralising, but actually skewing the tax system in a
way that benefits people on very high
incomes.</div>
					<a name="07020838000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">We already
know that in this country we have an extraordinarily unequal
distribution of income, wealth and opportunity. There are question
marks about whether social mobility has been declining over recent
years. So, it is very striking and also bizarre and extraordinary that
we should have a tax system that the Pensions Commission considers to
be skewed in favour of those people with the higher incomes. The second
report of the Pensions Commission points out this extraordinary
situation, which we have been discussing throughout the Bill, where
those people on very low incomes potentially suffer enormous withdrawal
of benefits in retirement and therefore may have their incentives to
save cut away from them. In the earlier debate the hon. Member for
Eastbourne talked about the effect of means-testing essentially
operating as a tax on
saving.</div>
				
					<a name="07020838000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the same time, to those people who already have a lot of money, more is
given. There is an extraordinary graph on page 313 of the Pensions
Commission&#146;s second report, which shows the impact of the tax
advantages on returns from savings. Looking at it, one will see an
extraordinary rise in the tax advantage of saving for those people as
they go over the threshold for upper-rate tax. The Pensions Commission
made the issue very clear on page 312 of the
report:</div>
					<a name="07020838000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
benefits of this significant cost to the Exchequer are...extremely
unequally
distributed&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020838000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continued:</div>
					<a name="07020838000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;But
the overall message is clear: the beneficial impact of tax relief on
the rates of return of savings is much higher for higher-rate taxpayers
than for basic rate or lower-rate taxpayers. And this is not simply
because tax relief undoes the higher 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 431</div>detrimental effect on rates of return which higher tax rates would
impose on non-tax privileged saving: higher tax rate payers can achieve
through pension savings higher post-tax rates of return than those
enjoyed by basic-rate
taxpayers&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07020838000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
includes those at the bottom end of the income distribution.</div>
					<a name="07020838000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a bizarre, eccentric
system. It not only uses tax relief on pensions to give a special bonus
to those who already have a lot, rather than just neutralising the tax
consequences, but it disincentivises saving among people with very
little money, because there is so much means-testing. Enormous
incentives to save are being given to people at the upper end of the
income distribution. It seems bizarre that we should be giving
massively generous incentives to affluent people while creating
disincentives for people at the bottom end of the income
distribution</div>
					<a name="07020838000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">James
Purnell:</b> I am following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech with
interest. I should be even more interested if he were to tell us what
his policy was.</div>
					<a name="07020838000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">Mr. Laws:</b> I
shall move on to that. I am encouraged to go further. We published a
policy last year&#151;I am sorry that the Minister missed
it&#151;to reorganise tax relief on pensions so that tax relief is
paid at the basic rate and the savings are recycled as a cut in the
basic rate of tax. If the Minister has an alternative we will listen to
it, because there are other ways of better using the money.</div>
					<a name="07020838000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our policy would avoid the
current situation, from which most Members of this House will probably
benefit. We can take the enormous benefit of 40 per cent. tax relief as
we save, in the knowledge that many of us will be paying only the basic
rate of 22 per cent. when we retire. A large proportion of the people
who receive tax relief at 40 per cent. will pay only the basic rate of
tax in retirement.</div>
					<a name="07020838000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Figure 7.8 on
page 313 of the Pensions Commission&#146;s second report is an
interesting graph that shows the average tax rate for people in
different income bands in retirement. The average rate of about 20 per
cent. applies to people on incomes of up to about &#163;55,000 a
year. Someone who has been a higher rate taxpayer during their working
life has to earn an awful lot of money in retirement to miss out on
that enormous freebie from saving in pension accounts. Notwithstanding
all the criticisms that have been made of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer for tinkering with tax relief on pensions, I should have
thought that removing that anomaly, which enormously advantages the
advantaged, would be extremely sensible for a Labour Government who
are, on the face of it, passionate about social justice.</div>
					<a name="07020838000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that the Minister will
say that such changes are far too complicated, but in its contribution

Pensions Commission as having drawn a line under the issue with its
conclusion that resolving it will be complex. We should note instead
its criticism of the unfocused nature of the existing relief. In the
Minister&#146;s reply, I hope to hear an acknowledgment that tax
relief is badly focused and that the door should not be closed to
consideration of that
issue.</div>

						</b> I should be very interested if the hon. Gentleman
would again go through the proposals. I am unsure about the detail. I
understand that pension relief on the contributions would be capped at
the basic rate. Then would the money saved be provided to broaden the
band that is only taxed at 10 per cent., or would thresholds be
increased? Or would it go into other forms of support for
pensioners&#146;
income?</div>

								Mr.
Laws:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising that
issue. There are a myriad different ways in which tax relief could be
redesigned. It could simply be redesigned so that it was given to every
member of the community at the same rate, rather like the proposal for
personal accounts where everybody gets the same rates of pension tax
relief. It could be that the money saved in that way is used to
incentivise saving in some other way. Our proposal is to restrict
relief to the basic rate and then to funnel that money back into
reducing the basic rate of tax. But it could be used for many other
things.</div>

this.</div>
					<a name="07020838000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the

tax relief as badly focused, but clarify the purpose of pensions tax
relief and whether it is to give incentives to save or whether it
simply seeks to deliver neutrality in the tax
system.</div>

announcement there will be another one along at any time, probably
saying exactly the opposite. I am grateful for his confirmation that
indeed his party&#146;s policy is the same as it was before the last

						</b> Yes, well, we await some of the detail. I am
amazed, if that is the case, that the hon. Gentleman has not had the
courage of his convictions because, if he does not mind my saying so,
his rather mealy-mouthed new clause only talks about having a report
whereas it seems to me he claims to have a thoroughly worked out,
hard-edged policy, which I think he might just have managed to form
into a new clause, but there we are. There is always Report stage to
consider.</div>
					<a name="07020838000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Speaking for
my party, at this crucial stage where the last thing we want to do is
remove incentives to people to save into pensions for their retirement,
to start fiddling with and reducing the tax relief available is exactly
the wrong way to go. The hon. Gentleman is wrong when he says it is not
understood. It may be true, as he indicated, that a lot of people do
not understand all the complexities and the detail but they do
understand the central point that if they pay into a pension fund they
get tax relief.</div>

							<a name="07020838000390"></a>Mr.

						</b> Well, I agree with Lord Turner&#146;s point
that it would be, I think the phrase was, &#147;very complex to do
anything about it&#148; but it is a luxury available to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s party to have very complex policies because they are
never going to be called upon to put them into effect in the real
world.</div>
					<a name="07020838000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">We on the
Conservative side of the Committee would have great reluctance in
supporting any such proposal, even if it were actually contained in the
new clause. We think it will not be well received at all among the many
higher earners out there who are aware that there is tax relief and may
well for that reason be saving in their pension. This is at a time when
we are really worried as a party that, if anything, people need more
encouragement to save into pensions, particularly with the coming of
personal accounts and the whole issue of levelling down, which I will
not go into again.</div>

						</b> And indeed in Yeovil. I also look forward to
seeing the detailed calculations that the hon. Gentleman will provide
at his seminar. He rather gave the impression that he was going to be
able to pocket &#163;14 billion from this. As he well knows, the
higher rate element of it accounts for only about a quarter, and there
is no guarantee that the savings will materialise because, people being
what they are, having lost one form of tax-advantaged saving, they
might well find another to allow themselves to make provision for the
future. Perhaps, therefore, all he will achieve is to shift money from
pension saving into another form of tax-advantaged saving, perhaps
housing. Given that the thrust of our debates has been to encourage
pension saving, I am not sure that that would necessarily be a
brilliant policy.</div>
					<a name="07020838000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am also tempted to read out to the Committeepage 319 of the

so, Mr. Gale, but I shall just send it to the hon. Gentleman
again so that he can read the bits that do not suit his argument quite

						</b> I did not have time to find the quote. However,
the hon. Gentleman has again demonstrated that he is cleverer than the
Pensions Commission and, indeed, John Hills, who looked into the matter
in some detail. John Hills gave a lecture on this, which was posted on
the PPI website&#151;that is not the right quote. Here we are: the
Pensions Commission said that it would be extremely complex to make the
changes so long as there is a significant element of
DB&#151;defined-benefit&#151;provision in the
system.</div>
					<a name="07020838000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point is
that, as is explained on page 319, which all hon. Members will read
before the hon. Gentleman&#146;s seminar, making the changes would
deal a potentially fatal blow to defined-benefit schemes because of the
extreme complexity that would be involved, the fact that individual tax
obligations would have to be calculated&#151;for every member, we
think&#151;and the fact that members who had significant increases in
their salaries might be required to pay significant in-year tax
bills.</div>

						</b> We are implementing the Pensions
Commission&#146;s recommendations pretty much in full, and they did
not include making that change. If the hon. Gentleman wants to make
policy suggestions that are potentially very damaging to final salary
schemes, that is very much at odds with his previous concerns during
our proceedings about levelling down. We do not think that that would
be the right approach, and in that we follow the Pensions Commission. I
suspect that he is trying to find a sum of money that he can recycle
into something that enables him to make a simple claim about basic rate
tax. I am sure that the money will be spent in a number of other areas
as well, such as on increasing the basic state pension, and it might
fund some other policy suggestions that the hon. Gentleman has made. I
do not think that that is a practical solution, and neither did the
Pensions Commission, and I urge him to withdraw the
motion.</div>

							<a name="07020838000400"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> It has been an interesting debate, and this is the
last new clause. I was not going to propose it until I got stuck at
Basingstoke station on the way home one day, and had nothing better to
do than read the Pensions Commission report. I then decided that it
would be negligent to end this Committee without airing serious
criticisms of the pension tax system. I anticipated, and wanted to
flush out, just how conservative both sides were going to be. I wanted
to test out whether all this new model Conservatism and Toynbeeism
really added up to much. We found out from the hon. Member for
Eastbourne that it does not. It comes down to a defence of traditional
privilege: the traditional privilege of those highest earners in
society who are tax-privileged and are getting an enormous subsidy to
save in pensions. The Conservative party is still determined to defend
that.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020838000402"></a>Mr.

						</b> The hon. Gentleman should know that the people who
are upper rate taxpayers are among the 10 per cent. richest and the
most affluent people in the country. The idea that we should have a
pension system that gives powerful disincentives to the poorest people
in Britain not to save, and gives enormous subsidies and incentives to
the richest to save is crackpot. Eventually, whether or not the other
parties agree, we will end up with a grand consensus based on this
little phrase from Lord Turner that we have got to change the
system.</div>

Eastbourne and the Minister eating their words and commending me for my
proposal to end the immoral and wasteful system of tax relief. I detect
that I may not at the moment

like to thank our Clerk, who has striven manfully to keep our
amendments in order, the <i class="I">Hansard</i> writers, the police and the
security officers and all the officials who have kindly supplied the
Minister sometimes with the right quotations and sometimes not. They
have supplied us all with loads of information and with loads of
letters, but not all at the same time. I should like to pay an especial
tribute to the Committee Office scrutiny unit who have laboured long

to thank all my hon. Friends and all members of the Committee. I should
particularly like to thank my hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Bedfordshire for his all hard work on the Committee and my own Whip
who, sadly, is not here. I should like to thank my hon. Friend the
Member for The Wrekin, who is not here either. I see from his biography
that he is a member of the Miniature Schnauzer Club of Great Britain. I
assume that he is out walking his dog today. In addition to his
activities as a Whip, my hon. Friend is a bomb disposal

					<a name="07020838000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have been
very honoured to have two very good Ministers. I looked on his website

said:</div>
					<a name="07020838000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You need
to keep the belief that there is far more good in the world than
evil.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020838000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us hope that
this Committee confirms that view of life. The hon. Member for Solihull
has experience as a prison governor and I hope that this experience has
not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 437</div>been too different. We established in a previous debate that the
earnings link was broken when the Minister for Pensions Reform was
still in primary school. There has been a great historical sweep in our
debates.</div>
					<a name="07020838000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Government Whip for whipping the Committee with an admirably light
touch. The visits to the Liberal Democrat Santa&#146;s grotto have
been interesting; I hope that the Minister has kept a running tally of
the spending commitments, the prize for which must go to the hon.
Member for Northampton, North who came up with a modest, probing
amendment that would have cost &#163;14 billion. I wonder whether she
has considered joining the Liberal Democrats.</div>
					<a name="07020838000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Yeovil
seemed determined to upset every aspect of the electorate, particularly
higher earners, except, of course, for the Christian Brethren who, as
he conceded, cannot vote for him or, indeed, for anybody
else.</div>
					<a name="07020838000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I had
a letter from the Minister this morning that contained a sentence that
should send us on our way cheerful and happy. It

rather more shallow and we shall return to some of the issues on

for Eastbourne throughout the proceedings and for ensuring that we have
been able to use all of our 12 allotted sittings. It would have been a
shame had we not been able to do so. Without his contribution, we would
definitely not have used a number of the sittings that the Conservative
Front-Bench Members asked
for.</div>
					<a name="07020838000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also like
to thank our Whip, who, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne said, is the
crème de la crème of Committee whipping. He is a most
experienced Whip and has dealt with us with a very light touch. He only
once said to me that I had made rather heavy going of a clause, which I
took to be a nuclear warning given his normal approach to such matters.
I can only apologise for new clause 2, which I know is embedded in the
memory of your co-Chair, Mr. Gale.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column438" />Column number: 439</div>
					<a name="07020838000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">In particular, I would like to
thank my officials, who have done a brilliant job. If we have appeared
like a duck across the surface of the water without too much stress, it
is only because they were furiously paddling underneath&#151;they
stayed up till all hours of the night dealing with people&#146;s
amendments. I hope that the Committee will join me in thanking them, as
well as the drafters of the Bill. They have given us a Bill far more
comprehensible than is normally the
case.</div>
					<a name="07020838000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to
thank the Clerk and all his staff as well as the members of
<i class="I">Hansard</i>. Not least, I shall finish by thanking all the
organisations that provided so many of the briefings and amendments,
and the police, who have prevented great hordes of Bosnians, the
Plymouth Brethren, mothers over 60 and, in the last sitting, a whole
horde of upper-rate taxpayers from invading the Committee. Without
their protection the Room might have been stormed, although I cannot
see them&#151;ah, there they are, fighting off hordes of higher-rate
tax-paying
nurses!</div>
					<a name="07020838000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
thank you, Mr. Gale and Mr. Taylor, for your
brisk and effective chairmanship. I wish everyone a very good weekend
and half-term
break.</div>

							<a name="07020838000408"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> It is one of the wonderful eccentricities of
Committee work that we always end with five minutes of points of order
that are totally out of order. But then, as points of order on the
Floor of the House are usually out of order, I suppose that it is a
convention that the House has established. As we have been completely
out of order, I am interested to note that the Committee feels that I
have been tolerant. Clearly, I shall have to look to my
laurels.</div>
					<a name="07020838000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a more
serious note, I add my thanks to the staff and Officers of the House
without whom we could not do our work. I also thank every member of the
Committee for making this a congenial and constructive
event.</div>
					<a name="07020838000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">

amended, to be
reported.</i>

rose at twenty-four minutes past Three
o&#146;clock.</i>
