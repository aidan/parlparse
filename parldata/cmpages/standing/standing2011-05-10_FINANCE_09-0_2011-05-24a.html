                           </strong> May I welcome you to the Chair, Mr Hood? It may
help the Committee if I run through the background to schedule 8, and
then talk about the purpose of our amendments. Schedule 8, which is
introduced by clause 35, makes changes to ensure that all recipients of
employer-supported child care who join schemes on or after 6 April 2011
receive the same amount of income tax relief as basic rate taxpayers.
Reform in this area was announced in 2009 by the previous Government,
and this Government also accept that changes to the system will make it
fairer, because it will ensure that individuals do not receive a
greater amount of tax relief on employer-supported child care just by
virtue of being higher earners. Employer-supported child care allows
participating employers to offer their employees support with their
child care costs, and it supports the Government’s policy on
providing support for child care costs to encourage parents to
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
latest HMRC modelling suggests that around 450,000 parents are members
of employer-supported child care schemes, and about 40% of them are
higher or additional rate taxpayers. That support is offered through
tax relief and an associated national insurance contributions
disregard, and employers are able to offer their employees up to
£55 a week free of income tax and national insurance
contributions.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Most
employers offer that support through child care vouchers, delivered
either by salary sacrifice or by flexible remuneration arrangements.
Such arrangements benefit employers as they can also make national
insurance contribution savings. At present, basic rate taxpayers can
receive up to £900 of support a year, whereas higher rate
taxpayers can receive up to £1,200 a year.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">While we are
very much in favour of employers helping their employees to share the
cost of child care, it is neither progressive nor well targeted for
wealthier parents to derive more benefit than those on lower incomes.
The argument rehearsed in the debate on 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 330<a class="bkMark" name="Column330">&#160;</a>
                           </div>clause 35 in the Committee of the whole House was that the previous
Administration announced these reforms in order to fund further free
child care provision for the most disadvantaged two-year-olds. I remind
the Committee that the basis of that was all tax relief on
employer-supported child care—all tax relief—would be
stopped for those joining schemes on or after 6 April 2011, and indeed
tax relief for those in existing schemes would cease from April 2015.
That was hardly an incentive for parents to go back to work. In
the face of robust opposition from parents, the child care sector and
even Ministers in the previous Government, the reforms announced in
September 2009 reappeared in the 2009 pre-Budget report in the format
being introduced
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">All
parents who join employer-supported child care schemes on or after 6
April 2011 receive the same amount of income tax relief as basic rate
taxpayers. That is the change that the clause and the schedule seek to
introduce. That is achieved by limiting the amount that higher rate
taxpayers and additional rate taxpayers can receive each week to
£28 and £22 respectively, so all parents receive the same
amount of income tax relief support each week—about £11.
All existing members who joined a scheme before April 2011 will be able
to retain their current rates of tax relief as long as they stay within
a scheme offered by the same employer. I can assure the Committee that
the change will not affect the tax and national insurance contributions
relief available for workplace nurseries.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Paragraphs 2
and 3 relate to child care vouchers. Paragraph 2 introduces a new
condition for tax relief to apply, based on a new condition relating to
employers making an estimate of the employee’s relevant earnings
for the tax year in respect of which the vouchers are provided.
Paragraph 3 introduces a new section setting out the detail of the
relevant earnings amount and the required time for making the estimate.
That should take place at the beginning of the tax year, or, if an
employee is joining an employer-supported child care scheme during the
course of the year, at that point.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Paragraphs 4
and 5 of the schedule deal with directly contracted child care: for
example, when an employer pays a child care provider directly on the
parent’s behalf. The provisions mirror those for child care
vouchers. Some respondents to the consultation on draft legislation,
which we undertook prior to finalising the Bill, felt that this change
should be through P11Ds, the normal form used by employers for the
reporting of employee benefits. However, it was felt that the approach
taken—of asking employers to make an assessment of employment
income at the beginning of the relevant tax year—was better for
several
reasons.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
it is more generous to parents, in that it focuses on the single
employment offering child care support, and does not include income
from further employments or other sources. Secondly, the approach taken
is quicker to implement, since changing the P11D would have taken a
further two years. Finally, it keeps the necessity of employer contact
with HMRC to a minimum, a point that many employers will welcome.
Further guidance aimed to address any outstanding concerns was
published at the beginning of April, and HMRC will continue to work
with key interest groups. The additional cost for all employers will be
around £1 million over five years, a reasonable amount given
that at least 450,000 employees participate.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000024">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I will now
briefly set out the purpose of the amendments. As a result of
continuing consultation with relevant interested parties on the
detailed guidance to support schedule 8, we identified some further
practical issues that require an amendment to the legislation as
published in
March.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
aim of amendment 108 is to offer further support to employers who have
the responsibility for applying the legislation. It is they who will
have to determine the appropriate level of tax relief on
employer-supported child care. The amendment removes some of the detail
related to the estimate of relevant earnings from the primary
legislation. The detailed provisions will instead be replaced with a
statutory instrument containing regulations relating to the estimate of
relevant earnings for the year. A draft of the regulations will be made
available for consideration by interested parties as soon as possible.
The regulations will be introduced before 31 December 2011
and will take effect from 6 April
2011.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">They
will have a more generous effect than the legislation as it currently
stands, and will reflect more accurately guidance published last
autumn. Further guidance to help employers has already been published
by HMRC. Through the amendment the Government are showing that they
listen to the concerns of interested parties and take action to address
them. The changes aim to support employers and make the legislation
more business-friendly. Therefore, I urge the Committee to accept the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">More
broadly, in terms of schedule 8, the Government recognise how valuable
the support is to working parents, but it cannot be right that
wealthier parents receive more support than basic rate taxpayers with
their child care costs. The reform will make employer-supported child
care fairer, better targeted and more progressive. I urge the Committee
to accept that the schedule stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000028">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We had an
interesting and impassioned debate on clause 35 in the Committee of the
whole House several weeks ago. Given the concerns raised by many hon.
Members during that debate about the finer details of the clause and
the associated schedule and the implications for child care provision,
it is important that we now have the opportunity to debate it in more
detail and to look at the Government’s amendments. I have some
technical concerns about them, which I will come to
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Schedule
8 reduces child care relief for higher earners. It has been well
documented that the previous Labour Government had planned to reduce
child care relief for higher earners to bring it into line with the
relief for basic rate payers. There are, however, clear differences
between this Government’s proposals and the plan put forward by
the previous Government. The original idea was motivated by a concern
that support for child care 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 332<a class="bkMark" name="Column332">&#160;</a>
                           </div>was not sufficiently well targeted given that a third of funding for
employer-supported child care schemes goes to higher rate payers.
Currently, basic rate taxpayers can receive up to £900 a year,
while higher rate taxpayers benefit from relief of up to £1,200
and additional rate payers up to £1,500. It is generally
accepted that that could be targeted much more effectively and fairly,
and schedule 8 accordingly introduces a new tax exempt limit of
£28 a week for higher rate payers and £22 for additional
rate payers, compared with £55 for basic rate
payers.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
understand our reservations about schedule 8, it would be helpful to
outline the differences between the proposals in front of us and
Labour’s intention when in government. Equalising the rate of
relief will generate substantial savings for the Treasury, and the
Labour Government proposal was to use that to fund an expansion
of nursery places for two-year-olds, starting with 65,000 places for
the most deprived children. We thought that it was right to target the
families who are most in need and who stand to benefit the most from
the funding, and the policy ensured that hard-working higher rate
payers could continue to receive some still much-needed
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
contrast, we understand that the present Government intend to pilot an
entitlement to 15 hours a week for 28,000 two-year-olds. The Exchequer
Secretary told the House that clause 35, as detailed in schedule 8,
will save the Treasury £100 million a year, but my understanding
is that the estimates have been revised down to £15
million this year, rising to £65 million in 2013-14.
Nevertheless, it is clear that the proposals that we are discussing
today fall far short of the previous Government’s proposals and
lack the ultimate long-term ambition of 250,000 free places
for
two-year-olds.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
considering what constitutes a fairer employer-supported child care
scheme, it is important to consider it in the context of wider support
that may or may not be available to working parents. That is why, when
it was discussed by the Committee of the whole House, we tabled an
amendment to clause 35 that would have required the Chancellor to
report on the impact of taxation on child care. Our amendment was not
selected for discussion, but we hope that the Treasury will
nevertheless give due consideration to our concern that the
affordability of child care, and the undoubted impact that Government
policy has on it, is kept under review. Indeed, the low incomes tax
reform group, responding to the proposals to reduce child care relief
for higher earners, called for a full review of child care policy
across government, which supports our view that the relief for higher
earners cannot be considered in
isolation.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
context in which we must consider the impact on families has changed
markedly for both high and low-earning families since Labour’s
original plan to reduce higher rate payers’ relief. Under this
Government, all parents have had their child benefit frozen, which
represents a substantial real-terms cut given that inflation is now at
5.2%, or 4.5% if the Government choose to use the consumer prices
index. Moreover, families with a higher rate tax payer will not only
see their help with child care reduced, but also lose all their child
benefit from 2013. As we have made clear, when in government, we
thought that there was an argument for reducing child care relief so
that support was targeted, but the child benefit cut is not at all fair
or equitable, given that higher earning 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 333<a class="bkMark" name="Column333">&#160;</a>
                           </div>couples will continue to receive child benefit. The Government’s
policy on support for working parents, therefore, does not seem to be
about ensuring that it is appropriately
targeted.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
contrast, the Government have chosen to target their spending cuts in a
way that disproportionately hits women and children. Families not only
face losing child care support and child benefit, but will on average
also be paying £450 a year extra in VAT. The House of Commons
Library has calculated that some families will be £1,700 a year
worse off due to the Government’s tax and benefit changes, and
there are no longer plans to improve child care provision for
two-year-olds from low-income
families.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000038">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Returning
more specifically to the provisions in schedule 8, doubts
have been raised about whether they achieve the Government’s aim
of ensuring that all working parents receive the same rate of relief.
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn mentioned during the
Committee of the whole House, the Chartered Institute of
Taxation’s low incomes tax reform group has expressed concern
that the schedule will only apply when an employer estimates at the
beginning of the financial year that an employee will earn above the
basic rate limit; what the employee actually earns is
irrelevant.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Concerns
have accordingly been raised that the earnings assessment will be too
unreliable and inconsistent and, consequently, will wrongly penalise
some parents. Additionally, putting the onus on the employer has the
potential to compromise their relationship with the employee,
especially as the employee has no effective means of challenging the
decision. As the Treasury has confirmed, it will increase the
administrative burden on employers, who are required not only to
estimate their employees’ earnings when they are not necessarily
in possession of all the relevant facts, but to retain records for
HMRC.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clearly,
there are financial implications for the employee if the employer gets
the assessment wrong, which I will come to later. Is there any
possibility of penalties being imposed on the employer if HMRC
considers that they made a mistake with the assessment or failed to
keep the necessary
records?<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000041">&#160;</a>

many of my colleagues on the Committee, that Government Members tend to
portray some of the measures to support people in work with child care
arrangements—whether it be through financial provisions, such as
tax relief or vouchers, or through other provisions, such as allowing
flexible working and maternity and paternity leave—as burdens on
business, rather than something that helps
employees.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000045">&#160;</a>

a balance has to be struck, but, particularly as the Government make
great play of encouraging people back into work and, in some cases,
have introduced draconian measures to force people back into work, it
cannot be just a stick approach, rather than a carrot approach. There
have to be conditions that allow people to juggle their busy lives.

combine looking after their children and going to

is sometimes portrayed as employees demanding certain things from
employers, and employers grudgingly having to go along with it because
the Big Brother state tells them that is how they have to do things.
Actually, most decent companies care about their work force. When an
invaluable employee who has been working for an employer for some time
decides to have children and goes on maternity leave, because the
employee’s contribution is valued and the employer would like
them to return to work, it is important that the employer can
facilitate that through flexible working and other support with child
care. There is an underlying philosophical debate about the
state’s role in helping people, rather than only imposing
burdens on them, but now is perhaps not the time to venture into
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000048">&#160;</a>

the Treasury has responded to some points raised during the
consultation on the draft legislation, such as the requirement to take
into account the amount of any coded-in personal allowances, but
reservations remain about the impact on businesses. The Treasury has
estimated that the average annual cost of the administrative burden
would be £200,000, so, for some businesses, the amount would not
be inconsiderable. Will the Minister tell us what discussions the
Treasury has had with businesses about their additional
responsibilities included in schedule 8, and whether the schedule could
deter them from offering employer-supported child care? As we have
suggested, it is important that the balance is right. It should not be
a deterrent to employers; it should be a benefit for employers and
employees alike. Will HMRC be able to provide advice and assistance to
employers who are uncertain about the relevant earnings
assessment?<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000053">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Many groups
have raised concerns about the inflexibility of the relevant earnings
assessment approach, which means that an employee’s exempt
entitlement cannot change until the next financial year, regardless of
changes to their circumstances, which could be in hours or earnings. It
also does not take into account the fact that some employees may have
additional sources of income, meaning that one employer’s
assessment may misrepresent the tax band that they are actually in,
which again, undermines the objective of ensuring that all parents
receive basic rate relief. Although, on one hand, there can be
additional complexities and administrative burdens in requiring in-year
changes, will the Minister tell us what consideration has been given to
allowing for those, and whether it is thought that the earnings
assessment is a more accurate reflection of actual
earnings?<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000054">&#160;</a>

comment, so that I can understand her point? She asked about the fact
that it would only be down to the employer’s earnings—the
earnings that the employee had with that employer—and that only
they would be taken into account, and not other earnings, which she
said could put people’s ability to get basic rate taxpayer
support at risk. I wondered how she felt that that would be possible,
given that if someone had employment elsewhere and already qualified
for the support, in many respects, the only risk is that their overall
earnings would have been under-calculated. Had all their earnings been
taken into account, they would have been a higher rate taxpayer, but
they would still be eligible for the same basic rate tax relief. Will
the hon. Lady clarify that, so that I can understand the point that she
was making?<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000055">&#160;</a>

appreciate the Minister’s point, which is that the danger would
be that if somebody’s extra earnings from another job were not
noted, the only impact would be that they would not get the higher rate
relief. I think that perhaps the concern is that if people have two
separate jobs, they would be assessed separately and could somehow be
entitled to the relief in respect of both employments. I am not quite
sure what the issue is, but I think that is what has been suggested:
somebody could benefit, as though their two jobs did not correlate, and
the relief would be received in respect of both employers.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000056">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I was asking
the Minister whether it would be better to deal with the matter on a
more ongoing basis through in-year changes, rather than through the
earnings assessment. The Chartered Institute of Taxation and the tax
faculty of the Institute of Chartered Accountants have suggested that
the previous year’s earnings and P60 could be used as an
alternative to the earnings assessment. That would not be perfect,
because the parent’s earnings might have changed
significantly, but it is another possibility. I would
appreciate further information on what consideration was given to that
and why, if it was considered, it was rejected by the Treasury.
Similarly, others have recommended using the P11D form to reduce the
burden on employers, so that actual earnings are used. Will the
Minister elaborate on the reasons for rejecting the P11D method and
treating employer-supported child care like any other
benefit?<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many
responses to the draft legislation queried whether it took account of
employment income exemptions under part 4 of the Income Tax (Earnings
and Pensions) Act 2003 and suggested that it could mean, for instance,
that provisions for transport for disabled employees might result in
their basic earnings assessment classing them as a higher rate payer
when they are not. Can the Minister confirm that that is no longer the
case and that sufficient guidance and information will be given to
employers to ensure that the appropriate exemptions are
made?<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000058">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Uncertainty
about what should be included in the earnings assessment brings me to
the four Government amendments. Amendments 108 and 109 give the
Treasury further powers to change the definition of “relevant
earnings” and “excluded amounts.” Not only does
that have implications for the level of parliamentary and external
scrutiny, but it might mean that employers are more dependent on
interpreting guidance and additional regulations than on following
clear legislation. Can the Minister clarify why the Government are
proposing this amendment and what they plan to include, and exclude,
from the proposed regulations? How will the Treasury ensure that the
list is a clear and exhaustive one, which will help employers more
accurately to assess an employee’s tax
band?<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
reason for these changes is unclear. The explanatory notes to the
amendments state that they

                        <p>It
is difficult to see how giving further powers to the Treasury to change
those definitions whenever it likes will result in greater clarity for
employers. If more detailed definitions were needed, why did the
Minister not provide them by making amendments to the Bill, as she has
done with schedule 2? Regulations will result only in more uncertainty
for employers, because they will have to watch for secondary
legislation rather than being able to rely on the certainty of primary
legislation, and the secondary legislation may be liable to change
without notice. It seems more sensible, therefore, for the Government
to include those definitions in a further amendment to the Bill. For
the sake of clarity and transparency, I encourage the Minister to
consider bringing that forward on Report.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000062">&#160;</a>

would allow the Treasury to make retrospective changes, which would
apply to the current tax year, as far down the line as 31 December
2011. That is particularly troubling and seems impractical. Paragraph
3(5) of schedule 8 makes it clear that the relevant earnings assessment
will be conducted only once each year and that unless the employee
joins the scheme part way through the tax year, the assessment will
take place at the beginning of the tax year. Can the Minister explain
to the Committee how changes can be retrospectively applied part way
through the financial year? Does the amendment mean that a
parent’s entitlement could change with very little warning, and
does it increase the burden on employers still further by potentially
requiring them to conduct another assessment in December? I think that
the Minister said during her opening remarks that secondary legislation
would be brought forward before December this year, which seems rather
a long time given that the Bill has been discussed on the Floor of the
House and is now being considered in Committee. Will she explain why it

find themselves in very complicated situations and that we will have to

it is probably worth while setting out the original starting point for
the legislation and the schedule. The previous Government introduced a
proposal to abolish employer-supported child care entirely. Many felt
that that was a retrograde step and, as a result of the fallout from
that proposal, a hybrid and more sensible approach was proposed. The
previous Government were right to recognise that their original
proposal was not well targeted 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 338<a class="bkMark" name="Column338">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and to seek to remedy that. Their initial proposal to abolish
employer-supported child care altogether to ensure that it was better
targeted by having it targeted at nobody was seen by many as a
draconian step. The measures before us today and the measures that the
previous Government finally realised were perhaps more
sensible will strike a balance between targeting employer-supported
child care and ensuring that it does not get spent excessively on
higher rate and additional rate taxpayers who, under the previous
scheme, were benefiting the most financially. We are going to press
ahead with
this.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
answer the hon. Lady’s questions, we are absolutely committed to
striking a balance between supporting people in work but more broadly
supporting families and working families. That is one of the reasons
why we are providing access to affordable and high-quality early
education and care with 15 hours of free early education for all three
and four-year-olds. It is also why we are extending that entitlement
for the first time to all disadvantaged two-year-olds, which is a
targeted measure that will bring some real benefits. The spending
review provided £380 million per year by 2014-15 to fund that
new entitlement for two-year-olds. More broadly, and not explicitly
related to child care per se, but to support families, we have brought
forward above-indexation increases in the child care tax credit for
this year and for next year
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000068">&#160;</a>

for the impact on individuals, when employers carry out the basic

                           </strong> I realise that the hon. Gentleman is speaking up
for people who will feel that this puts a squeeze on them. Obviously,
the people worst hit by this will be those earning £150,000 a
year who receive tax relief on their employer-supported child care. He
may want to argue that, in this time of fiscal deficit—which the
Government have picked up—we should prioritise supporting those
earning £150,000 a year with tax relief. He may feel that that
is the right priority. The Government believe in ensuring that money is
there to support the families who need it most. Perhaps that priority
is different to his, but I think that it is right.

correlation between the amount that we would have saved by abolishing
the higher rate of relief when we were in government, and a direct
programme with the ambition of creating 250,000 free nursery places for
two-year-olds. It was not hypothecated as such, but we made a clear
link between reducing something that benefited higher rate taxpayers
and shifting the money to provide for people who needed it at the lower
end of the scale. The Minister just outlined a broad-brush approach,
such as the pupil premium. Will she clarify how much the Government
think will be saved by introducing the measure—I think the
figure of £65 million was mentioned—and how
much of it will actually be spent on providing nursery places for

we live in a world without a fiscal deficit to tackle; that we do not
have to make any savings; and that we can somehow ignore all that debt
and pass it on to our children. I do not accept that argument. We need
to sort out the country’s public finances as fast as possible.
Debt is costing the taxpayer £120 million every day. Getting a
grip on that by taking the actions that we are to bear down on it and
ensure that we do not hand that debt and deficit on to our children is
critical.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000078">&#160;</a>

they felt they needed to ensure that the schedule and the clause work
well. We are encouraging employers to use that guidance, and to speak
to HMRC if they encounter problems. As any further problems are pointed
out, we will of course update the guidance. The message to employers is
that as long as they take reasonable care in how they look at the
earnings assessment, the question of penalties should not
arise.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000079">&#160;</a>

was asked explicitly whether using the P11D would have been a better
approach. That was obviously a possible alternative. However, the
estimated administrative cost for employers of the approach we are
using is approximately £1 million over five years. If P11Ds were
used, the estimate was £4.7 million over five years, nearly five
times as much. Using the P11D to deliver the reform would not just have
been more expensive, it would have meant that we could not have made
progress for two years, which would have delayed any savings and meant
that employers could not report national insurance contributions on any
overpayments at year end using the P11D. Generally, the thought for
employers of having to file P11Ds for 450,000 employees would be the
practical evidence of that increased administrative burden. It would
also have carried significant processing costs for
HMRC.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000080">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Obviously, it is as I have just said. If
employers can demonstrate that they have reasonable processes and
systems in place to collate information, and that they are taking their
information from the payroll system, for example, which would be most
companies’ source data on the level of employment remuneration,
that will clearly be seen as reasonable.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000082">&#160;</a>

enough, so that employers have the detail and understand what they need
to do, and flexible enough, to enable them to get that detail in the
way that is most straightforward for them. We hope we have found that
balance. The regulations approach will enable us to provide more detail
and that extra degree of support and certainty for
employers—something that came out of our consultation with
external stakeholders. That has enabled us to remove some of the
detailed provisions from schedule 8. The regulation-making powers for
HMRC will enable greater detail to be provided, but should support
employers and make the legislation more business friendly, which, as
the Committee can imagine, is what they

                           </strong> I have some fairly brief comments to make on
clause 36, which amends the limited exemption for qualifying child care
vouchers in the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 to relax
the requirements for any child care scheme to be generally
open.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000091">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">At
present, employees on or near the national minimum wage cannot benefit
from any salary sacrifice scheme that would bring their earnings under
the legal limit. That remains true under clause 36. It is important
that people on the minimum wage are protected from back-door attempts
by employers to reduce the amount that they are paid.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many of us
will have encountered situations in our constituencies over the years
in which employers provide rented accommodation or food for restaurant
workers, which actually has the effect of undercutting what the people
are paid, because those things are, in effect, deducted from their
wages or seen as payment in lieu of wages. It is important that we
maintain the legislative protection for people on the minimum wage who
would be vulnerable to such attempts to reduce the amounts that they
are paid. Again, that remains true under clause
36.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
regulations for employer-supported child care and child care vouchers,
which are included in ITEPA 2003, however, mean that an employer can
offer a child care scheme with tax relief only if the scheme is open to
all employees. Under existing legislation, that means that employers
cannot offer it to any employees if some are on or near the minimum
wage. The fact that some employees are paid the minimum wage in an
attempt to protect them actually means that the
employers are prevented from offering the scheme to anybody,
which, people would accept, is an unfair provision and
something that ought to be changed. Clause 36 changes

                           </div>that, so that employers are not prevented from offering a salary

employees on or near the minimum wage, in most cases. That is the child
care element that the Government have just reduced from covering 80% of
child care costs to covering 70%, representing a loss of up to
£1,560 a year for some families. At the same time, the
Government have chosen to freeze the basic and 30-hour elements of
working tax credits, to freeze child benefit and add

should also be remembered that parents working fewer than 16 hours a
week are not entitled to working tax credits, and consequently do not
receive help with child care. I have spoken to young mothers in my
constituency who work with the Prince’s Trust on issues around
helping them to get back to work, and they have raised this as an
obstacle. Before the reduction of working tax credit to 70% of child
care costs, the charity Gingerbread was campaigning for an increase to
100%, arguing that this would
cost<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000102">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not necessarily advocate that, but Gingerbread raises an important
alternative viewpoint. It also cited a 2008 study indicating that only
one in 10 working tax credit recipients take up the additional child
care support, which they partly attributed to the complicated
eligibility criteria. That is an important issue for the Government.
Given that the take-up of child care reliefs is so low, the balance
between whether the provision of child care vouchers by employers is an
easier alternative that would result in better take-up, and whether it
would have administrative problems, is
significant.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
accept that the alternative—tax-exempt child care
vouchers—is not available to the lowest earners, or consequently
to any of their colleagues, and that the point of the clause is to make
the vouchers more widely available. I am concerned with ensuring that
reducing the “generally open” requirement does not mean
that the needs of working parents with lower earnings are
neglected.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000104">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Does the
Minister have any information about the number or proportion of
employers that would like to offer salary sacrifice vouchers but are
prevented from doing so, or whose schemes cannot include tax relief
because they employ people on or near the minimum wage? I say
“prevented”, but that is not necessarily the case,
because employers have the option of offering a salary plus
arrangement, which can provide a much needed supplement to a
parent’s low pay.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Government give us an indication of the prevalence of such
arrangements? It would be troubling if clause 36 withdrew any incentive
for employers to offer this benefit, and if workers on the minimum wage
lost out as a result. Would employers be more likely to offer salary
sacrifice vouchers than salary plus vouchers? That might have an impact
on people close to the minimum
wage.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000106">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Affordable
child care can make the difference as to whether a parent can work or
not. That is why, recently in the House, I asked the Minister at the
Department for Work and Pensions, the right hon. Member for Epsom and
Ewell (Chris Grayling), about worrying reports that Jobcentre Plus
offices tried to impose sanctions on single parents on
jobseeker’s allowance because they were only looking for work
that fitted around their child care needs. Given that single parents
whose child has reached the age of five are expected to look for work
from next year, and reports that Jobcentre Plus is not showing the
flexibility that it should, in order to keep the claimant count down,
the availability of affordable child care will become increasingly
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000107">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What
estimate has the Treasury made of the number of employers who will
offer vouchers as a result of the clause? My concern is that this will
not prove sufficient, and that the Government do not have a coherent
plan for child care, particularly following the cuts to Sure Start and
working tax credits. As was noted during the discussions on clause 35
and schedule 8, the previous Labour Government planned to redistribute
child care support and invest in places for younger children from
lower-income backgrounds. Although the Government are continuing with
the reduction in relief for higher earners, there is no commensurate
investment for lower
earners.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000108">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
previous Labour Government set ambitious targets to reduce child
poverty, and lifted 600,000 children out of poverty. The child care
policy, if implemented, could have contributed to
continuing this trajectory, but instead we have the OECD and
the Institute for Fiscal Studies warning that Government policies could
push another 300,000 children into poverty. We would, therefore,
appreciate further information from the Minister on plans to support
working parents more generally, and whether the Government have a
coherent strategy to ensure that all parents can access affordable
child
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000109">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills launched a consultation
on flexible working and parental leave, but the potential benefits for
parents will not be available for another four years. In the meantime,
the Government have removed new employment rights for workers in
micro-businesses, so child care will remain a priority for working
parents struggling to balance their commitments. Although working tax
credits make a significant contribution, I have highlighted why we
should be cautious about thinking that they are the

week’s Gingerbread and Resolution Foundation report has raised
fears that child care changes with the universal credit could mean that
working parents lose 94p in every pound if they increase their working
hours. Given that the explanatory notes emphasise the role of the child
care element, what steps will the Treasury take to ensure that parents
on low incomes know that they can access it and what help will it offer
to encourage them to apply? Another recent Gingerbread report concluded
that changes to the tax credit system this April

                        <p>Has
the Treasury considered that report? It would be helpful to know
whether it had held any discussions with Ministers or officials in the

expected to be the judge and what evidence will they use? If a decision
is not to be based on exact calculations, is the Minister satisfied
that workers will not be wrongly excluded from a tax-relief scheme? How
much will clause 36 cost the Treasury if more parents qualify for tax
relief? The Bill allows for it to be introduced retrospectively from
2005-06, so how does HMRC plan to implement
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000114">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 36 amends the condition on
employer-supported child care to be generally open. The shadow Minister
has run through some of the situations that we seek to address through
the clause. It should enable some employers to make their child care
schemes more available to their employees by removing the restriction
that applies to those employees at or near the minimum
wage.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Employer-supported
child care is a benefit provided by employers to help their work force
with child care costs, and it is valued greatly. The Government support
it with a limited exemption from income tax and a national insurance
disregard. Many employer-supported child care schemes are offered
through salary sacrifice or flexible remuneration packages. The hon.
Lady asked how the salary sacrifice scheme will relate to salary plus
arrangements. Employers will be able to offer a mixture of such schemes
to their employees, so hopefully there will be additional flexibility.
Where employer-supported child care schemes are offered through salary
sacrifice or flexible remuneration packages, working parents who earn
the minimum wage, or near it, cannot join their employer’s
scheme, because making deductions from a person’s salary or
earnings that lead to them being paid less than the minimum wage is
prohibited.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
minimum wage rules are in place to ensure that the wage is at least at
or near the minimum wage. At the same time, unless employers make their
employer-supported child care schemes available to all employees,
except for

			Column number: 345<a class="bkMark" name="Column345">&#160;</a>
                           </div>in exceptional circumstances, the existing tax exemption does not
strictly apply, so we have ended up with employees caught between
minimum wage legislation and the conditions needed to allow for the tax
and national insurance contribution exemptions from employer-supported
child care. The changes made by the clause will rectify that
anomaly.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause will allow employers to meet the “available to
all” conditions and thereby continue to offer schemes through
salary sacrifice or flexible remuneration arrangements. We know that
many parents with earnings at or near minimum wage are already excluded
from employer child care schemes. That reflects the Low Pay
Commission’s 2006 report,
which<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000118">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Although
this might seem to be a reduction in support for low-income parents, I
think the shadow Minister recognised that in practice it corrects an
anomaly between the minimum wage legislation and the
conditions in place to encourage employers to
provide employer-supported child care; it should not have any real
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000119">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
stress that the majority of working parents paid at national minimum
wage levels are already eligible for support with their child care
costs through the child care element of the working tax credit, which,
in many cases, is more generous than employer-supported child care
would have been. The changes are being made retrospectively to put
widespread practice on a proper footing and to allow us to make the
appropriate amendments to the national insurance contributions
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000120">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about the impact on employers. These clauses have been
out for consultation since December 2010. The clauses and the
explanatory documents were perhaps worded clearly, but we received no
responses asking for further clarification or challenging the
Government’s rationale. We are amending the law to reflect a
problem that employers had to address themselves in a way that did not
stack up with the contemporary legal situation. Hopefully, clause 36
will ensure that we reflect the reality faced by employers. In
practice, the clause will not remove any child care support from
working parents. Conversely, it will allow employers to meet the
conditions required to continue to offer this tax relief to the 450,000
parents who currently benefit from the
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000121">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady asked more broadly about what the Government can do to
support child care. We in the Treasury worked alongside the Department
for Work and Pensions to develop the recently published White Paper.
The White Paper contained a commitment to developing a system of
support for child care costs that will work alongside the universal
credit when it comes in. We will ensure that that support is maintained
as the broader legislation on supporting families, particularly working
families,
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000122">&#160;</a>

about child poverty, and the breadth with which we talk about it, is a
challenge. Is it purely about income, or do we want more measures that
address a wider definition of child poverty? It is perhaps not only
about the financial poverty in which children may find themselves, but
about emotional poverty and poverty of opportunity,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000123">&#160;</a>

the OECD report, the IFS has done some work, which the hon. Lady
briefly mentioned. The IFS analysis is not directly comparable with
Treasury forecasts, but I draw her attention to the fact that the
Office for Budget Responsibility has looked at the past two Budgets and
said that there will be no measurable increase in child poverty. I
think I am right in saying that the OBR has said that, if anything, the
measures we brought forward in the Budget would result in a small
decrease in child poverty, albeit a decrease so small that it is not
statistically
significant.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000124">&#160;</a>

That is one of the reasons why we are pleased that the right hon.
Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field) has provided his
input.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000126">&#160;</a>

can see Opposition Members rolling their eyes. We need to debate not
just the financial aspect of child poverty but the broader issues that
we must tackle in terms of support for early years, and particularly
for disadvantaged children. They often face disadvantage far more
broadly based than simple income targets. The right hon. Member for
Birkenhead and many others are clearly saying that we need a
broader-based strategy if we are to reach our longer term 2020 target.
I hope that we can stand away from just having a debate on a statistic,
important though it is, and remember that behind that there are
children whose lives we want to change for the better.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000127">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps I can
give one final example of what I mean. By raising personal allowance
over the course of this year and next, we will take over 1 million
people out of income tax altogether. The impact of that will be to
raise average incomes ever so slightly. Because child poverty is worked
out as a median relative indicator, that change will see more children
technically slip into child poverty. Those extra children will suddenly
be defined as being in poverty, but will go to bed that night unaware
of any change in their circumstances. That shows that, while statistics
do matter and should be looked at, if we are to make a real difference
to children’s lives that they actually notice, which surely is
the main point of this, we need a broader-based strategy and a broader
argument about where investment can be best placed to ensure that we
make a difference on the ground.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000128">&#160;</a>

the title of this clause will cause hearts to sink. I suspect that
people would much rather we were discussing something else. The only
reason why I comment on it is that there have been reports on the
provision in the media along the lines that hon. Members are being
granted a special exemption from the new tax avoidance legislation. We
are being portrayed as trying to get away with something that ordinary
members of the public would not be able to get away with and as being
up to our old tricks again.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000132">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> When I talked about getting away with our old
tricks, I was talking about the way the media and, perhaps, some
members of the public portray the matter. I was not saying that I
believe that old tricks are being got up to, apart from a small number
of people who, in most cases, are getting their just deserts now. It is
probably best not to start digging in that minefield.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I appreciate
that the Exchequer Secretary wrote to all Members about this clause and
the schedule to explain that, as the new rules are intentionally broad,
this exemption is one of several necessary to ensure that legitimate
behaviour is not unintentionally caught by them. In particular, an
exemption is created for the accommodation expenses of Members where
they are paid by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority
directly to a third party such as a landlord, rather than to the
Member. That results from a change IPSA made last November that allowed
such direct payments to be made. Previously, we had to pay the landlord
direct and then claim it back. That seems reasonable. Individual
Members cannot change the way they are paid because it is statutory, so
they should not be caught by anti-avoidance rules. In my view, this
clause should not be necessary. Some Members might say that this clause
would not be necessary if we had not moved to the IPSA regime, but that
is a can of worms that we do not want to open in Committee right now.
More importantly, the clause would not be necessary if the rules that
the Government have proposed were not so complex. The clause is
intended to ensure that the rules do not have unintended consequences.
The rules are very difficult for the ordinary person to understand, so
it is not too surprising that the media raised concerns. John Whiting,
the director of the Office of Tax Simplification, was concerned about
the provision. He said to the Economic Affairs Committee that the new
rules had<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000135">&#160;</a>

debate about that. Specifically on Members’ expenses, the
Chartered Institute of Taxation has
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000138">&#160;</a>

many more such clauses will the Government have to add to the Bill?
That is quite a difficult question to answer, but it highlights the
fact that the legislation has created a great deal of uncertainty in
this area of the tax system. That goes against the Government’s
own aims set out in their framework for tax policy
making.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000140">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause does not grant MPs any new special tax treatment. It broadly
continues the tax treatment that has applied for accommodation expenses
payable under the MPs’ expenses scheme, which was introduced by
IPSA at the start of the current Parliament. With effect from 1
November, IPSA introduced a minor simplification, which allows it to
make payments in respect of MPs’ rental charges direct to a
third party such as a landlord or letting agent, on the authorisation
of the claimant MP. The existing exemption from tax for residential
accommodation expenses payments applies only to payments made by IPSA
directly to the MP. So the Bill will merely address the consequences of
this
simplification.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000148">&#160;</a>

which provides an income tax exemption for expenses paid to MPs that
are necessarily incurred on overnight accommodation required for the
performance of their parliamentary duties, whether in Westminster or
their constituencies, has existed for many years. That legislation was
updated in the second Finance Act last year so that, following the
introduction of IPSA’s new expenses scheme on 7 May 2010, it
applies to overnight accommodation expenses paid under this scheme
where appropriate. As I said, from 1 November 2010, IPSA introduced a
further minor simplification to the way it pays MPs’ expenses in
respect of rental charges on constituency and residential properties.
From that date, IPSA’s rules allowed such expenses to be paid
direct to another person, such as a landlord, at the direction of the
claimant MP. It is clear that the clause does not grant MPs any new
special tax treatment as that would not be
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000149">&#160;</a>

some detail this morning, over the replacement for the child trust
fund. I hope we can also make progress on some issues that have been
raised by the Government, but not answered by them to date, about what
happens to looked-after children and children in care. The provisions
of clause 40 are in place because the Government chose to end the child
trust fund, which was established by the previous Labour Government,
towards the end of last year, with effect from 3 January
2011.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000158">&#160;</a>

very political. The child trust fund—a universal benefit
provided for all irrespective of income, with particular help to the
poorest children and those with disabilities and in care—was a
successful scheme established by the Labour Government. It was
abolished by the Conservatives, with support from the Liberal
Democrats, with effect from 3 January this year. Clause 40
contains the Government’s proposed replacement: a self-selecting
benefit or child trust fund ISA, available to those who can afford to
contribute. We need to explore the objectives, the possible take-up and

                        <p class="tabbed">Hon. Members
will know that the child trust fund was originally a savings and
investment account for children born on or after 1 September 2002, and
was established by the then Labour Government to support a long-term
saving culture, with particular help for the poorest individuals. We
spent some time with the Financial Secretary in Committee before
Christmas debating the future of the child trust fund. I can see the
hon. Member for Reading West nodding: he spent many a happy hour with
me in Committee as we explored those issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000160">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s Bill was passed before Christmas, and they
abolished the child trust fund from January 2011. The fund
was worth more than £500 to all children over their lifetime and
£1,000 to the poorest. The previous Government wanted to
encourage saving, so that at 18 people had some savings
towards the considerable costs they would face such as tuition fees.
Children were also due to receive a £250 top-up on their seventh
birthday—£500 for the poorest. All of that went under the
Savings Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant Act
2010.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000161">&#160;</a>

Radnorshire: he went into the general election with a commitment to
stop spending on child trust funds for the public at large. He stood on
his manifesto. All 57 of the Liberal Democrats convinced 300-plus

                           </strong> There was overwhelming consensus in the
Conservative party on maintaining the child trust fund for the poorest
third and for people with disabilities; and there was a consensus on
our side for maintaining it as a whole. These are important
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000174">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We are
debating amendment 97, which deals with looked-after children, and we
shall come shortly to the principle of clause 40, under which the child
trust fund is replaced. This is important because, in itself, the child
trust fund was a successful scheme. During the last year of its
operation, 2 million people were contributing to 4.45 million open
accounts; and £2 billion of assets were under management,
attracting £22 million of regular contributions each month.
There was a 60% increase in tax-efficient saving over the period, and
the next generation of 18-year-olds will have amassed some £3
billion every year through the child trust fund over the course of its
operation. That is according to Save Child Savings, which made strong
representations on behalf of companies operating child trust funds that
they should continue. The Minister has to look at how much money in
savings the replacement for the child trust fund will generate, and
whether that will address in any way, shape or form, the important need
to improve the savings ratio for people, for their children in
particular, and for future savings
activity.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000175">&#160;</a>

way. I supported my party’s policy in the previous election
because all the evidence that I have seen indicates that life-changing
investment in a child’s development occurs very early in their

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes my point, by walking
completely into the fist that I will now put into him. Like me, he
represents a constituency in Wales. As he will know, one of the
Government’s arguments was to scrap the child trust fund and
replace it with the pupil premium. As he will also know, the pupil
premium does not apply to Scotland, Northern Ireland, or to his

families—74%—contributed over and above that to the child
trust fund. This issue is important, not because I want to revisit the

Act—but because clause 40 is about the replacement for the

indicate that we need to look at the replacement for the child trust
fund, which is what clause 40 is about. The child trust fund was a
success. Some 70,000 children are born into the UK each year and they
were getting a contribution from the state

were generated for all sectors of society because of the financial

Friend agree with me that one of the tests we should set for this child
ISA is how well it does in encouraging those on lower incomes to save?

of the points that I want to explore in our questions today—the
junior ISA, in clause 40, replacing the child trust fund. The child
trust fund was successful because it gave a financial contribution from
the state and said to families from all sectors of society, “The
state is in partnership with you to provide for your children’s
future at the age of 18. Here is a financial contribution from the
state.” In response, parents from across the social spectrum,
from all incomes, rallied to that call and contributed to help build
assets for the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11052482000002">&#160;</a>

the state will not be contributing financially, and therefore not
encouraging parental contributions through any financial contribution.

Gentleman said. I would like to probe him. Which people were investing
money and increasing those savings? Was that 25% from the poorest in
society, or were the more affluent contributing to the Government
money? Effectively, the question raised by the hon. Member for
Walthamstow was how we encourage the poorest to save. If they were
among the 75% who were not investing in the child trust fund, they were
not saving, but simply getting a Government
subsidy.<a class="bkMark" name="11052482000009">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is a valid point, and we debated it long and
hard before Christmas, when we considered the Bill that abolished the
child trust fund. The figures show that considerable numbers of people
in middle-income and well-off families contributed to child trust
funds, but an increased percentage of people from lower-income
families—sadly, I do not have the figures to
hand—contributed because of the co-operation and partnership
with the state.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000188">&#160;</a>

to the clause; we have been dealing with the background so
far—is that following the decision to abolish the child trust
fund, the Government announced at the end of last year that they would
establish a child ISA from autumn 2011. As part of that, they have said
that they want

                        </p>
                        <p>They
propose that all UK-resident children under 18 who do not
have a child trust fund will be eligible for junior ISAs. That includes
children who were born before the start of child trust fund eligibility
in September 2002, as well as people from before 6 January this year,
who will be eligible for the child ISA when it commences later this
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000191">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In making
that proposal, what calculation has the Minister made of the savings
the junior ISA will encourage, particularly among middle and

                        <p>The Minister’s
own estimate, therefore, is that only 20% of people who are eligible
for a junior ISA will take one up. Straight away, that compares with
the figures I gave the hon. Member for Elmet and Rothwell, which show
that 100% of children had a child trust fund. Of those child trust
funds, 74% were opened by the parents, and parents contributed to 24%
of them. On those statistics, 80% fewer people will have a junior ISA
than had a child trust fund. There will also be less saving, because
the Government’s estimate for the junior ISA says that fewer
people—20%—will save than contributed to the child trust
fund. How does the Minister marry those figures together? What is her

As my right hon. Friend says, the whole point of the child trust fund
was that it capitalised the uncapitalised and incentivised and financed
people who would not necessarily have the wherewithal to start
a savings programme. However, even under the Government’s agenda
for the junior ISA, it is not beyond the realms of conceivability that
the Government could lend money for a time directly to the institutions
that people want to set up a junior ISA. That would kick things off and
increase the number of families who could start a savings programme for
their child.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000195">&#160;</a>

the child fund was to incentivise people across the board to save. Lots
of middle-class and well-off people saved, and more people on lower
incomes saved. That is the key thing. Figures that the Minister
provided in reply to parliamentary questions show that the Government
expect 20% of eligible children to have a junior ISA, but 24% of
parents contributed to the child trust fund. The savings ratio under
the junior ISA is lower.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000196">&#160;</a>

the child trust fund was that parents could be confident that it was a

                        <p class="tabbed">Again,
in the absence of the child trust fund, what assessments has the
Minister made of the take-up? How many people does she expect to
contribute, how much does she expect to raise, what is the likely level
of tax relief and where will it be directed? Will it be directed at the
incomes of families making £50,000, £60,000,
£70,000 or £80,000-plus or at lower-income families? What
income band does she expect to contribute to the child ISA?<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000201">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Rather than a
direct financial contribution under the child trust fund, clause 40
will now effectively give a tax relief to people who voluntarily
contribute to the child ISA. My hon. Friend the Member for Houghton and
Sunderland South made a point about the range of ISAs and providers.
That is important, and we need to explore it during this

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point that the
Minister needs to answer. What is the banding of the people likely to
contribute to the child ISA? If richer people contribute to it and
establish it, good luck to them; that is fine. But what mechanism
exists to make the scheme help encourage savings by the poorest in
society? The children of the richest in society, when they reach the
age of 18, may well have had further inheritances or endowments, or
might have parents who can contribute to offset university fees, help
with initial rents and so on. The people whom we are trying to
encourage to save in a child ISA have no disposable income and low
levels of contribution. Their children at 18 will face higher levels of
tuition fees—another broken promise by the Liberal
Democrats—and other costs. How will they finance those
costs?<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000204">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are not
sure that the child ISA is the appropriate vehicle to generate the
savings ratio for the age of 18, particularly at a time when the Office
for Budget Responsibility, the Government’s own independent
forecasting agency, has said that household debt is expected to
increase from £1.5 trillion in 2010 to £2.13
trillion in 2015. The Government are privatising debt to individual
households while trying to cut public debt. Therefore, families,
particularly those on lower incomes, will have less disposable income
to put into the new ISA in the first place.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000205">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The purpose of the ISA was to meet costs that
individuals face at the age of 18. The purpose of the child trust fund
is the same. It is to build up a nest egg to meet costs at a particular
time. Some people may wish to pay their tuition fees up front and not
incur that level of debt.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000207">&#160;</a>

have the ISA to pay tuition fees up front. The whole point of the new
tuition fees—the reason why they are fair and the reason why
students will have to pay less money annually than they did under the
old scheme—is that they are paid back in arrears, afterwards and
only as and when those people can afford to pay them, depending on
their professional

                           </strong> We can debate this issue for a long time. There
are costs related to further education that the child trust fund was
intended to help people meet at a particular time, as well as other
costs related to accommodation and other charges. I am very happy to
debate this issue with the hon. Gentleman and I think that the public
know which side they are on in relation to it.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000209">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">However, the
key point today is that clause 40 replaces what existed before. The
Minister needs to justify to the Committee what clause 40 will do and
say who will benefit from the tax handout that she is giving to help
support that level of savings. Given the Government’s own
projection of 20% take-up, my assessment is that 80% of people are not
expected to contribute to their child’s future ISA. I might be
wrong, but my assessment is that that 80% of people will predominantly
be people from the poorer sectors of society who are experiencing a
squeeze on their household incomes because of the rise in
VAT—another broken promise by the Liberal Democrats—as
well as the rise in tuition fees and a range of other issues. Those
rises mean that those people’s disposable income will be even
less in future than it is now, making them less able to save money. Has
the Minister focused on that issue?<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000210">&#160;</a>

we keep coming back to election promises and manifestos, can the right

only voted on Government Bills before the House if they had been

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
there has been reference to the importance of helping the most
vulnerable children. I want to give the right hon. Gentleman an
opportunity to applaud and thank the Government for introducing the
savings account for looked-after children. I am sure that we all accept
that they are the most vulnerable children in our society. They need
that help and the savings account for them is a policy that has been
welcomed by children’s

                           </strong> I am most grateful to the right hon. Gentleman
for giving way. To expand on the comment that he made just a moment
ago, it is one thing to be unable to deliver a manifesto if
one’s party does not have a majority; it is slightly different
to go back on a manifesto promise if one’s party has a majority
of 66 or 179.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, the
specific point that I want to make is that he said that the child trust
fund was money to be used when children went to university, to meet the
costs involved in that. Of course, he will accept that a great number
of children do not go to university and they still have that trust fund
available to them. What were they using it for? Surely, therefore, he
welcomes the fact that we have not only gone further on tuition fees,
as my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash outlined, but we have created
thousands of apprenticeships. However, those apprenticeships have to be
paid for
somehow.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000218">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The trust fund was available for 18-year-olds to
spend as they wished. Starting in 2002, when the child trust fund was
launched, the first 18-year-olds would matriculate in 2020, which is
nine years away. The nest egg, which would be for all parts of society
and contributed to by the state and by parents, would help with the
challenges that they will face then. Most importantly, it would also
show partnership between the state and families in helping to support
those
18-year-olds.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000219">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
can look at what those challenges are, but the fact of the matter is
that the Minister’s figures, given in answer to my hon. Friend
the Member for Nottingham East, show that we now expect fewer people to
save under the junior ISA than we expected to contribute to the child
trust fund. We now expect 80% of the eligible population not to
contribute to the child ISA. As the first part of the discussion,
before I come on to the looked-after children, I want to ask the
Minister who benefits from the proposal in clause 40. Is it just people
who will be richer and better off? If it is, that will not help poorer
people to meet challenges in the future. It will be a tax handout to
people who will use the child ISA effectively to support tax-efficient
savings for their children, when that money could have been used
elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000220">&#160;</a>

means not only tuition fees. There are other costs attached that the
child trust fund could have been used to support. We are not, however,
only concerned with young people going to university, and I know that
my right hon. Friend will come on to looked-after children. There is,
however, one interesting case study in the Barnado’s document,
“On our own two feet”, which focuses on this issue and
gives the example of a young woman called Jo. Jo was in foster care,
and, unfortunately, she was in a car accident, for which she received

allowed her to move away to university. That is precisely the kind of
young person whom we want to support with savings schemes. The concern,
however, is that, because of the lack of detail in the
Government’s proposals, we are not sure that such people will be
supported.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000221">&#160;</a>

see them develop, wanted to keep them and voted accordingly. That
answers the Minister’s criticism initially. They were abolished,
and that is a fact of life that we, in Opposition at the moment, have
to face. The Minister has to make the case today for why the proposed
junior ISA is better than the child trust fund, why it is more
efficient, why it will contribute to a better savings ratio, who will
save and how that resource will be used by individuals to help generate
a pot to help meet the challenges of 18 years hence. I need
to know the details of that. As part of the discussion today, she needs

also voted for that in the House of Commons. I do not have the voting
figures in front of me, but I suspect that the hon. Lady voted against
the provision for looked-after children when we moved a clause on the
Floor of the House. When she asks whether I should be grateful to the
Chancellor for bringing forward funds for looked-after children, I say
to the Chancellor, “Thank you very much.” However, it was
after one vote in Committee, one vote on the Floor of the House, a
campaign by Barnado’s, Save the Children and a range of other
charities, and people being dragged to make that announcement through
questions to the Chancellor about what provision was being provided for
looked-after children. It dawned on the Chancellor that a child ISA,
which is being proposed in clause 40, is for parental contributions to
a tax-free savings
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000227">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Gradually,
after a vote in Committee and on the Floor of the House, and after
parliamentary questions and a lobbying campaign, it dawned on the
Chancellor that people in respite, residential and foster care are
there because they do not have parents. Either the parents do not exist
or they have had parental responsibility removed because of drugs,
alcohol, prison or whatever.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000228">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">So
the Chancellor came to the conclusion that we needed to have a
looked-after children child trust fund, because ultimately he
realised—he should have realised when we first raised
it—that the most vulnerable in our society needed support. They
fall within the definition of

the manifesto, which he supported, and they therefore needed to have an
element of state support to help them meet the challenges of 18. Three
of my children are over 18, but the one who is under 18 will have help
and support from active parents and will have resources to meet the
challenges of 18. The fact that a looked-after child is in care or in
foster care means that their parents are either dead or have had
parental responsibility removed. That is why we want a scheme for
looked-after children.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000230">&#160;</a>

Barnardo’s will have a meeting with the Department for
Education. Barnardo’s produced “On our own two
feet”, which presents the case for a savings scheme for
looked-after children. The representatives e-mailed me yesterday to
tell me about today’s meeting. It is their first contact with
the Department since 22 March, and they are meeting to
develop a scheme. I want to welcome the scheme today. I tabled
amendment 97 because I want, within three months of the Act being
passed, details of what the scheme means for the Economic Secretary and
for the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
need to know three or four key issues: how much the Government intend
to contribute to the potential child ISA for looked-after children and
how they intend to operate it. The Chancellor has stated that the
Department for Education will deal with it. I particularly need to know
whether the proposed replacement will apply in my constituency in north
Wales, in the constituencies of my hon. Friends the Members for
Edinburgh South and for Airdrie and Shotts in Scotland, and in the
constituency of the hon. Member for East Antrim in Northern Ireland,
because, as the Committee knows, the Department for Education is an
England-only Department. What was, before the abolition of the child
trust fund, a universal UK-wide benefit could now simply be a matter
for England. I tabled questions to that effect and the Government have
said that they intend it to be a UK-wide
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So,
again, I want to know the exact details of the scheme. We want it
within three months, but I am happy to withdraw amendment 97 if the
Minister can provide the information today. To deal with clause 40 and
to assess a future child ISA, we need to know what the issue is for
children in care. That is important because about 6,000 children are
taken into care each year in the UK. There is currently a care
population of about 86,000 children. Figures for 31 March 2010 show
that 64,400 children are in care in England; 15,288 in Scotland; 5,162
in Wales and 1,653 in Northern Ireland.

                           </div>At the moment, I am still hazy about how they will be able to access the
child ISA and about what the arrangements are. In the report “On
our own two feet” Barnardo’s and others make a strong
case for help and support. They call on the Government to contribute to
the ISA for looked after children. Does the Minister intend to make a
financial contribution within that £5 million, and if

includes information from a survey conducted by Action for Children,

survey would be encouraged to save themselves if the Government paid
into a savings account for them. Some 70% thought that their carers or
family would be encouraged to save for the future if the Government
paid in for them. Is it not the case therefore that it is crucial that

I will put my hands up when I know that we have had a discussion. We
lost the battle in Committee and in the House of Commons over the child
trust fund, but eventually, through persistence both outside and inside
this House, we have won the principle that there should be a support
mechanism for looked-after children to help contribute to the child
ISA. In particular, I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member
for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Paul Goggins) who assiduously raised
this issue with the charities. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield Central said, we need to know when the scheme will be up and
running, when it will be UK-wide and whether there will be a minimum
deposit in those accounts, which is something to which the Government
have not yet committed themselves. Carers, supporters and people in
local authorities need that information. We want a mechanism to ensure
that we generate help and support for looked-after children who, at the
age of 18, will leave residential care or foster care without the
parental support that most others in society
have.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000236">&#160;</a>

gives an indication of what we want to see in the broadest sense of the
word. It proposes that by 30 September, the Government publish a report
on children’s savings accounts and saving across society, which
would include the impact of Government policy. We tabled the amendment
because we are conscious that since the abolition of the child trust
fund, no information has been provided to show whether savings are
being generated for children under the age of 18 to the same extent
that they were before the abolition. At the time, we suggested that the
Government carry out a review of the abolition’s impact by the
end of this year, but they rejected that proposal; the amendment
provides another opportunity for them to consider
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000240">&#160;</a>

chance here, but perhaps the Government will accept the amendment and
produce a report that shows that all my fears were
unjustified—that people on low incomes are still contributing
and saving for their children. Perhaps their report will blow me out of
the water in October this year. If they wish, they could even time the
report for the Labour party conference to make a real hole in our
proceedings. They can accept the amendment, look at the impact of the
abolition of the child trust fund and show that the Opposition need not
have worried because their fears were not real and everything is

more people contributed to the child trust fund on lower incomes than
will potentially contribute to the child ISA. The Government’s

fund—fair enough, it has gone—and are looking at what the
saving mechanism will be, how confident is the Minister that this
mechanism will be a success? How confident is she that people will
contribute to it, that it will raise the resources that the Government
want and that the people who need it, who benefited from the child
trust fund, will benefit from the child ISA?<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000253">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I contend that low and
middle-earners are unlikely to have spare money to invest in a junior
ISA and so the beneficiaries of it will be those wealthy enough to
afford to take advantage of an attractive new savings product, which
this will undoubtedly be. Effectively, the policy change is ditching a
universal benefit and replacing it with a tax product that will most
benefit the richest members of society, which is why I said that this
is a very political clause. I do not object to their contributions,
because they could save under the child trust fund as well, but the
Minister needs to answer my key point that this will disadvantage those
on low and middle
incomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is misleading for the Government to claim that the junior ISA is some
sort of successor to the child trust fund, when it blatantly is not. It
is about giving a tax break to those who can afford to put money into
it; it is not a universal benefit in the way that the trust fund was.
Although no distributional or regional analysis or assessment of income
bands is provided, the assessment is that only 20% of children will
take it
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000255">&#160;</a>

that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, but my contention, which I base
on information that the Minister provided me with in parliamentary
answers, is that fewer people will save under the proposed child ISA
than saved under the child trust fund. The Minister must answer that
charge. The Government’s actions in abolishing the child trust
fund and saving half a billion pounds of taxpayers’ money have
resulted and will result in a reduced savings culture, and the savings
culture created will be in a different band of the population than was
previously the case.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000257">&#160;</a>

about the move away from child trust funds—but to justify the
benefits that are in addition to the new child ISA. She needs to
outline them in detail, and give a clear explanation of how the ISA
will help to generate those savings for the future. It would help in my
withdrawing of the amendment if she gave the same level of detail about
the contribution for looked-after children as she did under clause 40
about the child ISA—she managed to fill out several pages. The
issue is not new; it was raised in Committee last October and November,
and the Government committed to the child ISA at that stage. They could
have worked on the looked-after children contribution then as well, and
I want to hear the Minister’s proposals for that
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000260">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
should like to focus my comments on the effect that the measures will
have on children in care. We all know that children in care are among
the most marginalised and disadvantaged people in our society, and face
significant disadvantages in life. It is incredibly important,
therefore, that we press the Government, with the amendment, to give
much firmer details of what the scheme will do and what support will be
offered to young people in care. Action for Children and
Barnardo’s have published an interesting report on the subject,
entitled “On our own two feet: The case for a savings account
for looked after children.” It is only through the work of those
organisations that the Government have been forced to reconsider their
proposals for the
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000263">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are talking not about handouts to these disadvantaged young people, but
about providing support to allow care leavers to flourish and become
independent when they reach the age of 18, and I would have thought
that Members from all parties would support that. The savings accounts
would provide a financial asset, enabling young people to receive the
additional support they need. In the absence of a parent, whether
through a care order or difficult circumstances that have arisen, the
state will act as a corporate parent to provide young people with the
security and stability that they need, and it is therefore crucial that
the Government make it clear what the proposals will do. Will they be
UK-wide? How will the money be used? There are a number of areas in
which questions need to be answered by the Minister. Many of those
young people end up homeless, and any support in reserve would be of
massive benefit in enabling them to go on and live fulfilling
lives.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000264">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have seen at first hand the challenges that many young care leavers
face. The organisation that I used to work for ran an
accommodation project for young women aged 16 to 18, who were homeless
as a result of abuse. Many of them were care leavers who had
left the care system at 16, and who would have
benefited from any changes that had brought about further
support to enable them to flourish. Many of them had experienced trauma
and abuse, often at the hands of people who should have been caring for
them—often their parents. Whether it was physical, sexual or
emotional abuse, it was often perpetrated by the people who should have
cared about them most in the world, and should have acted in their best
interests. That is traumatic enough in itself, and it is important that
we provide care leavers with the greatest possible support to help them
to face all the difficulties that leaving the care system
brings.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Care
leavers and young people in the care system already face significant
disadvantage, from finding themselves homeless or under-attaining in
school for example, and they are far more likely to end up as
NEETS—people not in employment, education or
training. That failure to overcome serious disadvantage in
their lives will increase the costs to the state in the long run,
either through additional benefits, or through additional pressures on
the NHS or on council services

                           </div>such as housing. The unfortunate reality is that many young people who
leave care end up in prison because of the difficulties that they face
throughout their lives. All of that brings huge costs to the state, and
we want to avoid
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11052462000266">&#160;</a>
