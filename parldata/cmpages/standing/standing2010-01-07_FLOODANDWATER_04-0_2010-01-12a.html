<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div><a name="1001134000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001134000172"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): What a delight it is to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Martlew, with your
knowledge of flooding. You will not be calling me to speak too many
times, for
sure.</div><a name="1001134000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
said in the previous sitting that although I am sympathetic to new
clause 25, it is widely drawn, as I think that my hon. neighbour from
Tewkesbury would accept. I was making the point that the difficulty
with development in the Severn vale is that the River Severn, being
such a mercurial river, will inevitably change its course, causing all
manner of problems over where to locate housing and employment
development. The difficulty is that historically, as my hon. neighbour
from Cheltenham will know, the answer always seems to be development in
the Severn vale. That might be highly questionable, because we know
that it is an increasingly risky place for development, as we have seen
from what happened in 2007.</div>
<a name="1001134000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if we
were to encourage development outside the Severn vale&#151;in the
Cotswolds, where I would like to see more development, or the Forest of
Dean, both of which are the slowest growing parts of
Gloucestershire&#151;the difficulty is that the water will run off
the hills and come down into the Severn vale. We are damned if we do
and damned if we don&#146;t. We have a real problem over how we
develop parts of our countryside, and that is why this is a worthwhile
debate.</div>
<a name="1001134000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will offer
some definitive explanation from my constituency, as both colleagues
from Gloucestershire who preceded me in the debate used examples from
their constituencies. A number of us in the constituency opposed
development in a place called Ebley, which is not far from where I live
in the Stroud constituency, on the basis that there was likely to be
consequential flooding down the River Frome, which is a tributary of
the River Severn. We were pooh-poohed and told that the measures that
would be put in place would be such that the loss of greenfield land
and of meadow land, which has traditionally acted as a water reservoir
by sucking up water in times of surplus, would not be a problem. Modern
technology is such, we were told, that we would be able to come up with
solutions on development, and so it proved.</div>
<a name="1001134000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem is
that since that time, downstream in Bridgend and Stonehouse, where I
happen to live&#151;no one would pretend that the area has not been
flooded in the past, and the mills dotted all around the area show that
water has been a crucial requirement of everyday life since the 18th
century and even before&#151;the poor people living there have sadly
been flooded badly, first in 2007 and then every year since. I cannot
prove that that is the result of development, because I am not a water
engineer and have no specialist insight into cause and effect, but I
refer to consequential flooding, which is what the new clause is all
about, as something that really should
matter.</div><a name="1001134000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will conclude with two points. First, if there is evidence that a
development has caused problems elsewhere, that should be taken as
seriously as the development itself being regarded as a causation
factor in flooding. Secondly, we must not time-limit this, because
often the problems are of incremental duration in the sense that one
will not necessarily get an immediate impact from a
development&#151;it takes some time. The problem is we have used so
many of our important water storage facilities&#151;one could argue
that that has been happening 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>through time&#151;that the matter has become critical. I would always
argue that it is not the development itself that matters; it is where
the impact of the development will be felt. That is something we should
examine.</div><a name="1001134000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome what the hon. Member for Tewkesbury said. He has apologised to
me for not being in the room&#151;it is not because I am speaking,
but because he is elsewhere dealing with the problems of Ethiopia,
which are somewhat different from those that we face in
Gloucestershire. His new clause is
useful.</div><a name="1001134000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
my hon. Friend the Minister say how we can get fairness for people who
have not flooded historically, or who have flooded periodically but now
face regular flooding? How can they get greater protection and some
justice from the system? It might well be that we have to learn some
lessons and be much more careful about where we develop. That will
cause huge problems, not just in Gloucestershire, in terms of the
Severn vale, but perhaps all the way up the
country.</div><a name="1001134000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001134000173"></a><b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): I am warming to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s theme. Does he agree with the thrust of new clause
8, which is that one of the crucial powers that can help to tackle the
issue is the clear power for local authorities to refuse planning
permission on the grounds of high flood risk so that they can deal with
some of the things he is worried
about?</div><a name="1001134000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000174"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> I like giving powers to local authorities as long as
they use those powers purposely. I would blame my own local
authority&#151;Stroud district council&#151;for causing problems
because it chose to develop somewhere despite warnings. I am afraid
that local authorities cannot have it both ways. If they want that
responsibility, they will also have to take the blame when they have
chosen a particular site against expert advice. It might well
be&#151;the Minister might want to dwell on this&#151;that the
powers of the Bill will enable the Environment Agency to ensure that it
is listened to and its advice is acted upon. Too often what has
happened in that past is that either the Environment Agency has been
ignored or it has not been brought into the decision-making process at
all.</div><a name="1001134000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is an important debate. I have concentrated on new clause 25, because
that is the most widely drawn of the new clauses, but this is a problem
from which we cannot escape, and I hope the Minister will give us some
elucidation on how we can take forward sensible development. None of us
are against that, but we must ensure that if mistakes are made, people
are able to get some protection from the consequences of those
mistakes. More particularly, we need to learn from what we have done
wrong in the past and prevent undesirable development from occurring in
the wrong
place.</div><a name="1001134000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001134000175"></a><b class="B">Miss
Anne McIntosh</b> (Vale of York) (Con): I welcome you back to
the Chair, Mr. Martlew&#151;it is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship. Despite the absence of my hon. Friend the
Member for Tewkesbury, I congratulate him on new clause 25 and his
drafting ability. I will later consider its
contents.</div><a name="1001134000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was not convinced by the arguments of the hon. Member for Cheltenham
about new clauses 7 and 8. My concern with the drafting is that anyone
who was deemed to be living in a high flood risk would probably 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>be incapable of finding any insurance cover or of selling their home. I
am very concerned about the purpose of his new clauses in that
regard.</div><a name="1001134000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000176"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am extremely puzzled by the hon. Lady&#146;s
objection to the use of the wording &#147;high flood risk&#148;
because it is taken directly from Sir Michael Pitt and is used in the
measure proposed by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury, which talks about
determining such areas as &#147;flood risk areas&#148;. In fact,
our proposal is less prescriptive than
his.</div><a name="1001134000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000177"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I shall move on to the context in which that
phrase is contained in new clause 25, and I hope the hon. Gentleman
will agree with what I
say.</div><a name="1001134000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that PPS25 should be revisited on the basis of whether it was
the intention to have a proscription or moratorium on building on areas
at risk of flooding, although not necessarily floodplains.
Recommendation 18 of Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s review
states:</div><a name="1001134000140"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Local
Surface Water Management Plans, as set out under PPS25 and coordinated
by local authorities, should provide the basis for managing all local
flood
risk.&#148;</div><a name="1001134000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
progress report published by the Government last December sets out
where we are with the most recent editions of those plans. The progress
report states that &#163;9.7 million has been allocated to 77 local
authorities at risk from surface water flooding. I am sure the Minister
will accept that that is a small amount to be divided among 77 local
authorities&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> He will not
escape any earlier even though he is feeling the
cold.</div><a name="1001134000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000178"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Huw Irranca-Davies):</b> That is not an insignificant
amount of money and it has been focused, through an open application
system, on places at the highest risk. I know the hon. Lady will
recognise that it is not the only money that we have put into
flooding.</div><a name="1001134000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000179"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am most grateful for the Minister&#146;s
intervention.</div><a name="1001134000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
lot of the debate over the general aspect of risk management in the
clause comes back to the element of risk and how risk is
quantified. The risk of one in 1,000 years in the constituencies of
Copeland and Workington is on the scale of an act of God. It would be
difficult to prescribe the way in which to cope with that in any
legislation.</div><a name="1001134000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is my firm belief, however, that we can do a lot more with regard to
new developments putting existing developments at risk. For example, it
is inappropriate to build 300 houses in Filey on a field that floods,
and is at times of flood permanently waterlogged and saturated,
especially as the water flooding off the field has already flooded
Filey school and earlier developments. I am surprised that the Planning
Inspectorate can agree for that to go
ahead.</div><a name="1001134000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of issues that relate to this matter are not appropriate for
consideration here. However, PPS25 could be strengthened. For example,
we have established that the Environment Agency should have the status
of statutory consultee for major new developments. I believe that PPS25
would be further strengthened if we extended the status of statutory
consultee to water companies. We can elaborate on those arguments
elsewhere.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div><a name="1001134000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the context
of new clause 25, the Environment Agency should carry out the
assessment to determine the level of flood risk, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Tewkesbury goes on to establish in his new clause. I wonder
if the Minister will be minded to accept some of our arguments. He
might want the provisions to be worded slightly differently, but I
think that the new clause is well drafted and fits in with the context
of clause
3.</div><a name="1001134000149"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="1001134000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to ask the Minister about the impact assessment in the context of
the risk management aspects of the clause. We are told that the one-off
costs will be negligible although, under existing provisions, local
authorities are already investing &#163;27 million a year by means of
local levy. The point I put to the Minister is that page 10 of the
impact assessment
states:</div><a name="1001134000141"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
administrative burdens would be borne by
RFCCs&#148;&#151;</div><a name="1001134000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">regional
flood defence
committees&#151;</div><a name="1001134000142"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which
include local authorities and the Environment
Agency.&#148;</div><a name="1001134000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of funding risk management, I put it to the Minister is that it
seems that the same people are being asked to pay every single time.
The Minister is on record as welcoming the levy provisions and, indeed,
they are extremely important if clause 3 is to work effectively.
However, will he share with us some of the concerns that were probably
raised at the time of consultation, particularly about what the cost of
the administrative burden will
be?</div><a name="1001134000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the benefits of individual risk management projects are
reviewed constantly by the Treasury through the Green Book, and that
the risk can be reduced in certain situations, which are set out on
page 14. However, will the Minister respond to my concerns that their
preferred option of 2(a) in the impact
assessment&#151;</div><a name="1001134000143"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Extend
the scope of the RFDC &#145;local levy&#146; to allow funding to be
raised from local authorities for coastal erosion
projects&#148;&#151;</div><a name="1001134000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">will
put real hardship on those bodies? How does the Minister imagine that
clause 3 will be given effect in these circumstances, because I do not
believe that the administrative burden is neutral? There is a very real
cost to be looked at and, as I say, the same people have to pay it each
time. I will be most interested to hear the Minister&#146;s comments
about new clause 25 and his response to my concerns about the
cost-benefit analysis and the administrative burdens that are placed on
those bodies that are already finding it hard to raise the funds
required in the
Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000180"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> May I begin by thanking hon. Members for
what has been a very good debate on the amendments and clause? I will
deal with the issues roughly in the order they were raised, although
some of them overlap.</div>
<a name="1001134000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall begin
by mentioning the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud
and will then come on to the remarks of the hon. Member for Tewkesbury,
who started off the debate. My hon. Friend rightly signalled the
difficulty of getting the balance right between the needs of business,
the need for affordable housing, the need to find the right place for
development 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>and the risk of flood. I noted his comments about the responsibilities
of local authorities. In a moment, my comments will echo that and I
will also talk about the responsibility for implementing PPS25 robustly
and effectively right down the whole chain, what progress has been made
and what more needs to be
done.</div><a name="1001134000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is undoubtedly the case that development plans need to take real
account of PPS25. We need to get the strategic flood risk assessments
right and ensure they are robust. Across the whole line of spatial
strategies, we need to ensure that flood risk management proves to be
part and parcel of development planning in any local area or region. I
will come on to how we can do that. If hon. Members will bear with me,
in a moment, I want to go into some detail on
that.</div><a name="1001134000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me begin by addressing the issues raised by the hon. Member for
Tewkesbury. I have great sympathy with him&#151;indeed, during the
floods of 2007, I was in a friend&#146;s house where the water rose
through the cellars. He was not affected as badly as most people, but
the whole of his cellar was completely flooded and the water came up
into the ground floor. At that point, thank goodness, the water
stopped. However, I have seen the devastation that happens&#151;one
sees it in Cumbria and in Hull&#151;and how people are affected by
such a situation. So, getting the balance right is very
important.</div><a name="1001134000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause that the hon. Gentleman has tabled would require the Environment
Agency to determine flood risk areas across England and Wales and would
oblige it formally to object to any planning application in one of
those flood risk areas, where it represents 10 or more houses or covers
an area of land greater than half an acre.</div>
<a name="1001134000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Areas at risk
from river and sea flooding in England are already found in existing
national policy in PPS25, which is based on the annual probability of
flooding, and mapped by the Environment Agency. Local authorities
undertake local strategic flood risk assessments, which build on and
refine information in the Environment Agency&#146;s flood map and
identify areas at risk from all sources of flooding, including surface
water flooding, and take into account the impacts of climate
change.</div>
<a name="1001134000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of
the proposed clause would be to compel the Environment Agency to object
to all proposed developments above a specified size in a designated
flood-risk area regardless of whether the agency was content that the
individual proposal took account of the flood risk, that it would be
safe and not increase flood risk overall. It is a categoric proposal
that we have here that has no flexibility for the Environment Agency to
look at the plans, work with them and put forward
suggestions.</div><a name="1001134000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
determining the planning application, the local planning authority
would still be required to take account of all material
considerations&#151;social, economic and
environmental&#151;including the issue of flood risk, the flood risk
assessment prepared by the applicant and proposals for reducing or
managing that flood risk as well as representations and objections
received from statutory consultees and other interested
parties.</div><a name="1001134000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that hon. Members will be aware of this, but let us refresh
memories of how this is set up to work. I will come to how well it is
working and what more needs to be done. Planning policy makes it very
clear that flood risk must be assessed at all stages of the planning 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>process&#151;regional, local plan and individual planning
applications&#151;to avoid this worry about inappropriate development
in areas of risk of flooding and to direct development away from areas
at the highest risk. The next stage, regional spatial strategies,
should establish locational criteria for regionally significant land
uses, including the identification of broad locations, and that should
be informed by the regional flood risk appraisal.</div>
<a name="1001134000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The local
planning authorities establish specific land use or housing allocations
through the development plan documents. They are informed by their own
strategic flood risk assessment, and target development to lower flood
risk areas wherever possible. The local strategic flood risk
assessments&#151;as required to be carried out by local planning
authorities in PPS25&#151;in Calder Valley and Isle of Wight are
examples that show how our policy approach has played a key role in
influencing the core strategies for those local authority areas, so
that the most appropriate types of development are at the most suitable
locations. In a moment, I will come to an example of where it has gone
wrong and what happens in that situation. The core of my argument is
not that PPS25 is wrong&#151;we have been reviewing it and improving
and will continue to do so&#151;but that we must ensure that the
guidance is followed through at all levels. We all have a role to play
to push our own local authorities to do
that.</div><a name="1001134000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
often ask why the Government or Environment Agency allow development to
take place in areas of flooding. Why not stop building in those areas?
My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud mentioned some of the difficulties
with that. If we do it in one area, it impacts on another area and so
on. It must be done in a well-considered way. We have very strong
planning policy in place that ensures that flood risk is properly
assessed and taken into account by local planning authorities. The aim
should always be&#151;Committee members can hear me say it now,
people can read it in this transcript and it is in our PPS25 as
well&#151;to locate new development away from flood risk wherever
possible. The hon. Member for Tewkesbury, who cannot be with us for the
moment, made the point that Tewkesbury is not the same as London. I
know that it is not, but we must accept that significant parts of the
country are at risk of flooding. We cannot categorically ban all new
development.</div><a name="1001134000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001134000181"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000183"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Let me just finish my point.</div>
<a name="1001134000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">We cannot
afford to put that blight on whole communities. MPs come to me and ask,
&#147;Minister, why has the Environment Agency objected to this
development, as it has just killed the centre of my town?&#148; So
there is a counter-argument.</div>
<a name="1001134000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pretty much
the whole of Hull would be included. We do not have any Hull MPs here
today, but I do not think that they would want me to say that there
should be no development in Hull whatsoever, because the whole city is
affected. Two thirds of Portsmouth is affected. We have no Portsmouth
MPs here today, but I am pretty sure that they would be telling me the
same. They would want to see the rigorous implementation of PPS25 and
it being put into the spatial strategies. Most of London 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>would be affected, including my own flat, as would the east of England.
Those are all in areas of high flood
risk.</div><a name="1001134000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue is this: how do we provide the homes and development we need and
at the same time reduce flood risk? We need to ensure that, wherever
possible, we build where it does not flood, and that when we do have to
build in high flood-risk areas, we ensure it is as safe and flood-proof
as
possible.</div><a name="1001134000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000184"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Does the Minister understand that we are not
asking for the Government to force people not to build, but to force
them to consider properly the building, which is a completely different
issue? Also, there is not necessarily the desire for the level of
building that the Government would like to happen. Some people might
feel that less would be proper.</div>
<a name="1001134000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000185"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I fully understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point. However, the implications of some of the
amendments are to make the Environment Agency have to object, not to
work with, not to say, &#147;Actually, we can see a way forward here
if you will do X, Y and Z&#148;, as it has done in other instances. I
will come to an example in a moment of where that did not work and
explain the action it took.</div>
<a name="1001134000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman and I are aiming at the same thing, but I am explaining how
we should do that. We carried out a review last year of PPS25, which
I&#146;ll come to in a moment, and it showed what progress has been
made and what more needs to be done. We should be focusing our
attention on ensuring that, from the regional level to the local level,
PPS25 is adhered to. If there is a case for building in a flood-risk
area, everything has to be put in place to ensure that the risk of
flooding is mitigated, because we simply cannot ban all development in
those
areas.</div><a name="1001134000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000186"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister is wrong to say that the amendments
are about banning all development on flood plains or in flood-risk
areas. Certainly, new clause 8 would simply give a clear
power to local authorities, but it does not say that they absolutely
have to ban it. There is clear evidence from the Association of British
Insurers and others that many of the houses the Government are planning
to build are likely to be built in flood-risk areas. The hon. Member
for Tewkesbury and I both mentioned spatial strategies because planning
inspectors on the ground amending regional spatial strategies or
putting in amendments proposed by the Secretary of State are in
practice choosing areas that are quite explicitly flood-risk areas.
Once they are in the regional spatial strategy there is a huge impetus
towards developing those areas, and the Environment Agency cannot
object on the basis of anything outside its own competence for main
rivers and sea
flooding.</div><a name="1001134000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000187"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes my point for me.
We need to get this right. In the wide objectives we have at a local
and national level, he, like me, wants to see development and
affordable homes, but they need to fit within the strategies. We need
to ensure that they do, and ask questions when they do not, both of
local authorities and also more widely along the food chain.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div><a name="1001134000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will explain
what happens when that does not work, because I acknowledge the
examples that have been given. In some cases, because it is a localised
issue, people will say, &#147;Why on earth was this allowed to
happen?&#148; I have an example from my constituency of an area left
over from a coal washeries, which has never been flooded and which
people are desperate to develop, but the Environment Agency says that
it is on a flood plain. It has never, ever flooded, and a few years ago
a big hotelier put in an offer to develop it, in a coal-mining
constituency. The argument is that that has to fit with the advice, and
the Environment Agency&#146;s advice must be heeded, or good reasons
and measures must be put in place. That is my
argument.</div>
<a name="1001134000150"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000188"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> That is not
true.</div><a name="1001134000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000189"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I have not even addressed the remaining
issue. Let me come to it because it might help. My point of reference
was the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury, rather
than that tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham, which is slightly
different.</div><a name="1001134000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
refer the Committee to Restormel borough council, which is part of
Cornwall council. It is an example of a local authority whose core
strategy development plan documents in 2007 were found to be unsound.
One of the grounds for that lack of soundness was that a strategic
flood risk assessment was not carried out before the core strategy was
submitted. Results from the assessment later demonstrated that there
were flood risks in the St. Blazey, Par and Mevagissey areas. It was
unclear how the identified rural service centres would function and
develop in the future. There are opportunities to say that local
authorities and development plans are wanting and to object to
them.</div><a name="1001134000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a final buck-stop, which I can see happening. If there is
disagreement with the decision of a local authority or Environment
Agency advice is completely overridden, I would want to know about it.
Also, people can have a judicial review of the decision to see whether
it was sound and whether the full process was gone through. I have seen
that happen.</div>

Roger Williams</b> (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD): Will the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000191"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Let me turn to the new clauses and I will
then give way to the hon. Gentleman. I am not sure whether I will be
able to persuade hon. Members. The hon. Member for Cheltenham has
already indicated that he will press for a vote. However, I will do my
best.</div><a name="1001134000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clauses 7 and 8 would require that an area of high flood risk is
defined in local development frameworks and provide for a local
planning authority to cite high flood risk as grounds for refusing
planning permission in a high flood-risk area. That is the gist of the
new clauses. It is of course important that flood risk is recognised
and properly taken into account in planning decisions. I have tried to
explain that that approach  is already a central component of
existing national planning policy.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div><a name="1001134000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Environment
Agency&#146;s flood map shows areas at risk of river and sea flooding
based on the annual probability of flooding as defined in PPS25,
&#147;Development and Flood Risk&#148;. It requires local strategic
flood risk assessments to be done by local authorities to build on and
refine the information in the Environment Agency&#146;s flood map,
taking into account other sources of flooding. Similar arrangements are
in place in Wales under the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s
technical advice note
15.</div><a name="1001134000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">PPS25
emphasises the strategic approach to flood risk management. It stresses
the need to consider flood risk as early as possible in the planning
process in an integrated way. The policy makes it clear that flood risk
must be assessed at all stages of the process&#151;regional, local
and individual planning applications&#151;to avoid inappropriate
development.</div><a name="1001134000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
SFRA provides the evidence base for preparing local policies in local
development frameworks that avoid and manage all types of flood risk to
and from development. Those policies should refer to areas of flood
risk identified in the SFRA, where relevant. Regulations to implement
the European floods directive further strengthen the requirement to
produce the SFRA.</div>
<a name="1001134000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the local
authority does not think that it can deliver the housing targets
safely, it can take its evidence to the Government office and the
regional planning body. The Lincolnshire coast study is a good example
of local authorities taking just such a constructive
approach.</div><a name="1001134000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000192"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I have to say that the Minister is simply wrong
about how that is working on the ground. I have been in planning
inquiries where the local authority has argued against a development,
but has constantly had the regional spatial strategy quoted back at it
and where planning inspectors have spent a matter of minutes in a local
area before allocating an area to housing. The Environment Agency has
confirmed to me that it does not have powers to refuse or object to
planning applications when the flooding is as a result of surface water
flooding. The FRA and PPS25 must include all forms of flooding, but the
EA advice does not.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000193"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> To deal with that point directly, if the
hon. Gentleman has been informed that surface water flooding cannot be
taken into account, that is
incorrect.</div><a name="1001134000080"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000196"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Pitt&#146;s recommendation 5 made it clear
that there should be a presumption against building in high flood risk
areas. I take entirely the Minister&#146;s point that the practice
guide has been updated, but I think that in the view of many members of
the Committee it simply does not go far enough. That is a point
of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>difference between the two main parties. Where the Government persist in
wishing to build on areas at  risk of, or prone to, flooding,
how do they answer recommendation 11 of
Pitt:</div><a name="1001134000144"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Building
regulations should be revised to ensure that all new or refurbished
buildings in high flood-risk areas are flood resistant or
resilient&#148;?</div><a name="1001134000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a point of information, I am alarmed that the consultation on the
building controls has been pushed back from summer 2009 to summer
2011-12. That sets alarm bells ringing. If Pitt is to be followed
through, there should be a presumption
that&#151;</div><a name="1001134000085"></a>

will turn to resilience in subsequent amendments, and I am happy to
debate the matter then. The Pitt review shows good progress across a
range of issues, but there are areas in which we need to go faster. I
hope that the hon. Lady will acknowledge that the Pitt update

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000200"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Let me make some progress. I want to speak
to some of the points being raised, and I will then take the
intervention.</div><a name="1001134000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
point was made about the updated planning policy statement. Let me read
for the record exactly what the updated guidance, which we constantly
keep under review, states in section 5 on key planning
objectives:</div><a name="1001134000145"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
aims of planning policy on development and flood risk are to ensure
that flood risk is taken into account at all stages in the planning
process to avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of
flooding, and to direct development away from areas at highest
risk.&#148;</div><a name="1001134000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
matter is in there; the guidance has been strengthened. I understand
what the hon. Lady says, that it might not go as far as she or others
want, but it has been strengthened. In his review, Pitt agreed that the
policy within PPS25 is right and sound and that it is the right
approach. He said, however, and I also say, that it needs to be
rigorously applied. The point of difference here seems to be whether we
take what we have got&#151;what has been reviewed and
strengthened&#151;and show how it can be taken from the regional
level all the way down to the local, and make it work. We all have a
responsibility to do that, and to demand of our local authorities and
others that they  do
it.</div><a name="1001134000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000201"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> The Minister is in a difficult position, and he
is trying to have it both ways. I think that understands that we all
agree that development should not take place in high-risk areas, but we
also know that planning law says that it is difficult for a development
plan to say that such and such a development will not take place. The
planning phraseology is &#147;there will be a presumption
against&#148;. The Minister is trying to defend that when he knows
that we all, and the Bill, should be trenchant on the point that there
should be no development in high flood-risk
areas.</div><a name="1001134000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000202"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> No, I could not disagree more. The
approach that the hon. Gentleman has just outlined would rule out
economic regeneration in Hull, in much of the east of England, and in
Portsmouth and London. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>I understand where hon. Members are coming from, but I think that what
we are trying to push at is to get the process right. We know that it
has not been perfect&#151;far from it. Let me expand, to say where we
have got
to.</div><a name="1001134000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000203"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Minister, we are in danger of repeating
ourselves a
little.</div><a name="1001134000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000204"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Indeed. I just want to give an update on
where we are. Flood risk has to be a key factor in planning decisions,
but it is not the only one. That is the important thing. Economic
development and local circumstances are important, and the EA
acknowledges that it is not in a position to take a view on those
things. It is to do with democratic accountability and local
accountability. It is for the local authorities, which are
democratically elected accountable bodies, to do it. From what has been
put to me, it sounds as though people are saying, &#147;We cannot get
development happening because the EA has objected.&#148; I hear that
and I also hear the opposite, as I have said. Where that is happening I
would like to hear more about it, and we need to push on that as
Members of
Parliament.</div><a name="1001134000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
evidence is that the process is working in the vast majority of cases
and is now working better than when it was introduced. I am not the
only one saying that. In more than 96 per cent. of cases where the EA
has objected to planning applications on flood-risk grounds, the final
decision outcome is in line with the EA advice. Most local
authorities&#151;85 per cent. of them in England&#151;have
completed the strategic flood risk assessment as required under PPS25,
with most others expected to complete soon. Having said that it is not
just my saying this, may I mention what Nick Starling from the ABI said
last week in the afternoon evidence session? The challenge was put down
early on that insurers will walk away from this issue. I throw that
challenge back: that is not what the ABI and its members are saying.
Nick Starling
said:</div><a name="1001134000146"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Huge
steps have been made in terms of planning...we have seen a
dramatic reduction in the number of planning permission consents given
in high-risk areas, so we want to see that
continue.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Flood and
Water Management Public Bill Committee, </i>7 January 2010; c. 45,
Q66.]</div><a name="1001134000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that the process is not perfect and that wrong decisions will
be made, or it will not be applied robustly enough. Our job&#151;mine
as a Minister and ours as MPs&#151;is to ensure that that happens.
But we are going in the right direction when the ABI is saying that it
has seen the improvement, when I can quote figures that show an
independent assessment, and when I can mention the Department for
Communities and Local Government&#146;s review in June last year
showing the progress that has been made, which shows what more needs to
be done in applying the measure properly and which I will happily send
to Committee
members.</div><a name="1001134000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Cheltenham mentioned the issue of the wrong type of
water. PPS25 covers all types of flood risk and is not just selective.
I have also mentioned the updated guidance. I think that I have covered
every
aspect.</div><a name="1001134000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000205"></a>The

going to make progress, we should have shorter interventions and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000206"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I will endeavour to be brief, because we have
gone round most of the
issues.</div><a name="1001134000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to return to the matter of which types of flood risk are
included in what. It is clear that PPS25, which I have in my sweaty
palm, covers all forms of flooding and it is clear that strategic flood
risk assessments and even developers&#146; own flood risk assessments
should address all forms of flood risk. However, it is not
clear&#151;certainly not to the Environment Agency, from staff that I
have talked to&#151;whether its advice and input into this process
has addressed all forms of flood risk. Although it is the expert
agency, despite what the Minister has assured me, my strong impression,
and its impression at local level, and certainly at regional level, is
that it cannot give advice on anything other than main river flooding.
For instance, its flood maps are river flooding maps. We do not
yet have all the localised data for inundation by surface

I mentioned in my opening remarks on the clause&#151;the green area
of Leckhampton uphill from the area of Warden Hill, which flooded in
the 2007 floods&#151;was affected by surface water flooding and
causing a lot of problems. The EA apparently does not feel that it can
object to that in planning appeals. So we end up arguing in planning
appeals, with the local authority, despite or because of whatever flood
risk assessment that it has done, objecting to a proposal, but with the
EA having withdrawn its objections as the definitive expert body on
flooding, and with the developers quoting another Government
policy&#151;the regional spatial strategy&#151;which absolutely,
clearly allocates an area to housing, despite our having maps from
consultants showing large parts of it at flood risk from surface water
flooding. Clearly, things are not matching up. I accept that the
Minister wishes it was not so and wishes that this should not be the
way it works and that strategic regional flood risk assessments should
stop such things happening, but the bottom line is that it is not being
stopped at the moment. We need something that is clearer and stronger
in law to make it clear that at the planning appeal stage, a local
authority can produce the kind of maps that we have for Leckhampton,
which is near my constituency, and say, &#147;Look at this map. It is
clearly a high flood-risk area, which is grounds for us to refuse the
appeal. The development will not go ahead because the chances are that
those houses will flood when they are built and they will make flooding
worse downhill.&#148;</div>

is what the amendments are designed to achieve. They are not to rule
out all development in flood plains. They are not even designed to rule
out all development in flood-risk areas. In cases in which it is proven
that a development is inappropriate, the amendments will give local
authorities a clear power to trump other ill-informed Government
policies such as regional spatial strategies coming down from on high
and saying, &#147;Regardless of the environmental consequences, this
area shall be developed.&#148; On those grounds, when the time
comes&#151;I think next week&#151;I will still be pressing the new

the provisions of the bill by both Houses of Parliament under the
provisions of the European Communities Act
1972.&#148;</div>
<a name="1001134000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000208"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> At the same time as the Bill was published, the
Government laid before the House and the Committee the EU regulations
entitled the Flood Risk Regulations 2009 No. 3042. As I understand it,
the procedure is that the regulations are subject to negative
resolution, so I have a series of questions to put to the Minister. It
is our preference to consider them as part of the legislation.
Obviously, we are able to amend the main part of the legislation, but I
presume that we are not entitled to amend the text of the statutory
instrument.</div>
<a name="1001134000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must declare
an interest here. I am a member of the Select Committee on Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs. An exchange between the Secretary of State and
the Chairman of the Select Committee made it clear that if the
Government had not been able to pass the primary legislation, section
2(2) of the European Communities Act would
apply.</div>
<a name="1001134000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000209"></a>The
Chairman:</b> May I clarify something? If you wish to table a
new clause to amend the regulations at this stage, it is possible to do
that. Obviously, when it goes to a Delegated Legislation Committee, you
cannot make such an amendment. I hope that clarifies the
position.</div><a name="1001134000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000210"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> That is most helpful. Perhaps I can find out
what time such amendments might be
taken.</div><a name="1001134000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000211"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am sure we can find that out for
you.</div><a name="1001134000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000212"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Will the Minister confirm whether that procedure
has been approved by the European Commission, so we that we know that
we are on the side of the angels in that regard?</div>
<a name="1001134000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, the regulations were published on 19 November and are in
two parts: the explanatory memorandum and the general provision. Will
the Minister tell us what the relationship is between the contents of
the parts relating to preliminary assessment maps, the duty to identify
flood-risk areas through the Environment Agency, the duty to identify
flood-risk areas through the lead local authorities, the review of the
Environment Agency and all the parts relating to maps? I want to be
clear in my own mind as to the relationship between those parts of the
regulations and the content of the Bill.</div>
<a name="1001134000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proceeding to
the explanatory memorandum, obviously it is the intention to
incorporate the flood-risk parts of the flood directive into UK law. I
understand from the public consultation that only 5 per cent. were
specifically against the policy proposals. My specific concern relates
to page 11 of the explanatory memorandum to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>flood regulations, where it talks about the annual costs being within
the range of &#163;6.26 million to &#163;6.66 million. Is the
Minister absolutely convinced that that is the total, and how will that
amount be split between the work of the Environment Agency and the
upper-tier
authorities?</div><a name="1001134000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000213"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We are debating stand part, not the regulations
themselves.</div><a name="1001134000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000214"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Yes. I think you will find, Mr.
Martlew, that the regulations relate to the flood-risk management
functions. You will see&#151;it is my understanding&#151;that the
regulations are part and parcel of that. Will the Minister clarify
those points and explain how that will be the
case?</div><a name="1001134000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
it is appropriate to do so here, I would like to raise the following
issue, which may also be raised later in consideration of the Bill.
There is some concern that although it is right that upper-tier county
councils should be the flood risk management authority for highways,
particularly for SUDS in relation to highways, the planning aspect for
new developments, particularly in relation to the discussion we have
just had, is the lower tier&#151;the district authority. Is the
Minister happy in himself that, in fact, those responsibilities are
properly recognised in the
Bill?</div><a name="1001134000139"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000215"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady as
she spoke to the clause and, to some extent, to the new clause she has
put forward. I say to the Minister that the Bill in general has been
very good at ensuring that those powers that have been devolved to the
Welsh Assembly are recognised and that powers will be given to the
relevant Welsh Assembly Minister or to the Assembly itself. If the
Minister replies to the clause and the new clause, he can spell out how
the proposal could be made compliant in terms of the devolution Act and
the Government of Wales Act to ensure that any flood-risk management
function is scrutinised by not only both Houses in this place, but the
Welsh
Assembly.</div><a name="1001134000118"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000216"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> In line with your dictum, Mr.
Martlew, I will try to keep my contribution short and to the point. I
thank the hon. Member for Vale of York for introducing the topic. The
directive itself will go through the normal scrutiny. As she rightly
acknowledged, we consulted on draft provisions to implement the
directive as part of the draft Bill&#151;clauses 50 to
63&#151;published on 21 April.</div>
<a name="1001134000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were
grateful for the many consultation responses received and for the
scrutiny of the draft Bill by the EFRA Committee, of which the hon.
Lady is a member. We took account of both in bringing forward the
measures, which the House has had before it since the Queen&#146;s
Speech, that relate to both the implementing regulations for the
directive and the Bill we are debating today. The implementing
regulations for the directive benefited greatly from those
inputs.</div>
<a name="1001134000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specific
reference was made to the regulations in the written ministerial
statement of 19 November when the Bill was introduced, in the
Government response to the EFRA Committee report and the response to
the consultation that was published. All interested parties, including
Parliament, have had an opportunity to scrutinise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>our plans for transposing the directive. The regulations were
scrutinised by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and by the
House of Lords Select Committee on the Merits of Statutory Instruments
in the normal way.</div>
<a name="1001134000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Laying the
regulations on the day the Flood and Water Management Bill was
introduced provided an opportunity for each of them to be considered by
the House of Lords Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, and
officials provided clarification to that Committee. It also enabled
Members of Parliament more generally to consider both the Bill and the
regulations together. If further consideration of the Bill should
result in any discrepancy, however unlikely, between it and the
regulations, it would be entirely possible for us to amend the
regulations accordingly, by statutory instrument with the negative
procedure.</div><a name="1001134000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
did we go ahead with that measure? The hon. Lady asked whether the
procedure had been approved by the European Commission. As Ministers,
we always seek to minimise the risk of infraction, and we know that it
would be good to get the regulations in place in a timely fashion so
that local authorities and others can get on with the business that the
regulations allow them to do, but on a parallel time scale to the Bill.
The European Commission will ultimately review whether the directive
has been properly implemented, and will take infraction proceedings if
it thinks that it has not. Using this way forward has minimised the
risk of that, and things are well under way.</div>
<a name="1001134000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the tiers
of authorities, the allocation of responsibility in the regulations is
consistent with that in the Bill. On the estimate of annual cost, I do
not have that to hand, but if the hon. Lady is happy, I will gladly
write to her and other members of the Committee with a breakdown of the
cost
estimates.</div><a name="1001134000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire referred to WAG&#146;s role in
this, and he is right that we have gone to the nth degree in working
with our compatriots in Wales to ensure that this fits. The clause 2(2)
regulations on the directive apply to England and Wales, and WAG have
consulted on them. If hon. Members do not feel that the procedure is
right, there is an opportunity to pray against the regulations. I
cannot answer for the powers of WAG Members to do that. If Members
prayed against the regulations, we would need to bring the legislation
back. I am keen to ensure that the legislation moves ahead in the time
scale that we have set for
it.</div><a name="1001134000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000217"></a>Miss

what role, if any, does the Crown Estate have under the clause? Is it
referred to in any shape or
form?</div><a name="1001134000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000218"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am seeking some divine inspiration on
the Crown Estate. I had not anticipated a question about that under the

now.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div><a name="1001134000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000219"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000220"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Inspiration has arrived. I am pleased to
say that the Crown Estate is not a risk management authority as defined
by the Bill, but it can be added. We have the power and ability in the
Bill to add bodies subsequently that we clearly identify as risk
management authorities. We have the most significant players
here&#151;those that can easily be defined as risk management
authorities&#151;but if, over time, things changed, we could add
others. The Crown Estate is not currently specified in the
Bill.</div><a name="1001134000152"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000221"></a>Miss

Minister take the opportunity to write to members of the Committee if
there are any other bodies that may fall into that category? That would
be
helpful.</div><a name="1001134000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000222"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Thinking of the Marine and Coastal Access Act
2009, presumably the Marine Management Organisation might be one such
body. Surely it ought to have some responsibility for managing coastal
erosion. The hon. Lady might want to add that to her
list.</div><a name="1001134000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000223"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001134000225"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I think the issue might come up when
considering subsequent amendments. May I suggest that we deal with who
should be identified as appropriate under subsequent amendments? It
might then not be necessary to write to the Committee with a list of
those organisations, although I am happy to do so. The nature of the
matter is that we need the flexibility to change over time. I therefore
do not have a definitive list. We have included the flexibility to
change the list in subsequent guidance and regulations. We will deal
with the issue under subsequent
amendments.</div><a name="1001134000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000188"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> The Committee will be aware that landowners have
a number of roles to play under the Bill. I am sure that they will be
called upon with the increased levy and that many are members of the
current 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>flood defence committee. In terms of flood risk management, landowners
are first and foremost risk managers in their own right. The purpose of
the amendment is to recognise
that.</div><a name="10011314000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of years ago, successive Governments made capital grants
available to enable landowners to lay drains and irrigation channels,
which they are now maintaining at their own expense. They pay their
council taxes and so pay towards the role of district councils. Many in
Yorkshire, East Anglia and other parts of the country where internal
drainage boards exist pay substantial fees towards their work, which in
turn fund in large part the work of the Environment Agency. At every
level, landowners have a great role to play in the funding of flood
risk management. In earlier debates, we spoke about crop protection
where land is waterlogged or saturated and the crops are lost.
Landowners can suffer substantial losses in that
regard.</div><a name="10011314000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to recognise that landowners are interested
parties. We would like to include them in the definition so that they
are consulted. I hope that we have identified the right place for that
recognition to appear. I hope that the Minister and the Committee will
look favourably on the amendment because we are asking a lot from
landowners. It would bring them in and recognise them as risk managers
in their own right if we added them to the list of risk management
authorities alongside the Environment Agency, the lead local flood
authorities, the district councils, the internal drainage
boards&#151;I am delighted they are in the list&#151;water
companies and highway authorities. It is a great omission that
landowners are not in the list. Adding them would make it
complete.</div><a name="10011314000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
the addition of Natural England would be appropriate and, as can be
seen, a lot of names support that. I understand that Natural England is
the primary channel of funds for many flood alleviation schemes, in
particular for EU-funded money. It seems natural to add Natural
England. Obviously, for the sake of drafting, I would like landowners
to be included as (g) and Natural England as (h). If we could agree on
that, that would be great progress.</div>
<a name="10011314000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000189"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> I shall speak to amendment 114, which stands in
my name and those of my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham and
others. It would include Natural England among the list of risk
management authorities. Indeed, the hon. Member for Vale of York has
covered several of the issues that have led me to that conclusion. My
hon. Friend has raised the issue of water management and flood
mitigation being not only about construction and man-made features, but
about the land and using the landscape to ensure that the water that
falls on it is not discharged rapidly, but at a controlled
rate.</div>
<a name="10011314000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">Natural
England has among its statutory powers the ability to conserve and
enhance existing landscape features and even to create new landscape
features. As such, Natural England is an integral part of risk
management and should be included as an authority. Indeed, the National
Farmers Union and the Country Land and Business Association have
already developed a protocol with Natural England on coastal
protection, allowing some of the coastal defences to break down so that
land can be taken back by the sea. That is obviously a delicate issue,
but one that has been advanced by the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div>protocol and the close involvement of Natural England. I think that it
would be a good idea to include Natural England in the list of risk
management authorities.</div>
<a name="10011314000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to amendment 8, tabled by the hon. Member for Vale of York, I can
understand why she would include landowners in the list, because they
do manage the risk of flooding. My only reservation is that that would
increase the number of risk management authorities by an enormous
amount. Indeed, within the Bill there are duties on those authorities
that some landowners might not think appropriate for individuals and
private businesses. Therefore, I would have a little caution on that. I
am not trying to do the Minister&#146;s business, but I will say that
there are amendments to be considered later that will make it a duty
for various organisations to consult more closely with landowners and
involve them in that way. I therefore press the Minister to include
Natural England, but I would treat the issue of landowners with a
little more
concern.</div><a name="10011314000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000190"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The hon. Members for Vale of York and for
Upminster have tabled amendment 8, which would add any landowners with
a relevant interest to the list of risk management authorities, but
there appears to be no clear definition of relevant interest. That is
an interesting aspect of the matter, and I know that we could dance
around that with regard to drafting and clarification, but there is
something more fundamental to consider.</div>
<a name="10011314000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">To pick up on
the points made by the hon. Gentleman, this is not the part of the Bill
in which to tackle concerns about the contribution of private property
and individual landowners to flood risk. The bodies defined in the Bill
are public bodies, including the water companies in their capacity as
public undertakers. They have statutory functions and are given powers
and public duties. They administer and receive public funding. They are
held to account by regulators and pubic law. Therefore, the list is a
clear category of organisations. Adding landowners as a class to that
group simply would not work in that context, as they are not public
authorities. In fact, heaven forfend the burden we would put upon them
if we suddenly recognised them as such.</div>
<a name="10011314000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise
that there are issues with the contribution of private property to
flood risk and flood risk management. We consulted on that in depth
under the draft Bill and it was one of the most complex areas. Policy
in this area needs further careful consideration, which we are actively
undertaking on the back of the draft Bill. It might be best taken
forward alongside linked areas, such as changes to IDBs, at a future
legislative opportunity. I have signalled previously that we see the
need to return and bring forward some of those additional
aspects.</div><a name="10011314000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Natural England and the flood alleviation responsibilities, I am
informed that what has been said is not correct. However, clause 29
provides a power to add new authorities to the list of risk management
authorities. There is good flexibility under the Bill where necessary.
Over time, we need to consider whether there are additional bodies that
have flood risk management functions. As appropriate, those will be
brought
forward.</div><a name="10011314000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire tabled amendment 114, which
would include Natural England in the list of risk management
authorities. I understand his point that Natural England is our
principal environmental adviser and a source of great wisdom 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>and expertise. I accept the point made by him and the hon. Member for
Cheltenham about the need to think about what can be done for landscape
biodiversity and so forth and I am sure we will return to that point.
However, Natural England currently has no statutory flood and coastal
erosion risk management functions. As such, it has not been included as
a risk management
authority.</div><a name="10011314000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I just mentioned in response to the hon. Member for Vale of York,
clause 29 provides for Ministers to make an order that allows
responsibilities to be reassigned between authorities or for additional
authorities to be listed as risk management authorities. Therefore, if
Natural England or another body assumed flood or coastal risk
management functions, which is not outside the realms of possibility,
it would be possible to list it as a flood risk management
authority.</div><a name="10011314000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two other matters that I would like to bring to the attention of
hon. Members in respect of clause 29. First, we are
considering whether it would be appropriate to amend clause 29(1) to
clarify that new bodies can be added to the list of risk management
authorities.</div><a name="10011314000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
we are considering whether clause 29(6) accurately implements the
devolution settlement. If an intended reassignment of responsibility
was from or to a cross-border risk management authority or another
body, it is not clear where the ministerial responsibility would lie
for making such an order. Is it with me, the Secretary of State or down
the M4? That provision may have to be more precise about when an order
under the section should be made by Welsh Ministers and when by the
Secretary of State. If further provision is required to clarify that
important but technical issue, we will table an amendment on
Report.</div><a name="10011314000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">With

Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments 44 to 52, 54 to 57, 59 to 61 and 79 to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000194"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Due to my obstreperous nature, I hope that
the Committee will agree to these essentially technical and
administrative amendments, which clarify the position of risk
management authorities in relation to the national strategies and
guidance for England and Wales. In particular, they relate to
cross-border internal drainage
boards.</div><a name="10011314000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
43 introduces the terms &#147;English risk management
authority,&#148; &#147;Welsh risk management authority&#148; and
&#147;cross-border internal drainage board.&#148; English risk
management authorities are defined as the Environment Agency risk
management authorities that exercise their functions wholly in England,
IDBs for a district that is wholly or mainly in England and water
companies that exercise functions in relation to an area in
England.</div>
<a name="10011314000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Welsh risk
management authorities are defined as risk management authorities that
exercise their functions wholly in Wales, IDBs for a district that is
wholly or mainly in Wales, and water companies that exercise functions
in relation to an area in Wales. Amendments 44 to 46 make
associated amendments to clause 7. Their effect is that the national
strategy will have to specify these English risk management authorities
and their functions. The Environment Agency must consult those
authorities and issue guidance about how they should exercise their
duties under clauses 13 and 14. Although they are technical, the
amendments are crucial to the effective operation of the arrangements
set out in the Bill. Amendments 47 and 48 have the equivalent effect
for
Wales.</div><a name="10011314000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
49 to 52 make technical amendments to clause 11 that simplify the
drafting of paragraphs (1) and (3), and introduce the concept of
English risk management authorities into clause 11(1) and 11(4). Those
amendments do not change the meaning of clauses 11(1) and 11(3) in
respect of water companies. The concept of English risk management
authorities is introduced into clauses 11(1) and 11(4), so that it is
clear that these authorities, as defined under clause 6(13)
with Government amendments, are bound by the obligations in clause 11.
That means they have a duty to act consistently with the England
national strategy and guidance and local strategies and guidance in the
exercise of their flood and coastal erosion risk management functions.
They also have a duty to have regard to national and local strategies
and guidance in the exercise of other functions that may affect a flood
or coastal erosion risk. However, water companies are still treated
differently.</div><a name="10011314000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
54 to 57 have an equivalent effect for Wales. Amendments 59 to 61 are
further technical amendments in respect of cross-border internal
drainage boards, which relate to clause 27 on sustainable development.
The amended provision clarifies for cross-border internal drainage
boards whether it is the Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers to whom
the duty to issue guidance on sustainable development will
fall.</div><a name="10011314000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
79 and 80 make minor technical changes to clause 15 to address
cross-border issues. The first two amendments make changes to address
the fact that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>Environment Agency operates across both England and Wales. Those
amendments are needed to ensure clarity as to when penalties will be
subject to regulations by the Secretary of State and when subject to
regulations by Welsh Ministers. As a result of the amendments, that
will be dependent on whether the failure to comply with an information
request relates to the exercise of an Environment Agency function in
relation to England or in relation to
Wales.</div><a name="10011314000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment 81 addresses a drafting error&#151;my
apologies&#151;relating to the use of the term
&#147;authority&#148; in the clause, which had not been defined as
including the Welsh Ministers. Picking up the point raised by the hon.
Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, we are striving to ensure that this
is absolutely Wales-and-England
foolproof.</div><a name="10011314000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000195"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> If we are minded to approve these amendments, I
am tempted to ask the Minister, if we table some technical amendments,
whether he would be equally minded to agree to them in the spirit of
co-operation. Obviously, we do not want to take up too much of the
Committee&#146;s time with these. I presume that they are all being
moved together because they relate to the clauses that we are currently
considering.</div>
<a name="10011314000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000196"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Only one is being moved; the rest are grouped
for
debate.</div><a name="10011314000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000197"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am grateful for that. Obviously the Minister
is perhaps closer to Wales than Scotland, but I understand that
Scotland has gone down a slightly different path in that regard, and in
relation to many other aspects of the Bill. We will put our minds at
rest that this is a matter about which he does not intend to introduce
any technical amendments at a later date.</div>
<a name="10011314000171"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">I
presume that the Environment Agency will play the same role in relation
to both countries. To avoid any risk of judicial review further down
the line, is the Minister convinced that the amendments lay to rest the
issue of which is the relevant body and who is empowered to make the
regulations?</div>
<a name="10011314000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is the
Minister saying that the regulations will either be laid before the
Welsh Assembly for them to scrutinise or, if they are the
responsibility of his Department, before both Houses of Parliament so
that we can properly scrutinise them in this
place?</div><a name="10011314000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000198"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> To the best of my knowledge, I will not
table any amendments, and I hope that I will not do so in respect of
Scotland, either. As for regulations, we will follow normal procedures
in the House. In Wales, the standard practice is to put the regulations
before the National Assembly for Wales. The amendments define quite
clearly the bodies that we need for cross-border work, which is of
interest to the hon. Member for Tewkesbury and many others. They give
powers to the Secretary of State, Welsh Ministers, the Environment
Agency and internal drainage boards to apply the regulations. The
regulations have been run around the House and the Welsh Assembly
Government, so I can confirm that they are acceptable to both. As the
hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire knows, it is important that we
have working relationships bolted down properly in
legislation.</div>

them.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000200"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Just to elaborate on earlier remarks on clause
6(7), I am sure that the Minister is aware that there is some concern
over paragraph (b), which states that where there is no unitary
authority, the county council should be the lead authority for the
area. I do not know how much detail I am allowed to go
into&#151;</div><a name="10011314000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000201"></a>The
Chairman:</b> As much as is in
order.</div><a name="10011314000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000202"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Indeed, I am sure that you will keep a close ear
on that, Mr. Martlew. My concern is that if one is looking
for examples of sustainable drainage alongside the highway, I have no
doubt that the county council is the lead authority in that area.
However, if one is considering a planning application for what I would
call a SUDS&#151;a sustainable urban drainage system&#151;for a
major new development, I have no doubt that the lead authority would be
the district council. The district council is clearly the planning
authority. As we will be coming on to that debate later, I do not want
to have that argument now because we will have plenty of time to debate
it when the moment is right.</div>
<a name="10011314000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is the
Minister minded to consider an element of flexibility, so that where
there is no unitary authority&#151;in York we have a unitary
authority and in North Yorkshire we have the relationship between the
counties and the districts&#151;we can write into the Bill that the
county council or district council for the area is responsible as is
appropriate? That would help the Minister enormously. It is not in the
Committee&#146;s interest to get the backs up of any risk managers or
the interested parties in that regard. Self-evidently, the Committee
will see of its own accord which is the relevant council.</div>
<a name="10011314000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">As drafted,
clause 6(7) gives a hostage to fortune in the possible interpretation
of lead authority, perhaps leading to a lot of unhappiness where there
could
be&#151;</div><a name="10011314000049"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000205"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am always happy to bring joy into
people&#146;s lives. I do not want to pre-rehearse any discussions
that we might have subsequently, but I applaud the hon. Lady for
flagging up the issue under this clause. In the course of the draft
Bill and also in recent weeks and months, we have had much good
dialogue with the Local Government Association to try to resolve the
issue and give some clarity and some reassurance that the Bill is not
designed to trample over good working relationships and mechanisms on
the ground. I think that we can return to that matter
subsequently.</div><a name="10011314000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to walk away from Pitt&#146;s clear recommendations to
give clarity&#151; and, in some ways simplicity&#151;to where we
put the responsibility, but that is not the same as how the measures
will work on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>ground with partnerships and collaboration. I want to give the hon. Lady
that assurance at this point, before we get to more detailed
discussions. We want to see the most effective use being made of those
organisations at either tier, and also of IDBs and others on the
ground. Not only in terms of the Bill, but in the current economic
climate, I can see no other way of doing that, because we need to make
the most efficient use of taxpayers&#146; money in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000210"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Okay, but I would like to say that clause 7, on
the national flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy for
England, is at the absolute heart of the Bill, and I am grateful to the
Minister for having expedited the production at least of the headings
of the strategy as it might appear in practice. We were hoping that
that might somewhat reassure those of us who are a little worried about
the division of responsibilities in the Bill. The original vision that
some of us had imagined from the Pitt report, which said that there
would be national oversight of all kinds of flooding for the
Environment Agency and an equal lead local responsibility for all kinds
of flooding for local authorities, and that they would be two clear
general and comprehensive responsibilities&#151;one local and one
national&#151;got a bit confused when the Bill came out. It seemed to
preserve the more vertical split, in which some kinds of flooding were
the responsibility of the national body&#151;the Environment
Agency&#151;and some were the responsibility of local authorities,
raising the possibility that some kinds might fall between the two and
not be picked up by either.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div><a name="10011314000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at the
draft outline of the national strategy, it is not absolutely clear that
those fears have been allayed. There are some questions about whether
the outline strategy might simply allocate responsibilities rather than
provide national leadership, support and advice&#151;I think those
were Pitt&#146;s words&#151;from the Environment Agency, as the
national body. Perhaps we can return to that in the stand part
debate.</div><a name="10011314000181"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="10011314000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
your permission, Mr. Martlew, I shall talk about amendments
88 and 89 along with amendment 87, because they would
implement exactly the same idea. I referred earlier to a more holistic
approach to flood and water management in the landscape, and to trying
to accept that flooding is a natural process with which we have to
cope, albeit in a largely man-made landscape that now requires active
management in a way that the original natural landscape of the country
did not. That vision is shared by many organisations, including those
involved in the Blueprint for Water campaign, which has set out an
inspiring vision.
It</div><a name="10011314000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;advocates
a move away from flood defence, coastal erosion control and land
drainage that is aimed solely at achieving the greatest cost/benefit in
terms of risk reduction even where adverse environmental impacts are
mitigated. We believe the focus should be on flood and coastal
management that delivers clear environmental solutions. Government
policy has taken considerable steps towards this in the Vision and Aims
set out in &#145;Making Space for Water&#146;, the setting of
environmental, social and economic targets in the current set of
&#145;Outcome Measures&#146; and reinforced by the Vision set out
in &#145;Future Water&#146;. Nevertheless most
FCERM&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10011314000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">flood
and coastal erosion management&#151;</div>
<a name="10011314000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;schemes can
still be characterised as business-as-usual with environmental targets
being met off-site from the &#145;real business&#146; of building
flood
defences.&#148;</div><a name="10011314000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
earlier I gave the local example of a clear option for working with the
landscape and using natural features to control and retain water,
rather than the alternative of concentrating entirely on building hard
defences in a built-up area and allowing development to go ahead in a
natural landscape. That example underlines the fact that we tend to
have an entirely risk-based approach and take a hard defence route as
the default option, rather that one that is more holistic and
ecologically inspired. That is the purpose behind amendments 87, 88 and
89, which seek to talk not about risk management, but in simple terms
about flood and water management.</div>
<a name="10011314000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 90
is slightly different. It is surely the most innocuous and inoffensive
of all amendments proposed for the Bill, as it would simply insert the
word &#147;all&#148;. That is simply to clarify&#151;we have the
heads of an outline national strategy in front of us, but it still
needs clarifying&#151;that the Environment Agency will have an
all-encompassing responsibility for all flood risk. If that is the
case, as the Minister&#146;s earlier remarks suggested, surely there
can be no possible objection to inserting the word &#147;all&#148;
in the clause. That is a really serious issue, because it relates to
ground water and watercourses that are not main rivers, which might be
deemed to be the responsibility of the Environment Agency, but which,
instead, are the responsibility of local authorities.</div>
<a name="10011314000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was an
example in Cheltenham in the appropriately named Brook vale and the
neighbouring Oak avenue&#151;it was possible in the aftermath of the
floods to tell from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>the addresses what kind of case work was coming in. The people of Brook
vale wanted me to see the very small brook in question, which was
undoubtedly not a main river&#151;it barely got the top of my shoes
wet when I stood in it, as it was only an inch or so deep. It rose
15 feet at the height of the floods because the nature of
the watercourse and the blockage in the culvert below it meant that
there was nowhere for the water to go, so it rose straight up to fill
the available natural valley near Brook vale and went straight into
people&#146;s houses, many of which were not even on the Environment
Agency&#146;s flood risk map. One resident had been told that their
house had a one-in-1,000 chance of flooding, when the water went up
over the top of the natural landscape features and followed its natural
course down the hill, straight through what were then people&#146;s
houses in Oak avenue.</div>
<a name="10011314000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
brook was only a minor water course, and not the kind of thing that
would have been the responsibility of the Environment Agency
under the old arrangements for the oversight of flooding, the
incident was a serious example of flooding. The water was extremely
deep, and lives could easily have been lost. A disabled lady who lived
in one of the houses could easily have lost her life if she had been
caught on the wrong floor when the huge flood came through. Cars were
completely buried in flood water and a huge amount of damage was done.
That was a really serious incidence of flooding in my constituency, yet
it was not within the current Environment Agency&#146;s
responsibility.</div><a name="10011314000172"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The
Environment Agency is the body that has the expertise, not only in
hydrology, but in mapping techniques&#151;resources that local
authorities can only dream of in exercising their responsibilities. It
also has a vital connection with the Met Office so that in such
circumstances, it can combine its knowledge of the landscape and
hydrology with predicted weather patterns and map the likelihood of a
certain event happening on a certain
day.</div><a name="10011314000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pitt
made a clear statement on page 35 of his
report:</div><a name="10011314000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Environment Agency should progressively take on a national overview of
all flood risk, including surface water and groundwater flood risk,
with immediate
effect.&#148;</div><a name="10011314000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a strong suggestion that we need to get away from the tangle of
responsibilities and have one body with a clear oversight role. The
risk of the phraseology that is creeping into the Bill and the heads of
a strategy we have seen from the Department in the past few days is of
a vertical split developing. It is there at the
moment.</div><a name="10011314000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister responded positively to my questions and comments this morning
about the national flood line being a single point of contact. However,
I rang the national flood line over lunch and it confirmed that, for
the moment, it can give advice about only main rivers and sea flooding.
With the planning issues we have discussed, there seems to be confusion
over what the Environment Agency can give advice on locally and in
planning appeals, not least in the Environment Agency and
DEFRA.</div><a name="10011314000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
the floods of 2007, many of us found in our constituencies a terrible
tangle of responsibilities, with people repeatedly trying to phone
organisations. In the example of Brook vale that I have given, it was
unclear who was responsible for the culvert and for looking after the
watercourse. In some cases, when we pressed to find out who had the
legal responsibility for a particular 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>watercourse, the great ghost of riparian ownership raised its head and
it turned out that the poor, beleaguered householders had the only
clearly defined legal responsibility for maintenance. In an estate
called Whaddon in my constituency, the culvert passed hidden from view
underneath people&#146;s houses and I suspect that most of them were
unaware that it existed. It was only through the good inclinations of
the local authority or the Environment Agency that any maintenance was
done on some
watercourses.</div><a name="10011314000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pitt
was right that it is vital that we resolve this issue and address once
and for all the creation of a buck-stops-here agency, where the
expertise resides on all forms of flooding. That is all that is
behind the incredibly simple insertion of the word &#147;all&#148;
into clause 7 under amendment 90. That amendment is
incredibly important and I would welcome the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="10011314000074"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000211"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Amendments 87, 88 and 89, which were
tabled by the hon. Members for Cheltenham and for Brecon and
Radnorshire, seek to broaden the national strategy to address wider
flood and coastal erosion management, rather than just risk management.
That would enable the strategy to address the beneficial effects of
flooding on the environment, as well as the negative impacts. However,
there is already provision for the strategy to set out how it
contributes to the achievement of such wider environmental objectives
in clause
7(2)(j).</div><a name="10011314000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill includes a duty for local authorities and internal drainage boards
to contribute to sustainable development through the management of
flood and coastal erosion risks. The Environment Agency already has
that duty. It supports new approaches to flood and coastal erosion risk
management, including working with natural processes&#151;something
we have discussed already&#151;and will aim to reduce the threat to
people in the property and, at the same time, deliver those greater
environmental, social and economic benefits that are consistent with
the Government&#146;s sustainable development principles.</div>
<a name="10011314000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill also
provides powers for authorities to manage flooding and coastal erosion
to gain beneficial effects for people and the environment as well as to
reduce the harmful impacts of those processes. The national and local
strategies will include a statement on how flooding and coastal erosion
will be managed to contribute to relevant environmental objectives.
They will provide an opportunity for authorities to consider and
explain how risk reduction and environmental objectives will be
integrated in their
area.</div><a name="10011314000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
kinds of environmental benefits that we would expect to see and the
hon. Gentleman would want to see as a result of this joined-up and
integrated approach include&#151;this is not exclusive&#151;better
water quality, better carbon management, and more attractive,
ecologically rich and accessible coastal and river landscapes. In
saying that, may I just draw his attention to something? I do not know
whether he has seen this, but I have a copy&#151;please do not hold
me to this precisely&#151;of the first draft outline of the national
strategy for flood and coastal erosion risk management in England. I
just briefly want to read into the record from that. Within the context
of managing the risks, there are two overall objectives: first, to
reduce the threat to people and their property, which is primarily what
the risk management 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>focus is about, and rightly so within the Bill; secondly, to deliver the
greatest environmental, social and economic benefit consistent with the
Government&#146;s sustainable development principles.</div>
<a name="10011314000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
all that, it is important to recognise that the primary purpose of the
strategy will be to manage risk. I will come back to that strategy in a
moment. It is also important to note that many of the environmental
benefits are associated with water level management, rather than
flooding. The constraints of time in this sitting mean that those
policy areas will be dealt with in subsequent legislation.</div>
<a name="10011314000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Members for Cheltenham and for Brecon and Radnorshire have also tabled
amendment 90, which would require the national strategy to set out
objectives for managing all flood and coastal erosion risk. At this
point, although I recognise how innocuous he says it is, unfortunately
we have a problem of a technical nature. The amendment could be
interpreted in a number of ways&#151;let me just cite two. It could
mean that objectives need to be set out for all different sources of
flooding or it could be that objectives need to be stated for each
geographical area. I am therefore reluctant to accept the amendment as
it could cause unintended confusion in its interpretation. However, I
am happy to make it clear that the strategy is, indeed, intended to
cover the management of risk from all sources of flooding, except those
identified in clause 1(3).</div>
<a name="10011314000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me just
refer to one other part of the draft outline. The national strategy
will set out an overview of all forms of flood and coastal erosion risk
management, bringing together the implementation of the Flood and Water
Management Act and the floods directive with ongoing activities. It
will be a high-level publicly accessible document setting out the scale
of risk for different sources, explaining the way that risk is managed
and providing a framework linked to local strategies and other plans
and documents. The national strategy will set out an overview of all
forms of flood and coastal erosion risk management and will bring
together other pieces of legislation and other aspects that are already
in
place.</div><a name="10011314000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
that clarification, I invite the hon. Members for Cheltenham and for
Brecon and Radnorshire, who have raised important points that we have
already covered, to withdraw the
amendments.</div><a name="10011314000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000212"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> On amendments 87, 88 and 89, yet again we have to
make a judgment call on whether we think the Minister&#146;s good
intentions and the strongly sustainability-oriented wording that he
uses in his replies should or should not be reflected in the Bill. Such
wording is in some places and this was another opportunity to make it
more obvious in the Bill, but I am happy to take his remarks in good
faith and withdraw amendment 87 and not press amendments 88
and 89.</div>
<a name="10011314000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am much
less convinced about amendment 90. I am afraid that there is a risk
here. Pitt said that there should be a national leadership
co-ordination and advice role for the Environment Agency on all forms
of flooding. The Minister&#146;s excuses for not putting the word
&#147;all&#148; into the subsection, which sounded&#151;I hope
his colleagues will forgive me for this&#151;a little like civil
service speak, are really a bit pernickety. To say that it might raise
the possibility that we have to include each geographical 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>area seems to ignore the word &#147;national&#148;, which is at the
top of both the document and the clause. Clearly, a national document
does not have to address each geographical area in turn. The Minister
is now nodding vigorously. Perhaps he wants to intervene on me and
reassure me that the word might be
included.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000213"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Even though we have a technical issue with
this, we are trying to achieve the same thing. Let me assure him that I
will take this away and have a look at it. If we can get it right, we
will try to bring something back. At the moment, there is an ambiguity.
Legally, the measure could be interpreted in different ways. If the
hon. Gentleman will accept my reassurance on that, I will reconsider
the matter. We are trying to do the same
thing.</div><a name="10011314000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000214"></a>Martin

ambiguities, so I am very happy to accept the Minister&#146;s good

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000220"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> This is an attempt to be helpful to the Minister
and to save disappointment and angst later on. As the hon. Member for
Vale of York said, landowners and managers are instrumental in
protecting other land from flooding because it is in their own
interests. They do not want their land to flood, so they are keen to
see that flooding does not take place at all.</div>
<a name="10011314000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the agency should consult landowners and managers about the
national flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy. When it
was first suggested that such an amendment should be tabled, it was
said that there should be a requirement to consult with every landowner
or manager. I can understand why there could be a problem in
identifying every landowner and manager to ensure that they complied
with the legislation; I am sure that the Minister will agree. I thought
that it was a better idea to have bodies representing owners and
managers rather than having the owners and managers themselves. We must
do everything that we can to ensure that we get co-operation and
compliance with all the interested parties. Those parties will play a
large role in achieving the objectives that we set out in the section
about consultation. There is a requirement to consult in public, but
that is a rather vague and nebulous term. I suppose that the
Environment Agency could say that it could consult the public by
putting a rather small advert in the corner of a local or indeed
national newspaper. However, that is not the point; the point is to
encourage engagement and co-operation. Therefore, an obligation on
behalf of the Environment Agency to consult landowners and land
managers would be a good thing to achieve the objectives that are set
out in the Bill.</div>
<a name="10011314000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
corresponding clause
8&#151;</div><a name="10011314000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;National
flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy:
Wales&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10011314000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">there
is no obligation on Welsh Ministers to consult. I presume that that
obligation would be achieved by regulation in the Welsh Assembly
Government. Perhaps the Minister would like to comment on that
issue when he comments on the advisability of consulting
representatives of landowners and land
managers.</div>
<a name="10011314000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000221"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Amendment 115 relates to the discussion and what
I thought was the sympathetic hearing that we received from the
Minister in relation to our earlier amendment. Perhaps the Minister is
right that this is the more appropriate place to make this
change.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div><a name="10011314000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">On any reading
of the clause, it is very bland to say that the agency &#147;must
consult...the public&#148; without being more specific. Because
of the implications for landowners of many aspects of the Bill, it
would be nice to have agreement that it is spelled out that it is
owners and occupiers of land&#151;so it is landowners and farmers who
farm that particular land&#151;who could be referred to
specifically.</div>
<a name="10011314000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
like to move amendment 9 in my name and that of my hon. Friend the
Member for Upminster, along the lines that we believe it is absolutely
vital that both Houses of Parliament should have the right to
scrutinise the strategy. Therefore, we call for the approved strategy
or guidance under clause
7&#151;</div><a name="10011314000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000222"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. At this point, you are not moving the
amendment; you are speaking to the
amendment.</div><a name="10011314000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000223"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Of course. I am sorry to use language so
loosely. I would like informally to introduce the little, humble,
modest amendment that I am sure will charm the Minister so much
that&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> Otherwise, I really will
get formal.</div>
<a name="10011314000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the strategy or guidance should only be made if it is laid before
and approved by resolution&#151;I think that it is the affirmative
resolution and that is why we put it in those terms. So I hope that the
Committee and the Minister will look favourably on
amendments 115 and
9.</div><a name="10011314000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should also like to draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the
conclusions of the Select Committee. I would not say that the
Government were chastised by the Select Committee, because the Minister
is such a nice man that we could not possibly chastise him, but the
Select Committee concluded that clarity on the form of the national
flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy should be provided
in the Bill or through an order-making power subject to the affirmative
parliamentary procedure. The Select Committee further recommended that
the Bill provide for the strategy to be reported to
Parliament.</div>
<a name="10011314000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment
9, therefore, we are really just following through on that desire of
the Select Committee. I hope that the hon. Member for Brecon and
Radnorshire, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats, will support the
conclusions of the Select Committee, on which he also serves, in that
regard.</div><a name="10011314000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Select Committee also recommended that the Department publish details
of how the strategy will be prepared and scrutinised, and over what
period it will be reviewed. I am not entirely convinced that that issue
has been addressed in the clause, so I would be most grateful to hear
from the Minister in that
regard.</div><a name="10011314000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000224"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I shall speak about amendments 92 and 93, which
are being considered in this group. I am attempting to be even more
helpful to the Government by sharing with them a source of invaluable
expertise and wise counsel. My background is in the voluntary sector,
so I am naturally inclined to look to the third sector as a source of
expert advice and well informed and well judged opinions. Voluntary
organisations, of which there are a huge number relating to
environmental, water and flooding issues, are an obvious group of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>bodies to consult. They should be consulted properly and formally when a
national flood and coastal erosion strategy is being drawn
up.</div><a name="10011314000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have the National Flood Forum, all the bodies involved in the
&#147;Blueprint for Water&#148;, the Wildlife and Countryside Link,
the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Woodland Trust, the
wildlife trusts, Froglife, the World Wildlife Fund UK&#151;the list
goes on. It is potentially invidious to name in a Bill specific
organisations that we should consult. I know from my background in
branding charities that their names change from time to time and that
it is occasionally difficult to keep track of them.</div>
<a name="10011314000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Luckily, the
Charities Act 2006 provides a neat way of identifying precisely which
organisations the Environment Agency might care to consult on drafting
its strategy. It provides the new heads of charity&#151;the new
definitions of charitable activity. It
specifies</div><a name="10011314000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
advancement of environmental protection or
improvement&#148;,</div><a name="10011314000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
neatly encompasses almost everything in the Bill and a bit more
besides.</div><a name="10011314000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was the first piece of legislation I ever dealt with in this place and
I assure the hon. Member for Norwich, North that even though it was
only a couple of years ago, it seems like an eternity. One gets a
number of these things under one&#146;s belt in time. It is a useful
piece of legislation, which carries a precise definition of
environmental organisations. Those charities could easily be a category
of statutory consultee for the national strategy. Indeed, the Charity
Commission no doubt has those data in easily accessible form and could
provide a list to the Environment Agency within a matter of hours. On
the geography, postcodes are stored by the Charity Commission, so Welsh
environmental organisations would be equally easy to identify
definitively.</div><a name="10011314000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would add two other organisations in England and Wales that
seem to be obvious and natural consultees. One is Natural England,
which  has overarching responsibility within Government
for  looking at the natural environment and advising the
Government on it; it seems to be the most obvious consultee imaginable
for a truly environmentally sustainable flood risk and coastal erosion
strategy. Its equivalent in Wales is the Countryside Council for Wales.
I am sure that at some point my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and
Radnorshire will give me the proper Welsh version of
that.</div><a name="10011314000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later,
the Bill goes to great lengths to establish regional English and Welsh
flood defence committees from the old flood defence committees.
However, those are not statutory consultees in the process. Presumably,
they are expected to be the principal reservoir&#151;pardon the
pun&#151;of informal and voluntary expertise on flooding in
particular parts of the UK. It is bizarre that they will not be part of
the statutory consultation
process.</div><a name="10011314000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
we are asking does not open great floodgates, add thousands of
organisations or bring in a very complex way of consulting, but it
would get away from the vagueness in the term &#147;the
public&#148;, which has been referred to. That term could be used to
cover up a lacklustre and half-hearted consultation. If we specifically
include Natural England, regional committees and the voluntary sector,
we can be sure that the public will hear of any issues arising from
future versions&#151;or even the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>first version&#151;of the national flood and coastal erosion risk
management strategy. I heartily commend the amendments to the
Minister.</div><a name="10011314000183"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000225"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Hon. Members have tabled amendments
concerning approval and consultation of the national flood and coastal
erosion risk management strategy. Amendment 9 would require both Houses
to approve the draft national strategy. The Bill already requires
public consultation on the national strategy, as well as consultation
with the risk management authorities and Welsh and Scottish Ministers,
in so far as the strategy affects Wales and
Scotland.</div><a name="10011314000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Second Reading, the Secretary of State noted that it would be for the
Select Committee to decide what it wished to do. The EFRA Committee
will, of course, be able to scrutinise the strategy at the same time as
it goes out for public consultation. The code of practice on
consultation, to which both DEFRA and the Environment Agency have
signed up,
states:</div><a name="10011314000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Consultations
should normally last for at least 12 weeks with consideration given to
longer timescales where feasible and
sensible.&#148;</div><a name="10011314000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
period of time should be sufficient for the EFRA Committee to consider
the strategy, it is consistent with the time provided for
pre-legislative scrutiny for example, and we would expect such a
consultation to be arranged to avoid long overlaps with parliamentary
recesses. Similarly, I can assure the Committee that the Welsh Assembly
Government are committed, as they always are, to ensuring wide
consultation on their draft national
strategy.</div><a name="10011314000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Providing
for formal parliamentary approval of the draft strategy would be
disproportionate. In fact, we are confident that the EFRA Committee,
which has been rightly lauded today for the work that it has done on
this Bill and other legislation, will provide very effective scrutiny
indeed. The approved strategy and guidance will in any case be laid
before Parliament, providing an opportunity for them to be considered
and debated if
required.</div><a name="10011314000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
92 and 115 would require third sector environmental and conservation
organisations, Natural England, regional flood and coastal erosion
committees, and bodies representing the owners and occupiers of land
likely in the opinion of the Environment Agency to be directly affected
by flood and coastal erosion, to be specified as statutory consultees
on the national strategy. The bodies listed in the amendments are
already covered by the duty of the Environment Agency to consult the
public about the national flood and coastal erosion risk management
strategy. The Environment Agency already engages with such bodies as a
matter of course during national consultations, and is already duty
bound to consult with regional flood and coastal erosion committees in
the execution of its flood risk management functions. It is also
subject to a duty to secure public involvement through section 23 of
the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act
2009.</div><a name="10011314000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can go further and give assurances, because I recognise the concern to
ensure that the right people are consulted. The question is, how much
do we put in the Bill and how much do we put elsewhere? There is an
opportunity 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div>here because the Secretary of State is allowed to issue guidance
directly to the Environment Agency. I think that that is how we can
stipulate to the Environment Agency who should be consulted, not simply
through normal public consultation, but to say in writing who we think
it should be. I do not want to prescribe it here because of the classic
risk of saying, &#147;These ones are in and these ones are
out&#148;. The hon. Member for Cheltenham proposed a very interesting
idea about the third sector, I have to say. That may be exactly the
approach that brings it all together in the Secretary of State&#146;s
guidance and talks about landowners and landowner organisations. There
is an opportunity to do it, but it should not be in the Bill, because
of the problem of fixing things in
stone.</div><a name="10011314000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
93 concerns the Welsh consultation process, and would require Welsh
Ministers to consult risk management authorities in Wales, the public,
Welsh environmental and conservation organisations, the CCW and the
Welsh regional flood and coastal erosion committees on the national
flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy. My colleague Jane
Davidson, the Welsh Assembly Government Minister for Environment,
Sustainability and Housing, has already made clear her commitment to
conducting a full public consultation on the Welsh national flood and
coastal erosion risk management strategy, so that will happen. We are
happy to give the undertaking that she can signal guidance to us on
matters such as who should be part of that, in the same way as the
Secretary of State can issue guidance to the Environment
Agency.</div><a name="10011314000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire suggested that the Environment
Agency might consult by placing small ads in papers and so on. That has
not been ruled out, but it needs to go a hell of a lot further than
that given the agency&#146;s obligations and duties under this and
other Bills. Just taking the action to which the hon. Gentleman
referred would not be being compliant with the code on consultation. We
want it to go a lot further. Good points have been made, but we need to
find a way to get such things done. Indeed, we have ways that would not
bolt down such matters for ever. We need to give the flexibility
whereby a future Minister can turn round and say, &#147;Well,
actually we now have another organisation that we need to bring
forward.&#148; For all those reasons, such as detailing the degree of
quality consultation in England and Wales that the national strategy
will receive, I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011314000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000226"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> We have listened to the Minister and, as always,
he has sought to reassure us on such matters. He has done that. It
would be good if the guidance that he or a subsequent Minister issues
to the Environment Agency could be shared with members of the Committee
or, indeed, Members of Parliament in
general.</div><a name="10011314000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000227"></a>Huw

else, will have to read the transcript of my commitment, and heaven

it.</div><a name="10011314000128"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000233"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I want to make a small but significant point.
The Department was invited by the Select Committee at the drafting
stage of the Bill to consider writing a definition of strategy in the
Bill. For what reason has the Department chosen not to introduce such a
definition? There are definitions on strategy in other legislation.
There are precedents for defining strategies and policy statements. The
marine policy statement in part 3 of the Marine and Coastal Access Bill
and part 2 of the Planning Act 2008 contain provisions for the
Government to produce national policy statements. The
Department&#146;s attention was drawn to that in two respects so that
it could consider giving such a definition. Is the Minister minded to
bring forward such a definition at a later date, perhaps on Report, and
why was a conscious decision taken not to implement a definition of
strategy at that
stage?</div><a name="10011314000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000234"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I refer the hon. Lady to clause
7(2), which contains the steps we have taken to clarify the meaning by
setting out what we understand by a
strategy:</div><a name="10011314000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
strategy must specify...the risk management authorities in
England...the flood and coastal erosion risk management
functions&#148;</div><a name="10011314000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
so on. We have tried to set out an indication of what we understand
will be in the strategy, although perhaps in a different way to that
which the hon. Lady would have wanted. We have tried to go some way in
complying with the Committee&#146;s
request.</div>
<a name="10011314000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000235"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I should like to return briefly to some of my
opening comments about the division of responsibilities in the Bill.
That is reflected in both the Bill&#146;s wording and the draft
outline flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy for England.
The National Flood Forum, ourselves and others are concerned 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div>that there is too much vertical division of responsibility. The Minister
has an opportunity now to make clear those points that might have been
somewhat buried in the draft outline. The third bullet point for the
objectives in the draft sets out what it describes as
principles&#151;a risk-based approach, working in partnership and a
co-ordinated approach to the management of different sources of flood
risk. That one tiny phrase really goes to the absolute heart of
this.</div><a name="10011314000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
national co-ordination and leadership, which Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s
has called for, is to be shown by the Environment Agency, that is where
it will be shown and where the Environment Agency, on all forms of
flood risk, can start to give real guidance and direction. That could
include a more sustainable or sensitive approach to risk. It could be a
more customer-focused approach, and one that was more sensitive to the
victims of flooding. That is where that can start to be laid out and
leadership can start to be given to local authorities. Perhaps the
Minister would like to expand on what he expects to see in that tiny
section. Will there just be a couple of paragraphs that will not really
provide the kind of national leadership, co-ordination and advice that
Sir Michael Pitt was looking
for?</div><a name="10011314000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should also like to ask the Minister about two other sections in the
draft outline that are relevant to the clause. What are the different
roles and responsibilities, and how exactly will they be enforced and
monitored? It is not clear that the Environment Agency itself has much
of a role beyond setting out that strategy, as there is no clear
description of what it will do after being given those
responsibilities. What if it comes to the Environment Agency&#146;s
attention that a particular local authority or flood risk management
authority is not performing its task? Is there, hidden somewhere in the
Bill that I have not spotted, a clear role for the Environment Agency
in launching investigations or trying to enforce the various strategies
and national leadership that it sets out in the national strategy? Will
that kind of process be set out in the national strategy itself, and
how will that work in
practice?</div><a name="10011314000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
we have been given section 6 of the outline national strategy, which
deals with the process for review in time scales, setting out how and
when delivery of the strategy will be monitored and revised, but that
raises a few questions as well. Who will do the monitoring? If the
Environment Agency has national oversight, who will monitor its
delivery of the strategy? Perhaps the Minister would like to expand a
little on how he sees that working in practice. This might seem like
picking out small details of the document that he has given us, but it
gets to the heart of some of the concerns many local authorities and
observers have that the Bill still does not resolve that tangle of
responsibilities or create the single, buck-stops-here responsibility
for the Environment Agency that we were all looking for and that Sir
Michael Pitt so strongly
recommended.</div><a name="10011314000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011314000236"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The hon. Gentleman has raised some
important points, so perhaps I can expand a little on those and clarify
them. We anticipate that the national strategy will go into quite some
depth on the principles of the risk-based approach, on work and on
partnerships as well. I will just expand on that a little bit in a
moment, because the essence of the Bill is getting the balance of
people working together right, with agents 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div>working together, a co-ordinated approach to the management of different
sources of flood risk and sustainability as well. It will go into some
depth on that.</div>
<a name="10011314000184"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="10011314000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
national strategy will not prescribe local flood and coastal erosion
risk management decisions. It will provide the framework in which they
can be made in a consistent manner between areas. We know that if we
make the wrong decision in one area, it will impact negatively on
another area, as has been mentioned before. It will also ensure that
the investment of public funds&#151;they are significant funds now,
and they will have to grow as well&#151;in flood and coastal risk
management is carried out equitably. That is an important principle of
how we carry out the work, seeking maximum benefits, so that the
national strategy will ensure that that is done. Local strategies will
need to reflect that element of the national strategy, and decisions
will need to be made in the context of wider risk to ensure that
decisions made in one area do not impact negatively on another and are
not compromised by a lack of investment in one area compared with
another.</div>
<a name="10011314000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question, the national strategy will
provide the co-ordination required for the effective management and
partnership management of flood and coastal erosion risks, while
enabling the development of solutions that genuinely meet local needs.
Who will monitor that strategy? That is a fair point. Ministers
hold&#151;the Secretary of State and I hold&#151;regular
performance reviews with the Environment Agency and this will form part
of that; it will include the delivery of the national strategy as well.
That is where people are currently held to account. We have still got
to see more of this fleshed out, but that is our direction of travel.
The strategy will be held to account, and it will get away from the
very rigid vertical approach and allow joined-up working and
flexibility as well. However, it will be set in that national
parameter, so that we have equity and do not have unintended
consequences in other areas. It will also allow that element of local
partnership work as
well.</div><a name="10011314000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Griffith</b> (Llanelli) (Lab): I am keen to speak on the
clause because my constituency is surrounded on three sides by the sea
and has some very significant coastal erosion. It is an extremely
important area that we need to consider. What I am going to say has
some relevance to clauses 9 and 10, which other hon. Members may wish
to pick up later on.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div><a name="10011314000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I
should like to ask about the difference between clauses 7 and 8. In
clause 7, there is a monitoring role for the Environment Agency, while
that appears to be missing from clause 8. Welsh Ministers do not seem
to have a monitoring role for that strategy. How it is envisaged that
the strategy will be
monitored?</div><a name="10011314000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
8(2) contains the detail of exactly what the flood and coastal risk
management strategy should consist of and what should be done. Under
subsection (2)(e), the strategy must specify how and when
the measures are to be implemented.</div>
<a name="10011314000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to place my comments in the context of a plain-speaking report produced
by the Welsh Audit Office in October 2009. It found that progress had
been slow in respect of the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s new
approaches programme, which brings together stakeholders with interests
and responsibilities for the coastline. The report is critical, citing
insufficient capacity for the programme, which, it says, was evident
from the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s response to the Pitt
review. It cites leadership issues and lack of clarity about the aims
of the programme and fragmented and poorly co-ordinated management
processing systems. That is extremely worrying, because although those
comments are being made about the Welsh Assembly Government, they may
apply to some of the lead local flood authorities. Although some of
them might perform outstandingly, others might not be so well equipped
to perform their
tasks.</div><a name="10011314000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
constituents want to see progress on the issue but they are extremely
worried about flooding and coastal erosion. How can the provisions of
clause 8&#151;and those under clauses 9 and 10, about which Member
might want to speak later&#151;be strengthened? I appreciate the
difficulties involved in dealing with a range of strategies across the
country&#151;for example, it might be difficult to define dates by
which something must be done&#151;but the current situation is
open-ended, so we need some assurances that things will happen: people
are impatient to make progress.</div>
<a name="10011314000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The position
with catchment areas has been explained, but the same can be said of
the coast: one area can easily impact on another. My hon. Friend the
Minister will be aware of the issue of dredging in our part of the
world, where activity on one part of the coast can have serious
consequences for another part, with different lead flood authorities
being involved. Moreover, given that some authorities might be in
England and others Wales, with different time lines, different
strategies and different implementation times, there seems to be
worrying scope for drift.</div>
<a name="10011314000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want the
most effective action to be taken, so will the Minister clarify how
that will be achieved without the relevant wording being in the
Bill?</div><a name="10011314000158"></a>

hon. Friend asked why the Environment Agency has no monitoring role
under the Welsh strategy. That is to do with slight differences due to
devolution. The strategy will be developed in Wales by Welsh Ministers,
who will also be responsible for monitoring and implementation.
However, the Environment Agency will need to report, and under clause
18(2), that report will include a strategy. It will report both to
Welsh Ministers in Wales and the Secretary of State in England, so they
will monitor progress
effectively.</div><a name="10011314000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hear what my hon. Friend says about the worry about drift and the
consultation spreading. I am sure that our colleague, Jane Davidson,
will have heard what has been said in Committee today, and will want to
guard against that. In fact, I can probably assist a little as well.
The Welsh Assembly Government consulted, as we did, on the draft Flood
and Water Management Bill. There was strong support in Wales for the
production of a national strategy and for the retention of a strong
strategic role for Welsh Ministers. That ties in with the way that
Welsh devolution has evolved.</div>
<a name="10011314000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">In taking
forward the comments arising from their consultation, Welsh Ministers
felt that the best way to meet the needs of the people of Wales was for
them to prepare a national strategy for Wales. A summary of the
consultation responses, as considered by the Welsh Assembly Government,
is available on the website, and details of the outcome of the
consultation in Wales are contained in the joint Government response to
the consultation on the draft Bill, which is available on  the
DEFRA website.</div>
<a name="10011314000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
timing, the Welsh Assembly Government have already begun early planning
work for the national strategy, and they intend to publish a draft for
consultation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>this spring. Publication of the final strategy will take place later
this year, dependent on a number of factors, including the length of
the consultation, the nature of the response, and what, if any, changes
are required as a result of that consultation. However, I know that my
hon. Friend will make representations, not only about the consultation,
but about ensuring that it takes place in a timely manner.</div>
<a name="10011314000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Vale of York asked, quite rightly, who would be the arbiter
of the disputes. That is classic territory for me, as a former Welsh
Office Minister and as a DEFRA Minister. How do we deal with such
cross-border issues? The crux of the matter&#151;we went through this
in the Marine and Coastal Access Bill&#151;is that the two
Governments will have to work together. They will have to co-operate
fully on the matter and consult. There is no arbiter. There are Welsh
Assembly Government Ministers, the Secretary of State and me. The
nature of that match is established in the work, relationships and,
when necessary, underpinning protocols. However, I do not think that
protocols are needed. We have put the strategies and the cross-border
arrangements in place and we need to ensure that they work
effectively.</div><a name="10011314000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
