</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 9, in page 7, line 26, at beginning insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1) In relation to any sum that is paid into the Distribution Fund under section 21(2) of the 1993 Act after December 31st 2000, section 22(3)(e) of that Act shall have effect as if for ``on projects to mark the year 2000 and the beginning of the third millennium'' there were substituted ``on or connected with education, environment and public health, including children's play.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (2) Section 30 of the 1993 Act (winding up of fund allocated under section 22(3)(e)) shall cease to have effect.
<P>
 (3) The Secretary of State may by order substitute a later date for the date that is for the time being specified in subsection (1).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 8, in page 8, leave out lines 1 to 6.
<P>
No. 11, in page 8, leave out lines 12 to 14.
<P>
Before we continue with the debate, I should like to remind the Committee that amendments may not be tabled this Friday, which is a non-sitting day. In order to be unstarred and therefore selectable next Tuesday, amendments should be handed in no later than the rise of the House on Thursday 30 April. I understand that the house is expected to rise at about 7.30 pm on that day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Spring </B>(West Suffolk): On a point of order, Mr. Benton. During our debate on the sittings motion, I regret to say that the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin) said that my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude) had misquoted him on Second Reading, and that my right hon. Friend had apologised not only to him but to the Secretary of State and to Madam Speaker. All of that is untrue. Will you, Mr. Benton, please invite the hon. Gentleman to retract his charges against my right hon. Friend and to apologise?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sorry to have to tell the hon. Gentleman that that is not a point of order. What is reported in the House is not the subject of the Committee's deliberations, so I must rule that subject out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I am sorry that my point of order prevented me from doing what I am anxious to do, Mr. Benton, which is to welcome you to the Chair. We know that you will direct our proceedings with great flair and fairness. My hon. Friends and I have been looking forward to your taking the Chair this morning.
<P>
In all parliamentary democracies, political parties take their manifesto commitments very seriously. That is so throughout the world. Indeed, when political parties come to office, they usually try to carry out their manifesto commitments. Only in rare circumstances do they decide not to go ahead with those commitments--perhaps because of unexpected external events or, as has often happened in other parliamentary democracies, because an economic catastrophe blows the Treasury's calculations off course. No political party has made more of its manifesto commitments than the Labour party, but the so-called five early pledges of the Labour manifesto are already disappearing further into the distance.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to invite the Government to honour their general election manifesto, which included a pledge that there would be a new millennium fund--to be called the New Opportunities Fund--to replace the existing fund once the millennium has passed. The manifesto, ``new Labour because Britain deserves better'', stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Labour has already proposed a new millennium commission to commence after the closure of the Millennium Exhibition, to provide direct support for a range of education, environment and public health projects, including those directed at children's play, currently excluded from lottery benefit.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is clear evidence that the change was intended to take place after the millennium fund had used up its resources.
<P>
The Bill is a &#163;1 billion raid on the lottery. It will deprive the good causes of substantial sums of money. As my noble Friend Lord Skidelsky said in another place, even by January more than &#163;60 million may have been segregated into the shadow account for the New Opportunities Fund. The fund was created simply to get that money quickly. It was orginally to be a replacement for the millennium fund, not a sixth good cause, as it has now been described.
<P>
I fully accept that the Government have said that they want to remain within their public expenditure constraints, but in effect the Bill is a way of breaching those constraints by funding core Government responsibilities by raiding the lottery. During the general election campaign, the Labour party changed its mind about its manifesto commitment. It was said that the creation of the New Opportunities Fund had something to do with the Wednesday draw. The fact is that it was always Camelot's intention to introduce a mid-week draw; the idea that the New Opportunities Fund arose from that is unsustainable.
<P>
There is no guarantee that the original good causes will be protected--as we have seen in parts of the United States, there is such a thing as lottery fatigue. In breaching its manifesto commitment, the Labour party seeks to obtain money for the New Opportunities Fund as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Sport (Mr. Tony Banks):</B> Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee at what point the previous Government gave a guarantee about the existing good causes? Why under the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 can the percentage given to the good causes be varied by the Secretary of State? Clearly, there could be more than two draws--there could be three, four of more. Flexibility is already written into the existing legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I fully accept that there was a power under the original Act to vary the percentages given to the good causes, but they were to add up to 100 per cent. We are talking about a sixth good cause, which had never been designed to be a good cause, but which under the Labour party's manifesto commitment was to kick in only after the end of the millennium fund. That is the point addressed by the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> Nothing in the original legislation enshrined the existing five good causes. Nothing said that they were to be the only causes. It is inconceivable that other good causes would not be added as further draws were introduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I fully accept that when the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 was introduced, it was clear that the character and quality of the lottery would change as it progressed, but that is a differenet matter. There was an assurance in the Labour party manifesto that changes would not take place until the end of the millennium fund. Labour Members are subscribing to a Bill that goes against the principles on which they fought the general election campaign. That is not honourable or sustainable.
<P>
Does the Minister accept that bringing forward the launch date of the New Opportunities Fund had nothing to do with the mid-week draw, as has been implied? Does he accept that under the amendment the original good causes would receive percentage sums, not a reduced amount? Does he accept that the amendment would restore confidence in the arts, heritage, sports and charity circles that have been concerned about this aspect of the Bill? However, most basically and fundamentally, the amendment would enable Labour Members to show their commitment to the manifesto that enabled them to become Members of Parliament in the first place. If they do not accept the amendment, they will be in the extraordinary and unprecedented position of voting against their own election manifesto. I am sure that they would not want to do that.
<P>
Amendment No. 11 would stop the diversion of money from the original good causes to the shadow account in the New Opportunities Fund. As I have said, substantial sums have been hived off to that shadow account since October. It is difficult to estimate how much money is involved, but it might be well in excess of &#163;100 million. By the time that the Bill receives Royal Assent--Heaven forbid--the sum might be in excess of &#163;200 million or more, which would have gone to the original good causes.
<P>
We question giving parliamentary approval to such retrospection; there is no precedent for it. The National Lottery etc. Act 1993 contained no power of retrospection. However, given their desire to fill the void in their election commitments on education, health and other matters, the Government simply could not wait, frankly, to grab the loot for the New Opportunities Fund. Of course, under the original arrangements, the five good causes received 20 per cent. each.
<P>
On the point made by the Minister for Sport, section 28 of the 1993 Act gave the Secretary of State power to vary by order the percentages allocated to each cause, not to substitute a new good cause or to vary the percentages so that they do not add up to 100 per cent. However, using the shadow accounting mechanism, the Government have sought unilaterally to alter the percentage so that the five original causes do not add up to 100 per cent. The New Opportunities Fund will receive the money hived off from the worthy causes.
<P>
It would be absurd to suggest that the distributing bodies agreed to the new mechanism. On Second Reading, I invited the Secretary of State to publish the agreements that he made with the distribution bodies to show how anxious they were to co-operate with the Government. We have heard nothing from the Secretary of State, so I hope that Ministers will take the opportunity to give us further information.
<P>
The Bill represents an essentially political raid. The power of retrospection is being introduced to get the New Opportunities Fund up and running as soon as possible to fill the public expenditure gaps that are now screamingly apparent in health and education.
<P>
Lord Redesdale, a Liberal Democrat, made the issue perfectly clear when he sought to limit the Secretary of State's scope to vary the percentages of proceeds of the lottery given to each good cause. Lord Redesdale said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Minister was kind enough to send me a letter emphasising his point that the new opportunities fund would not grow so large. He strenuously denied our point about the funding of the cause being illegal and said that if the Government were not allowed to fund the new opportunities fund before legislation had been passed, then to bring the new opportunities fund up to the level of funding they wished, they would initially have to spend 18 per cent. of lottery funds on it and then they would have to fund it at 24 2/3  per cent. from Autumn 1999. I would find it worrying that if the Government had failed through their rather interesting accounting practices to secure the money for the new opportunities fund they would be quite prepared to take almost 25 per cent. of the lottery for one of the six good causes''--[Official Report, House of Lords, 9 March 1998; Vol. 587, c. 15.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The precedents do not exist and those that the Government have advanced are not substantive; the amendments to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 and to the Recreational Charities Act 1958 merely return the law to the state in which it was before a judicial decision interpreted it differently. It is a legal, technical matter. The powers under section 88 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, which has been mentioned, made legal a consultation process that had taken place before the Act was passed and that is wholly different from the appropriation of funds that has taken place and that is specifically proscribed by the original Act.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall conclude on a critically important point about the powers of retrospection. Retrospective provisions of the Stamp Duty (Temporary Provisions) Act 1992 allowed the Government to forego taxes to which they would have been entitled. The proposed retrospection has no basis. The Secretary of State has been challenged, but has not been able to respond. The power of retrospection is damaging and sets a wholly unacceptable precedent. I hope that the Committee will reflect seriously on the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Damian Green (Ashford):</B> I rise to support my hon. Friend. He eloquently pointed out that the amendments seek to save Labour Members from themselves. We know from experience that both Ministers--with their different styles--are decent, straightforward and honourable members of the Administration, who would not wish to be seen blatantly reneging on a manifesto promise. I am sure that that applies to all members of the Government Front Bench. As has been said, the Bill flatly contradicts what the Labour party promised, when it was in opposition. I was intrigued by the ingenuity of the Minister for Sport in seeking to turn the debate to the subject of the previous Government's behaviour; that is always a clear sign that he is embarrassed in the more intellectual parts of his anatomy at being caught out and does not want to discuss his or his Government's behaviour. The Government are reneging on what they said they were going to do--they are obviously trying to use the money generated by the national lottery for their own political ends. If the amendments were passed, the Government could sleep with a clear conscience tonight.
<P>
The amendments raise some important wider points, principally that they seek to protect the principle or additionality, which everyone agrees has been an important component of the lottery. If the lottery is viewed as a pot into which a Minister can dip his or her hand at the appropriate time, it will fall into disrepute and cease to have the widespread public support that has enabled it to do so much good in the past four years. We all agree that defining additionality has proved to be rather difficult, but I am willing to rely on the Prime Minister's own definition in the White Paper when he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We do not believe it would be right to use Lottery money to pay for things which are the Government's responsibilities.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a perfectly reasonable definition of additionality, through which clause 5 drives a coach and horses.
<P>
As was pointed out in another place, two principles underlie the definition of additionality. First, continuing public services should not rely on voluntary contributions, with the obvious dangers that that can cause and, secondly, national lottery money should be used for what is desirable rather than essential. That second point goes to the heart of some of the Government's weaker arguments in defence of their proposal. I have heard Ministers argue, ``If you ask people what they want to use lottery money for, they are always more in favour of using it for, say, health and education, than sport and the arts.''
<P>
<B>Mr. David Prior </B>(North Norfolk): Does my hon. Friend agree that the greatest practical defence for additionality is to ensure that the people allocating the money are independent of the Government? They will ensure that the project to which the money is being allocated is not part of the normal run of Government spending.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Indeed, that is a third, strong argument in favour of preserving the additionality principle.
<P>
The public recognise the distinction between essential and desirable spending and say that essential spending should come first in the queue. There cannot be anyone in the Committee who disagrees with that, but that is not the point. The point about the additionality principle is that there are areas of national life that are the Government's responsibility to fund--that is why we pay taxes. That is not a controversial underlying principle, although where the boundaries should lie is at the heart of political debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> In the Channel islands, perhaps.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Well, yes. I was referring to those of us who pay all our taxes. I cannot speak for all members of the Governement Front Bench in that regard.
<P>
We must not allow ourselves to be seduced by the fact that the public prefer essential spending over desirable spending, which is only common sense, and that, therefore, we can shunt some lottery spending away from the desirable to the essential. That is what will happen unless our amendments are accepted.
<P>
<B>Fiona Mactaggart </B>(Slough): If the hon. Gentleman thinks that projects that may be funded by the New Opportunities Fund are essential, will he tell us what those projects are?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is a good point. I have heard the defence before that if the Government are not spending money on something now, by definition it is not essential, so it can be funded by the lottery. That is the gist of the hon. Lady's remarks.
<P>
The additionality principle will be destroyed for all time because as technologies develop in education and health, new services will become available, which should be funded from core funding. Under clause 5, as it stands, the Government are saying that it is entirely legitimate to fund such developments out of the lottery, because they were not funded before. Future Ministers in other Administrations will find it extremely tempting to say that if something has not been funded before, it can be defined as additional, so lottery money can be used. The people who will laugh at this provision are the hard men in the general expenditure division of the Treasury. The Government are giving the Treasury the perfect excuse to say that nothing that is not funded now can be regarded as core Government expenditure. Therefore, no new areas of public expenditure can ever be legitimately allowed. I think that the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) will agree that that is not a sensible way for any Government to commit themselves to go; it seems a particularly foolish way for a Labour Government to go.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): The hon. Gentleman appears to be saying that a Government have certain essential responsibilities, which the previous Government did not fulfil. That seems to be a major criticism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The hon. Gentleman should have been listening. I said that, over time, different projects and priorities emerge for any Government. Inevitably, some will be completely new. The argument used by the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends is that because such projects have not been funded before, they cannot, by definition, be matters of core expenditure. That is the point that I am challenging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the training of information technology teachers clearly illustrates his argument?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Absolutely. Ten or 15 years ago, it would not have been thought of--it would have been a blip on the horizon. I dare say, however, that teaching information technology will become as essential as teaching reading and writing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> Why did the former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), say--it is on the record--that if the Conservative party won the 1997 election, he would have sought to use the lottery to put extra PE teachers into schools?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Because he regarded that as a legitimate use of lottery funds. He also said that he proposed to do that after the millennium funding had finished. The Minister knows perfectly well--as would other Labour Members if they had bothered to do their homework--that although the Government said they they would wait until after the millennium to mount this raid, they are doing it now via this group of amendments. That is one of the things to which we object.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon was perfectly honest; he said that after the millennium celebrations were over there would be a new source of money, to which people could legitimately look for lottery funding. The Government are taking that money now, illegitimately, from the good causes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> It is timing, then?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The millennium is going to happen in 2000, so yes, of course it is timing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> So it is not principle, it is timing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> No, it is principle. The millennium happens in 2000. In their manifesto, the Government promised that they would seek new targets for those funds after the millennium, but they are taking that money away before the millennium. They are betraying a promise that they made in their election manifesto and, as I think the Minister for Sport would agree, that is certainly a matter of principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): I have listened intently to the hon. Gentleman, who has talked a lot about manifestos. I wonder whether I might take him back to 1992, when the Conservative manifesto made it clear that the lottery was about promoting heritage and projects that would be a source of national pride. Would the hon. Gentleman include the Churchill papers in that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Yes. Preserving the memory of the greatest Prime Minister this century is something of which this country should be extremely proud. When Labour Members try to go back and talk about anything but the Government's behaviour, it is a clear sign that they know they are on a sticky wicket. We know then that they have no argument in defence of their behaviour and the hon. member for Hove has just confirmed that. 
<P>
Not only are we arguing about a point of principle, we are already seeing practical results arising from the Government's desire to raid the lottery pot for their own ends. We have all seen bids for lottery funding across all the good causes increasing, inevitably; the various distributing bodies and those who look to them for help perceive both the quality and number of bids increasing. As a result, there are more disappointed bidders now than there were. One of the Government's great delusions is that the creation under the clause of the sixth good cause will somehow be painless--they think that people will be pleased about the various good things that will be done by the New Opportunities Fund and that no one will suffer.
<P>
Of course people will suffer. We have already heard this week the bitter complaints of the people who run the helpline for battered women. They say that they are now being deprived of lottery funding, which they had had. The Bill will mean such complaints increasing. There will be more dissapointed good causes, which have been funded and might well have expected future funding, but which will now not get it because of the raid on the finances. This will not be a politically painless exercise for the Government, but they will worry about that more than I do.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Joan Humble </B>(Blackpool, North and Fleetwood): Is the hon. Gentleman saying that all good causes that have been given lottery funding should expect it to continue, or does he recognise that it has been standard practice to give some organisations pump-priming lottery funding to get then going? They are then supposed to raise their own money and generate voluntary activity, thus contributing to their community.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is a reasonable point. If the percentage allocated to each good cause had been kept the same, those who are turning away the class of people who receive grants could say legitimately that such practice was pump-priming and that they should not expect it. I am sure that Labour Members will know from their consituency experiences--as I do--that grant-giving bodies are having to say, ``I am sorry. The money is now being diverted away from us, so we are turning down more applications than we did before''. To revert to what happened this week, I understand that four out of five bids to the National Lottery Charities Board are having to be turned down--that practice can only increase as a result of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government have already gave the game away to some extent. In another place, Lord McIntosh of Haringey said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Given the pressures on the Exchequer, it is inconceivable that we would be contemplating provision for out-of-school learning and childcare, and healthy living centres.''[Official Report, House of Lords, 19 January 1998; vol. 584, CWH 42.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, Lord McIntosh was pointing out honestly the link between the Government's public spending pressures and what they propose to do with lottery money. The amendments would relieve the Government of some of their own public expenditure pressures, which we believe point to an illegitimate use of lottery money. Such practice will bring the lottery into disrepute and the Government's approach deserves to being them into disrepute, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ronnie Fearn </B>(Southport): May I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton?
<P>
We are against the New Opportunities Fund. The amendments would improve the Bill. As the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) said, four out of five applications are being turned down--a statistic that I am worried about, especially given the point of view of the distributing body for sport, which has said that certain amounts are not going through. Subsection (8) refers to education and the environment and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``after the definition of `the Distribution Fund' there shall be inserted--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```education' includes training and the provision of activities for children . . . `the environment' includes the living and social environment.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That provision is not clear and I should appreciate the Minister giving some examples for what it means.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser </B>(Mid-Dorset and North Poole): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton.
<P>
The Bill is clearly a &#163;1 billion raid on the lottery, for reasons already described. The original good causes will suffer due to that overhasty raid. I was interested to note on what basis it is proceeding, but I would like to know a little more about what consultation is taking place with the vital causes. My right hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey (Mrs. Bottomley) invited the Secretary of State to publish the agreement reached with the existing distributing bodies to support his claim that they agreed with the proposals on 16 February--that is noted in Hansard--but I can find no record of such information being released.
<P>
The national lottery was set up by the previous Conservative Government to provide a ring-fenced source of funding for arts, heritage, charities, sport and projects to mark the millennium. It was not set up to prop up Government spending. There is a subtle difference between its purpose and what the Government propose. There is also the issue of retrospection. The fact remains that the law has been broken and we need to consider that in connection with the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I will make two brief points. First, a fundamental difference between the New Opportunities Fund and the existing funds is that the new fund is much more prescriptive--it gives the Secretary of State much more control over how the money is to be spent. For example, the Secretary of State has determined that &#163;200 million is to be spent on healthy living centres. Why healthy living centres? There are all sorts of equally valuable things on which that money could be spent--rehousing the homeless or drug rehabilitation, for example. Why has the Secretary of State picked healthy living centres?
<P>
The second point that requires more explanation is the retrospective nature of the fund. In my experience, retrospection is used only if a cock-up or technical problem needs to be rectified. When we discussed the Government's initial proposals for personal equity plans and tax-exemption special savings accounts, which are retrospective, in the House recently the Treasury backed off from its original intention. I hope that we will receive further explanation on those two points from the Minister.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Arts (Mr. Mark Fisher):</B> May I say first, Mr. Benton, how pleased all Government Members are that you are in the Chair? We welcome you to the responsibility that you will share with your colleague.
<P>
We have had an interesting debate, with a slight difference of opinion between the two Opposition parties. The group of amendments is especially interesting and the official Opposition are being too modest about it. It demonstrates that they have not only been reading Labour party documents, but agree with them. We have heard a lot about new Labour and we are now hearing from the new Tories, who accept every dot and comma of Labour party thinking. If only the official Opposition had done that before the election, they might have fared better than they did at the polls.
<P>
We are always happy to welcome sinners repenting too late and are delighted that the Conservatives are accepting not just our policies but our words. The wording of the amendments follows precisely that of a 1996 document, ``The National Lottery: Initiatives and Recommendations'', and of ``The People's Lottery'', published on 23 April 1997, which established the idea of a new good cause. The amendments use exactly the same words: ``education, environment and public health''. We welcome the fact that the Opposition have agreed with the content of the good cause by tabling the amendments; that is a constructive piece of play by the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> This is so cosy that it feels almost unbearable to intrude. I remind the Minister that the Labour party went into the general election with a manifesto commitment, which was broken during the election campaign. It is a matter of principle, not of whether it is good or bad. If the Minister is unwilling to accept the amendment, the ludicrous situation will arise of him voting with his Friends against their party's manifesto.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman understands his amendment. It agrees with the content of the good cause. The only change that it makes is to the timing. We are pleased that the Opposition accept the content and scope of the good cause. That undoubtedly represents a shift in their position since Second Reading, which we welcome. That the content of clause 5 should be approved and welcomed is a constructive start to the Committee stage.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman said, the difference is in the timing. He is right to say that when we first proposed the new good cause in our manifesto and in the lottery documents published before the election, we anticipated that it should follow the running down of the Millennium fund. We have had second thoughts, however, which is perfectly reasonable. We were surprised and pleased at the strength of support for the new good cause. As it was so widely welcomed, it seemed perverse and unnecessary to delay it for several years. As it was supported by the public and now by the Opposition, we feel that if the content is right we should go ahead now, be decisive and get on with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Of course the public would like to see additional spending on education and the health service. The Minister also said that the public found the establishment of the New Opportunities Fund desirable, but he offered no evidence of that. On what basis does he make that assertion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman has only to read his own mail and the press to discover that people are very pleased with this initiative. It is a new cause and a good cause, which is widely accepted. As it is such a good idea--we are delighted that it has the approval of the Opposition--it seems sensible to get on with it now, to plan it in an orderly manner and to start it earlier rather than later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I put my question to the Minister again: you claim support, which we dispute, but the point was put to Chris Smith by Virginia Bottomley that a list should be published of those distributing bodies that purport to support the idea. Nothing more has been said. What evidence do you have that those distributing bodies support the idea?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Minister replies, may I ask the hon. Member to address his remarks through the Chair in the third person, not in direct conversation with the Minister and other members of the Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I am extremely grateful, Mr. Benton.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> We have running discussions and consultations with all the distributing bodies. They are fully aware of the plans and happy with them. Consultation is not an exercise, but a continuous process.
<P>
The hon. Members for West Suffolk, for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mr. Fraser) and for Ashford (Mr. Green) all spoke of there being a &#163;1 billion raid on the lottery. That is a misunderstanding. It has always been made clear that the other distributing bodies will receive &#163;1.8 billion each, and they have accepted that. That was the understanding on which they planned.

<P>

<B>Mr. Spring:</B> That is absolutely incorrect, and the Minister knows it. The fact that that has turned out to be the sum is beside the point. Under the National Lottery etc. Act 1993, the amount to be spent was stated as a percentage. No one had any idea that the sum would be &#163;1.8 billion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman should do his homework. He should look at the press releases that Camelot and the distributors issued in 1995 and 1996, in which that figure was given as the planning total. I am happy to direct the hon. Gentleman's attention to those press releases. The distribution bodies have always accepted that figure; it is the basis on which they have been able to plan. The important thing was the amount of money that they were to receive--&#163;1.8 billion. They will still receive precisely that sum.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
What is different is that the lottery has developed and become more successful. That is a tribute to the idea behind it, the success of its running and the public's enthusiasm. I pay tribute to the previous Government for setting up, with our support, such a successful lottery. I was happy to vote for the 1993 Act on its Second Reading.
<P>
The lottery's success is not due to the mid-week game alone; it has been more successful than expected in general. We can fulfil the planning totals, which all the distributing bodies understood, and do something in addition, which will enhance the benefits that have flowed from this good idea.
<P>
There is no raid on the lottery. We have simply found that more money is coming in to the lottery than the previous Government, or anyone else, thought possible. No one anticipated that the lottery would be quite so successful. The extra &#163;1 billion has enabled us to fulfil the planning assumptions for the five distributing bodies and to create new opportunities--hence the new good cause. That is eminently sensible.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford--or perhaps it was the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole--said that bids were being turned down because of a raid on the good causes. The reason why all the distributors are turning down bids is that the number of bids far exceeds the grants that can be allocated. It is misleading to say that bids are being turned down because we want to use the additional sum, the &#163;1 billion that happily has come to the lottery pot, in another way. There is no raid on the lottery.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> What the Minister says is a logical impossibility. Money that would go to the existing good causes is being given to the New Opportunities Fund, whether or not it has planned for it. Therefore that money cannot be distrusted to the existing good causes, and some applications will be turned down. Those applications would be accepted if the New Opportunities Fund did not exist. The Minister cannot deny that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman is simply not grasping the point. He is not talking about the reality. All the lottery boards work on the assumption that they will receive &#163;1.8 billion. That is exactly what they are receiving. If they had been genuinely raided, that sum would have been reduced. If it had been reduced, they would have had good cause for complaint about the Government. That is not the case. They knew how much they were to receive. They have been planning on that basis. However, because of the lottery's success, an extra &#163;1 billion is available, and we are directing that money to a very good cause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fearn:</B> As the lottery becomes more successful, the applications will multiply. Most people are only just finding out how to fill in the application forms for lottery money. Those are the people who are really in need. Those who were wise in the beginning applied quickly. We should incorporate the expansion of funding within the present lottery spheres, rather than create a new one that will take money away from those who are only now making applications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. Smaller organisations have taken time to understand the lottery's unnecessarily cumbersome application procedures, which the Bill takes powers to simplify. The way to do that is not necessarily through allocating more money. Last week the Secretary of State launched a new community pilot scheme in Scotland, to be repeated in the east midlands later this year, that will create a one-stop shop for smaller grants. That will address some of the hon. Gentleman's valid points.
<P>
I share the Opposition's view that retrospective legislation is not in the main desirable, particularly those forms that penalise people for unknowingly having committed offences. The Bill is a different form of retrospective legislation. We are taking the powers to ensure good financial planning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Wow, that will make a change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not seem to understand that the Bill is not retrospective in the sense of giving money to the new causes--it affects virtual money and creates shadow accounts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> That is an interesting definition of money. Would the Minister use the term ``virtual money'' in the hearing of the existing good causes that are having money taken away? It is real money to them and they are suffering in consequence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I thought that we had gone over that point. Money is not being taken away from them. We are trying, in an orderly and planned way and using good practice, to find a method of getting that &#163;1 billion to the new area of lottery activity. It is a good idea to set up shadow accounts so that money flows into the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts and the New Opportunities Fund--money that they cannot use until the Bill is enacted--and so that they have a good planning period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Is it not the case that under the Bill the existing causes will receive &#163;1 billion less?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> No, that is the wrong way of looking at it. The causes will receive exactly the same amount as was originally planned, but because of the excess--[Interruption.] The evidence exists; the hon. Member for West Suffolk chooses not to acknowledge it, but all the existing causes have planned on the basis of &#163;1.8 billion and continue to do so.
<P>
We were talking about the surplus and the additional amount of money that has flowed in. There is a misunderstanding about what might have been; the original planning basis has remained exactly the same and the causes are losing no money from their original planning total.
<P>
One area that retrospection benefits is the planning abilities of existing distributors, because they also need to plan for the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> It is helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Yes, it is helpful to know what sums of money are coming in and how. That is why the distributors have been consulted on the matter and why they are content with it. The other way of achieving the effect of the &#163;1 billion would be to start the accounts running after the Bill is enacted rather than at the point at which the legislation allows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I should like to complete this point so that the hon. Gentleman can understand it. In order to get to the &#163;1 billion, the percentages in the Bill would have to be different, which would be to the disadvantage of existing distributors at the end of the licence period, when everthing is looked at again. Therefore, it is to their advantage that a higher percentage is in the Bill. They recognise that and are content.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I apologise for intervening yet again, but the temtpation is so overwhelming following the Minister's remarks. In view of the fact that there is such a state of blissful and happy understanding between the Secretary of State and the distributing bodies, will the Minister publish the agreements that have been made with the existing distributing bodies, showing how happy and in accord they are with the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I thought that I had answered that point when I referred to consultation with the lottery boards, which is a continuing process. They have been fully involved throughout, which is necessary for them to make orderly plans. It is a matter not of a document or a series of negotiations, but of a seamless flow of consultation. We consult on a whole range of matters all the time. I assure the hon. Member for West Suffolk that they have been fully involved--they understand and concur with what we are doing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fearn:</B> Consultation has been mentioned several times. Is it just within the lottery boards, or is there consultation with the national health service, people involved in education and other outside bodies? They should be included in the consultation process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> There has been a long process of consultation on lottery procedures and the Bill. The issues raised by the hon. Member for West Suffolk and his hon. Friends were whether the boards were consulted and agreed with the powers that the Government were taking in the bill and about the new use of the additional &#163;1 billion. I repeat that there has been a series of discussions and the boards have been consulted throughout. They have been involved in all the procedures leading to the proposed legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> May I, too, ask the Minister for clairfication? If the consultation was so extensive, will he explain why fewer than 100 members of the public bothered to respond to it? Are the Government happy with that level of response? Is it adequate when we consider the amount of money that will be spent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am not responsible for how many members of the public responded. I think that it shows the general agreement to our proposal. I thought that the hon. Members for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and for West Suffolk were asking about our involvement with the boards--the other distributing bodies--and I hope that I have reassured them that the boards were involved throughout in the Goverment's thinking, planning and drafting of the legislation.
<P>
As I tried to explain, it is to the distributing bodies' advantage that the percentages following the Bill are higher rather than lower. If we had not started the shadow accounts running when we did, to get to the &#163;1 billion surplus money that we want to reallocate to those funds, the percentage figure would have been different and to the disadvantage of the boards in the long-term. They recognise that and accept that it is good orderly planning for them, as well as for the New Opportunities Funds and NESTA.
<P>
I return to the valid points made by the hon. Member for Ashford about additionality. From the start of the lottery procedures legislation in 1993, we recognised the importance of protecting areas of funding from the Treasury's interests and distinguishing between Government expenditure and the new benefits that would come from the national lottery. The hon. Gentleman was gracious enough to acknowledge that defining additionality had proved rather difficult. He is right; it is not an exact science. There have been many attempts to do so--by the former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), my right hon. Friend the present Prime Minister, various Secretaries of State and many others. All have one thing in common, whatever language they use, that the purpose of additionality is to distinguish between core Government spending--statutory or essential spending--on some projects and the new projects that should be funded by the national lottery. That is the purpose and intent on which we all agree. It is not easy to define additionality precisely, which is why no one in the previous Government nor in this Government has done so in law. It would be a thorny path to attempt to do so.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Does the Minister accept that one of the practical safeguards of additionality is to ensure that the distributing bodies are independent of the Government and cannot be told by them where to spend the money? Does he also accept that the New Opportunities Fund is not as independent as the previous distributing body?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> No, I do not accept that. Distributing bodies are independent and are not affected by Government Ministerial decisions. Their independence is editorial and executive. They must be independent to make their own judgments on the applications that they make. It is right and proper that hon. Members should make representations on behalf of their constituents, but the bodies are determinedly independent and the record of all the good causes and the distributing bodies so far shows that independence only too well. If anyone attempted to lean on them in the past the previous Government no doubt made their desires felt--the distributing bodies made it clear that they jealously guarded their independence. They have done an extremely good job and I am confident that the boards of the New Opportunities Fund and NESTA will be equally jealous of their powers.
<P>
The intention is to appoint good people to the boards to make independent judgments. If the hon. Member for North Norfolk has evidence that any of the distributing bodies has been less than independent, he should say so, but I think that he is being less than fair to the extremely good people on the boards who have behaved very independently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> The evidence is that the Secretary of State said that &#163;300 million will be spent on healthy living centres. That does not leave much discretion to the people on the board of the New Opportunities Fund.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> It leaves complete discretion about which projects to choose. I suspect that there will be many interesting projects. Healthy living centres can be expressed in a number of different ways and it will be up to the board to decide. We are doing no more in allocating or suggesting a planning total for that area of expenditure than for other boards. All have a general definition in the original legislation and in the proposed new legislation. The independence comes not in the area of their activities, but in their choice of allocating grants, a matter on which they are very independent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way before he moves off the point about independence. I was extremely glad to hear his strong defence of the independence of the existing good cause distributing bodies, which we on the Conservative Benches endorse, especially in the case of the national heritage memorial fund and its award to the Churchill papers, which has been a source of constant denigration from Labour Members up to, and including, this morning. I am glad that the Minister has said implicitly that that award was made completely independently and without political interference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am sure that that was a serious intervention.
<P>
I turn to the comments of the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn). I should have noted it during Second Reading, but I did not realise that the hon. Gentleman is wholly opposed to the New Opportunities Fund. That is sad. Those who care about after-school activities, healthy living centres and all that will result from the Bill will be surprised--
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> Nay, shocked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Yes, I am shocked that the hon. Gentleman, who has a good record in supporting imaginative thinking on education and health matters, does not welcome the opportunities that will result from the Bill. I ask him to repent, even at this late stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fearn:</B> I am surprised that the Minister should be surprised that I occasionally see things that are quite wrong. This is one of them. The Conservative party is saying that lottery funding should not be used in that way. The Committee will see that in later amendments I shall question what happens when the good cause is set up; yes, I realise that it may possibly go through. One question--the Minister may be about to answer it--is on children's activities and social environment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am a cautious person. I do not assume that the clause will be accepted. My hon. Friends, who are fiercely independent, will have to be convinced that it is worth supporting. I never take the views of hon. Members for granted; I hope to persuade everyone to vote against the amendment and for the clause--in which case the hon. Gentleman is right that it will go through. However, I am sad not only that the clause will go through without his support, but that the splendour and wealth of opinion of the Liberal Democrat party is against additional expenditure for new ideas on health and education. I wonder whether everyone who is thinking of voting for the Liberal Democrats on Thursday in a couple of weeks realises that that rather negative attitude has been taken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fearn:</B> I hoped that the Minister would not bring politics into this debate and especially that he would not mention the forthcoming local government elections. However, he is barking up the wrong tree. In the end, it will probably be a better Bill than it is now and we shall probably vote for it, but we have reservations about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful for that reasoned and reasonable intervention. The hon. Gentleman asked two specific questions. He asked also for examples of training and educational work and of the living and social environment. Because of the boards' independence, it must be left to the New Opportunities Fund to judge the applications made to it. However, the Government want the fund to direct its attention first to after-school activities.
<P>
I should have expected the hon. Gentleman, with his understanding of education, to realise that although the Government may be responsible for what happens in the classroom, a great deal of important education--the wider social education and the stretching of children's minds outside their academic studies--happens in out-of-school activities.
<P>
Such opportunities, which may be cultural, sporting, or a whole range of other activities and which form an important part of a child's education, have never before received funding. That is why the Bill is so exciting. It will back the sort of work that is happening in schools in Bristol and in other parts of the country, which has never had any support but is such an important and enriching part of education. I ask the hon. Member for Southport to recognise how important that is.
<P>
Similarly, in the Bill all that the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the living and social environment''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
means is that when we consider the environment we should consider not simply hedgerows, cycle paths and the green environment, which are important, but the social environment, which involves people and communities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fearn:</B> I thank the Minister for that explanation, but is it not Government policy to encourage such activity in education and the national health service anyway? He should not have to grab additional funds for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Those are things that I am sure the people running hospital trusts and doctors would have liked to have done, but they are not part of their core responsibilities. There are things that all hon. Menbers and people in the country would have liked to have been done in education and health, but which we have not been able to do--imaginative new ideas that enhance health and education in their widest senses. It is those opportunities that the clause will enable us to grasp.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> To take up the point made by the hon. Member for Southport, which is perfectly valid, will the Minister confirm that a Green Paper will shortly published on a national child care strategy, which will include out-of-school activities that are in effect to be funded by the lottery?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> We will have to wait to see what is in the Green Paper, but I think that the hon. Gentleman will find that it is a strategic document that considers child care provision in the wide sense of child minding, baby minding, finance and other matters. We are considering the specific matter of out-of-classroom activities. Anyone who has worked in education, as I did for 10 years, has long recognised that it has been a weakness of our system that it has relied on the good will of volunteers and teachers to provide activities outside the classroom and has often failed to grasp the full richness that can accrue to children. The new cause provided in the Bill addresses that and I hope that all hon. Members would welcome that.
<P>
It is important that all members of the Committee understand that the wording of the amendment makes it clear that the Opposition's objection concerns timing. I hope that I have satisfied the hon. Member for West Suffolk that our proposed timing is sensible. Conservative Members appear to agree with the content and scope of the new good cause; we are delighted at that. For that reason, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment, so that we can make progress with the Bill and ensure that the new good cause benefits education and health in their wider, additional sense, which is something that we all want to happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> May I also thank every member of the Committee who has participated in this morning's interesting debate? I was gratified that the hon. Member for Southport is taking a somewhat agnostic view of the New Opportunities Fund. I hope that he will resist the somewhat oleaginous blandishments with which the Minister for Arts sought to seduce him into supporting the fund, because the Minister's comments were not filled with substance, if I may put it in that way.
<P>
The central point at issue is that if the Labour party does not accept the amendment, it will have broken a manifesto commitment. There is no point talking about timing and so on. Governments come into office having stated their views and made commitments to the people. That commitment is being flouted, which is a matter of principle.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman clear in his mind that not only are we fulfilling the content of our commitment in the Bill but that his party concurs with it? The content of that manifesto commitment is hard and fast and is being delivered by the Bill. The only difference between us concerns the exact date on which we start work. Given that we all agree that it is good work that ought to be done and as we have the money, it seems sensible to get on and do it now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I must say again to the Minister that the original intention was that the fund would kick in when the millennium fund moneys had been spent. As has been said, the proposal is premature and undermines the commitment to wait until the expiry of the millennium fund. That intention was not stated before the general election; that is quite wrong.
<P>
It is fair to say that additional facilities that could broadly be described as healthy living centres are desirable. Many GP fundholder practices already operate such facilities. The desirability of after-school facilities is also arguable. The point at issue is that it is wrong to flout the principle of additionality--which I accept is difficult to define--by introducing lottery money into a core Government funding commitment.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
For the Minister's edification, I recall what the Prime Minister said about additionality in the White Paper:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We don't believe it would be right to use Lottery money to pay for things which are the Government's responsibilities.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government are already directly and indirectly paying for a number of the commitments for which the New Opportunities Fund will end up paying.
<P>
As for the absolute figure of &#163;1.8 billion, the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 was based on percentages. I well remember the discussions with the then Secretary of State on what they might yield; there was no clear evidence at the time about the likely figures. I remind the Minister that other parts of the world, particularly the United States, have been affected by lottery fatigue. When that occurs, the amount of money available for good causes can drop. The Bill offers no guarantee that they would be protected.
<P>
The Minister has also talked of a ``seamless flow''--a wonderful term that I shall remember. There had to be a defining moment when the existing good causes agreed that money could be removed from them into the shadow account. I repeat my request for the Minister to publish that happy agreement to which he has alluded. I do not believe that the situation is as seamless as he described.
<P>
The Minister implied that precedents were indeed difficult to find, and talked about retrospection. If the Bill is enacted, it will create a precedent that could be abused. As parliamentarians, we have to be mindful of what could happen in future in different circumstances, perhaps under a different Government and in many years' time. There is no comparable precedent to the Bill's retrospective powers, and that is a worrying matter of principle.
<P>
Virtually nothing that the Minister said in trying to reassure my hon. Friend and myself on the key issues satisfied us, so we wish to push the amendment to a vote.
<P>

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 8, line 2, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(6A) In section 28 of the 1993 Act (power to amend section 22) in subsection (2)(a) for ``5 per cent.'' there shall be substituted ``13 1/3 ''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The object of the amendment is to ensure a minimum percentage for the good causes. There is no doubt that several distribution bodies are concerned about aspects of the Bill. The National Lottery Charities Board said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Board would welcome an assurance that the ratios now set for the six distributing bodies will remain as they are until the expiry of the current lottery operator's . . . licence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Sports Council stated: ``We seek clarification that sport will be guaranteed long term funding post 2001 through its percentage share of Lottery income at no less than current levels.''The Minister talked about a seamless flow and the happy relationship that existed between the Department and distribution bodies, but genuine concern is felt by such bodies, as is illustrated by those two observations.
<P>
However, it is not only formal submissions that are of interest to the Committee. During the Committee stage of the Bill in another place, Lord Rothschild, who has recently retired as the distinguished chairman of the national heritage memorial fund, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``nobody likes money to be taken away from them''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
While talking about the sixth good cause, he went on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Its creation . . . will reduce the Heritage Lottery Fund's share of lottery proceeds at a time when we are already being asked to do more with less''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On the same occasion, Lord Gowrie--
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman note that Lord Rothschild referred to the share, not to the actual amount of money. That confirms that point that I made earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The Minister makes my point for me. The purpose of the amendment is to preserve the share for the existing good causes and to give them some assurance.
<P>
Lord Gowrie is about to retire as chairman of the Arts Council. Talking about the Chancellor, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``He has to make it uncompromisingly clear, backed by the Secretary of State and the entire Government, that following the loss of money to the sixth good cause, including NESTA and the new opportunities fund, he will continue to protect the existing good causes through the lottery in the next Parliament''.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 18 December 1997; Vol, 584, c. 750, 774.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a similar concern.
<P>
It is unrealistic for the Minister not to accept the distribution bodies' genuine concern about the fact that the Bill contains inadequate protection for them on several levels. The amendment offers the Government an opportunity to allay their fears.
<P>
From the comments to which I have referred and from informal comments that have been made to me, it is clear that many people think that the Bill is the thin end of the wedge and that there will be further attacks on the existing good causes as money is taken away from them and given to the causes that the Secretary of State considers desirable.
<P>
The Government are refusing to adhere even to the new, reduced percentage allocations. I hope that the Minister can assure us about the percentages, because they are extremely important to the distribution bodies. The 1993 Act gave the Secretary of State power to vary by order the percentage allocated to the five good causes. However, the cumulative effect of the Bill will be that the Secretary of State will enjoy considerable powers that no Secretary of State has enjoyed heretofore.
<P>
As I have said, we as parliamentarians must be mindful of what the future might or might not bring. We, as defenders of Parliament, should be reluctant to give any Secretary of State additional powers which, given the nature of the national lottery, might be open to abuse and manipulation. That is an important principle.
<P>
During consideration of the Bill in another place, the Government assured both Liberal Democrats and Conservatives of their good intentions. I hear what the Government have said, but the Minister owes it to the Committee to go further and back those good intentions with more specific assurances. We want to register our concerns by speaking to the amendment. We moved it because we wanted to introduce a statutory element.
<P>
On Second Reading, no assurance was given about the percentage for good causes. We heard only about the &#163;9 billion versus the &#163;10 billion, and the Minister has mentioned those figures again today. We heard nothing about percentages. If the figures increase to more than &#163;10 billion, what will the percentage be? The Minister should give us an assurance. Equally, on the other side of the coin, what will happen if there is a revenue shortfall? Obviously, we all hope that that does not happen, but there might be an unexpected economic event, or a change of attitude.
<P>
Clearly there is no evidence of lottery fatigue, but it might set in; that has happened in parts of the United States. If it does, what will happen? There were indications, although they were not potent, that such fatigue had begun before the mid-week draw was introduced. That was of concern. In fact, the mid-week draw boosted sales. However, lottery fatigue is a realistic possibility, which is why I moved he amendment.
<P>
On Second Reading the Government would not give a specific commitment that the original causes would continue to receive money after the year 2001. I hope that the Minister will give some assurance on that matter. He has heard both the comments of the various distribution bodies and those of Lords of considerable distinction in public life. They have represented their anxieties, not emotively but by underlining their concerns.
<P>
It is not enough just to say that we must have confidence in the Secretary of State's good faith--we must look ahead. We therefore propose that a percentage floor be placed under the original good causes.
<P>
That protection would not be necessary if the new good cause did not come so much more directly under the Secretary of State's control. Our central objection to the Bill is that it concentrates too much new power. The whole construction of the fund is a departure from what has happened before. As the Minister will know, under the 1993 Act, five equal percentages were designated, and the terms of reference were that support should be given to specific projects by the five distribution bodies; there was no absolute power of ministerial direction. Unfortunately, under the New Opportunities Fund, the Secretary of State will have additional powers of direction, and the essential freedom that the five good causes originally enjoyed will be changed by the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I point out that we are discussing clause 5, not clause 6?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I am, of course, happy to accede to your ruling, Mr. Benton. The point that I was trying to make was that that note on clause 6 supports my argument that there is a qualitative distinction between the new cause--the New Opportunities Fund--and the existing causes.
<P>
We know that information technology for teachers and librarians, healthy living centres, out-of-school-hours activities, and so on will be introduced. They are simply extensions of Government policy, and we seek to prevent further diversion of moneys by the Secretary of State using his new powers. The new cause will have a share of 20 per cent. plus in 1999, as millennium spending tapers off. Why might it not be 25 per cent. or 50 per cent? The Bill would not prevent that, and I seek the Minister's assurance that it would not happen. We are talking not about hundreds of millions of pounds but about billions of pounds, potentially, so an assurance from him is warranted.
<P>
As the Minister will know, the original minimum for the good causes under the 1993 Act was 5 per cent. The Government's new cause may be voracious, in view of the powers to be given to the Secretary of State. That is why we think that the level of 5 per cent. is now too low to protect the original good causes, and have proposed to raise the minimum for all good causes to 13 1/3  per cent.--equivalent to the proposed level for the New Opportunities Fund. In other words, &#163;3.3 billion of the &#163;5 billion that the Minister mentioned would be ring-fenced. At present, under the 5 per cent. level, only &#163;1.25 billion is ring-fenced.
<P>
Given all that I have said, it would give great comfort to the distribution bodies and their directors if the amendment were accepted. I ask the Minister to give a binding undertaking that during this Parliament he will not cut the percentage given to the original good causes below 16 2/3  per cent. As he will know, there is considerable concern among the arts, sport, heritage and charities about future funding from the national lottery and the funding outlook in general. They are crying out for additional protection.
<P>
I remind the Minister of what the Prime Minister, when Leader of the Opposition, said at the 21st anniversary lunch of the British Screen Advisory Council at Manison House on 3 February 1997. Talking about the arts, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The arts sector has a right to expect clarity, commitment and consistency.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is fair point. The Bill lacks that clarity, commitment and consistency and I hope that, through the amendment, we can give some important comfort to the good causes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> From what the Minister has said today, he should find it extremely easy to accept the amendment. The thrust of his speech on the previous group of amendments--he was engaged in an entertaining piece of sophistry when he explained that taking &#163;1 billion from the existing good causes did not mean taking real money away from them, but that argument contained certain virtual elements--was that good causes needed to plan and that although they might originally have planned for what was included in the Camelot licence application, they should not necessarily expect any more.
<P>
It is obviously important for the distributing bodies to be able to plan ahead. The amendment would give a degree of reassurance to those good causes so that they do not unexpectedly find themselves falling out of political fashion or in desperate need of a Minister to find some money for a transiently popular, or even a permanently popular, cause. Indeed, the latter may be more popular than those causes that have so far been the beneficiaries of the lottery. On the basis of what he has said so far, I am sure that the Minister will agree that it is important that the good causes should receive such an assurance. If it is given, it is thus legitimate to ask why it was not included in the original legislation.
<P>
I hope that I anticipate the Minister's answer. As has been made clear, the original Bill introducing the lottery inevitably had to allow some experimentation. We had not had a national lottery since the previous century and setting one up required some guesswork and flexibility. We now know how the lottery operates and how the distributing bodies to the good causes operate and the legislation can be tightened up and improved. However, other substantive points need to be made to explain why the amendment is necessary.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk said that the introduction of the New Opportunities Fund was the right time to introduce a completely new type of good cause, one that was not restricted to a particular area but was completely open-ended and could be stretched to cover a wide range of activities--one that was more capable of being predatory, to use a word used by my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk. Ministers or officials will not find it difficult to make long lists of desirable projects that could come under the general rubric of the New Opportunities Fund. I am sure that the Minister is aware that the existing good causes are already somewhat nervous about that. This would be a good time to reassure them.
<P>
The division of money has so far been crude but extremely fair. The Minister can imagine the agonising that went on in Whitehall on the allocation of money to the various good causes. I was a small toiler in the vineyard when the No. 10 policy unit was working on that matter. Enormously erudite papers were flying around, but it was decided that the allocation had to be fair--and seen to be fair--and that the easiest way to achieve that would be to divide the cake equally. Five good causes would receive 20 per cent. each. That would overcome the problem of people arguing that one good cause was better than another, or that a certain good cause was more controversial than another. Everyone is more in favour of charities than other organisations and some people doubt the value of the arts and heritage grants. By and large, however, the system is easibly defensible, if the money is divided up in that relatively crude way.
<P>
Such a simplistic approach has been broken by the Government's intention under the Bill to allocate certain percentages to the good causes to keep the millennium fund at a certain level and to introduce the new good cause at another level of grant. Once such simplicity is broken, it is impossible to put it back together again and that causes uncertainty about future behaviour.
<P>
Lord McIntosh said in another place that one reason for such an amendment seemed to be that the Opposition said that although the previous Government could be trusted, the present Government could not be. I could not have put that better myself. He summed up the situation exactly. By introducing complications and variations, the Government have made themselves less worthy of trust by the good causes. Inevitably, people will fear second-order effects. Even if they accept what is happening now, once the breach is made, Ministers will be able to say, ``We now have the power to decide not only which new causes will be introduced, but how the money should be allocated between them.'' It is only human to assume that the good causes that are closest to the heart of the particular Administration in power are likely over time to receive a larger slice of the cake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that if and when there is a switch from spending on one-off capital grants to running costs, it will be even more important that the good causes can plan forward for a long time? The amendment is especially important in that context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point, not least because inevitably as time goes by the balance between capital and revenue grants will change assuming that the lottery maintains itself at such a successful level. Initially, it was sensible to concentrate on those capital projects which, in many areas--notably the arts and sports--had fallen behind and were in danger of becoming a national disgrace. [Hon. Members: Oh!] Yes, I am talking about what has been a national disgrace for the past 50 years. How many football stadiums have been built this century? How many arts centres have been built? I hate to tell Labour Members that, just as 1 May last year was not the year zero, nor was 9 April 1979. Many problems have been ongoing for most of this century and the most successful way that has yet been found to deal with them is the national lottery, which was introduced by the previous Government. I welcome the enthusiasm of Labour Members for that radical idea, which has proved to be such a success.
<P>
Under the Bill, it will be possible for up to 75 per cent. of the money to be allocated according to ministerial preference to a particular good cause. It is not completely implausible to envisage a situation in which pressure on spending on the health service was such that the Minister would be tempted to say, ``We are expanding the New Opportunities Fund, as a result of which we can guarantee that not a single hospital bed will be taken away over the next two years.'' I am sure that it would not take skilled draftsmen long to find a way in which such a promise could be made under the New Opportunities Fund.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman distinguish between the health service and hospitals and the healthy living centres, or does he have a problem in distinguishing between a hospital and a healthy living centre?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green</b> I am entirely capable of distinguishing between a hospital and a healthy living centre. I should be grateful if the Government would define a healthy living centre, because they seem incapable of doing so sensibly. If the hon. Gentleman has visited the hospitals in this constitutency, he will know that the national health service is increasingly dedicated to preventing ill health and to promoting good health. I imagine that the role of hospitals will continue to evolve.</B><P>
<P>
The Government are in danger of arrogating to themselves the power to distribute money in a way that would give the existing funding areas cause for concern. I am sure that the Minister would wish to avoid that. Another important point is the relevance of Parliament to the process. The lottery has run successfully for several years. Parliament should set down the parameters of distribution so that Ministers are not given such wide latitude to alter, at whim, the division of the cake.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that the Government will accept the amendment, which in practical terms will do nothing to change their proposed distribution for the rest of this Parliament. We therefore do not seek to change existing policy, but to reassure the existing good causes--to which the Minister has paid tribute this morning. If the Minister cannot bring himself to accept the amendment, I hope that he will give an explicit reassurance about the long-term level of grant to the four existing good causes that will continue beyond the millennium.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am delighted to reply to the short debate. The Opposition are getting into interesting problems. Having introduced the national lottery, they basically support it and, as is clear from the previous group of amendments, agree with much of what we are doing. They are obviously having to twist themselves into knots to find something with which to disagree. The amendment is an attempt to reform their own legislation. Section 28 of the 1993 Act set the floor for percentages. It is curious that the Opposition should revisit their own legislation five years later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> May I remind the Minister, in case he had not noticed, that circumstances have changed and that he now finds himself in government? We have an entirely new situation in which the Secretary of State has been given an entirely new set of powers, transforming the balance of the national lottery. We therefore seek to protect those anxious distribution bodies that have made their views known.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Yes, we have heard all this talk of sticking to one's principles--the Opposition thought that 5 per cent. was a good idea when they were in government, but not now.
<P>
There has always been flexibility in the legislation. The 1993 Act enshrined that flexibility by providing that Parliament could vary, by affirmative procedures, such elements as percentage shares. I do not criticise the Opposition for having included that flexibility to cover new eventualities; it was an eminently sensible part of the 1993 Act and we reaffirm the need for it.
<P>
The hon. Members for West Suffolk and for Ashford wanted assurances about the new good causes. I am happy to give them. The Government have no plans, beyond those that they have already announced--the reduction in the millennium share to 13 1/3  per cent. and the increase in the new good cause to 20 per cent, in autumn 1999--to alter the funding of the existing good causes. That applies both to 2001 and beyond. I hope that Opposition Members will accept that assurance and reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I am comforted by the emollient way in which the Minister expressed himself. We can all take note of what he said--that there are no plans to change the percentages or to alter the funding of good causes--and it may come back one day to haunt him. But, as we know from the flip-flop on the hon. Gentleman's party manifesto commitments, things can change.
<P>
Circumstances can change dramatically for no apparent reason. I am not casting aspersions on the Minister's good faith, but Parliament's job, in scrutinising legislation, must be to look ahead and consider circumstances that may not be evident now, but may arise in the future, and from which the existing good causes demand protection. That is not unreasonable. However, the way in which the Secretary of State wants to take powers unto himself involves a high degree of centralisation and direction, the precedence for which could be wholly unwelcome, especially in other hands--or even in the present hands. We have said repeatedly that the principle of additionality is being flouted.
<P>
It is unfortunate that the Minister cannot give the assurances that the distribution bodies and the existing good causes want. He has been unable to comment directly on the points that I have made about what will happen after 2001 and has failed to mention the ability of a fund to expand considerably at the Secretary of State's direction. The Opposition must send out a clear message. We, in the Conservative party introduced the national lottery in the first place and we shall rigorously protect the integrity of the legislation in its original form. The Minister's response was inadequate, so I must press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The first group of amendments would re-establish the arm's length principle in the distribution of lottery money. We believe that that is a crucial and core element of the continued confidence in the national lottery by not only the distributing bodies but the public. The Sports Council states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We believe that the arms length principle between government and the Lottery distributing bodies should be maintained, and that the new powers given to the Secretary of State to instruct us to `comply' with directions to delegate to specific organisations is too prescriptive.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Conservative Members endorse those concerns.
<P>
The 1993 Act gave no power to the Secretary of State to distribute funds. The Bill is, therefore, a new departure. Once again, we must accept the fact that the Bill is designed to depart from the original good causes into areas that we believe are essential Government core funding; it breaches and flouts the principle of additionality. The Government are anxious to get their hands on the money for reasons that have already been expressed, and the Bill will enhance the Secretary of State's powers to do that. He does not want to place limits on the money so that it can be diverted to causes that he feels are desirable.
<P>
The critical point at stake is that the order that makes unique the New Opportunities Fund was never envisaged in the original legislation. The reason why there was such cross-party support for the national lottery in the first place was because of its true integrity of purpose, with no taint of the possibility of the moneys being used for essentially party political purposes. That is why the national lottery has been such a considerable success. People had confidence in how the moneys were distributed.
<P>
How can that departure be justified? It is part of the Government's on-going political agenda to bridge the gap in their public expenditure commitments on health and education because the public perception on 1 May of what would happen has clearly been let down. It contradicts the arm's length principle fundamentally--a principle that has been prized by the distributing bodies--and departs from the original theme of the national lottery.
<P>
The Sports Council also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are also concerned that the powers on the Secretary of State to issue directions to us in relation to our distributing strategies should not be too prescriptive. Delegate bodies must demonstrate that they can effectively account for expenditure of lottery funds.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That absolutely encapsulates our objection to the abrogation of the arm's length principle, which even the Sports Council, a recipient of lottery funds, has criticised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman trying to tell the Committee that directions in relation to lottery funds have not existed prior to the Bill, or does he accept that directions were made under the previous Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Springs:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify that for the hon. Gentleman. Of course the good causes were given a broad remit concerning what they could do and the distribution bodies had their own criteria, which were open to public inspection. That is entirely different from what is proposed in the Bill, under which orders may be passed at the behest of the Secretary of State--fundamentally different powers of direction from those that currently exist.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman may regard that as desirable--that is a matter for him--but a principle is being abrogated. There is no point denying the fact that it is a departure that strengthens the powers of the Secretary of State--not merely the distribution bodies and many other people, but Ministers have accepted that. I cannot understand why the hon. Gentleman should be in any doubt about that; it is not at issue. The real concern is what those powers will be used for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's explanation, if I can call it that. I am still a little amazed at what he has just said. The right hon. Member for South-West Surrey changed the directions in 1996 to include the word ``must'', giving clear directional orders from the Conservative Government to the boards. That breached the principle about which the hon. Gentleman appears to care so much today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> When the national lottery was set up, it was made absolutely plain by those who took the Bill through its parliamentary stages that changes would be made as the lottery evolved--for example, that spending would move from the capital side to the revenue side. Of course I accept that. What is different about the Bill--there is no doubt about this, because the Government have confirmed it--is that specific powers of direction are being granted to the Secretary of State concerning what the New Opportunities Fund can do. That is a considerable departure from what has gone before and one that is open to abuse. If the power is seen to be used politically, it will begin to undermine public confidence in the national lottery. The Secretary of State and his successors will be able to specify further new causes without further reference to Parliament. I hope that the Minister will confirm that; it is my understanding.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jim Murphy:</B> I wish to press the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hove. Reading the Standing Committee records from 25 February 1993, as I do--[Hon. Members: ``Get a life!''] I do not want to get a life. Important issues were debated. The hon. Member for West Suffolk can correct me if I am wrong, but clause 26(3) of the 1993 Act states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A body shall comply with any directions that the Secretary of State considers appropriate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How can the hon. Gentleman marry that with his comments today?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> There are two points there. If the hon. Gentleman can give me an example of direct ministerial interference, I should like to hear it. The hon. Member for Hove alluded to the Churchill papers, over which there was considerable controversy. The Secretary of State did not see fit to intervene. In his excitement to make his point, the hon. Member for Eastwood may have missed mine. Let me remind him that the Secretary of State will be able to specify new causes for the lottery without further reference to Parliament. That is in addition to and wholly different from the orders and powers of direction. With respect to the hon. Gentleman, that is not fertile territory for him; he is wrong. The Secretary of State's powers under the Bill are a radical departure in practice and in law from what has gone on before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Murphy:</B> I am neither right nor wrong; I am quoting the Official Report, which I use as an accurate representation of what happened here before I had the privilege of being elected. However, the hon. Gentleman challenged me to give an example. On 13 January 1993, the then Secretary of State told the Select Committee on National Heritage:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is appropriate for the Secretary of State in those circumstances to give advice to the Arts Council on the conditions under which the money can be spent.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a clear direction from the Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman would do well to read what members of his own party have said before criticising what the Government are doing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> There is a distinct difference in practice between advice sought by the Arts Council and direction. If the hon. Gentleman is interested in the proceedings of the Bill, I advise him to read Lord Gowrie's speech, in which he expressed concern about the radical change to the national lottery under the Bill. As the hon. Gentleman has referred to the Arts Council, he should refer to what Lord Gowrie actually said.
<P>
A Government spokesman in the Lords admitted that the New Opportunities Fund is fundamentally different from other funds. Lord McIntosh of Haringey said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Of course, the relationship between the Secretary of State and the new opportunities fund, as proposed in the Bill, is different from that which exists between the Secretary of State and other lottery distributors. There is no pretence otherwise.''--[Official Report, House of Lords, 22 January 1998; Vol. 584, c. CWH 71.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the arm's-length principle is being challenged. Lord McIntosh, with refreshing candour, admitted exactly what the Government are up to. This is a fundamental issue of the role of Government in the national lottery and of the confidence of the people that it will be not be abused by politicians for political purposes, whether now, or in 10 or 15 years' time. The distribution bodies are already anxious about that. We need more than reassurance from the Minister--something specific must be done to restore the underlying principles of what has been a successful national lottery. Therefore, I ask the Government to think again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fearn:</B> I shall speak to amendment No. 18, which I tabled as a probing amendment. I consulted the Library Association and libraries themselves. The amendment would allow the New Opportunities Fund, at its own discretion, to make grants for non-recurring but additional items of current expenditure necessary to facilitate the promotion of determined projects. Libraries, which are strapped for cash, are an example of where there could be non-recurring expenditure.
<P>
In addition to the general services that libraries provide, many run reading clubs for children during the holidays, homework help clubs during term time and many other services for children that indirectly benefit communities. The amendment would allow one-off payments for the set-up costs only of such facilities.
<P>
Setting up such schemes can also encourage partnership with other agencies, such as youth services, schools and voluntary groups--in other words, non-recurring items to help communities. Public libraries are currently eligible to apply for lottery funding--for instance from the national memorial heritage fund lottery unit--but only if the library is housed in a historic building. The national memorial heritage fund may also support projects to assist with the preservation, conservation and accessibility of special collections of national importance.
<P>
The Arts Council lottery unit would provide support for a new building, an extension or a refurbishment of a building if the project provided exhibition space, a performance space or some other facility to promote the arts in the locality, but it would not provide funds only for a library building.
<P>
I believe that the Government have adopted the policy commitment that lottery funds should be used only to provide additional facilities and not for mainstream funding. Will non-recurring items such as those for libraries that I mentioned be considered under the new ruling? As I say, it is only a probing amendment, but I hope that the Minister can give me an answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I have a few questions on amendment No. 18. The hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn) said that it was a probing amendment, but the more I consider it, the less clear I am about its meaning. Conservative Members accept that, over time, it would be proper for more money to be spent on revenue than on capital grants, but the amendment refers to ``non-recurring. . . current expenditure''. Most current expenditure, almost by definition, is recurring. The amendment seems to limit recurring and non-recurring items, so it is difficult to grasp the standing of revenue expenditure.
<P>
Amendment No. 18 is limited to ``determined projects''. The amendment continues:
<P>

On reading that for the first time, I thought that it was at least standing up for independence. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk that it is vital that the sticky hands of the Secretary of State are kept as far away as possible from the allocation of money. However, those words qualify ``determined projects'', and those projects are substantially determined by the Secretary of State. The independence that the amendment purports to give is not real.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fearn:</B> I have used the word ``recurring'' to refer to one-off payments within the expenditure that local government can propose, which are therefore not determined by the Secretary of State. The expenditure is determined first by the local authority. A one-off payment is needed for that expenditure to continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I would have been happier to support the amendment had it been clear that it was in favour of a move towards revenue support and that it was absolutely clear that such decisions were made completely independently of the Secretary of State. Those two matters are not made clear, so I am more ambivalent about the amendment than I would otherwise have been.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> With the permission of the Committee, before I come to amendment No. 12, I should like to answer first the points made by the hon. Member for Southport. The hon. Gentleman said fairly that his amendment No. 18 was a probing amendment. The tabling of such an amendment is an accepted convention in all parts of the House. Its precise wording is less important than the purpose behind it. It is a little confusing, however, because it seems to agree with the Government about the direction of the New Opportunities Fund, but wants to extend it to other projects.
<P>
Clearly, the issue that the hon. Gentleman wanted properly to explore and probe was funding for libraries. That has been a long-standing problem for the national lottery. I am sure that everyone understands that, unlike the arts, heritage and sport and other good causes in the original National Lottery etc. Act 1993, the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 made public libraries a statutory responsibility, which makes their funding more difficult legally. Such a position has been frustrating for many people. Like me, the hon. Gentleman loves libraries. I was the chairman of Staffordshire Libraries Committee and there is nothing like attempting to administer a service on the ground to realise the very good work undertaken by libraries. It has been a permanent frustration that libraries have not benefited to the same extent as the arts, heritage and sport.

<P>
Having said that, the benefits accrued to the library system have not been non-existent. Libraries have benefited to the extent of &#163;105 million and 94 projects have managed through the Heritage Lottery Fund, the arts lottery fund and the millennium fund to receive funding. Perhaps they have a right to expect more, given their extremely good work. It would be fair of the hon. Gentleman to recognise that we, as well as the previous Government, have faced a difficult legal position in ensuring that libraries benefit in a general sense from the lottery, because of our desire to hold to the principle of additionality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fearn:</B> Of those 94 projects, 70 are concerned with historic buildings and have not reached out to the libraries in the community.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. Indeed, the previous Government's National Heritage Act 1997 allowed for the purchasing of archives and special collections. That was a laudable attempt to extend the measure to other library interests.
<P>
I am glad that the hon. Gentleman approves of the direction of the New Opportunities Fund even if he does not approve of the fund generally. In the coming months, libraries stand to benefit considerably from it. They will be receiving &#163;20 million for information technology training, which is important for developing the information side of public libraries and &#163;50 million for the creation of content. If they can find the right projects to support and become involved in, the New Opportunities Fund will allow financing for out-of-school activities. In the year of literacy in which the Government are involved, libraries are already proving how imaginative and constructive they can be in respect of such activities.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has done the Commitee a service by raising the important issue of public libraries. I hope that what I have said shows how sympathetic the Government are. 
<P>
The Library Association together with my Department organised a seminar for public librarians to help them understand the opportunities that are inherent in the national lottery project and to assist them to make better use of, and have access to, the funds available. It was well attended. It was a good initiative by the association and I hope that public librarians will find ways to benefit from the national lottery pots of money, without breaching additionality. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Southport for raising that important point.
<P>
With their main amendment the Opposition seem to be revisiting the two matters--which I am sure we shall return to many times in Committee--of additionality and the independence of the boards. The hon. Member for West Suffolk made the point, as he has before, that the arm's-length principle--the independence of the boards--had somehow been breached. He said that the lottery would be used for party political purposes. Perish the thought. The independence of the boards is jealously guarded by both sides of the House and by the boards themselves. They are independent entities. The people who have already accepted posts on them are able and eminent. I am sure that those appointed to the New Opportunities Fund will prove every bit as independent as the others. The idea that they are puppets of Government is a surprising slur on the independence of the board members.

<P>

<B>Mr. Spring:</B> At no time did I cast aspersions on the integrity, credibility or independence of the individuals making up the distribution bodies. I ask the Minister to rephrase what he said about my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman was talking about the independence of the boards. They are wholly independent because the board members and chairmen are determined to retain that independence. Quite right too. They, not Governments, are the experts on what projects should be supported. They are an essential part of the national lottery project.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman went on to talk about delegation of decision making. Perhaps it would be appropriate to consider that matter in greater detail under clause 10. However, such a power has been set out, and the hon. Gentleman will, I hope, have seen the new draft directions that we issued recently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Last night.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Very recently. We issued those to help explain how the new section 43C(1) that clause 6 would insert in the 1993 Act will work. Our purpose is to be helpful to this House and the distributing bodies. The draft directions are work in progress, and we shall be happy to consult the chairman and members of the New Opportunities Fund, once that is up and running, on how the directions are to work in practice.
<P>
I hope that when the hon. Member for West Suffolk studies the draft directions he will realise that there is no malign intent behind the delegation of decision-making powers. It is a benign power in the Act. There is nothing suspicious about it. The Secretary of State would not be able to force the New Opportunities Fund to make grants or to do anything. There would be no such power. The hon. Gentleman is reading into the proposed new section as sinister intent that is not there.
<P>
Delegation strengthens the arm's-length rule. Power is delegated away from the centre, instead of being kept at the centre--a tendancy that many people have criticised about the national lottery. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will see that his amendment is best treated as a probing amendment, and that when he reads the draft policy directions he will appreciate that what we propose is a sensible and orderly way of conducting the New Opportunities Fund's business. I ask him not to pursue the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> It is a probing amendment, but in the light of the Minister's comments, it seems to be probing a vacuum. He did not provide substantive replies to the critically important points that I raised in my opening remarks. I am sure that he wanted to be helpful in supplying the draft directions on the New Opportunities Fund--I accept the fact that they are draft directions. However, it is difficult to give them the attention that I am sure they deserve when they were produced only the night before being distributed. If the Minister intends to produce further background information on important aspects of the Bill, I urge him to encourage those responsible to produce them in a way that is more helpful to the successful consideration and conduct of the Committee.
<P>
As I said, the Bill flouts the principles of additionality and of arm's length, which were fundamental to the original legislation. I again refer the Minister to the remarks of his noble Friend Lord McIntosh of Haringey:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Of course, the relationship between the Secretary of State and the new opportunities fund, as proposed in the Bill, is different from that which exists between the Secretary of State and other lottery distributors. There is no pretence otherwise.''--[Official Report, House of Lords, 22 January 1998; Vol. 584, c. CWH 71.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister did not deny that the Secretary of State and his successors will be enabled to specify new causes without further reference to Parliament. By giving powers of direction and interference and by abrogating the arm's length principle, I believe that we are setting a precedent that could be damaging to public confidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not seem to realise for whom the power is being provided--it is for the boards. They will have the power to delegate decision making, but are not required to do so. The Secretary of State cannot compel the boards to delegate powers and if they do not choose to use them, they will not be used. The power is given into the hands of the New Opportunities Fund. It is not a power for the Secretary of State to employ. The hon. Gentleman seems to misunderstand that, which is understandable in dealing with new territory. I hope that he will accept that the power is for the new opportunities fund to use if it wishes, at its discretion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I fear that the Minister misunderstands my point. Of course I accept that the New Opportunities Fund will delegate and make decisions in accordance with what it deems desirable, but I am concerned about the overarching power of the Secretary of State, in the context of the overall construction of the New Opportunities Fund, the percentage of money allocated and his powers of direction. I am concerned about the fact that the Secretary of State can take to himself, by order, additional powers that stretch into the area where the arm's length principle is at risk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It is clear that my hon. Friend is not in danger of being seduced by the Minister's words--
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I will try again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Were he in such danger, I would commend to him the directions that we have so recently been given. They begin by instructing the New Opportunities Fund board to commit projects to healthy living centres that will cover 20 per cent. of the population. The Minister has already decided that four fifths of the population will not be able to benefit from the healthy living centres.
<P>
Mr. Spring: That is precisely the point. That is something that a politician has decided and therefore has moved to direct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I want to make one further point clear, which I hope the hon. Gentleman will consider before, I hope, deciding to withdraw his amendment. He raises the spectre of the Secretary of State extending matters further: any further initiatives, over and above those in which the New Opportunities Fund will get involved, will--as he will appreciate from his close reading of the Bill--require affirmative resolution of the House. So, the powers remain with the House, rather than the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I conclude by saying that the matter is an important one of principle; it is an underlying theme of the Bill to which we object. I therefore wish to press amendment No. 12 to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fearn:</B> In view of the Minister's assurances, I do not intend to press amendment No. 18.
