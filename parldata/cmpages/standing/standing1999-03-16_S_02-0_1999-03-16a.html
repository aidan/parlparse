<H4><center>Memorandum from the Refugee Council</center></H4>
<H4><center>1 UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND THE NEW SUPPORT SYSTEM</center></H4>
<P>
The Government argues that the payment of cash benefits is an incentive for economic migrants to make unfounded asylum applications in the UK and that the removal of benefits will see a subsequent reduction in the number of applications. However, all the available evidence indicates that this assumption is wrong.
<P>
If asylum seekers were coming to the UK because of the availability of cash payments then one would expect them to apply at port so that they could access these benefits. Yet, despite the hardship suffered by asylum seekers on National Assistance Act support, which is cashless, there has been no change in the ratio of port to in-country applicants over the last two years. It remains static at 49 per cent. in-country applicants and 51 per cent. port applicants. Nor has there been an increase in asylum applications in Scotland despite the fact that cash payments are still available there for in-country applicants.
<P>
Furthermore, cash payments have not been an incentive to asylum seekers to make applications in the many other European countries which offer more generous reception facilities to asylum seekers than the UK. The following figures are weekly allowances paid to single adult asylum seekers out of which they are expected to pay for food, clothes, transport, toiletries, and other personal items. Housing is provided separately&#151;most commonly through reception centres or state accommodation&#151;unless stated otherwise:
<P>
Sweden:&#151;&#163;32.29&#151;Asylum seekers must take Swedish language classes and work placements to qualify for the allowance. They are allowed to work after four months.
<P>
Switzerland:&#151;&#163;41.07&#151;This is an average allowance in state accommodation in Bern. Allowances vary with asylum seekers receiving more if they help out in the centres, obey the rules, etc.
<P>
Germany:&#151;&#163;41.10&#151;This information relates to Berlin. Provision for asylum seekers varies from one Land to another. Can be paid in cash or coupons.
<P>
Denmark:&#151;&#163;45.77&#151;An additional clothing allowance is available after 150 days.
<P>
Luxemburg:&#151;&#163;48.00&#151;After three months asylum seekers are also given a monthly travel card.
<P>
Norway:&#151;&#163;51.70&#151;Asylum seekers can also get temporary work permits if they have a job offer.
<P>
Finland:&#151;&#163;53.47&#151;Asylum seekers receive the same living allowance as Finnish nationals. Accommodation is provided free, normally in reception centres.
<P>
Ireland:&#151;&#163;63.51&#151;Medical cards also cover most medical expenses. A rent allowance is provided separately.
<P>
Belgium:&#151;&#163;99.00&#151;This is given to those who are not held in reception centres. It does not include accommodation, although a rent allowance is available in certain cases.
<P>
The UK's current support system is already harsher than most of its EU counterparts as all in-country applicants (roughtly half the total number of applicants) and all those on appeal have no access to cash payments unless they are families with children. A single adult asylum seeker who has no other means of support and applies at port will receive &#163;45.30 per week. As the above statistics illustrate, this is not generous by European standards.
<P>
As the evidence above clearly indicates, the establishment of a largely cashless system of support for destitute asylums seekers is unlikely to have any real impact on the number of applications made in the UK. The Refugee Council believes that the great majority of applicants are fleeing persecution and civil conflict (nearly 30 per cent. of all applications last year came from the former Yugoslavia and Somalia and these countries had recognition rates of 89 per cent. and above).
<P>
During 1998, 35 per cent. of all substantive decisions were grants of refugee status or exceptional leave to remain. This does not include those who win appeals, which is estimated to be 11 per cent. for 1998 (Hansard 27 January 1999, column 249). Of the remainder who are refused, we believe that the majority do have a proper case and/or a genuine fear, even if they are ultimately judged not to meet the criteria for receiving protection in the UK.
<P>
The Refugee Council does not dispute that some asylum applications are without merit, but if the Government wishes to remove the incentive to those making unfounded applications then the most effective deterrent would be to speed up the decision-making time. As of December 1998, the average time taken to recognise a refugee who applied before 1993 was 81 months and for a refugee who applied post-1993 it was 20 months (Hansard 16 February 1999, column 657). This means refugees are left waiting literally years before they can restart their lives, while those with unfounded applications know that it will take nearly two years before their claim is assessed. This is the real incentive for abuse, not the availability of cash benefits.
<H4><center>2 COST IMPLICATIONS, BOTH FINANCIAL AND HUMANITARIAN, OF THE NEW SUPPORT SYSTEM</center></H4>
<P>
In general, Section VI removes all benefit rights from asylum seekers and their families as well as local authorities' obligations towards them under sections of the National Assistance, Housing and Children Acts. In their place the Government proposes to set up a largely cashless system of support based on vouchers to sustain those who would otherwise be destitute. Asylum seekers will be offered accommodation anywhere in the UK on a no choice basis. Asylum seeking children will be included in a cashless system for the first time and they will be the only children in the UK to be excluded from some of the provisions of the Children Act. We believe the operation of Section VI is fundamentally incompatible with the intention of the Children Act and the promotion of children's wellbeing.
<P>
The Bill takes asylum seekers outside the minimum standards of social support normally provided in this country without obliging the Home Secretary to meet those minimum standards. There are periods in which no support at all will be provided, for example if an asylum seeker is seeking judicial review through the courts, or appealing against a refusal to provide support. In addition asylum seekers will not be able to express reasonable preferences about the location or type of accommodation which they will be allocated (eg a desire to be near family or friends). There is a real danger that the new system will be as chaotic as the existing support mechanism and that sylum seekers will become more and more socially excluded.
<P>
The Government has already accepted that the support system proposed in Section VI is more costly per person. It will also involve the establishment of a new bureaucracy in the Home Office, the Asylum Support Directorate, in order to administer this system, with consequent expenses. Added to this will be the cost of providing additional grants for the development of supporting infrastructure to areas where significant numbers of asylum seekers are to be clustered.
<P>
The Government has projected that the costs associated with the new support system will go down over the next three years based on two assumptions. First, that the numbers of applications will go down because cash benefits will not be available. As outlined above, all the evidence would indicate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Secondly, the Government has stated that the time taken to dispose of any asylum application and appeal will be reduced to six months and the backlog of initial decisions will be cleared by 2001. Given that the backlog of asylum applications awaiting initial decisions went up by approximately 13,000 last year and that the Home Office is currently moving offices and does not envisage getting back to 1998 levels of efficiency until April, we believe that there is no prospect of these targets being reached. The consequence of this will be that the new system will become more and more costly to administer, possibly making it unsustainable.
<P>
From the point of view of the asylum seeker, the six month deadline is equally important as it will be increasingly difficult for asylum seekers to sustain themselves after this period of time. It is also extremely important to stress that a cashless support system is demeaning to the individual and stigmatises asylum seekers in general. Research carried out by the Refugee Council in 1996 showed that some adult asylum seekers living on National Assistance Act support, which is a cashless system, saw both their mental and physical health deteriorate over a two month period. More recent research, carried out in 1998, confirmed that many asylum seekers in Britain continue to suffer severe hardship. A random survey of nearly 200 of the Refugee Council's clients, found that:
<P>
Over 60 per cent of the asylum seekers we interviewed did not have enough to eat on a daily basis.
<P>
Nearly 75 per cent were completely penniless, with no cash for bus fares and other necessities.
<P>
The Refugee Council is fundamentally opposed to Section VI because it will cause considerable hardship for asylum seekers and their families and it will establish a new bureaucracy in the Home Office to do something that the benefits system could do both cheaper and better. We believe the system is based on assumptions which are fundamentally incorrect and we are not convinced that it will be sustainable in the long term.
<P>
The new Asylum Support Directorate is likely to require around 200 staff to run it. If these staff were employed at the Home Office taking decisions on asylum claims they would be able to take in the region of an extra 40,000 decisions a year. If resources had been allocated in this way the credibility of the decision-making system would be re-established and there would be substantial savings from reducing both the backlog and the asylum seeker's waiting times.
<P>
It is worth highlighting that the Bill does not contain any proposals to help with the settlement of refugees. This is a considerable oversight given that Section VI envisages clustering asylum seekers in areas where there is likely to be inadequate training and education facilities. If a proper settlement policy is not implemented then refugees' skills will not be fully utilised and the intentions of the new support system will be undermined because refugees will drift back to London where they are more likely to find the support facilities to help them restart their lives.
<P>
If the Government does decide to pursue this system there are a number of clauses and subsections which need to be amended to ensure that people are treated with a minimum level of dignity. We have outlined below areas where we believe the Bill's provisions will be impractical, unjust or may result in legal difficulties for the Government and made recommendations as to how legislation might be amended.
<H4><center>3. ANALYSIS OF CLAUSES IN SECTION VI AND RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS</center></H4>
<H4><center>Clause 73</center></H4>
<P>
defines who is an asylum seeker to be supported in this new system. It will include anyone over 18 and any dependents they may have including children. Unaccompanied children will not be part of the scheme but remain the responsibility of local authorities.
<H4><center>Recommendation</center></H4>
<P>
We are particularly concerned about the lack of any specific provision for 16 and 17 year olds as many local authorities are currently treating this vulnerable group as adults.
<H4><center>Clause 73(1), line 24</center></H4>
<P>
A claim for asylum is limited to claims under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). It is difficult to see why support would be offered to someone who was claiming a breach of Article 3 of the ECHR (that no one shall be subject to torture), but that the support could not be offered to someone who was claiming, for example, a breach of Article 2 (the right to life) or Article 8 (the right to family life).
<H4><center>Recommendation</center></H4>
<P>
The Secretary of State should have the power to offer support to anyone who has a claim based on a breach of the ECHR.
<H4><center>Clause 73(1), line 26</center></H4>
<P>
The definition of dependent is limited only to a child of the asylum seeker or their spouse. This would appear to exclude children who are dependent on an adult other than their parents, for example an aunt or an elder brother, from being supported by the Secretary of State. It would also exclude unmarried partners, children who are over 18 and all other relatives from being described as dependents. This could lead to many additional and unnecessary asylum applications being made and there is also the possibility that families would be separated when accommodation is allocated under the new support system.
<H4><center>Recommendation</center></H4>
<P>
There needs to be a broader definition of dependent.
<H4><center>Clause 73(3), line 6</center></H4>
<P>
Proscribes when an asylum claim can be considered as determined and, following a notice period when support can be cut off. In the Explanatory Notes the notice period is described as ``no less than 14 days''. It is clear that 14 days will not be sufficient time to obtain either benefits, employment or alternative accommodation once status is granted.
<H4><center>Recommendation</center></H4>
<P>
Support should not be terminated until those granted asylum or ELR have access to other means of support otherwise there is a very real danger that those who have been recognised as refugees will be left homeless.
<H4><center>Clause 73(5), line 15.</center></H4>
<P>
Asylum seekers with children will continue to be supported under the new system even after their appeal has been dismissed. This should ensure that families with children are not left destitute, but no provision is made for other asylum seekers who have had their appeals refused, but cannot leave the UK immediately, for example: pregnant women or sick asylum seekers; asylum seekers who are ready to leave, but are waiting for travel documents; asylum seekers who cannot be removed because an outbreak of violence in their country of origin has made it unsafe to return them; and asylum seekers who are awaiting the outcome of a judicial review.
<P>
The Bill as it is currently drafted intends to leave these people destitute even though they cannot leave the UK. It would also force people who have been granted judicial review into destitution and thereby could prevent them from exercising their legal rights.
<H4><center>Recommendation</center></H4>
<P>
It is fundamentally unjust to leave these people destitute and statutory provision should be made for them until such time as they are able to leave or, in the case of those on judicial review, until they have received the determination.
<H4><center>Clauses 74(1).</center></H4>
<P>
Gives the Secretary of State a power, but no obligation to support destitute asylum seekers. This is unacceptable. This is after all a final safety net for those facing destitution and some of these people will eventually be recognised as refugees. We are also concerned that the Bill gives the Secretary of State powers to exclude ``such persons as may be prescribed'' under 74(2).
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
There should be a duty on the Secretary of State to provide support. We do not believe anybody should be excluded from this support, but if the Secretary of State intends to do this it should be made specific on the face of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 74(3).</center></H4>
<P>
Defines destitute as not having adequate accommodation or having it but not the means of meeting essential living needs. However ``adequate accommodation'' and ``essential living needs'' are not defined. What constitutes adequate accommodation is to be prescribed in 74(6).
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
These definitions should be based on existing housing legislation and be made clear during the Standing Committee.
<H4><center>Clause 74(6)(b) & (d).</center></H4>
<P>
Makes clear that the Secretary of State cannot take into account whether accommodation is shared or the location of the accommodation when considering whether it is adequate or not. This would apparently mean that families with children might have to share with adults or that women could have to share with men and that the Secretary of State would have to disregard these matters.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
There must be flexibility within the system to take such factors into account, possibly by prescribing them as issues to which the Secretary of State must have regard in (5)(a).
<H4><center>Clause 74(7) & amp; (8).</center></H4>
<P>
Subsection 7 deals with whether the asylum seeker's essential living needs are met, but gives no clue at all as to the criteria for making this decision. Similarly, subsection 8 gives the Secretary of State the power to specify, by regulation, which items should be considered as essential living needs.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
There should be an objective means test to determine whether essential living needs are met, based on existing tests for benefits. Furthermore, we believe that what constitutes essential living needs should be laid out on the face of the Bill. The definition should cover day to day living expenses and include in particular: food, household fuel, the purchase, repair and replacement of clothing and footwear, normal travel costs, weekly laundry costs, miscellaneous household expenses such as toilet articles, cleaning materials, and the purchase and replacement of small household goods (eg crockery, cutlery, cooking utensils, bedding etc). This definition is almost identical to that used in the 1980 Social Security Act.
<H4><center>Clause 74(9-11).</center></H4>
<P>
Empowers the Secretary of State to specify conditions which have to be met in order for support to be offered. These are not specified although the explanatory notes mention the behaviour of the applicant. The conditions will be in writing and given to the asylum seeker.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
The exact nature of these conditions should be made clear during the course of the Standing Committee. The conditions should be made available to the asylum applicant in a language that they can understand. If there is to be a compact between the asylum seeker and the Secretary of State then there should be a commitment in terms of the quality of provision given to the asylum seeker.
<H4><center>Clause 75(1).</center></H4>
<P>
Outlines the ways that support may be provided (housing, essential living needs and other expenses, excluding legal costs, connected with the asylum claim). Once again there is no duty put on the Secretary of State to provide support. Furthermore, the support will be made available at whatever level the Secretary of State deems necessary.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
There should be a duty to provide this basic assistance to people who would otherwise be destitute and objective definitions, based on existing homelessness and benefits legislation, should be incorporated onto the face of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 75(2).</center></H4>
<P>
Enables the Secretary of State to use ``other ways'' to support individual asylum seekers if he considers ``the circumstances of a particular case are exceptional''. It is unclear whether ``other ways'' allow additional payments to be made to the existing package (in cash or in kind) or whether the provision could be made entirely outside the support in kind scheme.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
We would welcome the possibility of taking vulnerable people out of the cashless system of support, but we are concerned that the definition of ``exceptional circumstances'' is as inclusive as possible, particularly as some local government responsibilities to the most vulnerable asylum seekers under other legislation have been removed.
<H4><center>Clause 75(3, 4 and 5).</center></H4>
<P>
Subsection 3 provides that support should not normally be made by cash payments. However, subsections 4 and 5 give the Secretary of State the power to repeal this subsection entirely or to remove certain categories of people from it. These subsections appear to indicate that the Government is far from confident that the cashless system will reduce the numbers of applications and therefore allows for the whole system to be ditched in favour of the more cost-effective benefits system if it fails to function.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
We believe that there should be a provision within the Bill which puts asylum seekers back in the benefits system if they have not received a final decision on their claim after six months. The government's proposals assume that the support system will only be temporary, but if they fail to meet their six month target then the cost of the system increases as does the suffering of asylum seekers. This amendment will provide an incentive to the Home Office to improve efficiency and a safeguard to asylum seekers and their families.
<H4><center>Clause 76(1)(b).</center></H4>
<P>
This subsection expresses the desirability of providing accommodation in areas where there is a ready supply of accommodation. It also gives the Secretary of State the power to prescribe other factors that he must take into consideration.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
The Secretary of State must also have an obligation to look at issues such as access to community groups, good legal representation and good race relations when providing accommodation to asylum seekers. If this is not made specific then there is a real danger that asylum seekers will end up isolated on sink estates because these are generally the areas where there is a ready supply of accommodation.
<H4><center>Clause 76(2)(a).</center></H4>
<P>
This subsection makes it clear that any preference an asylum seeker may have as to where they are housed cannot be taken into account. This would mean that if an asylum seeker had a brother in, for example, Newcastle, but his brother had a family and no room to accommodate him, then the preference the asylum seeker had to be housed near his family could not be taken into account.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
Asylum seekers who are surviving in the new cashless system will, more than ever, need the support and help of friends or community groups. To deprive them of this support will not only cause additional hardship, but will also undermine the goal of trying to cluster asylum seekers in areas outside London. Previous experience with Vietnamese refugees shows that without the support of community groups, asylum seekers drift back to areas where there are existing communities&#151;most frequently London. This could also lead to a breach of Article 8 of ECHR as it may separate family members as the definition of dependent is extremely restrictive (see clause 73 (1) line 26). This clause must be amended so the Secretary of State can consider these matters.
<H4><center>Clause 76(5).</center></H4>
<P>
This allows the Secretary of State to limit the overall amount of expenditure he can incur in relation to a supported person. This would mean that asylum seekers' essential needs might not be met because the amount of money that can be spent on an individual has been capped. This would affect all asylum seekers including those with children and those in ``exceptional circumstances''.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
No limit should be set as this support system is a safety net of last resort and an individual's needs should be met within this system. Where children are involved this could also contravene the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
<H4><center>Clause 76(5)(a).</center></H4>
<P>
This subsection specifies that the level of support will be whatever proportion of income support the Secretary of State considers appropriate, but this amount is not specified. Furthermore, Clause 75(3) makes clear that provision will not normally be made through a cash payment, although a small cash element is likely to be included. This broadly cashless system will require a parallel welfare system to be set up, with its own bureaucracy and at considerable cost.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
We remain convinced that the only sensible, cost effective and humane way to deliver support to asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute is through the benefit system. However, if the system outlined in this section of the Bill is to be used then the level of support should not be lower than the 90 per cent. of income support that asylum seekers currently receive. It is also essential that a reasonable amount of this is made as a cash payment as this will give asylum seekers some flexibility and basic dignity in meeting their needs and those of their children while their claims are being assessed.
<H4><center>Clause 77.</center></H4>
<P>
Allows for support to be cut off if an asylum seeker ceases to reside in the accommodation given. The explanatory notes indicate that support will be cut off after an extended absence, but we are concerned that people who spend a few nights away from their given address may be removed from the support system.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
We believe that proper safeguards need to be built into the primary legislation, possibly through 77(6) which gives a power not to apply this provision, to ensure that asylum seekers are not left homeless when they have a compelling reason for having left their accommodation, such as to escape harassment or violence.
<H4><center>Clause 78.</center></H4>
<P>
Allows the Secretary of State to make rules regarding the operation of the scheme by regulation. It is not specified in what circumstances support may be provided, what will be taken into account in making this decision, the level and kind of support to be provided, what the threshold of eligibility for support will be or how applications for support will be made.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
These fundamental details of how the system will operate need to be made explicit during Standing Committee.
<H4><center>Clause 78(3)(b).</center></H4>
<P>
Gives the Secretary of State powers to decide what assets or support the asylum seeker already has available when deciding whether to provide support.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
These powers should not be operated to pressurise friends or family into supporting the asylum seeker or to force the individual into selling personal items like a watch (as happened to individuals on National Assistance Act support) before they would be considered for assistance.
<H4><center>Clause 78(4)(c).</center></H4>
<P>
Allows for an application for support not to be considered.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
Once again we believe that people should not be excluded from a system which is a safety net of last resort. However, if categories of asylum seekers are to be excluded from support then this should be made specific in primary legislation.
<H4><center>Clause 82.</center></H4>
<P>
Gives the Secretary of State the power to designate an area as a ``reception zone'' and direct a local authority to make unoccupied accommodation available. No criteria is given to indicate how an area will be designated as a reception zone.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
Only areas which can offer appropriate support facilities, such as good legal advice, community support and schools which have the facilities to teach non-English speaking children, should be designated a reception zones.
<H4><center>Clauses 83-85.</center></H4>
<P>
These clauses detail the establishment of the Asylum Support Adjudicators who will hear appeals against either a refusal to provide support or the withdrawal of support while a claim is still pending. These are the only grounds of appeal and there will only be one appeal unless the individual's circumstances change.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
All asylum seekers should be supported while an appeal is being considered, otherwise individuals and families with children will be left suffering hardship or left entirely destitute. This is particularly important as we do not know how long it will take for a decision to be reached and because the adjudicator has a power to remit the decision back to the Secretary of State for further consideration.
<H4><center>Clauses 86-90.</center></H4>
<P>
These clauses detail offences that could be committed by either an applicant for support, a sponsor or organisation by giving false or dishonest information in order to obtain support for an asylum seeker. The offences are comparable to existing social security legislation, but we are concerned that the drafting may criminalise some people unfairly. For example:
<H4><center>Clause 88(1)(b).</center></H4>
<P>
Makes someone guilty of an offence if they refuse or neglect to answer a question or give information. There is nothing here to indicate whether they intentionally did not comply.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
We believe they should only be guilty of an offence under this clause if they knowingly refuse or neglect to answer a question.
<H4><center>Clause 89.</center></H4>
<P>
Makes it an imprisonable offence to fail or refuse to maintain a person in accordance with an undertaking.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
Some account must be taken of the reasons for refusing or failing to support an individual, e.g. the person was abusive or the sponor became ill or was obliged to become a carer for elderly parents.
<H4><center>Clause 91.</center></H4>
<P>
Gives powers to the Secretary of State to reimburse local authorities for costs they incur in providing services to asylum seekers, including council tax.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
We are concerned that there is no provision to reimburse local authorities for any expenditure on unaccompanied children. We also believe that it is essential that local authorities receive adequate compensation to cover additional ``secondary'' costs which will be associated with clustering asylum seekers in specified areas (e.g. extra demands on health and education services) and that they also receive funding to promote the settlement of refugees.
<H4><center>Clause 93.</center></H4>
<P>
Allows the Secretary of State to recover expenditure on support where someone has ``failed to disclose a material fact (whether fraudulently or otherwise)''.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
It must be made clear that this recovery clause would not operate against an asylum seeker when they were unaware that there were friends or members of their community who would have been able to support them.
<H4><center>Clause 95.</center></H4>
<P>
Removes all benefit entitlement from all asylum seekers and indeed anyone who ``is a person subject to immigration control''. The Refugee Council fundamentally opposes the exclusion of all asylum seekers from the mainstream benefits system regardless of their needs.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
This clause means that, for example, asylum seekers who are disabled or have disabled children will not be eligible for any disability benefits or child benefit regardless of how young or vulnerable these children may be. Access to these types of benefits should be based on need and the best interests of the child respectively.
<H4><center>Clause 96.</center></H4>
<P>
Amends the National Assistance Act to exclude asylum seekers and anyone subject to immigration control from the provision of residential care solely because they are destitute.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
We remain concerned that this will further exclude asylum seekers from mainstream support. Although they would still qualify for care and assistance if they were, for example ill, it is unclear how it will be decided if their physical need for assistance arises out of their destitution or some other cause. If it is the former the local authorities could not assist them.
<H4><center>Clause 97(1).</center></H4>
<P>
Removes entitlements from asylum seekers and persons subject to immigration control to services under section 45 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968. This will prevent social services departments using a power, and it is a power not a duty, to provide services to the elderly simply because they are subject to immigration control. These services include meals and recreation in the home or elsewhere, information on services for the elderly, assistance with travel, social work advice and support, home help and adaptations.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
The Refugee Council cannot accept the withdrawl of services which are only used for the promotion of the welfare of elderly people and which the local authority has no duty to provide. This subsection would, for example, prevent local authorities from providing meals on wheels services to elderly asylum seekers who were making their own provision possibly forcing them into the cashless support system. This clause should be deleted.
<H4><center>Clause 97(2).</center></H4>
<P>
Removes entitlements from asylum seekers and persons subject to immigration control from paragraph 2 of Schedule 8 of the National Health Service Act 1977. This means that local authorities will not be able to provide day centres, meals, advice and support from social services, night sitter services, or social and recreational activities to people who are ill. Furthermore, asylum seekers are excluded from the framework for social work service for the identification, assessment, diagnosis and social treatment of mental illness, including the provision of day centres for people suffering from mental disorders.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
Once again the Refugee Council cannot accept the withdrawl of services which are focussed solely on arrangements for the prevention of illness, assisting people who are ill and those who need aftercare. This can only lead to vulnerable asylum seekers and others subject to immigration control suffering further hardship and social exclusion. Nor can it be desirable for the wider community that people suffering from mental or physical illness are deprived of the care and assistance they need. This clause should be deleted.
<H4><center>Clause 98.</center></H4>
<P>
Amends Scottish legislation and thereby prevents Scottish local authorities providing services to asylum seekers including cash payments which, unlike English and Welsh authorities, they have been able to do up till now.
<H4><center>Clause 99.</center></H4>
<P>
Amends the 1989 Children Act, and its Scottish equivalent, with the intended purpose of removing access to support for destitute asylum seeking families from social services under section 17 of the 1989 Act. This is the first time that the Children Act has been amended to exclude a group of children from any of the minimum standards of treatment that the Act established for all children.
<P>
This clause is discriminatory and clearly incompatible with Section 1(1) of the Children Act which states that the child's well-being is of ``paramount importance''. The Refugee Council's experience shows that adult asylum seekers have suffered hardship on National Assistance Act support and putting families with children into this cashless system cannot be in the best interests of any children.
<P>
Furthermore, if the child's need is caused by the family's destitution, the local authority has no power to meet these needs. It would, however, still have a duty to accommodate a child in need if the person who has been caring for the child is prevented from finding the child suitable accommodation (Section 20(1) of the Children Act). We are concerned that the clause would result in more asylum seeking children being taken into care.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
We firmly believe that this clause is contrary to the intention of the Children Act and will not operate in the best interests of asylum seeking children. We believe this clause should be deleted and families with children should be maintained within the existing benefits system.
<H4><center>Clause 101</center></H4>
<P>
Gives any person authorised by the Secretary of State power to enter any premises provided as part of the support system ``using reasonable force if necessary''.
<P>
This power is excessive and dangerous and appears to be in conflict with an individual's right to privacy. The power to enter using reasonable force is given to ``a person'' without any safeguards or accountability as to how these powers will be used.
<H4><center>Recommendation:</center></H4>
<P>
This clause needs to be amended and appropriate safeguards inserted.
<H4><center>4. Conclusion</center></H4>
<P>
The Refugee Council believes the support system outlined in the Bill is fundamentally flawed. There is no evidence to support the notion that asylum seekers come to Britain because of a cash based benefit system, indeed more asylum applications were made in 1998 than any year previously despite the withdrawal of cash benefits from 50 per cent of applicants. Furthermore, we are not convinced that initial asylum claims will be determined within two months and final decisions within a further four. The system proposed in Section VI is more expensive per person than benefits and more cumbersome to administer. We believe that there is a real danger that the new support system will not be sustainable.
<P>
Living in a cashless system will cause asylum seekers severe hardship and rob individuals of their dignity. We are particularly concerned about the effect this system will have on children and other vulnerable groups. The Children Act was hailed as a primary piece of legislation that promoted the welfare of all children and any amendments to exclude asylum seeking children from any of its protection is a profoundly retrograde step.
<P>
Finally, there is a real danger that this system will undermine the government's commitment to combatting social exclusion. Section VI is likely to push already impoverished refugee communities into further hardship by making them responsible for the welfare of other members of their community with very limited support. It will also leave many asylum seekers isolated from their own communities yet stigmatised in the wider community. Other asylum seekers will be left entirely destitute.
<P>
We believe that it is absolutely essential that the package of support offered to asylum seekers under the new system should not be less than 90 per cent of income support they currently receive and that a reasonable amount of this should be made available in cash.
<P>
If the Government is intent on pursuing a cashless system of support for asylum seekers then the Refugee Council believes that the recommendations outlined above for amendments to Section VI are essential to ensure that individuals are treated with a minimum level of dignity.
<H4><center>Memorandum from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants</center></H4>
<H4><center>INTRODUCTION</center></H4>
<P>
The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants is the only independent national organisation working exclusively in the field of immigration, asylum and nationality law. We are committed to working for an end to racism in UK immigration laws.
<P>
The Immigration and Asylum Bill 1999 (the Bill) is by far the biggest piece of legislation in this area ever seen in the UK, but it shows signs of having been put together with too much haste. JCWI is worried by many of its provisions:
<P>
in places the expressed narrow intentions of government are not matched by the widely drawn terms of the Bill (eg. clauses 7, 9, 10 and 116)
<P>
in many places the intentions of government remain unknown until secondary legislation is produced (eg. clauses 7, 10, 15, 95 and 97)
<P>
a number of measures risk breaching the Human Rights Act (or European Convention on Human Rights) (eg. clauses 6, 133 and Part III)
<P>
some seem likely to inflame community division (eg. clauses 6, 15 and Part VII)
<H4><center>PART I: IMMIGRATION: GENERAL</center></H4>
<P>
The Bill proposes a further concentration of immigration controls against designated nationalities overseas, through British High Commissions and Embassies. We are opposed to further development in this direction. The compulsory visa list, weighted heavily against African and Asian countries, inclines the immigration system towards institutional racism, with disproportionate impact on those nationalities.
<H4><center>Clauses 1-3: Visas and conditions of entry</center></H4>
<P>
These clauses will make entry clearance officers (ECOs) responsible not only for issuing visas which will allow people to embark on their journeys to the UK, but also for their conditions of entry. Shifting checks overseas, away from UK ports of entry, risks further increase in already prohibitively high visa fees.
<H4><center>Clause 6: Removal of certain persons unlawfully in the UK</center></H4>
<P>
This provision is perhaps the most draconian in the Bill. It allows for directions for the removal of certain persons who in the view of an immigration officer are in breach of a condition of leave to remain, who have obtained leave to remain by deception, or are a member of the family of a person who has been served with directions for removal. Such people would previously have been subject instead to deportation. No distinction will any longer be drawn between those who have held lawful status, but are in breach of one or more of their conditions of entry or stay, and those who have never been other than unlawfully present.
<P>
It will not be possible by these means to ensure justice, nor to avoid strong grievances being held. This move would engender tension and mistrust within established communities, and would lead to breaches of human rights obligations. The inevitable result would be an increase in applications for judicial review, and increases in ill-founded claims to asylum and (perhaps more well-founded) claims under clause 47 (actions contrary to the Human Rights Act). This is not a recipe for consistent decision-making, nor for quicker or fairer procedures.
<P>
Decisions on removal are made by immigration officers, while the powers of deportation must be exercised by the Secretary of State. Unless and until the immigration service is made subject to effective oversight, an independent complaints procedure, and the effects of the Race Relations Act, these changes will further institutionalize the most divisive features of the current immigration control system.
<H4><center>Clauses 7 and 8: Financial bonds</center></H4>
<P>
These clauses provide a mechanism for the Secretary of State to permit or require security to be given in respect of people applying for entry clearance and applying for leave to remain in the UK, and for that security to be forfeit if the person does not leave the UK.
<P>
Many people living in the UK desperately want to be able to provide some security to show their integrity and support their relatives' visit applications. There are serious drawbacks to this proposal and it should be considered very carefully, and amended, before any pilot project takes place. If the drawbacks outweigh any benefits it provides, it should not be implemented but further training and support to entry clearance officers to help them make correct and unbiased decisions should be given. It is to be hoped that the reintroduction of appeal rights for refused visitors will help to ensure that refusals are correct in law.
<P>
The system must not be operated solely or mainly in certain parts of the world.
<P>
The amount of any bond should be related directly to the sponsor's ability to pay.
<P>
A legally-binding commitment or undertaking to pay, rather than the deposit of money, would be more equitable.
<P>
The Bill does not make the government's intentions clear and the immigration rules which will explain it have not been published.
<P>
Similarly, the Bill will give the Secretary of State power to make bonds mandatory in certain circumstances, to be specified in rules. The intention of such rules needs to be clarified.
<P>
The Explanatory Notes to the Bill focus on visitors but the Bill referes to people `applying for entry clearance' or `given leave for a limited period'. If it is intended only to apply the bonds to visitors, the Bill should say so.
<P>
If people are granted the leave for which they apply, any bond given on entry which might have been forfeit should be refunded. This should definitely be done if the person applies for, and is granted asylum.
<P>
The pilot project for bonds should take place in more than one British post, so that its use can be properly monitored.
<P>
The bond proposal must be considered in conjunction with the restored right of appeal for family visitors (clause 41). If an appeal must be paid for, it must be ensured that the cost is not received twice. Entry clearance fees are intended to cover the whole cost of the entry clearance operation, which includes preparatory work for appeals. If there is a fee for an appeal, the entry clearance fees should be lowered.
<H4><center>Clause 9 and 10: Passenger information</center></H4>
<P>
These clauses, amongst other things, empower immigration officers to require the owners or agents of ships and aircraft to provide information on the ship or craft and its passengers. The explanatory notes state that it is a power that will `normally' be used in relation to arrivals at ports where there is no permanent immigration presence, but does not rule out selective use at major ports against specific carriers. If this is the intention, the Bill should make it plain. We are concerned that this power may come to be used particularly against the operators of cheap charter flights departing from non-visa countries, but whose nationals have been subjected to higher levels of scrutiny and refusals under current procedures. Frequent use of such powers, and an increase in administrative costs for agents and carriers, can be expect to drive many low-cost agents out of the charter flight activities from such countries.
<H4><center>Clause 15 and Part IX: Reporting suspicious marriages</center></H4>
<P>
The Bill proposes a number of changes to the law governing the conduct of civil marriages, some of which are not directly related to immigration control. It is extraordinary that such significant alterations are proposed to an institution so fundamental to civil society as the ceremony of marriage in a Bill concerned with immigration.
<P>
It is objectionable that marriage registrars should have to serve as immigration police. No safeguards are proposed as to what should constitute grounds for suspicion. Ungoverned suspicions will tend to amount to no more than stereotyping, that is, to prejudice.
<P>
Registrars will be required to judge whether a marriage is entered into for the purpose of avoiding provisions of immigration law. Some of these are notoriously difficult for a non-specialist to determine.
<P>
The test also involves assessing the purpose for which a person seeks to marry. The iniquities of the discredited `primary purpose' test, abolished by this government soon after taking office, are thereby set to re-emerge in a new guise.
<P>
Checks are proposed only against marriages involving EEA nationals. It is not clear whether any intended guidance issued to registrars will include the UK as an EEA state for these purposes. If not, this measure is likely to amount to unlawful discrimination contrary to the European Treaties.
<P>
The Bill also intends an extension of the power to refuse to conduct a marriage on the ground of lack of satisfaction that the parties are free to marry. While there is to be a right of appeal against such a decision, a decision not to allow a marriage to go ahead may amount to a breach of Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the right to marry and found a family).
<P>
This provision will introduce an onus on a couple to prove their eligibility to marry. In the UK no comprehensive scheme for registering civil status exists. If different standards are applied for evidence of marital status to persons of different nationality, this is likely to amount to discrimination contrary to the Race Relations Act.
<H4><center>Clauses 16 and 17: extending the offence of deception</center></H4>
<P>
These clauses create a new immigration offence, of seeking or obtaining `the avoidance, postponement or revocation of enforcement action' by `means which include deception by him'. They also extend the crime of making a false statement to an immigration officer.
<P>
The Home Office Explanatory Notes state that clause 16 is intended for use against asylum-seekers whose claims are unfounded and who seek to string them out by making further unfounded claims or applications to the courts. But it is phrased much more widely than this and, if it is retained, its scope should be narrowed to reflect the government's intention.
<P>
In any event, the act of fleeing persecution will usually involve deception, in the form of entry without documents, misrepresentation, or the use of fraudulent documents. It appears that the Bill intends that nearly all failed asylum seekers should be liable for prosecution. this is unfair and unworkable.
<P>
The complicated possibilities this section suggests makes the availability and funding for provision of good legal advice and representation even more vital.
<H4><center>PART VI: SUPPORT FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS, CLAUSES 73-103</center></H4>
<P>
The provisions bar large groups of people subject to immigration control from access to benefits for children, disability benefits, priority housing and safety net community care provision. It is not only asylum seekers who are affected. Those excluded, and with no alternative support arrangements, include people with indefinite leave to remain. They may have nowhere else to go. They may have families. They may be disabled.
<P>
The provisions discriminate against families and the disabled. They offend the right to respect for privacy and family life by institutionalising social exclusion.
<P>
The resource implications of complex immigration and destitution tests are likely to outweigh the estimated savings in benefits and community care provision.
<P>
Disability and child benefits should be removed from the barred list.
<P>
Exceptions to safety net benefits, housing and community care restrictions should include those who suffer a critical change of circumstances beyond their control.
<P>
People with indefinite leave to remain (permanent residence) should not be excluded from provisions to help the destitute and the disabled.
<H4><center>PART III: BAIL; PART VII: POWER TO ARREST AND SEARCH; AND PART VIII: DETENTION</center></H4>
<P>
Widened detention powers, with insufficient checks, will impact on wider groups of people in the ethnic minorities, including many who will prove to have no immigration status problem. This trend will be aggravated by new and expanded immigration offences, equated with serious arrestable offences, with further powers of arrest, entry, search and use of force.
<P>
The limited bail provisions proposed are an inadequate safeguard against arbitrary detention. Bail hearings in prisons, possibly by video link, will seriously compromise the appearance of independent judicial process and fair and effective proceedings. There remains no presumption in support of liberty, no time limit on administrative detention is proposed, access to independent judicial scrutiny throughout detention is not guaranteed, and access to legal representation will remain inadequate without legal aid.
<P>
Lengthy administrative detention of people who have not been charged with any offence, with few checks, will continue to violate human rights, including those relating to arbitrary detention, due legal process and family life.
<P>
No exceptions are included for young people, women, torture victims or others who should not be in detention.
<P>
The scheme of regulation as proposed is imbalanced in favour of new offences, greater powers of custody officers, and approximation to prison regime, without acknowledging the rights and vulnerabilities of uncharged detainees.
<H4><center>JCWI Briefing on the Immigration and Asylum Bill</center></H4>
<H4><center>1 INTRODUCTION</center></H4>
<P>
JCWI considers that the immigration control measures which are intended to come into effect in the Immigration and Asylum Bill (the Bill) currently before Parliament will mark a significant erosion of the rights of the vast majority of people who have legitimate expectations of benefiting from opportunities within the new global markets in jobs and services; of rights available under the provisions of international refugee and human rights law; and generally being able to participate in the forms of international culture and exchanges which are today expanding rapidly. The Government had opportunity to address these and other issues in its legislative programme but in our view has utterly failed to do so. Instead of considering proposals for modern immigration policies for the modern world, we find in the Bill the structure of the 1971 Immigration Act (IA 1971) left essentially intact, but with a string of diverse proposals intended to `tighten up procedures' and `close loop-holes'.
<P>
Our specific criticisms of the bill are set out as follows:
<P>
Pre-entry and on-entry control issues;
<P>
Removal of existing rights and the increase of insecurity for immigrants and refugees;
<P>
Increased powers of the immigration authorities;
<P>
Detention and bail issues.
<H4><center>2 PRE-ENTRY AND ON-ENTRY CONTROL ISSUES</center></H4>
<P>
In our view the bill proposes measures which confirm trends towards the concentration of immigration controls against designated nationalities overseas, at the visa sections of British High Commissions and Embassies. We are opposed to any further development in this direction. The compulsory visa country list, with its heavy bias against African and Asian countries, already propels the balance of the immigration control system in the direction of institutional racism, with African and South Asian nationalities being disproportionately effected by the full rigour of its procedures. Further, the established principle that the full cost of pre-entry control measures should be met from visa fees has meant that these self-same African and Asian nationals are obliged to pay a disproportionate cost of control measures which are designed to impede their movement across frontiers.
<H4><center>3 REMOVAL OF EXISTING RIGHTS AND THE INCREASE OF INSECURITY</center></H4>
<P>
A great deal of the proposals of the bill, if carried into legislation, will have the effect of removing existing rights from immigrants and of increasing the insecurity of a large number of people. The provisions we particularly want to refer to under this heading are, Clause 6 proposals for the removal of certain persons from the UK; Clause 13 dealing with employers' liability; Clause 15 (and Part IX) duty to report suspicious marriages; Clauses 16-17 offences; and Clauses 55-58, the `one-stop' appeal procedure.
<H4><center>Clauses 1-3: Visas and conditions of entry</center></H4>
<P>
These clauses propose making entry clearance officers (ECOs) responsible not only for issuing visas which will allow people to embark on their journeys to the UK, but also for fixing conditions of entry. This shift checks carried out by immigration officers at UK ports of entry, and whose operational costs are currently met from general taxation, to ECOs based abroad, and carries the danger of a further increase in already prohibitively high visa fees. We are concerned that increased use of controls overseas will translate into additional ECO postings, differential administrative delays as queues build up in certain posts in order that others may be facilitated, and higher costs for visa applicants. In our view, what has been presented as a sensible rationalisation of current procedures, would only be acceptable if the Government gave a firm guarantee that the increase in pre-entry control procedures that are likely to result from these measures will not translate into an even higher level of fees.
<P>
We are also concerned that the means by which leave to enter will in future be granted or deemed are not yet indicated. There are many potential pitfalls if these new arrangements are not carefully planned. How will it be possible to tell in future what the conditions of a person's entry are? When will visit leave expire, for instance? Six months after entry of clearance, or six months from the date of landing? When would a person become an overstayer? How would entitlement to services be gauged?
<H4><center>Clause 3: Fees</center></H4>
<P>
It is objectionable that applicants should be expected to pay fees calculated at rates to cover the full cost of processing applications, when the administration at the Immigration and Nationality Directorate is so deeply inefficient. The worse the system becomes, the more&#151;on such a basis of calculation&#151;applicants would be required to pay.
<H4><center>Option</center></H4>
<H4><center>Amendment:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 3 insert new sub-clause (3)&#151;`The regulations may prescribe different rates of fee for different classes of application, provided that all such rates shall be commensurate with the reasonable expectations of applicants.'
<H4><center>Clause 6: removal of certain persons unlawfully in the UK</center></H4>
<P>
This needs to be read with Schedule 12 paragraph 30(2). Together, the effect of these provisions is to amend the structure of the immigration control system in a significant way. Until now a fundamental distinction has been drawn between those who have obtained lawful leave to enter and those who, requiring it, have never done so, either by evading the control or because the leave they obtain is treated as vitiated by deception. The latter are liable to be deported, and are made subject to a procedure, with appeal rights and safeguards, by which the Secretary of State may sign an order for deportation, under cover of which the person may be removed from the UK, and barred from re-entry until the order is revoked, which will not normally be within three years. Those without leave, by contrast, are liable merely to summary removal without any right of appeal, on the basis that they have no lawful standing within the UK under the immigration laws.
<P>
Amendments introduced under the former government severely restricted the right of appeal of deportees, in provisions criticized in the strongest terms by members of the current government, then in opposition.
<P>
These new provisions will equate the majority of deportees with persons liable to summary removal as illegal entrants. No distinction will any longer be drawn between those who have held lawful status, but are in breach of one or more of their conditions of entry or stay, and those who have never been other than unlawfully present.
<P>
In the years since the passing of the 1971 Act the courts have, in response to particular initiatives by the Home Office, extended the definition of illegal entry well beyond what was envisaged in 1971, to include deception, advertent or otherwise, and whether committed by the person concerned or by a third party. Even the matter of whether the deception is material to the grant of leave has become somewhat flexible, allowing much discretion to immigration officers.
<P>
The new provision will affect any person in breach of conditions. This can include, for instance: a bona fide student working in circumstances where, had he or she known they need to obtain it (many do not), permission to work would have been granted; an applicant who submits their papers to the Home Office in time, only to have them returned for some small detail of the documentation to be clarified; an applicant who posts their application by normal post a few days before expiry, only to have the letter delayed in delivery; a wife whose documents have been passed to her in-laws, or a student whose application goes through his or her college, or a person who passes papers to legal representatives for attention, only to have them inadvertently submitted late by that other person. They will also affect dependants of such persons, so that even young children born in the UK will be liable to summary removal, if they are not British citizens. In none of these cases should the applicant be penalized so harshly, by a total lack of any appeal right. They are not illegal entrants, and their otherwise blameless behaviour should not attract such draconian consequences.
<P>
The Secretary of State would still, presumably, be expected to consider the individual's circumstances, but with no opportunity to establish what factors had been taken into account, and no judicial oversight of decisions, there would be no restraints, and no mechanism for ensuring compliance either with domestic law or with other obligations. It would end the prospect of an appeal in cases where there may be strong compassionate reasons to allow a person to remain.
<P>
It will not be possible by these means to ensure justice, nor to avoid strong grievances being held. This move would engender tension and mistrust within established communities, and would lead to breaches of human rights obligations. The inevitable result would be an increase in applications for judicial review, and increases in ill-founded claims to asylum and (perhaps more well founded) claims under clause 47 (actions contrary to the Human Rights Act). This is not a recipe for consistent decision-making, nor for quicker or fairer procedures.
<P>
It is not at all clear that there is any significant mischief which needs to be dealt with by way of this amendment that will not be dealt with under other provisions (the power of curtailment, one-stop appeals and so on). There are a very small number of `repeat appeals' of deportees who have already had a variation appeal, but they are very few (456 in the last full year), and all would disappear as a result of these other provisions.
<P>
It has been suggested that removal is a less severe penalty than deportation, since in the latter there is a bar on return until the order is revoked, while in the former there is no formal bar. This is disingenuous. The immediate effect on the individual, and his or her family and private life, is identical, and if a person who has been removed seeks entry there is no real prospect of convincing an immigration officer to grant leave once the fact of removal is known. Indeed, the prospect of detention and removal at once rather than after notice and appeal rights, of a person who may otherwise have a settled life, or commitments in the UK will exacerbate tensions.
<P>
Decisions on removal are made by immigration officers, while the powers of deportation must be exercised by the Secretary of State. Unless and until the immigration service is made subject to effective oversight, an independent complaints procedure, and the effects of the Race Relations Act (see comments on Part VII of the Bill, below), these changes will further institutionalize the most divisive features of the current immigration control system.
<P>
The whole provision is so counter-productive that the principal Option must be to propose:
<H4><center>Amendment:</center></H4>
<P>
delete clause 6, and Schedule 12 paragraph 30(2); re-number all subsequent clauses and paragraphs consequently.
<P>
The Bill proposes that there shall be exemptions from these arrangements, `in such other circumstances as may be prescribed' (clause 6(4)), but no indication has been given by the government of what these might be. It is essential, if this proposal is to be adequately debated, that the government makes clear its intentions, and the Committee needs to require that the Minister at the least makes clear undertakings, or produces draft instruments to explain the intention. The same consideration applies to sub-clause (6), by which `any requirements' may be applied, in accordance with (so far unseen) rules.
<P>
If it is the intention of government that this provision should not apply in certain cases (the guidance notes make no mention of rules under clause 6(4) confining its effect) then the clause should be amended to make the intention clear.
<H4><center>Clauses 7 and 8: Financial bonds</center></H4>
<P>
These clauses provide a mechanism for the Secretary of State to require security to be given in respect of people applying for entry clearance and applying for leave to remain in the UK, such security to be forfeit if the person does not leave the UK.
<P>
Many people living in the UK desperately want to be able to provide some security to show their integrity and support their relatives' visit applications. This could help to dispel people's feeling that their integrity is in question, rather than that an official abroad is not satisfied about their visitor's intentions. But there are serious drawbacks to this proposal and it should be considered very carefully and amended, before any pilot project takes place. If the drawbacks outweigh any benefits it provides, it should not be implemented but further training and support to entry clearance officers to help them make correct and unbiased decisions should be given. It is to be hoped that the reintroduction of appeal rights for refused visitors will help to ensure that refusals are correct in law.
<P>
The system must not be operated in certain parts of the world only, or mainly. According to the 1997 Countrol of immigration statistics, 23 per cent of refusals of visas for temporary purposes took place in the countries of the Indian subcontinent, whereas the number of applications there was 14 per cent of the total. Thus there is the potential for this to be used in a discriminatory way, mainly against people from particular areas. ILPA welcomes the Home Secretary's announcement of 24 February that the Immigration Service is to become subject to the Race Relations Act, but hopes the Committee will receive assurances from the Minister, and draft immigration rules about how and where any power to take bonds will be used.
<P>
The amount of any bond. ILPA was concerned to hear that the Minister had suggested an amount of &#163;5,000-&#163;10,000. This is an unrealistic and unfair amount for people on even an average salary to raise, let alone those below. If instead a bond were to be related directly to the sponsor's ability to pay, for example 10 per cent or 5 per cent of the income shown for supporting the potential visitor, this would be much fairer between applicants.
<P>
If the money had to be paid up front in the UK, it will mainly affect the less wealthy. It could lead to the growth of unofficial moneylenders and loan sharks, exploiting people unable to offer the security needed for a reputable bank loan and charging extortionate interest rates for these loans. It would also mean either sponsors making these financial arrangements in advance of a visa application being made abroad, or the case being referred from the British post abroad to the Home Office to seek a bond. Either of these would mean further delays in dealing with applications, a serious matter when the reason for the visit is urgent, such as a funeral. A legally-binding commitment or undertaking to pay, rather than the deposit of money, would again be a more equitable system.
<P>
If the money were to be requested overseas, it would probably most often come from the sponsor in the UK, and have to be sent overseas. This could lead to another layer of exploitation by agents abroad, who could claim that they needed this money before making an application; if this were false, the money might then be requested again by the entry clearance staff. It could lead to another opportunity for corruption, when touts and agents know that money may be required and some applicants will not know to whom they have paid it. It is even more difficult to check whether this is happening overseas than in the UK, or for family members here to know what has happened.
<P>
These questions arise only because the Bill does not make the government's intentions clear and the immigration rules which will explain it have not been published, even in draft, with the Bill. ILPA finds this very disappointing, emphasised by the Home Secretary's admission on 22 February that `I cannot promise that drafts of all the regulations will be made available at this relatively early stage in the process'. His refusal to do so means that it is impossible to debate many parts of the Bill in any sensible way, as the detail of what is intended cannot be known.
<P>
The Explanatory Notes to the Bill, and the debate about bonds outside, focus on visitors. But this is not what the Bill says, it refers to people `applying for entry clearance' or `given leave for a limited period'. Thus the proposal could also apply to students, to working holidaymakers, to those needing medical treatment. If so, money could be deposited with the Secretary of State for substantial periods, and accrue significant interest. Whose would this be? If it is intended only to apply the bonds to visitors, the Bill should say so.
<P>
The Bill (para 7(3)) states that the bond is in order to secure that the person leaves the UK at the end of a period of limited leave given. Will the Minister confirm that this refers to the duration of the leave stamped on the passport (or given in any other way as provided by clause 1 or 2), rather than any shorter period which a person may have stated when applying for entry clearance? In the past, people who have stated they intend to stay for less than six months but whose plans change so they stay for longer than initially stated, but still leave within the six months period they were given, have been penalised.
<P>
If people are granted the leave for which they apply, under clause 8, any bond given on their initial entry which might have been forfeit should be refunded. This should definitely be done if the person applies for, and is granted asylum, or is granted exceptional leave on asylm grounds, or is granted further limited leave but goes before that time finishes.
<P>
The pilot project for bonds should take place in more than one British post, so that its use can be monitored. If a post in India is chosen, so should a post in Pakistan, and also in an area with fewer perceived problems.
<P>
The bond proposal must be considered in conjunction with the restored right of appeal for family visitors (clause 41(3) to (5)) and with the entry clearance monitor (clause 14). Appeals will cost; but it must be ensured that the cost is not received twice. Entry clearance fees are intended to cover the whole cost of the entry clearance operation, which includes preparatory work for appeals. If there is a fee for an appeal, the entry clearance fees should be lowered.
<P>
Clause 14 provides for the continuation of the monitor of refusals without right of appeal. It is not clear which appeals the monitor will consider, on the face of the Bill, it is family appeals where the appeal fee has not been paid, but this is bizarre. The Minster should give an assurance of what he means by this. It should include all entry clearance refusals where there is no right of appeal, and the monitor should have enhanced powers to call for papers on cases she or he selects and to make unannounced visits to British posts.
<H4><center>Options</center></H4>
<H4><center>Amendment 1:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 7(1), line 13: insert after `entry clearance' `as a visitor'
<H4><center>Amendment 2:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 7(2)(b) add at end, line 19: but if it is not taken into account, the Secretary of State must give reasons for declining to do so.
<H4><center>Amendment 3:</center></H4>
<P>
After sub-clause 7(4), line 32, add new subclause: (5) The Secretary of State will not realise the security, and will repay any security deposited, if the applicant is recognised as a refugee or is granted exceptional leave or leave to remain under the immigration rules.
<H4><center>Amendment 4:</center></H4>
<P>
Clause 7(6), line 45 add at end: Provided that such security may not be more than 10 per cent. of the income declared by the sponsor in supporting a visit if required from the sponsor, or of the visitor's income as declared to the British post, if required from the visitor.
<H4><center>Amendment 5:</center></H4>
<P>
Clause 8(2), line 13, add at end as 7(6).
<H4><center>Amendment 6:</center></H4>
<P>
Clause 8(3), line 18, add as in 7(4) above.
<H4><center>Clauses 9-12: Passenger information</center></H4>
<P>
These clauses empower immigration officers to require the owners or agents of ships and aircraft to provide information on the ship or craft and its passengers. The explanatory notes suggest this power will `normally' be used for arrivals at ports where there is no permanent immigration presence, but do not rule out selective use elsewhere. We are concerned that the power may come to be used against the operators of cheap charter flights from non-visa countries, but whose nationals have been subjected to higher levels of scrutiny and refusals under current procedures. We have seen in the past how a charter flight from Jamaica, by reason of its relative cheapness, can be seen by immigration officers as particularly likely to be carrying passengers who should not be admitted. Frequent use of such powers, and an increase in administrative costs for agents and carriers, may drive low-cost agents out of charter flight activities from such countries. We believe that if these provisions were operated in this way they would be damaging to British interests, and discriminatory.
<H4><center>Clause 13: Employment: code of practice</center></H4>
<P>
The proposal for a code of practice will not significantly improve the situation for minority ethnic workers who experience discrimination as a result of Article 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1996. The Home Office's current `Guide for Employers' on Article 8 already sets out the fact that staff recruitment and appointment breaches should not breach the RRA 1976 and that complaints against discriminatory practices might be made to the employment tribunal. A code of practice prepared by the Secretary of State and approved by Parliament may add a little to the authority of the existing guidance, but we are generally pessimistic as to whether employers&#151;or at least a significant proportion&#151;pay heed to such codes.
<H4><center>Clause 15 and Part IX: Registrars of marriage</center></H4>
<P>
The Bill proposes a number of changes to the law governing the conduct of civil marriages, some of which are directly related to questions of immigration control while others are not. It is extraordinary that such significant alterations are proposed to an institution so fundamental to civil society as the ceremony of marriage in a Bill concerned with immigration.
<P>
There are a number of concerns arising from these changes, most relating to clause 15, which seeks to introduce a duty for registrars to report to the Secretary of State on `suspicious' marriages, that is those which they suspect of being `sham'.
<P>
It is objectionable that officials whose role and function is to assist in the celebration of the union of couples in marriage should simultaneously have to serve as immigration police (see Amendments 4 and 6 below). Regulations are proposed (clause 15(3)) to stipulate the manner of reporting (although these are not to be subject to any parliamentary scrutiny&#151;see clause 134(4)(b)&#151;see Amendment 10 below), but the matter of what should constitute grounds for suspicion is left entirely to the discretion of the registrar. Ungoverned suspicions will tend to amount to no more than stereotyping, that is, to prejudice (see Amendments 1 and 2 below).
<P>
In an initiative unconnected with this Bill, the government has announced its intention to extend the scope of the Race Relations Act 1976 to cover public services. Giving registrars duties dependent on suspicions concerning immigration intentions puts them in a position where they will be open to claims of discrimination, whether or not well-founded. This is invidious, and will be unwelcome to many conscientious officers (see Amendments 4 and 7 below).
<P>
Registrars will be required to judge whether a marriage is `entered into by A for the purpose of avoiding the effect of one or more provisions of immigration law'. Some provisions of immigration law are notoriously difficult for a non-specialist to determine. What level of training will registrars receive? How, if they are not regularly called upon to make assessments, will this knowledge be reinforced and updated? (see Amendment 5 below).
<P>
The test also involves assessing the purpose for which a person seeks to marry. All the iniquities of the discredited `primary purpose' test, abolished by this government soon after taking office, are thereby set to re-emerge in a new guise (see Amendment 3 below).
<P>
Checks are proposed only against marriages involving EEA nationals. Presumably it is thought that these provide a more ready means to evade immigration controls for those who wish to do so. It is not clear whether any intended guidance issued to registrars will include the UK as an EEA state for these purposes. If the UK is not included, this measure is highly likely to amount to unlawful discrimination contrary to the European Treaties. If the UK is included, however, what justification is there then for leaving out of account those marriages where neither party is British nor a national of an EEA state? (see Amendment 5 below)
<P>
The Bill also appears to intend an extension of the power to refuse to conduct a marriage on the ground of lack of satisfaction that the parties are free to marry. Clause 133 will insert a new s. 31A in the Marriage Act 1949, envisaging refusal on the basis of any `representation' received, and although there is a right of appeal against such a decision, the damage will in many cases already be done, and a right of restitution against a person making a `frivolous' representation is unlikely to be an effective remedy (see Amendment 9 below).
<P>
A decision not to allow a marriage to go ahead is potentially very significant: its importance is underlined by the fact that a wrong decision would be likely to amount to a breach of Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the right to marry and found a family), and so may the registrar open to action under the Human Rights Act (see Amendments 8 and 9 below).
<P>
This provision will introduce an onus on a couple to prove their eligibility to marry. How is this to be done? Although such a provision already exists in some countries, in the UK no comprehensive scheme for registering civil status exists. If the guidance to be issued by the Registrar General (see cl. 132(3)) applies different standards for evidence of marital status to persons of different nationality, this is likely to amount to discrimination contrary to the Race Relations Act (and probably the equivalent Northern Ireland provisions) (see Amendments 8 and 9 below).
<H4><center>Options</center></H4>
<H4><center>Amendment 1.</center></H4>
<P>
Delete clause 15, and Part IX, and in clause 134(4)(b) delete `15(3) or'. Re-number clauses 16 to 129, and 134 to 138 consequently.

<P>
[*this option is proposed as a second alternative to amendment 2 above]
<P>
In clause 15 insert new sub-clause (7)&#151;`Persons carrying out duties under subsections (1) and (3) above shall have regard to section 16, and the code issued in accordance with that section shall apply to all such decisions and actions as are authorised by those subsections.'
<P>
and insert new clause 16, as follows, re-number all subsequent clauses consequently:
<H4><center>``Code of practice.</center></H4>
<P>
16.&#151;(1) The Secretary of State must issue a code of practice as to the measures which a registrar carrying out functions within section 15 of this Act is to be expected to take, or not to take, with a view to securing that, while fulfilling the duties imposed upon him by that section, he also avoids unlawful discrimination.
<P>
(2) ``Unlawful discrimination'' means&#151;
<P>
(a) discrimination in contravention of section 4(1) of the Race Relations Act 1976 (``the 1976 Act'') 1976 c. 74 or
<P>
(b) in relation to Northern Ireland, discrimination in contravention of Article 6(1) of the Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 (``the 1997 Order'') S.I. 1997/869 (N.I. 6).
<P>
(3) Before issuing the code, the Secretary of State must&#151;
<P>
(a) prepare and publish a draft of the proposed code; and
<P>
(b) consider any representations about it which are made to him.
<P>
(4) In preparing the draft, the Secretary of State must consult&#151;
<P>
(a) the Commission for Racial Equality;
<P>
(b) the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland;
<P>
(c) the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in England;
<P>
(d) the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages for Scotland;

<P>
(6) The draft code may contain modifications to the original proposals made in the light of representations to the Secretary of State.
<P>
(7) After laying the draft code before Parliament, the Secretary of State may bring the code into operation by an order made by statutory instrument.
<P>
(8) An order under subsection (7)&#151;
<P>
(a) shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament;
<P>
(b) may contain such transitional provisions or savings as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient in connection with the code.

<H4><center>Amendment 8:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 132 insert new subclause (4)&#151;`In preparing the guidance the Registrar General must consult&#151;
<P>
(a) the Commission for Racial Equality;
<P>
(b) the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland.'
<H4><center>Amendment 9:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 133(3)(a), for `representation made to him, and' insert `representation made to him (provided that he shall not take account of any representation where the person making it does not sufficiently identify himself), and';
<P>
and in clause 133(4), for `the declaration of the Registrar General purporting to be sealed' insert `the declaration of Registrar General containing details of the representation made to the superintendent registrar and purporting to be sealed';
<P>
and insert new subclause (5)&#151;`For the purposes of subsection (3) a person sufficiently identifies himself if he provides a name and address which the superintendent registrar has reasonable grounds for believing to be genuine.'
<H4><center>Amendment 10:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 134(3) insert `(b) section 15(3)', and renumber sub-subclauses (b) to (d) consequently. In clause 134(4)(b) delete `15(3) or'.
<H4><center> Clauses 16 and 17: extending the offence of deception</center></H4>
<P>
These clauses create a new immigration offence, of a person seeking or obtaining `the avoidance, postponement or revocation of enforcement action against him' by `means which include deception by him.' The penalty, on summary conviction, could be six months imprisonment and/or a fine up to the statutory maximum or on indictment, two years and/or an unlimited fine. They also extend the crime of making a false statement to an immigration officer to cover anything said to an officer acting under any of the five major Immigration Acts.
<P>
The Home Office Explanatory Notes state that clause 16 is intended for use against asylum-seekers whose claims are unfounded and who seek to string them out by making further unfounded claims or applications to the courts. But it is phrased much more widely than this and, if it is retained, its scope should be narrowed to reflect the government's intention.
<P>
In any event we are concerned that, owing to the strenuous ways in which the UK authorities seek to deter asylum seekers from arriving in the country, the act of fleeing persecution will usually involve deception, in the form of deceit, misrepresentation, and the use of fraudulent documents. It appears that the Bill intends that nearly all failed asylum seekers should be liable for prosecution. This is unfair and unworkable.
<P>
The definition of `deception' has been drawn very broadly in court cases, and can include failure to give information which was not known to the applicant. Cases have also hinged on the `credibility' of the person, always difficult to judge, particularly when there is no supporting evidence.
<P>
The concept of stopping people from leaving the country, when their immigration application has been refused and removal arrangements are in process, in order to arrest, prosecute, detain and sentence them, and then after all that make them leave, seems bizarre. This proposal, if implemented, will clog up police time, the courts and the prisons with people who will not be allowed to remain here and who will suffer particularly while in prison due to the unfamiliarity of their surroundings, language, culture, religion etc.
<P>
At present, conviction and sentence happens most frequently for people who have sought to enter the UK, or sought travel in transit here, and are then found to be travelling on false documents. They are frequently prosecuted under the Fraud Act rather than the 1996 Asylum and Immigration Act, and are usually sentenced to some months imprisonment. This is not a sensible use of resources; if people need to flee they can rarely obtain genuine documents, if their applications have been refused, they should be returned as quickly as possible.
<P>
These clauses should be read in conjunction with clause 117, which allows immigration officers to `use reasonable force' in exercising any of their powers under the 1971 and 1999 Acts. If a person resists an officer, whether knowing that he is an immigration officer or not, and thus secures a delay in removal arrangements, is that an extra crime?
<P>
In conjunction with clause 59 on `appeals without merit'; if the Tribunal makes such a decision, and also suggests, or makes a finding, that deception was used, would that make a person liable to prosecution under s. 16?
<P>
The complicated possibilities this section suggests makes the availability and funding for provision of good legal advice and representation even more vital.
<H4><center>Options</center></H4>
<H4><center>Amendment 1:</center></H4>
<P>
Delete whole of clause 16, lines 15 to 42 (&#151;the preferred choice).
<H4><center>Amendment 2:</center></H4>
<P>
In 24A(1), line 16, insert after `citizen' `and who has applied for asylum in the UK'
<H4><center>Amendment 3:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 16(3), line 34, delete `to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or' and line 37, delete `to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or' and line 38, delete `or to both'.
<H4><center>PART III, clauses 29-36&#151;Bail</center></H4>
<P>
Part III provides for two automatic bail hearings for immigration detainees, one week and five weeks after detention. There will be two categories of detainees for bail purposes. Those with an appeal pending will have bail hearings before immigration adjudicators. Others will be heard by magistrates.
<H4><center>Options</center></H4>
<H4><center>Amendment 1:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 29(2), line 14: delete ``on bail''.
<P>
The intention is to give adjudicators/magistrates a wider review of the lawfulness and reasonableness of detention, rather than merely the opportunity to release on bail.
<H4><center>Amendment 2:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 29(5), line 27: delete ``second reference to the court is made'' and insert ``further references to the court are made''.
<H4><center>Amendment 3:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 29(5), line 33: after ``was detained'' add ``and at intervals of between twenty-eight and thirty-three days thereafter''.
<P>
There remains no right to automatic hearings at regular intervals. There is no time limit to immigration detention and the average duration is some months. Those held for long periods are most in need of independent judicial scrutiny.
<H4><center>Amendment 4:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 29(7): Consequential amendments from suggested amendments to clause 29(5).
<H4><center>Amendment 5:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 29(11)(c), clause 30 and clause 36: Delete ``Secretary of State'' and insert ``Lord Chancellor''.
<P>
It is inappropriate for the Secretary of State for the Home Department, who is responsible for the decision to detain and maintain detention, to have such control over venue and procedure rules in what is meant to be an independent judicial process.
<H4><center>Amendment 6:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 30, lines 30 and 31: Delete ``(c) detention centres; (d) prisons''.
<P>
Bail hearings at places of detention will seriously compromise the appearance of independent judicial process and prejudice the ability of the detainee adequately to present his or her application. It is moreover difficult to envisage proper public accessibility to such places. Prejudice will be aggravated by video links (section 35), severely limiting communication between legal representatives, interpreters, the court and the detainee.
<H4><center>Amendment 7:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 33(6) and (7): Delete subsection (6). And at line 9: delete ``If subsection (6) does not apply''.
<P>
Section 33 gives immigration officers wide powers of arrest, entry, search and use of force, where a person ``is breaking or is likely to break any condition'' of bail. Conditions commonly include weekly, or possibly twice-weekly, reporting to a specified police station. An occasion may be missed, for example because of sickness, or the police may omit to record the attendance. The latter is not uncommon. An amendment is needed to ensure independent judicial scrutiny of further detention.
<H4><center>Amendment 8:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 34(3) and (6), at line 42: ``On the first and second references''.
<P>
The possibility of two full bail hearings brings this into line with criminal bail provisions.
<P>
Section 34(6) extends rights of audience for those acting on behalf of the Secretary of State. Provision is needed for detainees' representatives who are not formally qualified to have rights of audience before magistrates.
<H4><center>Amendment 9:</center></H4>
<P>
Delete clause 35. Re-number subsequent clauses consequently.
<P>
Reducing the detainee's access to the court to a mere video link from the detention centre undermines the effectiveness of the bail hearing as a legal safeguard. Video links are associated with protecting vulnerable witnesses. In these circumstances they can only aggravate vulnerability. Immigration detainees are uniquely disadvantaged, ignorant of English language, law and procedure. Their chances of comprehending a routine bail referral, seven days after detention, from a room within the detention centre, possibly without legal advice, are limited. The scope for misunderstanding or mistrusting interpreters across a video link is large. Any representatives who are instructed will have difficulty taking confidential instructions in such circumstances.
<H4><center>Amendment 10:</center></H4>
<P>
In clause 36, at line 25: delete ``Secretary of State'' and insert ``Lord Chancellor''.
<P>
See above commentary on excessive power and conflict of interest of SSHD.
<H4><center>Additional comments</center></H4>
<P>
There remain no time limits for detention, unlike in other European countries. Most immigration detainees are asylum seekers. As the government is committed to processing asylum applications within six months, and other provisions in the bill are designed to meet this commitment, the failure to target a maximum detention period is unjustifiable.
<P>
The Home Office review of immigration detention (August 1998) suggested an average duration of 152 days in asylum cases, although Amnesty International research in 1996-97 suggested a higher average.
<P>
The lack of any time limit on duration of detention, coupled with the widened powers of administrative detention envisaged in section 116, call for improved legal safeguards&#151;including routine judicial scrutiny at regular intervals (rather than the two routine bail applications at one and five weeks in sections 29 to 36) and availability of legal aid in line with other proceedings involving deprivation of liberty.
<P>
A reason why existing bail provisions are ineffective is that there is no statutory presumption in favour of liberty, to be displaced only on specified grounds (as in cases before criminal courts under the Bail Act 1976). A statutory presumption would put the onus on the Immigration Service to provide substantial reasons for detention, referable to the individual.
<P>
Specified grounds should take account of the UNHCR guidance that there should be a presumption against detention; alternative monitoring mechanisms should be applied first; account should be taken of whether it is reasonable and proportional to the objectives to be achieved; if judged necessary it should only be imposed in a non discriminatory manner for a minimal period.
<P>
Any new bail procedure should be monitored; outcomes should be published.
<H4><center>PART VI: support for asylum seekers</center></H4>
<P>
This part has implications for others subject to immigration control, not just asylum seekers
<P>
The provisions seek comprehensively to exclude people subject to immigration control from access to benefits, social housing and safety net social services help. For some asylum seekers there are alternative support arrangements. But for other categories of persons subject to immigration control there is no provision. Some have indefinite leave to remain. They live here. Many will have paid tax and national insurance here. They may have nowhere else to go and no means of subsisting when they are too disabled to work. The barred benefits are not only means-tested benefits, but also benefits to help care for children (child benefit and family credit) and benefits to help with the expense of disability.
<P>
Widened categories are being excluded both from access to subsistence benefits and safety net social services provision, including some people with indefinite leave and people with disabilities. The limited asylum support scheme leaves many without means of subsistence; many of those who are eligible for support will be excluded when their asylum claim is determined but while they are still awaiting a final determination after due process. More people will be destitute.
<P>
Disability and child benefits should be removed from the barred list.
<P>
Exceptions to safety net benefits, housing and community care restrictions should include those who suffer a critical change of circumstances beyond their control.
<P>
People with indefinite leave to remain (permanent residence) should not be excluded from provisions to help the destitute and the disabled.
<P>
The provisions discriminate between children and they discriminate against the disabled.
<P>
They offend the right to respect for privacy and family life, by institutionalising social exclusion.
<P>
Disability benefits and community care help is part of govenment policy to keep people out of hospital. Hospitalisation is an expensive alternative.
<P>
The extra administrative costs of applying a complex immigration status test to disability benefits and child benefit, and an immigration status and destitution test to community care, including costs of internal review, appeal and judicial review, are likely to outweigh the estimated benefit savings.
<P>
Disability benefits and child benefit have a built-in six-month residence test. People who are only temporarily here cannot get them. Community care provisions already have strict eligibility criteria to ensure only those in extreme need get help.
<H4><center>Example:</center></H4>
<P>
A 70-year-old widow, or a disabled adult sister, comes here to join a relative who gave an undertaking to support her. Under current income support rules the undertaking bars benefit for five years, although it is not clear that new rules will retain existing ``Urgent Cases'' provisions which include this time limit. She is given indefinite leave to remain. The sponsoring relative is disabled in a road accident and cannot work. He has to claim benefits himself. Because of the undertaking, the sponsored person cannot get means-tested or disability benefits under section 95. She can get no local authority help under sections 96 to 98. Meanwhile her presence in the household penalises her relative whose housing benefit will be reduced and council tax increased because of the presence of a non-dependant adult.
<H4><center>Part VII: Power to arrest and search, Clause 116 (detention); Clauses 104-117</center></H4>
<P>
Widened detention powers, with insufficient checks, will impact on wider groups of people in the ethnic minorities, including many who will prove to have no immigration status problem. This trend will be aggravated by new and expanded immigration offences, equated with serious arrestable offences, with further powers of arrest, entry, search and use of force. At a time of widespread concern over institutionalised racism among police officers, this move will heighten anxieties over the immigration service.
<P>
The exercise of police powers is circumscribed by a number of measures designed to safeguard the interests of suspects, the general public, and, now, minority communities. The work of the immigration service inevitably focuses on minority communities, and has great potential for inflaming tensions and promoting misunderstanding. Additionally, some of the powers the service exercise impact more greatly on the liberty of the subject. The need for similar safeguards is evident.
<P>
The 1971 Immigration Act already gives wide powers of administrative detention while immigration officers are considering whether to give leave to enter or while there is a prospect of removal. The fact that people can be and are detained for years illustrates the width of existing powers. The detention estate is always full.
<P>
Clause 116 goes much further. It will affect people who are not subject to immigration control or who are permanently and lawfully resident. People could be detained, indefinitely and with few legal safeguards, on the off-chance that they might be immigration offenders. As immigration offences are generally victimless and regulatory, the basis of ``reasonable suspicion'' is not clear cut. ``Reasonable suspicion'' can arise if someone cannot readily produce certain documents. Members of ethnic communities may not be able to produce immigration status documents precisely because they are not subject to immigration control or are long-term residents who have not had to up-date documents for years. As a result of other provisions in the Bill involving fusion of entry clearance and leave to enter, people who are subject to immigration control may not have stamps in their passports specifying time limits and conditions.
<P>
Clause 116, extending detention powers, must be read in the light of other provisions in the Bill impacting on detention (see next section, below).
<H4><center>Options</center></H4>
<H4><center>Amendment 1:</center></H4>
<P>
Delete clause 116; re-number subsequent clauses consequently.
<H4><center>Amendment 2:</center></H4>
<P>
Insert new clause 118, re-number all subsequent clauses consequently:
<H4><center>``Immigration Service Complaints Authority</center></H4>
<P>
118(1) There shall be an independent complaints authority (the Authority) to oversee the work of the immigration service and to receive complaints from any person who wishes to make complaint of any action, conduct, or lack of action on the part of an immigration officer acting in the course of his employment as such.
<P>
(2) The terms of reference, powers and procedures of the Authority shall be such as are prescribed in an order made by the Lord Chancellor.
<P>
(3) An order under subsection (2) must be made by statutory instrument.
<P>
(4) The Lord Chancellor shall appoint such number of persons to serve as members of the authority as he considers fit.
<P>
(5) The existence of the Authority and the manner in which complaints may be brought shall be brought to the attention of all persons who may come into operational contact with officers of the immigration service, by notice prominently displayed at all such offices,and by written reference on all forms and notices designed for service upon persons required to submit to investigation or subject to action under this part of this Act.
<P>
(6) The Lord Chancellor may pay to the members of the Authority acting in that capacity such remuneration and allowances as he may determine.
<P>
(7) If a person ceases to be a member of the Authority and it appears to the Lord Chancellor that there are circumstances which make it right that he should receive compensation, the Lord Chancellor may pay him a sum of such amount as the Lord Chancellor may determine.
<P>
(8) The Authority shall have the power to make investigation into any allegation or complaint notified to it, and may compel the production of such evidence as it considers necessary to that end.
<P>
(9) In exercise of its power to investigate the Authority may oblige any member of the immigration service, any person making a complaint, or any other person whom it considers necessary to hear, to appear before it and to give evidence.
<P>
(10) Where the Authority finds, in accordance with its investigation of a complaint received, that an immigration officer has acted wrongfully or that the rights of a subject have otherwise been infringed by action taken or purportedly taken in pursuance of powers under this Act, it shall have the power to order restitution in such sum or in such manner as it shall deem appropriate.
<P>
(11) The Authority shall also have the power, in circumstances set out in subsection (8), to recommend disciplinary action to be taken against any immigration officer.''
<P>
and in clause 134(3)(c) delete `or'; insert new sub-clause `(d) section 118(2), or'; re-number sub-clause (d).
<H4><center>Amendment 3.</center></H4>
<P>
after clause 111 insert new clause 112, as follows, renumber all subsequent clauses consequently:
<H4><center>``Code of practice.</center></H4>
<P>
112.&#151;(1) The Secretary of State must issue a code of practice as to the measures which an immigration officer carrying out functions within this part of this Act is to be expected to take, or not to take, with a view to securing that, while fulfilling the duties imposed upon him by that section, he also avoids unlawful discrimination.
<P>
(2) ``Unlawful discrimination'' means&#151;
<P>
(a) discrimination in contravention of section 4(1) of the Race Relations Act 1976 (1976 c. 74) (``the 1976 Act''); or
<P>
(b) in relation to Northern Ireland, discrimination in contravention of Article 6(1) of the Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 (N.I. 6) (S.I. 1997/869) (``the 1997 Order'').
<P>
(3) Before issuing the code, the Secretary of State must&#151;
<P>
(a) prepare and publish a draft of the proposed code; and
<P>
(b) consider any representations about it which are made to him.
<P>
(4) In preparing the draft, the Secretary of State must consult&#151;
<P>
(a) the Commission for Racial Equality;
<P>
(b) the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland;
<P>
(c) such bodies (including organisations or associations representative of staff or employees) as he considers appropriate.
<P>
(5) If the Secretary of State decides to proceed with the code, he must lay a draft of the code before both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
(6) The draft code may contain modifications to the original proposals made in the light of representations to the Secretary of State.
<P>
(7) After laying the draft code before Parliament, the Secretary of State may bring the code into operation by an order made by statutory instrument.
<P>
(8) An order under subsection (7)&#151;
<P>
(a) shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament;
<P>
(b) may contain such transitional provisions or savings as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient in connection with the code.
<P>
(9) A failure on the part of any person to observe a provision of the code does not itself make him liable to any proceedings.
<P>
(10) But the code is admissible in evidence in any proceedings brought by a person claiming to have been affected by any decision, action or failure to act to which the provisions of the code apply.
<P>
(10) The Secretary of State may from time to time revise the whole or any part of the code and issue the code as revised.
<P>
(11) The provisions of this section also apply (with appropriate modifications) to any revision, or proposed revision, of the code.''
<H4><center>Amendment 4:</center></H4>
<P>
Codes of practice (as per s 60, Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984)&#151;(may either take a power, and issue the Codes separately, or annex the Codes to the Act as Schedules&#151;or alternatively simply adopt the PACE Codes wholesale for the use of the immigration service)
<H4><center>PART VIII, sections 118 to 129 (detention centres and detained persons; schedules 9 (detainee custody officers), 10 (discipline etc at detention centres) and 11 (escort arrangements)</center></H4>
<P>
The range of immigration offences is significantly extended. Immigration offences do not necessarily involve culpable behaviour. For example, if a person's in-time application form to the Home Office is returned with a query after expiry of leave, that person becomes an overstayer.
<P>
Regulatory offences are being upgraded to serious arrestable offences, with enlarged immigration officers' powers of arrest, entry, search and use of reasonable force.
<P>
In combination these provisions will do nothing to alleviate the grievance that members of ethnic communities are subject to disproportionate attention by the police.
<P>
It is not clear that the government has taken proper account not only of the social cost but also the financial cost. The detention estate (500 detention centre places and 500 prison places) is always full. It costs the Home Office &#163;22.3m per annum, not counting prison places&#151;which cost an average of &#163;500 per week (twice the cost of a bail hostel place). There is resistance from the Prison Service (and Her Majesty's Inspector of Prisons) to such profligate and inhumane use of prison places for uncharged detainees. The cost of a substantial expansion in the immigration detention estate is prohibitive. Inevitably there will be increased use of police cells, the most expensive detention facility averaging &#163;400 per day.
<P>
Clauses 123 and 124. There should be an independent and confidential complaints procedure, including an appeal right, details of which should be provided to all detainees.
<P>
Clause 124 requires the Secretary of State to make rules for the regulation and management of detention centres. These rules, which may include disciplinary rules, should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and approval. Clause 124(1) should be added to clause 134(3) (regulations and orders subject to positive resolution).
<P>
Rules should require that conditions of detention, including powers and duties of custody officers, be explained to each detainee in writing in a language which he or she understands.
<P>
Clause 125(2). Qualification and training standards of custody officers should be no less than those applicable to prison officers. Race awareness training should be a requirement.
<H4><center>Options:</center></H4>
<P>
Schedule 9&#151;detainee custody officers
<H4><center>Amendment 1:</center></H4>
<P>
Paragraph 2(2), line 29: delete ``headgear''.
<P>
The requirement to remove headgear for inspection could offend those whose headgear relates to beliefs or cultural norms.
<H4><center>Amendment 2:</center></H4>
<P>
Paragraph 2(4): the power to use reasonable force should be clarified.
<H4><center>Amendment 3:</center></H4>
<P>
Paragraph 6, line 25: delete ``or otherwise'' as too vague.
<H4><center>Options:</center></H4>
<P>
Schedule 10&#151;discipline, etc at detention centres
<P>
Paragraph 1(1) envisages detention centre rule (in accordance with section 124) but refers only to provision for detained persons to be measured and photographed. Any such rule affecting uncharged detainees should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and approval. The operation of rules, particularly disciplinary rules, should be monitored.
<P>
Paragraph 2 provides for drug or alcohol testing. Rules should provide that tests are subject to appeal and independent verification, as in prison procedures.
<P>
Paragraph 5(1), line 33: delete ``or to a detained person''. The Secretary of State has discretion to add different places to the Immigration (Places of Detention) Direction, for example hospitals. Alcohol is not an illegal substance. Small amounts may be present and imperceptible in a range of comestibles. Outside of detention centres there will be no penalty notice displayed to warn people, as required by paragraph 7 of schedule 10.
<H4><center>Amendment:</center></H4>
<P>
Paragraph 6(1), line 2: insert ``wilfully''.
<H4><center>Amendment:</center></H4>
<P>
Paragraph 6(1)(a), line 3: delete ``or''.
<H4><center>Amendment:</center></H4>
<P>
Paragraph 6(2)(a), line 8: delete ``any thing anywhere outside'' and insert ``any prohibited item in proximity to''.
<P>
A standard list of prohibited items should be published. Prohibition should be justified as relevant to escape or unlawful or injurious purposes only. There should be exemptions, such as materials relevant to religious or health needs, or legal proceedings. HM Inspector of Prisons 1995 report on Campsfield House lists prohibited items which include ``large quantities of dried fruit'' and ``cleaning materials''. Definition and justification is not clear. Sikhs wear miniature ornamental swords, which they may not realise qualify as prohibited items. Umbrellas and mirrors are also prohibited items. Any visitor entering a detention centre with an umbrella on a rainy day, or forgetting that a powder compact contains a small mirror, is committing an offence of strict liability, as drafted. Given the wide search powers under Schedule 9, this offence of strict liability cannot be justified.
<H4><center>Options:</center></H4>
<H4><center>Schedule 11&#151;escort arrangements</center></H4>
<P>
Paragraph 1(2) requires the appointed escort monitor to report to the Secretary of State on escort arrangements, including any allegation made against a detainee custody officer. Such reports should be published. Effective complaints procedures should be established and notified to all detainees.
<H4><center>Amendment:</center></H4>
<P>
Delete Paragraph 2(1)(b).
<P>
The Secretary of State can add different places to the Immigration (Places of Detention) Direction. For example, hospitals were included after it became necessary to hospitalise hunger strikers. This would give detainee custody officers a wide power to search anyone entering any such place, backed up by reasonable force under paragraph 2(5).
<H4><center>Amendment:</center></H4>
<P>
In paragraph 2(2), line 3: delete ``headgear''.
<P>
Paragraph 3(4) envisages ``punishment of a detained person under detention centre rules''. Such rules should be laid before Parliament to be approved by a resolution of both Houses.
<H4><center>Comment</center></H4>
<P>
The Bill provides no guarantees that immigration will not continue to be arbitrary, inadequate in legal safeguards, and an interference with privacy and family life.
<P>
Statutory regulation of detention centres is to be welcomed and has been given some encouragement by HM Inspector of Prisons Sir David Ramsbotham, although his proposals have not been fully met.
<P>
In his 1997 report on Campsfield House, he recommended a properly, and transparently regulated detention service with a clear, coherent set of rules which should include detainees' rights as well as responsibilities (10.12).
<P>
``The precise powers of contractors' staff in the use of force should be defined in statutory legislation'' (10.08).
<P>
The conduct of detention centre staff ``should be regulated by the professional codes applying to law enforcement officials'' (10.08 and 10.09).
<P>
The statutory scheme herein is imprecise, gives no guarantee of transparency and has little regard to the rights of uncharged detainees. It is imbalanced towards control and restriction and significantly approximates with prison regime.
<P>
Whereas HM Inspector of Prisons advised (1998 report on Haslar),
<P>
I do not believe that asylum seekers or immigration detainees should normally be held under Prison rules . . . They are not criminals, and this should be recognised in the new statutory rules for Immigration Detainees'',
<P>
new offences create ample scope for those not charged with any offence at the time of detention to become criminal offenders in the course of detention, for example by resisting a custody officer or failing to submit to a medical examination. The scope is large given that many detainees do not speak the language, do not understand why they are in custody when they are not aware of having committed any offence, and may have traumatic recollections of custody. Rules should provide for precise information about conditions of detention, powers and responsibilities of guards, rights of detainees and access to independent and confidential complaints procedure, to be provided to all detainees in writing in a language they understand.
<P>
Also lacking is acknowledgement of HM Inspector of Prison's recommendation (1998 Haslar report) that alternative arrangements be made as quickly as possible for children and those under the age of 21. Children, young people, women, torture victims, and other vulnerable groups, should not normally be detained.
<P>
Conditions and performance standards of private detention centres should be in the public domain to ensure proper accountability.
<P>
Emphasis on firm control in this Bill is possibly the government's reaction to an increasing control problem in detention centres. Whereas 84 security or control incidents were reported in 1991, 236 similar incidents were reported in 1996.
<P>
An alternative view, emphasised by Lord Woolf in his thorough report following prison riots (1990), is that violent disorder is a consequence of an abiding sense of grievance.
<H4><center>Memorandum from Amnesty International</center></H4>
<P>
Amnesty International's work on behalf of refugees focuses on the human rights violations on which it campaigns. It seeks to ensure that all those asylum-seekers who have genuinely fled persecution are identified and protected by being given asylum. The organisation monitors the policy and practice of the Government to ensure compliance with the relevant international standards.
<H4><center>OVERVIEW</center></H4>
<P>
Amnesty International's comments on the provisions contained in the Immigration and Asylum Bill focus solely on asylum matters and the human rights of refugees. The Bill puts into effect many of the proposals for reform of the immigration and asylum system as outlined in the Governments White Paper (CM 4018) Fairer, Faster and Firmer&#151;A Modern Approach to Immigration & Asylum.
<P>
Amnesty International has concerns that the very poor drafting of the Bill makes many of the provisions obscure. The Bill's provisions do not address the concerns that Amnesty International identified throughout the consultation process and in its response to the White Paper. The Bill in its current form does not deliver the promised holistic approach to the asylum determination process, nor does it make radical changes to the current asylum procedures which Amnesty International believes are inadequate to identify those in need of protection from persecution.
<P>
The initial determination procedure, on which the Bill is silent, is barely operational at the present time. The support arrangements as proposed in the Bill are dependent on speedy decisions but no attention has been paid to the importance of well informed decision-making at the initial stages.
<P>
Although the Home Secretary has declared that, in his view, the provisions of the Bill are compatible with rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), Amnesty International does not believe this to be the case.
<P>
While Amnesty International has concerns regarding many of the Bill's provisions, for the purposes of the special standing committee, our comments will concentrate on the pre-entry controls, the detention of asylum-seekers, and the support arrangements proposed for asylum-seekers with regard to early access to good quality legal advice.
<H4><center>PART II OF THE BILL: CARRIERS LIABILITY</center></H4>
<H4><center>Clauses 18-28 clandestine entrants</center></H4>
<P>
In our response to the White Paper, Amnesty International made clear its opposition to the proposed strengthening of the Immigration (Carriers Liability) Act 1987. Part II of the Bill repeals the 1987 Act and puts into effect tougher penalties for carriers bringing improperly documented passengers into the UK.
<P>
The UK has made it more difficult for refugees to access its asylum procedures through measures such as imposing visa requirements on nationals of refugee producing countries such as Bosnia-Hecegovina (1992) and Colombia (1997). Such measures, coupled with carriers' liability, have forced many asylum-seekers to rely on forged documents.
<P>
Those fleeing human rights violations often experience difficulty in obtaining a valid passport from their national authorities. A tougher approach by the Government to deter and prevent the arrival of those with invalid travel documents does not discriminate between people attempting to flee persecution and others. Indeed on giving evidence to the Home Affairs Committee on 12 May 1998, Mike O'Brien said, ``. . . some people who are refugees may find some difficulty in getting into the UK''.
<P>
The White Paper stated that one of the most effective preventative measures undertaken recently by the Immigration Service was the placement of five Airline Liaison Officers (ALOs) in Accra, Dhaka, Nairobi, Colombo and New Delhi, to help to combat document fraud. An additional 15 ALO's were announced and many of those have already been posted. In 1998, airlines operating from the five locations where ALOs were based refused carriage to 2,095 prospective passengers who were not adequately documented (Hansard 15 February 1999). Those fleeing human rights violations were likely to have been amongst their number.
<P>
The Bill outlines several measures which will make it more difficult for those fleeing persecution to claim asylum in the UK. These include extending carriers liability, the power to request carriers to give notification of non-EEA arrivals even before a vessel has departed, and expanding the offence of obtaining leave to enter or remain by deception Clauses 16 and 17. The latter is of particular concern. Since mid-1990s, an increasing number of refugees have received prison sentences of between three to six months for having arrived in the UK, in transit to the USA or Canada, with false documents. Such prosecutions are linked to the carriers' liability legislation and the imposition of visa requirements on refugee- producing countries.
<P>
The extension of pre-entry controls prevents people in need of protection from reaching the UK. Amnesty International believes that any restriction on entry which obstructs the flight to safety of individuals in need of international protection is incompatible with the provisions of Articles 31 and 33 of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.
<H4><center>PART III OF THE BILL: BAIL</center></H4>
<H4><center>Detention of asylum-seekers</center></H4>
<P>
Amnesty International believes that detention for those who have committed no criminal offence is an extreme sanction. Although the majority of asylum-seekers are granted temporary admission pending the outcome of their claim, currently more than 750 are detained at any one time at the discretion of an Immigration Officer, under the powers of the 1971 Immigration Act. There is no legal limit on the period of time an asylum-seeker may be detained.
<P>
According to Hansard 19 November 1998, at the end of October 1998, 756 ayslum-seekers were detained of whom 448 were awaiting an initial decision and 159 were awaiting the result of an appeal. Many of those awaiting an appeal may well have been detained since making the initial application for asylum. The Government has stated that detention of asylum-seekers would be concentrated at the end of the asylum determination process, when all appeals have been exhausted, prior to removal, but this is not the case.
<P>
Amnesty International's research on current detention policy and practice has shown that in many cases asylum-seekers have been detained since applying for asylum. Such detention is often prolonged, costly and ultimately futile, in that the detainee is often released from detention without his or her asylum claim having been fully resolved. Amongst the thousands of asylum-seekers detained in recent years there have been many individuals later recognised as refugees&#151;individuals who have suffered persecution in their countries of origin only to be detained, without due process, in the country in which they have sought protection. In 1997, 89 people who had been detained solely under Immigration Act powers went on to get refugee status and a further 132 were granted exceptional leave to remain.
<P>
In September 1998, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) visited the UK to investigate allegations that asylum-seekers were being held in prolonged administrative detention without the possibility of adminstrative or judicial remedy. Many of the concerns that Amnesty International has repeatedly raised with the Government regarding the UK's policy and practice of detaining asylum-seekers are shared by the WGAD and are detailed in the ``Matters of Concern'' outlined in their report dated 18 December 1998. Of particular importance is that the provision of a bail hearing will not be an effective substitute for an independent review whereby the reasons for a decision to detain may be challenged.
<H4><center>Clauses 29-37</center></H4>
<P>
There are currently no statutory criteria for the detention of asylum-seekers and the Bill does not set out the criteria under which an asylum-seeker may be detained. There need to be clear safeguards built into the system to ensure that asylum-seekers are detained only when absolutely essential and that full written reasons should be given in all decisions to detain.
<P>
Asylum-seekers should only be detained in exceptional circumstances in line with international standards. For example, if the detaining authorities can demonstrate that there is a real risk that they would otherwise abscond and that other measures short of detention such as reporting restrictions are not sufficient.
<P>
The power to detain should be limited to the standards set out in Conclusion 44 of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees which states that:
<P>
 . . . in view of the hardship which it involves, detention should normally be avoided. If necessary, detention should be resorted to only on grounds prescribed by law to verify identity; to determine the elements on which the claim to refugee status or asylum is based; to deal with cases where refugees or asylum-seekers have destroyed their travel documents in order to mislead the authorities of the State in which they intend to claim asylum; or to protect national security or public order''
<H4><center>Judicial Oversight and Bail</center></H4>
<P>
Amnesty International has repeatedly urged the Government to provide for judicial oversight of decisions to detain asylum-seekers, in line with international law. In his recommendations to the Home Secretary in April 1998, following his inspection of Campsfield House Detention Centre, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Sir David Ramsbotham stated that the deprivation of liberty of people seeking to enter the UK should be overseen by judicial process as defined in international human rights standards, such as Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and Article 5 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).
<P>
Asylum-seekers should have the right to challenge the lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty promptly, before a competent, independent and impartial authority, accompanied by the appropriate provision of legal aid and legal representation. The Bill introduces two automatic bail hearings for those detained under Immigration Act powers to be held 5 to 9 days after initial detention with a further hearing between 33 and 37 days should detention continue.
<P>
Amnesty International believes that a bail hearing is an insufficient guarantee against arbitrary detention as it depends on criteria other than the lawfulness of the detention, such as the availability of sureties. As such it does not meet the requirement of international law that there should be an objective review of the decision to detain.
<P>
Article 5(4) of the ECHR states: ``Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful''. Amnesty International does not believe that the bail provisions in the Bill comply with this requirement.
<P>
The Bill provides no guarantee of legal representation which is essential given the importance of an infringement of the right to liberty and the short amount of time which the detainee will have to prepare for the first bail hearing. There is no maximum period of detention, and no necessity for continued judicial supervision after the second bail hearing.
<P>
Unlike those charged with criminal offences, asylum seekers do not benefit from a presumption in favour of liberty at bail hearings.
<P>
The absence of these provisions raises questions about the Bill's compliance with the right to liberty under Article 5 of the ECHR.
<P>
Amnesty International believes that asylum detainees should be physically present at a bail hearing and not via a TV link&#151;Clause 35(1). Research carried out by Amnesty International in the USA where TV links have been used in asylum detention hearings suggests that the subject of the hearing is dehumanised. The opportunity for conference with lawyers in private is problematic during the US proceedings (particularly where there are language difficulties) as the asylum detainee is held in a room with a guard in the detention centre, whilst the lawyer is in the court with the judge. The detained asylum-seeker may have been waiting all day in the room waiting for his/her case to be heard which is not always apparent to the judge.
<P>
Amnesty International submits that only those asylum-seekers charged with serious criminal offences should be detained in prisons in line with international standards and currently 50 per cent. of those detained are held in prisons. Bail hearings should be seen to be impartial and therefore it is unacceptable for them to be held in prisons or immigration detention centres.
<P>
Amnesty International is deeply concerned at the pattern of detention of unaccompanied refugee children which has been revealed in a study by the Refugee Council. We believe that the detention of such children amounts to a serious violation of international law and domestic provisions. It is our view that a statutory commitment should be made that an unaccompanied refugee child should never be detained under Immigration Act powers alone. This is also stated in the conclusions and recommendations of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.
<P>
Amnesty International recommends that detention is only resorted to when other measures short of detention will not suffice and for a minimal period. There should be effective safeguards on the use of detention including: a statutory presumption in favour of liberty; statutory criteria in respect of the denial of liberty and an effective review mechanism to scrutinise decisions to detain by a court or similar competent, independent and impartial review body accompanied by the appropriate provision of legal aid and guaranteed access to legal representation.
<H4><center>PART VI: SUPPORT FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS</center></H4>
<H4><center>Support for asylum-seekers and access to legal advice and representation</center></H4>
<P>
The Bill removes access to statutory welfare benefits for all asylum-seekers even though it has been accepted by the Government that the reinstatement of welfare benefits would be cheaper and less cumbersome. The proposed new arrangements do not respect the dignity of asylum-seekers by allowing them a choice about their living arrangements&#151;Clause 76(2) and are potentially dangerous because of the identification of a person as a refugee by the conditions under which they will be made to live.
<P>
Amnesty International is deeply concerned that the proposed new support arrangements fail to take into account access to quality legal advice and representation. The Legal Aid Board noted, in its consultation paper about reform of the civil legal aid system, that the majority of legally-aided immigration advice (mostly asylum-related) is concentrated in the South East of England. This is where most of the law firms and legal agencies representing asylum-seekers are located.
<P>
If refugees are to be dispersed across the country, the new arrangements will inevitably create a legal protection crisis unless provision is made for access to quality legal advice and representation and for training of lawyers in refugee law. Asylum-seekers should be assured early access to quality legal advice and representation before the commencement of the initial determination process. Early access will help the asylum-seeker to fully set out the claim for asylum (with supporting documentary evidence where available), will assist in determining a claim and should be integrated into the asylum procedure.
<P>
From April 2001, up to 50 per cent. asylum-seekers may be located outside of London, to areas where there is currently little expert legal advice in an increasingly complex area of the law. This raises the prospect of asylum-seekers in an almost cashless system walking miles to get access to legal advice and representation, if it exists at all.
<P>
During evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee in May 1998, Mike O'Brien described the current subsistence programme for asylum-seekers without benefits as ``a shambles within a shambles''. Amnesty International does not see the proposals in the Bill making any difference to the shambles of current support for asylum-seekers. The provisions for support in the Bill do not ensure that the inherent dignity of the asylum-seeker is respected and will create a further shambles.
<P>
It has always been Amnesty Internationals belief that, rather than withdrawing benefits to asylum-seekers, the correct way to address the situation of costs to the public purse would be to reduce the unacceptably long delays in the processing of applications. This was also the Home Secretary's belief prior to the election when in a briefing document for election candidates entitled: Fairer, faster & firmer Labours approach to asylum and immigration, he stated that ``. . . Delays leave genuine applicants in limbo, cost the tax payer money and encourage unfounded applications''. The Labour social security spokesman was also reported saying that ``tackling the administrative delays would be far more effective than this indiscriminate attack on applicants'' (Daily Telegraph, 12 January 1996).
<P>
The pre-election promise to operate a system in which genuine asylum-seekers are treated with respect and not left destitute is a hollow one when the choice facing asylum-seekers is to be beholden to family, friends or community or be dispersed around the country without money to live or the means to maintain contact with their legal representative. Asylum-seekers, many of whom have fled from torture and other human rights violations, should be allowed to pursue their asylum claims in dignity.
<P>
As currently drafted there are periods in which no support at all will be provided, for example if an asylum-seeker is seeking judicial review through the courts. Amnesty International believes that this may be in breach of Article 3 of the ECHR.
<P>
The Governments proposals assume that the support arrangements will only be temporary because asylum claims will be determined within six months. Such claims have been made by previous Governments and Amnesty International believes that this Government's assumptions will prove to be unrealistic as the backlog of outstanding initial decisions increased by 13,000 in 1998 alone and currently very few asylum cases are being determined.
<P>
Amnesty International believes that asylum-seekers should be given access to welfare benefits, permission to work and that support arrangements should take into account the availability of access to good legal advice and representation.

1 This paper sets out provisions in the Immigration and Asylum Bill that raise problems of compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and therefore may be in breach of the Human Rights Act 1998. It also points to provisions that may undermine protection under the 1951 Refugee Convention (1951 Convention).
<P>
2 In general, we are concerned about the number and scope of delegated powers in the Bill, which make it impossible to assume that it will operate in a way that is human rights compliant. These powers should be more clearly set out in statute, and those that affect human rights should always require affirmative resolution of Parliament.
<P>
3 In relation to ECHR rights in general, we consider that the following provisions raise clear questions of compliance with the Human Rights Act:
<H4><center>Detention (paragraphs 8.1.-8.31)</center></H4>
<P>
the provisions of Part III in relation to detention do not provide a clear legal basis for detention, or proper judicial control. These provisions do not meet the requirements of leading Counsel's Opinion already provided to the Home Office, or the recommendations of the UN Working Party on Arbitrary Detention. Part III needs amendment to provide statutory grounds, and clear criteria in regulations, governing the use of detention; and to provide swift and continuous judicial control over its legality and length. Legal representation will be necessary at detention hearings.
<H4><center>Removal of support (paragraphs 10.3-10.20)</center></H4>
<P>
breaches of ECHR (as well as 1951 Convention) rights are likely to result from the removal of acommodation and support while an asylum claim is still under consideration or before the courts. Destitute asylum-seekers should be supported while their claims to protection are under consideration or before the courts.
<H4><center>Immigration officers' powers of entry, search and seizure (paragraphs 11.1-11.7).</center></H4>
<P>
there is a lack of safeguards over immigration officers' new powers of arrest, search and seizure without warrant. These powers should not be transferred without appropriate judicial and procedural safeguards.
<H4><center>`Sham' marriages (paragraphs 5.1-5.7.)</center></H4>
<P>
the definition is so broad that it raises privacy issues; and the provisions apparently discriminate on religious grounds. The provisions should be amended to remove discrimination and protect privacy.
<H4><center>Penalties for carrying `clandestine entrants' (paragraphs 7.7-7.17)</center></H4>
<P>
the provisions of clauses 18-23, acording to our advice, do not provide effective due process rights for carriers bringing in `clandestine entrants'. These clauses appear to create a criminal penalty, which would require much stronger judicial safeguards; even as a civil penalty, they appear to lack due process safeguards.
<H4><center>Exchange of information (paragraphs 1.4-4.14).</center></H4>
<P>
the purposes for which information, particularly sensitive infromation&#151;on asylum-seekers, can be exchanged under clauses 11 and 12 are too broad. The purposes in these clauses, and the order-making powers to extend them, need to be more specific; the Data Protection Commissioner should be consulted.
<H4><center>Level and kind of support (paragraphs 10.21-10.34).</center></H4>
<P>
breaches of ECHR rights may occur as a result of the proposed new support and accommodation arrangements, particularly if they extend beyond the promised six month period. No-choice accommodation, support in kind and the low level of support risk breaching ECHR rights if they extend beyond a limited period.
<P>
4 We also note provisions in the Bill which appear to undermine protection rights guaranteed under the 1951 Convention and Article 3 ECHR. We point in particular to:
<H4><center>Fees for applications for protection (paragraphs 3.1-3.4).</center></H4>
<P>
the ability to set fees for applications for protection. There should be no power to impose fees for protection applications.
<H4><center>Extension of deception offence and penalties (paragraphs 6.1-6.3).</center></H4>
<P>
the extension of the offence of, and penalties for, deception, even in relation to well-founded cases. Penalties should not be imposed on those who make a well-founded protection claim.
<H4><center>Extension of carrier sanctions (paragraphs 7.1-7.17).</center></H4>
<P>
the extension of carrier sanctions without clear exemptions for those who bring in people who are in imminent danger of persecution and who are later accepted as in need of protection. There should be exemptions from penalties for those who carry people in imminent danger of persecution, torture or inhuman treatment.
<H4><center>Certification of asylum claims (paragraphs 9.11-9.17).</center></H4>
<P>
the continuing power to certify cases for fast-track treatment and deny access to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. Certification powers risk undermining protection and should be removed or narrowed.
<P>
5 In addition, we draw attention to two matters which are fundamental to the effective protection of human rights:
<H4><center>Legal advice and representation (paragraphs 9.18-9.22).</center></H4>
<P>
the existence of competent legal representation, if necessary free to those who cannot afford it. There should be a single, comprehensive system for public funding of advice and representation in asylum and detention cases.
<H4><center>Effective human rights jurisdiction in appellate system (paragraphs 9.2-9.6).</center></H4>
<P>
the protection of human righs depends in the first instance on an appellate system with clear jurisdiction and procedures. The Bill's present provisions are unclear and need amendment and clarification, as do the Secretary of State's powers to refuse an appeal. They also need to be complemented by a clear humanitarian jurisdiction.
<H4><center>IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM BILL</center></H4>
<H4><center>HUMAN RIGHTS COMPLIANCE</center></H4>
<H4><center>INTRODUCTION</center></H4>
<P>
1.1 The Human Rights Act 1998 will change law and practice in the UK. It will mean that all those exercising public functions (from the Home Office down to a voluntary organisation carrying out a statutory responsibility) will need to make sure that their policies and actions comply with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). It will also mean that the courts can declare primary legislation to be incompatible with the ECHR and can strike down or disregard secondary legislation which breaches ECHR rights. Broadly, this will mean that where an ECHR right is established, it cannot be interfered with, except in circumstances prescribed in the Convention itself, or where such interference can be shown to be `necessary in a democratic society' and proportional to the aim pursued.
<P>
1.2 These principles of necessity and proportionality will become critical in law-making, law implementation and law enforcement. Existing law will be open to reinterpretation, as UK courts apply Convention principles directly, taking account of decisions of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in Strasbourg. New law needs to be examined carefully in light of these new requirements. It is important not only that it does not directly breach the ECHR, but that it also assists those who will be implementing the new Act to ensure that they are aware of, and comply with, ECHR standards.
<P>
1.3 In terms of this Bill, the UK's responsibilities under the United Nations Convention and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees (the 1951 Convention) are also relevant. The 1951 Convention is effectively part of UK law, as both the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 and the present Bill prohibit any action in breach of the UK's 1951 Convention obligations. Though there is no equivalent of the Strasbourg court to enforce that Convention at international level, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has responsibility for monitoring it, and the official statements of the UNHCR Executive Committee (ExCom) therefore provide interpretation and guidance on the implementation of various Articles of the 1951 Convention.
<P>
1.4 The text of the Articles of the ECHR and the 1951 Convention referred to in this Briefing, are set out in Annex 1.
<H4><center>THE BILL'S COMPLIANCE</center></H4>
<P>
2.1 This Bill is extremely long and complex. It also builds upon and amends four other major immigration and asylum statutes. It has not been possible, within the time available, to subject all its provisions to detailed scrutiny. What this briefing does, therefore, is to point to some of the human rights compliance issues that are raised, and not so far dealt with, in the Bill's provisions. It does not pretend to be exhaustive or definitive, but it is based upon the expertise of lawyers familiar with those areas of human rights law and practice.
<P>
2.2 The Home Secretary, as he is required to do under the Human Rights Act, has stated on the front of the Bill that he believes that it complies with ECHR rights. We do not believe, in light of some of the Bill's provisions, that this statement can safely be made. Nor do we believe that some of its provisions comply with the UK's obligations under the 1951 Convention. This briefing identifies those areas where the Bill itself, or the powers it confers, raise serious questions of compliance with the ECHR or the 1951 Convention.
<P>
2.3 One of the problems is that the Bill's structure makes it impossible to assume that it will operate in a way that is human rights compliant. It contains over 50 provisions for secondary legislation, almost all of which are subject only to negative resolution, and where the scope, intent and safeguards of the delegated powers are insufficiently set out in the statute. In some cases, this may mean that the provisions fall foul of the ECHR requirement that any interference with rights is clearly `prescribed by law'. In many cases, the breadth of the delegated powers is such that significant breaches of human rights in the regulations or their implementation cannot be ruled out. There is no obligation to provide a certificate of compliance in relation to delegated legislation. In this briefing, we note some of the delegated powers that raise important human rights concerns.
<P>
2.4 We consider that the limits of order-making powers should be more precisely defined in statute, to alert those making or amending orders or regulations to human rights compliance issues. We also consider that secondary legislation with a human rights impact should be certified and should require affirmative resolution of Parliament.
<P>
2.5 We are very grateful for the assistance of Nicholas Blake QC, Matthew Craven, Ben Emmerson, Jessica Simor and UNHCR (who have all provided written Opinions or Notes on clauses which have been made available to the Committee Clerk), and for advice from Nik Nicol.
<H4><center>COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT</center></H4>
<H4><center>PART 1: IMMIGRATION: GENERAL</center></H4>
<H4><center>clause 3 (Article 33 1951 Convention and Article 3 ECHR) see also clauses 1 and 7</center></H4>
<P>
3.1 Article 33 1951 Convention prevents states returning any person who will suffer persecution as a refugee (`refoulement'). Article 3 ECHR prohibits torture and inhuman and degrading treatment: this not only obliges states not to carry out such treatment themselves; it also imposes an absolute prohibition on returning a person to a country where they face a real risk of prohibited treatment1.
<P>
3.2 Clause 3 gives the Secretary of State power, by regulation, to charge a fee for any application to remain in the UK. Without payment of such a fee, no application is validly made. There is no statutory prohibition exempting those seeking 1951 Convention or Article 3 ECHR protection from payment of a fee, though the explanatory notes on clauses state that it is not the Government's current (our emphasis) intention to do so.
<P>
3.3 Any barrier which prevented a person claiming or obtaining protection under either Convention, with the result that he or she had to return to face prohibited treatment, would be in breach of the ECHR and the 1951 Convention. Any fee which governed the ability to make an application for such protection and which resulted in some people being unable to make protection claims would be such a barrier.
<P>
3.4 The legislation should specifically exempt claims for asylum under the 1951 Convention or Article 3 ECHR, so as to govern the regulation-making power of the Secretary of State.
<P>
3.5 There are also powers in clause 1 (grant of leave to enter) and clause 7 (power to request security) which could be used to refuse those seeking protection while en route to the UK, or to require and enforce securities on their behalf, even if they were subsequently to be granted protection. These measures, also, could undermine the ability to seek protection and therefore the UK's international obligations. The Bill should make clear that these powers will not be used to refuse, or penalise, refugees and those seeking Article 3 ECHR protection.
<H4><center>clause 6 (see comments on clause 48)</center></H4>
<H4><center>clauses 11 and 12 (Article 8 ECHR and the EU Data Protection Convention)</center></H4>
<P>
4.1 These clauses provide for the exchange of unspecified data for immigration purposes between the Secretary of State and police and customs. They also give the Secretary of State the power, by regulation, to extend, without limitation, the purposes for which, and the persons between which, information may be exchanged. Although the clauses do not state this, the exchange of information will in fact be much wider than that provided for in the Bill. The agencies involved, particularly the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) are those that will be feeding into, and accessing, key European Union-wide databases, including Europol, and, if the UK decides to participate, the Schengen Information System.
<P>
1 Soering v UK (1989) 11 EHRR 439, Chahal v UK (1997) 23 EHRR 413.
<P>
4.2 The collation and exchange of personal information immediately engages Article 8 privacy considerations. Under this Article, a number of data protection principles have been developed, to provide key privacy safeguards. They are reflected in the Council of Europe's 1981 Data Protection Convention and the European Union's 1995 Data Protection Directive, both of which underpin the UK's Data Protection Act 1998, which is designed to ensure compliance with those principles.
<P>
4.3 Safeguarding information has particular relevance for asylum-seekers. A great deal of information held about them, including the mere fact of their asylum application, may directly endanger, or prejudice, themselves or their families. For example, the consequences of information about asylum-seekers, passed on by immigration or entry clearance authorities, directly or indirectly reaching the authorities in a country where they face persecution is well-documented in a number of cases (such as Kurds seeking to leave Istanbul and Tamils in Colombo).
<P>
4.4 Clauses 11 and 12 give agencies the power to share a wide range of personal information which they may not currently be able to do under the Data Protection Act. This gives rise to two main issues: the extent to which these clauses (and subsequently any orders laid under them) are in compliance with Article 8; and the effect of these clauses on existing privacy safeguards in the Data Protection Act 1998.
<P>
4.5 Under Article 8, any interference with privacy rights can only take place if
<P>
there is a precise and detailed legal basis
<P>
it can be shown that such interference is necessary and is proportionate to the harm that would otherwise be done.
<P>
4.6 First, there must be questions as to whether clauses 11 and 12 fulfil the first Article 8 requirement, of precision. The purposes for which, and the persons to which, information may be exchanged are very broadly defined, and these are not required to be further specified in regulation. Going beyond the usual crime purposes for exchanging information, `immigration purposes', as defined in clause 11(3), includes the `administration of immigration control'. This covers an extremely broad range of circumstances. It is far less specific than, for example, the clauses in the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997, which refers in detail to the activities and purposes (which relate to criminal offences) for which information may be shared between government departments.
<P>
4.7 Secondly, there are particular concerns relating to the exchange of immigration and asylum information. Due to the very real dangers of disseminating information on asylum seekers, the tests of proportionality, necessity and legal precision required under Article 8 need to be particularly strict. Again, the catch-all category of `administration of immigration control' may not provide sufficient legal basis to meet these Article 8 requirements, and may also expose UK authorities to breaches of Article 3, if persecution should as a result take place.
<P>
4.8 The Bill should define more clearly the purposes for which it is proposed information should be exchanged. It should also require the Secretary of State to set out, in regulations, the specific purposes for which, and circumstances in which, information may be exchanged between government agencies for purposes other than those for which it was collected. Those regulations should specify, in particular, the circumstances in which information on asylum-seekers can be exchanged.
<P>
4.9 The clauses also give the Secretary of State a wide and unfettered power to extend, by order, the purposes for which and persons to whom information may be exchanged. These include non-specific purposes other than immigration purposes, and therefore arguably outside the scope of the Bill. The non-disclosure provisions of data protection legislation are a cornerstone of privacy safeguards which should not be exempted or lessened other than in specific circumstances which can be shown to be necessary and proportionate.
<P>
4.10 The statute should set limits to the Secretary of State's order-making power to extend statutory purposes or users. Any such extension should only be possible by positive resolution (which is not at present the case in Clause 11 or clause 12(6)).
<P>
4.11 These clauses also raise questions as to the application of existing safeguards in data protection law. Schedule 3 of the 1998 Act specifically provides for stronger processing controls for sensitive personal data (including information about racial or ethnic origin and religious or political affiliation) which in general require the express consent of the subject. Although these controls can be bypassed in certain specified circumstances, it is unclear whether it is intended that they should be bypassed in relation to the exchange of data under these new clauses.
<P>
4.12 These is a further concern over whether these clauses are intended to provide the legal basis for large-scale data matching between the specified agencies, and between those agencies and others. There are now very sophisticated techniques whereby profiles of individuals, their activities and contacts may be built up by matching large quantities of unconnected computer-held information. This is not permitted under the provisions of the Data Protection Act, which allows disclosure of data to take place only on a case by case basis.
<P>
4.13 We understand that the Data Protection Commissioner, who is responsible for privacy matters in the UK relating to personal information, was not formally consulted on these clauses of the Bill before the statement of compatibility under section 19 of the Human Rights Act was made. This raises the question of the role of the Commissioner in promoting compliance with privacy standards in the UK.
<P>
4.14 We consider that the Data Protection Commissioner should be consulted whenever it is proposed to introduce provisions affecting the scope of the Data Protection Act 1998. We also believe that she should now be asked to report in detail on the implications of these clauses for data protection safeguards.
<H4><center>clause 15 (and Part IX) (Article 14 ECHR, read with Articles 8 & 12 ECHR)</center></H4>
<P>
5.1 Clause 15 requires superintendent registrars to notify immigration authorities of suspected `sham marriages'. Part IX empowers registrars to request documentary evidence as to identity and nationality and to refuse to conduct a marriage. These provisions do not apply to marriages conducted within the Anglican church. These provisions engage Article 12 ECHR (the right to marry) and Article 8 ECHR (the right to a private and family life). If they apply in a discriminatory way, they are also challengeable under Article 14 ECHR (protection from discrimination on, inter alia, religious grounds).
<P>
5.2 `Sham marriages' are defined as marriages entered into, between an EEA national (which includes a British citizen) and a non-EEA national, `for the purpose of avoiding the effect of one or more of the provisions of immigration law'. Any such marriage would, of course, have the effect of avoiding various immigration law provisions. The notorious (and now abolished) primary purpose marriage rule showed how difficult it is to gauge intention and to do so in a non-discriminatory manner. In addition, this is a very unclear and imprecise definition, and would cover genuine marriages which conferred immigration-related benefits: for example a couple who had been cohabiting for many years and who decided to marry partly so that the non-EEA partner was free of certain immigration requirements, or in order to secure settled or nationality status for their child.
<P>
5.3 In order to justify the interference with Article 8 ECHR that the provisions provide, the Bill should specify much more precisely the circumstances which might denote a `sham marriage'. Such a definition should be sufficiently narrow to provide justification, on grounds of necessity and proportionality, for any intrusive action that was subsequently taken.
<P>
5.4 In addition, the provisions appear to constitute a more direct breach of Article 14 ECHR, read with Articles 8 and 12 ECHR. They do not apply to religious marriages carried out by the Church of England or Church in Wales, though they apply to all other religious marriages which require civil preliminaries. Article 14 ECHR prohibits discrimination on grounds such as race, religion and nationality, in the exercise of any of the rights guaranteed by the Convention. It would appear difficult to justify a position whereby, for example, Muslims or Roman Catholics who had married according to their religious rites were subject to scrutiny and possible barriers to marriage which did not apply to members of the Anglican church. The statement in the explanatory notes that `there is no evidence to show' that marriages conducted within the Anglican church are `abused for immigration purposes' appears to confirm, rather than mitigate, this discrimination.
<P>
5.5 Any provisions that are to be applied, should be applied indiscriminately to all marriage ceremonies.
<P>
5.6 Any regulations issued by the Registrar-General in relation to the exercise by registrars of these powers will also have to be carefully drafted so as to ensure that registrars do not exercise them in a discriminatory manner (eg by requesting evidence only from pensions of a particular race or nationality).
<P>
5.7 In order to ensure that registrars are aware of the need to avoid unlawful discrimination, we suggest that a non-discrimination requirement is written into the statute, thus governing any regulations later issued.
<H4><center>clause 16 (Article 31 1951 Convention)</center></H4>
<P>
6.1 This clause extends the definition and the penalities for obtaining or seeking to obtain leave to enter or remain in the UK by deception. Such persons are liable to a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment. The explanatory notes make it clear that this has the `express purpose' of dealing with failed asylum-seekers whose claims have involved deceit; however the clause as drafted is much broader, and allows penalties to be enforced even on those whose protection claims are accepted, or are still under consideration. In addition, `deception' is not defined or limited and therefore may include deception which is not blatant, or substantive.
<P>
6.2 Article 31 of the 1951 Convention explicitly prohibits states from penalising asylum-seekers who have entered illegally, provided that they can show good reason for this. It is accepted that asylum-seekers will often need to provide themselves with false documents in order to leave the countries where they face persecution or torture, and that they may not feel safe enough to declare this to an immigration officer immediately on arrival. In such circumstances, according to Article 31, no penalties should be imposed.
<P>
6.3 Clause 16, as it stands, may therefore breach Article 31 1951 Convention insofar as it may be applied to asylum-seekers and refugees, particularly those entering on false documents. It should be amended to limit its scope and definition.
<H4><center>PART II: CARRIERS' LIABILITY</center></H4>
<H4><center>clauses 18-27 (Article 3 ECHR, Article 33 1951 Convention, Article 6 and Protocol 1(1) ECHR)</center></H4>
<P>
7.1 This Part retains, and extends, sanctions upon carriers who bring into the UK undocumented entrants, or those concealed within transporters. It creates a new category of `clandestine entrant' who has arrived concealed in a ship, vehicle or aircraft and who has claimed, or intends to claim, asylum (or to evade immigration control). They then impose a new penalty on the owner or driver of the transporter concerned, which allows the transporter to be detained. The new, and indeed the existing, penalties raise questions under the UK's responsibility to provide protection under the 1951 Convention and Article 3 ECHR. The new clandestine entry penalties are also likely to raise problems of compliance with the requirements of Protocol 1(1) ECHR in respect of interference with property rights and the Article 6 ECHR requirements for due process in determining civil obligations and criminal penalties.
<H4><center>The UK's protection obligations</center></H4>
<P>
7.2 Existing carrier sanctions, in the form of mandatory visas and fines on carriers of undocumented persons, have already been held by UNHCR, Amnesty International and others to undermine the UK's international obligations to provide protection under the 1951 Convention, as well as the right to seek asylum guaranteed in Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In practice, because asylum-seekers cannot easily obtain documentation or leave overtly, such sanctions act to prevent those being persecuted from leaving their countries of origin to seek protection. They also engage the UK's Article 3 ECHR obligations, insofar as they may result in a refusal to carry a person who is in imminent danger of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment.
<P>
7.3 As UNHCR points out:
<P>
`While States have a legitimate interest in controlling irregular migration and a right to do so through various pre-entry control measures, including visa requirements, when such measures effectively prevent persons at risk of persecution from gaining access to safety and obtaining asylum in other countries, States act inconsistently with their international obligations towards refugees2'
<P>
2 Document prepared for JUSTICE by UNHCR, February 1999 (this document has been sent to the Clerk of the Special Standing Committee)
<P>
It has frequently been pointed out that carrier sanctions devolve responsibility for decision-making to the employees of carrying companies, who have no obligations to provide protection under international instruments, but have obligations not to incur fines to the detriment of their shareholders.
<P>
7.4 The new definition of `clandestine entrant', and associated penalties, greatly increase the extent to which the UK's international obligations are undermined. `Clandestine entrants' include persons who seek, or may seek, asylum; they are not confined to persons seeking to enter the UK by deception, or persons who are not entitled to protection in the UK. Clause 18 therefore explicitly foresees that a transporter carrying a concealed entrant who is a Convention refugee, or a person in need of Article 3 ECHR protection, will be penalised for doing so. There is no defence, and no remission of penalties, if and when such a person is granted protection in the UK; and the amount of the penalty is not statutorily prescribed, as it is for those carrying undocumented passengers.
<P>
7.5 In 1987, the Immigration Service issued guidelines in relation to the operation of existing carrier sanctions, setting out the circumstances in which discretion not to fine carriers could be exercised. These included transporting persons who were later recognised as refugees and had been unable to obtain documents or were in imminent danger to life3. The guidelines do not include any reference to those in imminent danger of Article 3 ECHR violation, or of persecution which is less than life-threatening. It should be noted that, in a recent judgement4 the Court of Appeal held that asylum-seekers in imminent danger should be able to claim a defence of duress of circumstances to criminal sanctions. The Court pointed out that Anne Frank could have needed such a defence if she had stolen a car in order to escape safely from Amsterdam. By analogy, if she had hidden in a car boot, the driver could be said to have required a similar defence to any charge or penalty.
<P>
7.6 We consider that, to ensure that Article 33 1951 Convention and Article 3 ECHR obligations are not undermined, there should be an exemption from all carrier sanctions where the carrier can show that he or she acted to prevent imminent persecution or Article 3 ECHR harm, and where the person carried is subsequently granted protection in the UK.
<H4><center>Clandestine entry penalties and due process rights</center></H4>
<P>
7.7 Clause 18(7) provides that it is no defence for a carrier not to know, or suspect, that a person was concealed in a vehicle. Clause 20(3) provides, however, that a carrier will have a defence to any penalty if he/she did not know or suspect that a person was concealed in the transporter and had an `effective system' in place for preventing such carriage and that system was being operated `properly' at the appropriate time. Clause 19 provides that the Secretary of State may issue a code of practice to be followed to prevent clandestine entry, but does not require him to do so. It is for the Secretary of State alone to decide whether any objections to the issue of a penalty notice are justified (clause 21(8)). If the Secretary of State is mistaken in his decision and the transporter is detained as a result of issuing such a notice, clause 24(4) provides that this action shall not be unlawful, and therefore exempts the Secretary of State from any claim in damages even if the notice was wrongly issued. The matter needs to go before a court if it is proposed to sell the detained vehicle in the absence of payment of any penalty imposed.

<P>
4 R v. Naji and others, CA 17 December 1998.
<P>
7.8 In a Note provided to JUSTICE by Ben Emmerson and Jessica Simor, barristers5, they consider that these penalties raise serious issues under Article 6 ECHR (the right to a fair trial) and Protocol 1(1) ECHR (the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property). They point to three key areas where the Bill, as drafted, may conflict with ECHR requirements.
<P>
7.9 First, there is the question of whether such penalties (which may lead to a carrier's bankruptcy) can be considered to be proportional to the harm caused in circumstances where the person carried subsequently sustains a claim to protection. This is further argument in support of an exemption as suggested in paragraph 7.6. above.
<P>
7.10 Secondly, however, they consider that these penalties may constitute a criminal charge for the purposes of Article 6 ECHR. If this were the case, the carrier would be entitled to a hearing that complies with the procedural requirements of Article 6(2) and (3) ECHR before any penalty could be imposed.
<P>
7.11 A penalty can relate to a `criminal charge' for ECHR purposes even if it is defined as a civil penalty under domestic law. The ECtHR will look at the underlying nature of the offence and the potential penalty incurred. It is argued that clause 18 is clearly designed to have a deterrent effect and to be punitive, rather than to be pecuniary compensation for damage6. Furthermore, it should be read with the existing provisions in section 25 of the 1971 Immigration Act, which create the criminal offence of intentionally assisting illegal entrants. As Emmerson and Simor point out
<P>
`That offence is triable summarily, with all the procedural guarantees of Article 6 [ECHR]. The new concurrent regime under clauses 18-23 provides for a penalty to be paid on the demand of the Secretary of State for the same offence, but where no intention can be established. It grants the Secretary of State the power to find the individual guilty, impose a penalty at a level he prescribes and indeed determine whether a carrier has any defence (see clause 21(6) of the Bill). Consequently, a carrier who brings an asylum seeker or illegal entrant into the United Kingdom without knowledge is entitled to fewer procedural safeguards than one who intentionally assists such an entrant. There appears to be little reason why the Secretary of State would ever choose to adopt the approach that requires him to prove intent before a Court of Law, where an alternative option is open to him, that requires neither proof of intent, nor judicial involvement. In effect, clauses 18-23 may be used to penalise individuals for conduct that also falls within the criminal sphere . . . thus frustrating the purpose of Article 6 [ECHR]'7.
<P>
7.12 They also point out several further factors which argue for these being in effect criminal penalties, including the nature of the defences available. They also note the factors that distinguish these penalties from those applicable in the Air Canada8 case (where the ECtHR found that the seizure of an aeroplane by Customs after it had been used for the smuggling of illegal drugs was not a criminal penalty).9

7.13 There are therefore strong arguments to the effect that the Bill is creating a criminal penalty, which should therefore be determined by a court. Clauses 18-23 would then need to be redrawn, to provide for penalties to be imposed by a court, and not by administrative means.
<P>
7.14 Finally, however, even in the absence of a criminal penalty, Emmerson and Simor consider that the provisions of Article 6 ECHR in relation to the determination of civil obligations are not fulfilled. Article 6 ECHR requires individuals to have recourse to a court where there is a dispute as to such obligations. It is the Secretary of State who acts as a court under this Bill. Nor can an individual wait to be sued in debt proceedings before a court by the secretary of State since to do so would render the individual at risk of having his transporter seized.
<P>
7.15 The Bill provides that where there is a risk of non-payment of a penalty, this renders the vehicle liable to seizure (there are similar provisions in respect of carrier sanctions). Though that seizure can subsequently be challenged in court, Emmerson and Simor consider that this is an ineffective remedy, given the serious prejudice that will already have occurred (the direct and indirect costs of seizure) and the fact that the court cannot provide any remedy for any losses sustained as a result of the transporter's seizure. In practice, they consider, an individual subject to a penalty notice would be obliged to pay the penalty for fear of the consequences. This would be particularly the case for those for whom detention of a transporter represented the removal of all, or a significant proportion of, their livelihood10.
<P>
7.16 There is a particular difficulty in relation to the clandestine entrant penalty, since carriers may not know in advance whether they are liable to penalties. The Bill provides (clause 19) that the Secretary of State may issue a detailed Code to set out what constitute effective measures that carriers ought to have in place, and which would provide a defence to any liability for a penalty. However, he is not required to do so. A Code should be mandatory, to provide a sufficiently precise legal basis for individuals to assess the consequences of their actions, or failures to act.
<P>
7.17 The regime for penalising those subject to clauses 18-23 should be amended to ensure compliance with the due process requirements of Article 6 ECHR requirements. This should include a mandatory code setting out the procedures required to provide a defence to any penalty.
<H4><center>PART III: BAIL</center></H4>
<H4><center>clauses 29-27 (Article 5 ECHR, Article 31 1951 Convention (and Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)</center></H4>
<P>
8.1 This Part provides for two automatic bail hearings for those detained under Immigration Act powers, at 5-9 days and 33-37 days from initial detention. Such hearings may be held in front of magistrates or immigration adjudicators. There is no presumption of liberty, as there is in criminal bail hearings, and the court may only release the detained person subject to recognisances (which may include financial sureties).
<P>
8.2 These provisions are not sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 5 ECHR (the right to liberty) or the similar provisions in Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), particularly in respect of those seeking protection under Article 3 ECHR or the 1951 Covention. JUSTICE has already provided a detailed Opinion of Nicholas Blake QC to the Home Office, setting out the requirements of these Articles11. The findings of that Opinion are confirmed by the recently-issued report of the UN Working Party on Arbitrary Detention, following its visit to the UK12.
<P>
8.3 Article 5(1) ECHR provides that no-one can be detained except in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law and, inter alia, (Article 5(1)(f)) `to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or . . . with a view to deportation or extradition'. Article 5(4) ECHR provides that all those detained are entitled to take court proceedings to determine the lawfulness of detention. There are similar provisions in Article 9 ICCPR.
<P>
8.4 Lawfulness means more than mere accordance with domestic provisions. Detention is only lawful if it is for a purpose prescribed under the Convention13. The provisions of the Convention in Article 5(1)(f) ECHR do not authorise the detention of any asylum-seeker, but only of one who is seeking to enter unlawfully14. The act of seeking asylum is not an attempt to gain unauthorised or unlawful entry; it would only become so if an asylum claim was being made with a view to evading immigration control and remaining illegally. It is therefore for the authorities to show that such grounds exist, before they acquire the lawful power to detain15.

<P>
8.5 The relevant caselaw on detention is to be found in the cases of Amuur v France at the ECtHR and A v Australia, before the UN Human Rights Committee. The principles set down in those cases include the following:
<P>
the concept of `in accordance with the law' in Article 5(1) ECHR is wider than merely accordance with national provisions and embraces the requirements of legality set down in the Convention (Amuur, para 50)
<P>
detention may be arbitrary, even if it is lawful under national law `if it is not necessary in all circumstances of the case, for example to prevent flight or interference with evidence: the element of proportionality becomes relevant' (A v. Australia, para. 9.2)
<P>
detention is only justified under Article 5(1)(f) ECHR to prevent `unauthorised entry' (i.e. an attempt to enter a country illegally); this does not include seeking international protection (Amuur, para 43)
<P>
there should be a legal regime covering detention, as opposed to executive discretion: such laws should be `sufficiently accessible and precise, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness' (Amuur, para 50)
<P>
a detainee must have the right of access to a court for a speedy decision determining the legality of the detention (Amuur, para 43); this must continue if detention is prolonged, and the court must be able to consider not only whether there is jurisdiction to detain according to national criteria but must also deal with the requirements for legality laid down in the international instrument (Amuur, para 50 and 53, A v Australia, para 9.5).
<P>
8.6 Detention of asylum-seekers may also contravene Article 31 of the 1951 Convention, which prohibits the imposition of penalties on asylum-seekers who arrive without authorisation. The principles of Article 31 in relation to detention have been supplemented by ExCom Conclusion No 44 of 1986 and the UNHCR's 1999 Guidelines on the Detention of asylum-seekers. They follow very closely the human rights jurisprudence above, with its emphasis on necessity and the need to show reasons in each case. The 1999 guidelines state that `detention of asylum-seekers is . . . inherently undesirable'. ExCom conclusion No 44 defines the limited grounds upon which asylum-seekers may be detained, but only if it is strictly necessary to do so in each case16.
<P>
8.7 The provisions in the Bill do not satisfactorily meet the requirements of Article 5 ECHR and Article 31 1951 Convention. They are deficient in two main respects: they do not provide a proper statutory and legal basis for detention, or proper judicial control and oversight. They may also fail to provide sufficent legal representation to ensure detainees' effective access to courts.
<H4><center>Statutory basis</center></H4>
<P>
8.8 The Bill is silent on the power to detain and the reasons for doing so. Statutory powers of detention are therefore to be found only in the Immigration Act 1971, which gives immigration officers blanket powers to detain any person whose application to enter the UK is being examined, or who is facing removal or deportation.
<H4><center>Detention of asylum-seekers</center></H4>
<P>
8.9 Asylum-seekers come into the first category; and examination of their cases may take many months. An immigration officer may, as an alternative, temporarily admit such a person to an approved address, with or without reporting requirements. No statutory grounds or criteria are identified in connection with the use of the power to detain or to grant temporary admission. There is no provision that each decision to detain an asylum-seeker should be based upon a presumption of liberty, which can only be displaced if there are reasons to believe, in an individual case, that the asylum-seeker will not comply with any lesser measures.
<P>
8.10 The statutory provisions are reinforced by unpublished departmental instructions. They do set out a presumption in favour of temporary admission for asylum-seekers and list eight factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion to admit or detain. These instructions were revealed only as a result of court challenges to detention. They have no basis in statute, may be altered at any time, and are simply a statement of the exercise of executive discretion. This does not meet the requirements set out by the ECtHR in Amuur17. In UNHCR's view, neither does it meet requirements under the 1951 Convention.
<P>
[present UK] `Practice does not meet the minimum requirement of necessity: Viable alternatives to detention (such as reporting or residence obligations) should be considered first unless there is evidence to suggest that alternatives will not be effective in the individual measurable case. Detention should only take place after a full consideration of all possible alternatives or when monitoring mechanisms have been demonstrated not to have achieved their lawful and legitimate purpose18.

<P>
8.11 The requirements of Article 5 ECHR are somewhat different for those who have exhausted all legal avenues for remaining in the UK and are therefore subject to removal&#151;whether they were asylum-seekers, or are persons who have overstayed or entered illegally. In such a case, though the presumption of liberty under Article 5 ECHR still remains, it is more easily displaced, since they fall more readily into the provisions of Article 5(1)(f), being persons against whom deportation action was being taken.
<P>
8.12 It should be noted, however, that the present Bill extends the circumstances in which detention prior to removal can be authorised. Clause 116 provides for detention, on the authority of an immigration officer, if he or she has `reasonable grounds for suspecting' that removal directions may be given, and while a decision as to whether to issue such directions is being made. At present, detention can only be authorised of persons in respect of whom removal directions can be given.
<P>
8.13 It is clear that what is envisaged here is essentially preventive detention, possibly immediately after refusal or final appeal, in order to be able to effect removal directions, if given. Reasons for a decision to detain, relating to a belief that the person would otherwise abscond, would need to be provided and justified before a court in order to render this lawful. Questions of proportionality will also arise in respect of the use of detention in the case of people who have established themselves within the community over a lengthy period.
<P>
8.14 In addition, in all pre-removal cases, the question that would arise would be whether the detention was in reality in connection with deportation action: in other words, whether removal was able to be effected within a realistic time. There is already domestic law on the need under habeas corpus to establish a connection between the likely imminence of removal action and the period of detention.19 It will be all the more important, under the provisions of the Human Rights Act, to establish such a link in order to render detention lawful under Article 5 ECHR.
<H4><center>Requirements</center></H4>
<P>
8.15 The requirements for a clear legal basis, in statute and regulations, and the need to issue specific reasons for detention in each individual case, were clearly set out in Nicholas Blake's Opinion, forwarded to the Home Office in mid-1998. They are confirmed by the just-issued report of the UN Human Rights Commission's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention following its visit to the UK to examine immigration and asylum detention.20 The report concludes that the lack of clear criteria on those who should be or are detained, can amount to arbitrary and therefore unlawful detention21 and that each detainee should be provided in writing, in a language they can understand, with the reasons for their detention. These must show `a compelling reason to detain that is based on the personal history of each asylum seeker'.22

8.16 The following statutory and regulatory changes are required:
<P>
(i) The statute should set out the grounds for detention. There should be a presumption of liberty, which can only be displaced on Article 5 ECHR grounds: to prevent unauthorised entry or effect removal.
<P>
(ii) The criteria for detention should be developed in regulations, to be issued under statutory powers. They should set out the circumstances in which detention can be authorised, and stress that the detention of asylum-seekers is an exceptional measure.
<P>
(iii) Full reasons should be provided to justify detention with reference to the specific circumstances of the individual case, relating them to the detention criteria set out above.
<H4><center>Judicial control</center></H4>
<P>
8.17 The bail hearings provided for in Part III do not appear to be intended to deal with the question of the legality of detention. This is implicit in the fact that they can only release upon recognizances (which may include sureties) (clause 31(1)), in identical terms to the powers that now exist for release on bail after seven days of detention. It was made explicit by the Home Secretary in the Second Reading debate on the Bill:
<P>
`it will not be possible in the bail proceedings to raise the issue of the lawfulness of detention. That is a matter that must be dealt with under process for habeas corpus'23.
<P>
Nor will those hearings proceed from a presumption of liberty, as is the case with criminal bail hearings. This was also confirmed by the Home Secretary in the debate:
<P>
`Because of the special circumstances of immigration detention, which is used in only a relatively small number of cases and as a last resort, I did not judge it appropriate that there should be the same assumptions about the availability of Bail as there are in the Bail Act 1976.24
<P>
8.18 These statements contradict the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998, and would not provide effective judicial control over the decision to detain. As already stated, Article 5 ECHR provides for a right to liberty, which may only be interfered with under prescribed circumstances; and the ECtHR has held that this means that a detainee must be brought promptly before a court to determine the legality of the detention. Under the Human Rights Act, a Convention right may be argued in any legal proceeding before a court or tribunal. The lawfulness of detention under Article 5 ECHR therefore could, and should, be argued within any swift mandatory bail hearing.
<P>
8.19 However, it may well be difficult to persuade a court charged with only a bail jurisdiction to begin by examining whether detention should have been authorised, rather than simply to assess whether someone already detained can be released on bail conditions. In any event, the court would be unable to provide a remedy if it found unlawful detention. It cannot simply reverse the initial decision to detain and authorise temporary release, with or without reporting restrictions. It has power (under clause 31) only to release on recognizances, with appropriate sanctions.
<P>

<P>
8.20 such recognizances may, and in many circumstances in practice do, include a requirement for financial sureties. For newly-arrived asylum-seekers, who will in many cases be eligible only for the minimal support arrangements envisaged in Part VI of the Bill, this is impossible. The ability to demand sureties from those who are unlikely to be able to provide them, without the protection of the presumption of liberty inherent in criminal bail applications, is doubly undermining of the protection offered by Article 5 ECHR.
<P>
8.21. The UN Working Party Report underlines the inadequacy of bail hearings:
<P>
`a bail hearing, as promised by the Government in the White Paper, would not be an effective substitute for an independent review whereby the reasons for a decision to detain may be challenged. . . . each decision to detain should be reviewed as to its necessity and its compliance with international legal standards by means of a prompt, oral hearing by a court or similar competent independent and impartial review25'.
<P>
8.22 The Home Secretary appears to envisage a situation where separate proceedings, either by habeas corpus or, more likely, judicial review, to the Divsional Court, may be taken to deal with a fundamental question of the legality of the initial decision to detain, on the basis of Article 5 ECHR rights, including the presumption of liberty. This appears to create the anomalous situation where by the mandatory bail hearing cannot be prevented, under the terms of the Human Rights Act, from addressing the prior question of the legality of the detention against a presumption of liberty, but is prevented from granting an effective remedy, with the result that the case will have to be reheard before a higher court on habeas corpus proceedings, where the Human Rights Act provisions will again be argued. If this is the case, it would undermine the scheme of the Human Rights Act (which gives all courts and tribunals power to determine human rights questions in proceedings before them), and would greatly add to the time and expense of dealing with such matters.
<P>
8.23 In order to comply with the requirements of Article 5 ECHR and the scheme of the Human Rights Act:
<P>
(i) this section of the Bill should be re-titled `Detention Hearings', with consequential amendments to the text of clauses 29-30.
<P>
(ii) Clause 31 should be redrafted to refer to a two-stage process:
<P>
In the first stage, the court should examine the lawfulness of the initial decison to detain, with the power to quash the decision to detain and substitute temporary release, with or without reporting requirements. That decision should relate to the extent to which the statutory grounds and the criteria in the regulations at paragraph 8.16. above have been met.
<P>
If the decision to detain is upheld, the court should then have the powers set out in clause 31 at present, to release subject to recognizances, which may include sureties.
<P>
It is important to separate these two stages to ensure that the courts begin by examining the necessity for detention, rather than the suitability and extent of recognizances.
<P>
25 op cit, paras 18(h) and 29
<P>
8.24 The Bill makes no provision for continued judicial oversight of detention after 37 days, nor does it provide for a maximum period of detention. This ignores the fact that the longer administrative detention lasts, the more serious it becomes and the greater is the likelihood that it may breach human rights principles of proportionality and necessity. Continued judicial supervision is therefore essential. Indeed the UN Working Party Report recommends that an absolute maximum detention period should be set in national law.26
<P>
8.25 If recognizances are broken, or likely to be broken, this should always be a matter for the court which set those recognizances. Clause 33(6) envisages a situation in which those required to appear before immigration officers as a condition of releast may be arrested and then appear before immigration officers. This does not amount to judicial control.
<P>
8.26 In order to protect against arbitrary detention
<P>
(i) The maximum period of detention should be set out in statute.
<P>
(ii) There should be mandatory further judicial hearings every month at which the necessity for continued detention will need to be demonstrated.
<P>
(iii) Any breach, or potential breach, of recognizances should be dealt with by a court, not by immigration officers.
<H4><center>Further safeguards: legal advice and representation</center></H4>
<P>
8.27 The ability effectively to challenge the legality of detention and therefore enforce Article 5 rights will be dependent upon the availability of competent legal advice, which would need to be provided free if the detainee lacked means. The case of Aerts v Belgium makes it clear that the due process requirements of Article 6(1) ECHR are engaged when liberty is at issue, and that the ECtHR takes very seriously indeed states' responsibilities to provide publicly-funded legal services for those in detention.27 The UN Working Party Report sets out a requirement for `the appropriate provision of legal aid'28. At present, legal aid is not available for the hearings provided for in the Bill.
<P>
8.28 The Bill contains a power for the Secretary of State to provide funding to voluntary organisations to provide representation at such hearings `on such terms and subject to such conditions' as he may determine. However, it should be remembered that those powers will be subject to requirements under Article 6 ECHR in a way that the present section 23 powers are not (because matters of public law generally do not fall within the ambit of Article 6, whereas matters affecting liberty do).
<P>
8.29 Assuming that the Secretary of State is in some circumstances the only provider of public funds for representation, he will therefore have to ensure that competent legal advice and representation is available in the interests of justice. This is likely to involve ensuring representation for all those who lack the means to pay it themselves: which will include the majority of detainees, particularly asylum-seekers. The Secretary of State will be vulnerable to challenge by any such detainee unable to find representation. The courts may be particularly alert to the potential conflict of interest between the Secretary of State's role as the authoriser of detention and therefore the other side in proceedings, and his role as the provider of funds to ensure access to representation to challenge his own decisions.
<P>

<P>
27 see Aerts v Belgium, case no 61/1997/845/1051
<P>
28 op cit, para 29
<P>
8.30 It should also be noted that those organisations that the Secretary of State funds under clause 37 would not be able to represent in hearings in magistrates' courts, except through solicitors with practising certificates. Only practising lawyers have rights of audience before magistrates' courts. The Bill does not contain any provisions for extending those rights, except to those representing the Secretary of State. Furthermore, unless legal aid is available more widely, it is difficult to see how effective representation at detention hearings will be provided for those whose cases are being dealt with by solicitors in private practice, who will not have access to public funds for this purpose.
<P>
8.31 Effective access to courts under Article 6 ECHR requires the provision of competent legal advice, if necessary at public expense for those who lack means. The proposed arrangements may not be able to guarantee this. It would be preferable to have a single funding system, administered through legal aid, to provide representation where the interests of justice require it, and which would allow the existing representative, whether in private practice or a voluntary organisation, to appear, or arrange for representation, at detention hearings. This would involve amendments to the Access to Justice Bill presently before Parliament.
<H4><center>PART IV: APPEALS</center></H4>
<P>
9.1 This Part makes provision for a `one-stop' appeals procedure and for lodging appeals on 1951 Convention and ECHR grounds. The Schedules lay down certain requirements for the appeals process. It is welcome that the jurisdiction of adjudicators over human rights matters is set out in the Bill, as required by section 7(11) of the Human Rights Act. However, the present drafting of clauses 47, 48, 55 and 56 are not sufficiently precise for there to be confidence that the Bill meets the requirements of the ECHR and the Human Rights Act 1998. There are also questions as to whether, in practice, the provisions will enable the appellate system to exercise an effective human rights jurisdiction.
<H4><center>clauses 47 and 48 (Articles 3, 8 and other ECHR rights)</center></H4>
<P>
9.2 Clause 47 purports to provide an appeal on ECHR grounds, and to give adjudicators jurisdiction to provide a remedy for human rights breaches, by overturning decisions of the Home Office that conflict with ECHR requirements. It is also the only gateway to an appeal before removal for those threatened with removal from the UK as overstayers or illegal entrants. One of the Bill's most controversial provisions is to remove in-country appeal rights in general from overstayers.
<P>
9.3. The drafting of the clause 47 provision is, however, somewhat confused, and likely to provoke further litigation. It provides for appeals where it is alleged that the Home Office has `in taking any decision relating to that person's entitlement to enter or remain in the UK, acted in breach of his human rights'. First, it appears to give adjudicators a backward-looking jurisdiction, over a past decision, whereas the ECHR requires a forward-looking approach, which considers whether a future action, such as removal from the UK, will infringe human rights. Second, there are no `entitlements' to enter or remain in the UK, except for British and EEA nationals. Third, there is no explicit reference to the situation of overstayers and illegal entrants, who are not subject to a decision to enter or remain, but rather an administrative decision to remove. Finally, there is no reference to entry clearance officers who operate overseas but who are, like immigration officers, emanations of the Secretary of State and therefore bound by the Human Rights Act.
<P>
9.4 Clause 47 should be redrafted to clarify adjudicators' powers to overturn any administrative decision of the Secretary of State or his officers which would result in actions or consequences which would be in breach of an individual's human rights.
<P>
9.5 We deal in our other submission to the Committee with the problems of procedure and fairness that are raised by the proposal to remove deportation appeals as such. We note, in particular, the danger of overloading a new appellate jurisdiction&#151;the human rights jurisdiction&#151;with appeals for which it was not intended. We would also stress that the existence of a human rights obligation does not replace the obligation to act fairly and humanely in regard to individuals who have individual compassionate and humanitarian reasons for seeking to remain in the UK. The ECHR principles of proportionality and necessity are particularly appropriate for judging whether, in an individual case, those reasons outweigh the public interest in deportation. That is what the present immigration rule on deportation provides.
<P>
9.6 We consider that an immigration rule setting out the use of deportation or removal powers on humanitarian grounds is consistent with human rights principles, would complement the appellate jurisdiction on human rights, and ought to be retained.
<H4><center>Clause 56</center></H4>
<P>
9.7 Clause 56(4) and (6) contain provisions to prevent certain appeals being brought on asylum or human rights grounds. Clause 56(4) prevents appeals in relation to late asylum claims if the Secretary of State has certified that `in his opinion the claim for asylum was made solely for the purpose of delaying removal from the UK'. Clause 56(6) contains an even wider power to prevent any human rights appeal by certifying that `in his opinion the sole purpose of such an appeal would be to delay . . . removal from the UK'.
<P>
9.8 The ability of the Secretary of State to prevent appellate challenge to asylum or human rights decisions clearly raises questions in terms of the rights guaranteed by Article 33 1951 Convention, Article 3 ECHR and other ECHR rights (in particular the right to private and family life at Article 8). It is much more severe than the Secretary of State's other certification powers, dealt with below, which limit, rather than remove, appeal rights.
<P>
9.9 While there may be some need to restrict wholly frivolous or vexatious appeals, questions of whether a human rights challenge can be sustained should normally be matters for a court. In principle, therefore, the Secretary of State's certification should be a matter for the appellate jurisdiction to consider and uphold or reject; if not, it is in any event likely to result in judicial review proceedings. In addition, the power of certification given to the Secretary of State in the Bill is insufficiently precise to be defensible as an interference with human rights challenges. It should be reformulated to require grounds to be shown.
<P>
9.10 Certification under clause 56 should be subject to appeal. The grounds for certification should be amended to allow the Secretary of State to certify in such cases only if he has reason to believe that the claim is made solely to delay removal.
<H4><center>Schedule 4</center></H4>
<P>
9.11 Schedule 4(9) repeats the criteria, now in the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, whereby the Secretary of State can certify any asylum claim on a range of grounds, with the result that the claim is subject to fast-track procedures and there is no second-tier appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. The only change to the 1996 Act is that the ability to certify by reference to certain countries of origin (the so-called `White List') is removed.
<P>
9.12 Certification of a claim results in a speedier and less safe procedure. The risks of refoulement contrary to Article 33 1951 Convention, or removal contrary to Article 3 ECHR, and therefore increased. This risk was outlined in the case of Salah Ziar29 where the court held
<P>
`The question of the claim being certified may . . . affect an adjudicator's approach to the case as a whole and encourage a speedy resolution in circumstances in which speed and detailed thorough analysis are not always easy bedfellows . . . we think the certification may well affect the preparation of the appellant's case and the hearing before the adjudicator . . . Once it is established that the characterisation is wrong then it must follow that there is a serious possibility of serious disadvantage to the appellant because of the erroneous classification.'
<P>
9.13 Yet, as UNHCR points out, the criteria for certification are very broad, and go much wider than those claims that are frivolous, vexatious or manifestly abusive. They have been used, for example, in the case of Roma asylum-seekers later granted refugee status.
<P>
9.14 If certification is to be retained, in UNHCR's view, it should be related solely to claims in a narrow and precisely-defined band as defined by ExCom Resolution No 30 (1983) `those which are clearly fraudulent or not related to the criteria for the granting of refugee status as laid down in the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the status of refugees nor to any other criteria justifying the granting of asylum'. Any accelerated procedures must also comply with ExCom Conclusion No. 8 (1997), that there should be appropriate safeguards, including `a reasonable time to appeal for a formal reconsideration of the decision'.30
<P>
9.15 UNHCR notes also that the Bill contains no provision for certification and early recognition of manifestly well-founded claims, as proposed in the White Paper31.
<P>
9.16 Finally, the Bill, like the 1996 Asylum and Immigration Act, provides no in-country appeal for those whom it is proposed to remove to some `safe third countries'. The arguments against this have been well-rehearsed. The courts on judicial review have held, in some cases, that such removals can breach the UK's protection obligations. The assessment of the safety of a third country in relation to an individual applicant is something which needs to be tested in court before, not after, he or she is returned there.

9.17 The certification powers in Schedule 4(9) are too broad and risk interfering with Article 33 1951 Convention protection against refoulement. All those refused protection, whatever country they are to be returned to, should have an appeal before removal.
<H4><center>clause 60</center></H4>
<P>
9.18 Clause 60 contains the only power to provide public funds for representation at any appellate proceedings considering inter alia human rights and asylum claims. There is no alternative or parallel provision to provide legal aid for representation at such hearings, indeed the Access to Justice Bill presently before Parliament specifically excludes such proceedings from the funding powers of the proposed new Community Legal Service Fund. Legal aid funding can, however, be provided at present for advice on, and preparation of, appeals under the Green Form scheme; as well as for judicial review proceedings.
<P>
9.19 Matters of public law are not generally held to fall within Article 6 ECHR and its requirements for procedural guarantees, including legal representation. However, there are exceptions (such as detention and social security matters). The ECtHR's jurisprudence on Article 3 ECHR violations makes it clear how seriously it takes the right of access to courts32, and the necessity for effective judicial control in any case where a person risks being returned to face prohibited treatment under Article 3 ECHR33. This is likely to lead to further development of the minimum procedural guarantees needed to give effect to Article 3.
<P>
9.20 In other words, the incorporation of Article 3 ECHR into UK law may be presumed to have incorporated the means to provide an effective remedy for any violation. The right of appeal, and the ability properly to present a case at such an appeal, is critical to such remedies. Legal representation at such appeals will be particularly important in view of the Bill's requirement that an Article 3 ECHR or refugee claim may need to be formulated with speed and precision in a short period in the context of the `one-stop' appeal proposed in Clause 51. The availability of such advice will become a further issue, given the proposal to disperse asylum-seekers to areas where there may be a dearth of competent advice provision (see Part VI comments below).
<P>
9.21 It is known that, at present, the Secretary of State's funding powers under s.23 Immigration Act 1971 (which are exactly replicated in clause 60) are insufficient to provide representation to all those appealing refusals of asylum. They will now be required also to fund appeals against other human rights violations, and asylum appeals all over the country. If insufficient resources are available to provide competent advice in what will be a new, and is an increasingly complex, area of law, this will raise questions of Article 3 ECHR and Article 33 1951 Convention compliance.
<P>
9.22 Failure to provide effective legal representation to those without means in human rights matters, particularly those involving Article 3 ECHR protection, may prevent effective access to those rights. This should be considered in the context of the Access to Justice Bill and this Bill.

<H4><center>Part VI: SUPPORT FOR ASYLUM-SEEKERS</center></H4>
<P>
10.1 Part VI removes all residual support, by way of accommodation and living expenses, which may be provided to asylum-seekers under other legislative provisions. It then gives the Secretary of State the power (though not the duty) to provide `adequate' accommodation (on a no-choice basis) and `essential' support (largely on a no-cash basis) to those asylum-seekers who would otherwise be destitute. These provisions raise two kinds of human rights compliance questions:
<P>
the extent to which they may prevent asylum-seekers exercising their 1951 Convention or Article 3 ECHR rights and thus breach the prohibitions on return and refoulement
<P>
the extent to which the provisions, of themselves, may breach asylum-seekers' ECHR rights, or rights guaranteed under other international instruments.
<P>
10.2 The implications of Part VI for human rights compliance in general is dealt with in the detailed Note provided by Matthew Craven of the School of Oriental and African Studies34. That Note deals with the possibility of breaches of directly enforceable ECHR rights, as well as conflicts with the UK's obligations under other international instruments, which the government has ratified, and which the courts may use as aids to interpreting compliance with the ECHR.
<H4><center>Removal or refusal of support</center></H4>
<P>
10.3 Both questions arise in connection with those who are denied any support, or where support is removed, during the period in which they have a claim for protection which is still under consideration.
<P>
Risk of removal or refoulement in breach of Article 3 ECHR or Article 33 1951 Convention
<P>
10.4 Simon Brown LJ, in the JCWI case35, found that the removal of benefits from asylum-seekers whose appeals were still pending undermined their statutory right to claim refugee status. Waite LJ, agreeing, remarked that the removal of benefits from an asylum-seeker whose case had not yet been determined had the effect of `rendering their ostensible statutory right to a proper consideration of their claims in this country valueless in practice by making it not merely difficult but totally impossible for them to remain here to pursue those claims'.
<P>
10.5 These cases related to asylum-seekers whose cases were still live and who faced destitution without the provision of some state support. It is therefore clear that the English courts are likely to take a robust view of the extent to which removal or refusal of support may undermine or violate the UK's obligations to ensure that those in need of protection are able properly to put their claims.
<P>
10.6 The Bill provides for three situations in which this will arise. First, under clause 73(3), support is to be provided only until the determination of any appeal. The Process Manual36 states in terms (para 7.5) that `support will not be provided where Judicial Review is pursued'. Nor does it appear to contemplate support on an appeal from the Immigration Appeal Tribunal to the Court of Appeal. The only exceptions to this will be families with children. This is an invidious distinction. The protection needs of those with and without children are precisely the same.

<P>
36 Process manual for the Asylum Support System (Draft First Version), 17 February 1999
<P>
10.7 The removal of support (which the Process Manual declares should be terminated `quickly and effectively') will place those asylum-seekers in precisely the situation identified by the courts in the earlier cases: with a choice between destitution and abandoning a live claim for protection. It should be noted that both judicial review and Court of Appeal challenges require the leave of the court, which will only be granted in cases with some merit. Recent statistics37 show that one in four per cent of immigration judicial review cases which are granted leave result in a successful outcome for the appellant (and indeed that two out of five applications for judicial review in immigration cases have a favourable outcome for the applicant). By definition, therefore, the removal of support during that process will undermine the protection rights of some appellants.
<P>
10.8 Secondly, there is the position of those whom the Secretary of State does not consider to be sufficiently destitute and who are challenging that assessment through an Asylum Support Adjudicator. The Process Manual envisages that all those who appear to be destitute will be given emergency support while they submit a formal application for assessment. However, if the application is refused, and pending consideration of an appeal, emergency support will be withdrawn. There will be no legal aid for representation at such appeals.
<P>
10.9 The Bill requires the Secretary of State to make rules regulating such appeals in which he `must have regard to the desirability of securing, so far as is reasonably practicable, that appeals are brought and disposed of with the minimum of delay'. There is no statutory time limit, nor does the Process Manual give any indication of expected times to appeal. It must be assumed that some days, or even weeks, will elapse between a refusal of support and the determination of an appeal, particularly if an asylum-seeker has no legal representation and needs to define and submit grounds for appeal him or herself. During this period, it is envisaged that he or she will be evicted from accommodation and deprived of support. The same considerations as above therefore apply to those who are later shown to be destitute.
<P>
10.10 Thirdly, the Bill provides (clause 77(2)) that if a person is provided with accommodation under the scheme and leaves that accommodation, he or she will also lose support. Clause 77(4) contains the same provision for those who cease to reside at the address notified. Though Clause 77(6) gives the Secretary of State, by order, the power to disapply these subsections, there is no requirement that he do so if, for example, a person has left accommodation for reasonable cause and has notified the authorities of his or her new address. Given the consequences for those seeking protection in the UK, the Secretary of State's power to withdraw all support on a change of address should be statutorily circumscribed. There are also provisions (clause 74(9)) to withdraw support if prescribed conditions (not set out in statute) are not met.
<P>
10.11. It should also be noted that dispersal which prevents access to competent legal advice may be in breach of the procedural requirements of Article 3 ECHR (see para 9.20 et seq. above).

<H4><center>Risk of direct breach of Article 3, Article 8 and Article 2 ECHR rights</center></H4>
<P>
10.12 Removal of support also raises the question of the UK's own responsibility to secure Article 3 ECHR and Article 8 ECHR protection to those within its territory. In extreme cases, withdrawal of benefits could constitute inhuman or degrading treatment. In the case of D. v. United Kingdom38 it was found that the UK's decision to remove a person to St Kitts with the consequent deprivation of proper medical treatment for an HIV-related condition was a breach of Article 3 ECHR. The UK was clearly not responsible for the adequacy of medical facilities in St Kitts: but the decision to deport D. and therefore withdraw his present facilities constituted a breach.
<P>
10.13 By analogy, therefore, a decision to withdraw necessary support from asylum seekers and thereby expose them to the risk of destitution, poverty or disease, may itself breach the UK's Article 3 ECHR obligations. In the judgments referred to above, the judges were particularly emphatic, even in the absence of enforceable ECHR rights, about the standard of life that a civilised state should provide. Simon Brown LJ, for example, held that the withdrawal of all support `necessarily contemplates for some a life so destitute that to my mind no civilised nation can tolerate it. So basic are the human rights here at issue that it cannot be necessary to resort to the European Convention of Human Rights to take note of them'39. That argument will apply a fortiori, once the ECHR is domestically arguable. Collins J, in the Westminster Council and others case40 considered that if Parliament had intended to remove all assistance from the asylum-seekers who were lawfully here and could not lawfully be removed, `it would almost certainly put itself in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and of the Geneva Convention.' In extreme cases, the UK's obligations under Article 2 ECHR (right to life) may be engaged.
<P>
10.14 Eviction from accommodation raises further questions under Article 8, which protects the inviolability of one's home. Though this does not include a positive right to a home, it does incorporate the right not to be arbitrarily expelled or evicted from accommodation41. Home for ECHR purposes, includes any temporary dwelling42. In order to justify such action, it would have to be shown that such interference was necessary and proportionate. It may be possible to substantiate this in the context of someone being evicted with a view to deportation; but it would be hard to sustain a proportionality challenge in evicting someone with a live claim who is unable to obtain any alternative accommodation. Forcible evictions are also matters which the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights takes particularly seriously, and where states are under much greater legal and procedural obligations than in many areas of socio-economic rights43.
<P>
10.15 The provisions for removing, or refusing, support and accommodation to asylum-seekers who are destitute and whose protection claims are still not finally determined raise serious questions of compliance with the ECHR and the 1951 Convention. They create the risk of undermining the protection of Article 3 ECHR and Article 33 1951 Convention by forcing asylum-seekers to leave. They also create the risk of directly breaching Article 8, Article 3 and (in extreme cases) Article 2 of the ECHR. Those provisions should be deleted or amended. Support should not be withdrawn during the determination process other than for exceptional reasons or unless the asylum-seeker seeks to evade immigration control.

<P>
10.16 States are responsible for protecting the Convention rights of all those on their territory, irrespective of immigration or other status. Again, in view of previous judgments, the domestic courts are likely to examine with interest any claim that those rights have been violated in respect of persons seeking protection in the UK, some of whom will be refugees within the meaning of the 1951 Convention. The Convention (at Articles 21 and 23) requires states to provide the same access to benefits, housing and other social support as are available to their own nationals. The determination process does not create refugees, it merely recognises them as such.
<P>
10.17 Article 3 ECHR (prohibition of torture and of inhuman and degrading treatment) and Article 8 ECHR (protection of private and family life, and home) are likely to be the most important rights. In addition, if Article 8 ECHR rights are interfered with in a discriminatory way, there may be a breach of Article 14 ECHR (prevention of discrimination).
<P>
10.18 It is very difficult to assess with any precision whether the support arrangements proposed in the Bill will violate ECHR rights, for the following reasons
<P>
the Bill itself provides no enforceable minimum standards and no clear criteria for the provision of support; this is to be left to the Secretary of State to determine, by order. In some circumstances, however, the breadth and lack of definition of the order-making power may itself be in breach of Convention guarantees; in others it may permit such breaches within the regulations or their implementation.
<P>
human rights breaches may be cumulative, rather than immediate. In other words, arrangements which may be supportable if they are genuinely temporary may become breaches of private life, family life, or constitute degrading treatment or even a risk to life itself it they are maintained beyond a limited period. The arrangements in Part VI presuppose a determination system capable of delivering a definitive result within two to six months. Even within the upper limits of this period, there may be questions as to the acceptability and proportionality of some of the arrangements proposed; however, if, as on previous occassions, the determination system is unable to deliver an outcome, the likelihood of substantive breaches will become much greater.
<P>
the jurisprudence of the ECtHR, particularly in relation to Article 8 ECHR is developing very quickly; the concept of `private life', for example, includes conceps such as the dignity of the person and the right to be protected from health hazards. Moreover, qualified rights such as Article 8 are those where the ECtHR applies the greatest `margin of appreciation': the latitude that it allows to domestic courts and decision-makers to apply human rights principles in a manner that is consistent with national needs and practice. Following incorporation, the domestic courts will be able themselves to develop law on what is a necessary and proportionate interference with Article 8 ECHR rights. It is likely that there will be activity in the domestic courts in relation to housing generally and public authorities' duties of care and support. Parliament needs to be alert to possible breaches, and interpretations, which may not be apparent either from present domestic, or current Strasbourg, jurisprudence.
<P>
10.19 In those terms, some of the support and accommodation provisions are of particular concern. They ought also to be of concern to any local authority, or voluntary organisation, which is likely to be involved in the provision of support. Under the Human Rights Act, they may also be exposed to challenge if, as a result of their actions or failures to act, human rights breaches occur.
<P>
10.20 There are four elements in the Part VI proposals that raise particular questions of human rights compliance:
<P>
the circumstances in which no support at all will be provided (dealt with in paras 10.10-10.14 above)
<P>
the absence of minimum statutory standards
<P>
the provision of living needs solely, or mainly, in kind
<P>
the absence of choice as to housing
<H4><center>Standard of accommodation and support</center></H4>
<P>
10.21 The Bill contains no minimum standards for the provision of accommodation or support by the Secretary of State, or for the decision as to whether asylum-seekers' existing accommodation and support constitutes destitution and therefore engages the Secretary of State's support arrangements. It therefore replaces a range of statutory requirements as to fitness of accommodation, and the level of financial support necessary to support a reasonable standard of life. These are particularly relevant to vulnerable groups, such as children, the elderly and the chronically sick (which could include those traumatised by persecution).
<P>
10.22 By contrast, the Secretary of State has broad and unfettered powers to determine, in clause 74, whether a person already has `adequate accommodation or the means of obtaining it', or `cannot meet his essential living needs'. Under the former head, he is not allowed to take account of whether the accommodation is shared, whether there are any rights to occupy it, or where it is located. The latter head is left entirely to regulations to determine.
<P>
10.23 Similarly, in clause 75, if the Secretary of State takes responsibility for providing accommodation, it is to conform to a standard which `appears to the Secretary of State to be adequate', and other support provided is to consist of `what appear to the Secretary of State to be essential living needs'.
<P>
10.24 The particular problems of in-kind support and no-choice accommodation are dealt with separately below. But there is a general question of the provision of a standard of life which meets fundamental human rights obligations. It must be assumed that the Secretary of State does not intend to tie himself to the standards of homelessness provision required by Part VII of the Housing Act 1996. It is clear from clause 76(5) that he intends support to be at a lower level than that which would be provided under the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, `bearing in mind the temporary nature of such support'. By definition, therefore, he is differentiating between asylum-seekers' needs and requirements and the needs and requirements of others whose housing and support needs are provided by the state.
<P>
10.25 The Secretary of State cannot, of course, insulate himself against challenge under the Human Rights Act, and an regulations or orders he lays may be struck down or disapplied by the courts if they are held to breach ECHR requirements. In particular, he will be vulnerable to challenge, under Artice 8, Article 3 and Article 14 of the ECHR, if he imposes significantly lower standards which apply over a significant period of time to a specific group of people who have become, over passage of time, members of a community. This would be avoided if the Part VI provisions were of limited duration; in other words, if the determination process failed to meet its targets, the normal homelessness and benefits provisions would apply.
<P>
10.26 As the Bill is presently drafted, it is impossible to know whether its implementation will comply with human rights standards. It is essential that all delegated powers under this section are scrutinised in detail against the requirements of the Human Rights Act. We also suggest that the Bill should contain passporting provisions, whereby after a certain period, if the asylum application is not determined, the normally applicable statutory provisions for accommodation and supply will apply.
<H4><center>Support in kind</center></H4>
<P>
10.27 It is envisaged that support for asylum seekers will be based upon support in kind, even though it is recognised that this is more cumbersome to deliver and more expensive in unit cost44, the rationale being that it will deter economic migration. Support in kind raises questions under Article 8 ECHR, which requires states not only to avoid interfering with family life, but also to ensure `effective' respect for private and family life through positive measures. This includes `the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings'45. Asylum-seekers' ability to develop these normal social relationships will inevitably be affected if the are wholly, or largely, dependent upon vouchers. As Matthew Craven's Note says,
<P>
`they will be made permanently visible, stigmatised by their inability to use the normal mechanisms for exchange or purchase and enjoy many of the everyday prerogatives of community life. Their life will also be subject to a level of control quite out of the ordinary insofar as the number of institutions in which vouchers may be accpeted for exchange will undoubtedly be limited'.
<P>
10.28 The state may intervene in the enjoyment of Article 8 rights, but only if it can show that it is `necessary in a democratic society' to do so for one of a number of prescribed reasons, which include public safety or the economic well-being of the country, the prevention of disorder or crime, the protection of health and morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The ECtHR has established that states must show a `pressing social need' which is proportionate to the means employed. The government may find it difficult to meet this test of proportionality. It is acknowledged that in-kind support is more costly to provide and administer; the justification would therefore have to rest upon the aim of `reducing economic incentives to migration' which, as Craven points out, may not be sufficient in itself, particularly as it is unproven and indeed contradicted by some statistical evidence.

<P>
10.29 It is also possible that Article 14 considerations may arise, in particular cases, in respect of different treatment of different groups which cannot be justified. Craven also points out that the measure raises questions under the anti-discrimination provisions of the ICCPR and ICESCR, particularly as the move from cash payment to vouchers is a regressive one46; as well as the UK's responsibilities under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, given the minimal nature of support proposed.
<P>
 10.30 The proposals for support in kind raise the possibility that there will be breaches of Article 8, particularly read with the UK's other international human rights obligations, and may in practice raise questions of Article 14 compliance. Those risks will rise insofar as the regulations do not provide for flexibility and an adequate cash provision to allow asylum-seekers dignity and the possibility of normal social life; and also in relation to the time period during which dependence upon in-kind support is continued.
<H4><center>No-choice accommodation</center></H4>
<P>
10.31 Clause 76(2) of the Bill prevents the Secretary of State from taking account of asylum-seekers' preferences as to the location of accommodation, or on any other matters to be prescribed by him by Order. In the debate on Second Reading, the Home Secretary described this as being the same as the provisions which exist in respect of UK residents who are homeless. This is not, however, the case. While it is true that the Housing Act 1996 provides only one choice of homeless accommodation, the accommodation provided must be `suitable'. This has been held to imply both security of tenure and suitability to the homeless person's needs, with particular reference to location and family ties. The Department for the Environment (now DETR) has produced comprehensive guidance on such matters which the courts have repeatedly confirmed should be followed by local authorities. The Bill attempts to prevent such judicial scrutiny of asylum-seekers' accommodation offers by explicitly providing that this is a factor which may not be considered.
<P>
10.32 This will raise the same, or even stronger, Article 8 ECHR points as those set out above. The positive obligation upon states to ensure respect for family life includes the right to develop relations with others in one's social group and community. This does not, of course, mean an unfettered right to choose the location of accommodation. But it does require reasonable account to be taken of Article 8 ECHR considerations in any decision as to where and how accommodation is to be allocated. Once again, the risk of breaching Article 8 ECHR will increase, the longer normal social and community ties are displaced or disallowed. Matthew Craven also points out the conflict with Article 27 ICCPR, which protects the cultural and linguistic rights of minorities.
<P>
10.33. There is particular concern, in this regard, with the terms of clause 76. It seeks specifically to prevent the Secretary of State from taking account of any preference of the asylum-seeker as to location, or any other matters which he may later prescribe by order. Moreover, it gives him the unfettered power to amend, by order, those matters that he must, or may not, pay regard to in terms of accommodation. He may do so by negative resolution, without explicit parliamentary approval. These provisions, insofar as they result in any interference with ECHR rights, will raise questions as to whether they are sufficiently precise, or provide a sufficient legal basis, for such interference. The Home Secretary has stated, in Parliament, that he intends to provide accommodation, where possible in `clusters', presumably of national or family groups; but this is nowhere expressed, or provided for, in the Bill.
<P>
46 Craven, ibid. Section A
<P>
10.34 The exclusion of any element of choice, or any requirement that the Secretary of State have regard to reasonable preferences as to location or type of accommodation will be challengeable under Article 8 ECHR and other international instruments. Clause 76 should be amended to allow the Secretary of State, insofar as it is practicable, to have regard for reasonable preferences and to seek to locate asylum-seekers in family and community groups. The location and type of accommodation provided will also need to be reviewed if it results in social separation and exclusion which persists over a lengthy period.
<H4><center>PART VII: POWER TO ARREST AND SEARCH</center></H4>
<H4><center>clauses 104-117 (Article 8 ECHR)</center></H4>
<P>
11.1 This section gives to immigration officers powers of arrest, entry, search and seizure which can at present only be exercised by a police officer. Some of these powers are exercisable without a warrant, and therefore without prior judicial control. Prior judicial control is normally required where there is to be interference with Article 8 ECHR rights to privacy and the integrity of the person. This can only be dispensed with where it can be shown that it is necessary and proportionate.
<P>
11.2 Ben Emmerson and Jessica Simor give some preliminary views on the issues raised in their Note47. They point out that the interrelation of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) with this Bill and the ECHR raise complex questions which they have not had sufficient time to determine. However, they point to several troubling provisions in the Bill.
<P>
11.3 First, it should be noted that, under PACE, police powers of entry and search without a warrant are confined to cases where a person has been arrested for an `arrestable' offence. Section 24 of PACE defines this as an offence which attracts a maximum sentence of more than five years. The general balance struck under PACE is that search without warrant can only take place in respect of offences which reach a certain level of gravity. This fits within the idea of proportionality in Article 8 ECHR where interferences with privacy must be proportional to the seriousness of the harm that would otherwise occur.
<P>
11.4 However, the powers of arrest without warrant conferred in clause 104 of this Bill, which then provide concurrent powers of entry and search without warrant of the premises where the person was arrested, include the offence of harbouring and illegal entrant, which is a summary offence attracting a maximum level 5 fine, and the new offence of deception which, if tried on indictment, carries a maximum two-year prison sentence. The lack of judicial safeguards in relation to interferences with privacy by immigration officers in relation to less serious offences risks contravening the requirement that any interference with an individual's private life be necessary in a democratic society and proportionate.
<P>
11.5 Article 8 ECHR is intended to guarantee protection for the individual against arbitrary interferences by the State and abuses of executive power. It has been found to include a requirement that the exercise of power by the authorities be subject to `adequate and effective guarantees against abuse'.48 This has been held, for example, to prevent search and seizure by customs officers without judicial warrant.49
<P>
11.6 In the case of such powers exercised by the immigration service alone, the court might be expected to have regard to whether there was effective statutory or other control over the exercise of these powers. In terms of Article 8 ECHR infringements by the police, customs and security services, for example, the following have been relevant considerations:
<P>
whether these powers are exercised in compliance with a statutory or justiciable code or regulations
<P>
whether there is an effective and independent complaints procedure
<P>
whether there are clear, published and enforceable internal mechanisms of accountability.
<P>
The fact that these mechanisms do not exist at present in respect of immigration officers' powers will make them particularly vulnerable to challegne when they are exercised without formal prior judicial control.
<P>
11.7 The new powers for immigration officers will raise significant issues under Article 8. If they are to be enacted, they appear to require greater safeguards than at present exist.

<H4><center>SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE</center></H4>
<P>
1 JUSTICE has provided the Committee with a briefing on human rights compliance issues raised by the Bill. As the briefing says at para 2.1 it is not exhaustive. There are some questions of human rights compliance where we are awaiting more detailed advice and where we have not been able as yet to provide the Committee with a detailed examination and opinion. However, as some of them are likely to raise important human rights considerations, we thought that it might be useful to alert the Committee to them at this stage.
<P>
2 In clauses 11 and 12, we are seeking further advice on the privacy and data protection issues raised under Article 8 ECHR.
<P>
3 The provisions in Part V and Schedule 5 Immigration Advisers and Immigration Services Commissioner) may raise issues under Article 8 ECHR in terms of the privacy and confidentiality of information, particularly in relation to the power to enter and search premises in Schedule 5(6).
<P>
4 In Part VI, we have dealt only with general provisions of the Part in relation to human rights standards. We would particularly wish to draw the Committee's attention, however, to two other areas of concern in this Part.
<P>
the powers in clauses 101-103 to enter (forcibly if necessary) the accommodation being occupied by a asylum-seeker; and to obtain information from property owners and the postal service. These subject asylum-seekers to a degree of intrusion and surveillance which appears to raise strong Article 8 ECHR questions. Such interference with private life and home may not be able to be justified on grounds of proportionality and necessity, especially in view of the broad regulation-making powers given to the Secretary of State.
<P>
considerations under Article 6 ECHR relating to the appeals structure under this part, and in particular to the Secretary of State's broad power to make regulations, which include being able to determine the burden of proof and to give ancillary powers to adjudicators.
<P>
5 We aim to produce an appendix covering more detailed analysis of the issues raised for the Bill's clause by clause consideration, unless they have been covered by other witnesses.
<H4><center>EFFECTIVE DETERMINATION PROCEDURES</center></H4>
<H4><center>1 INTRODUCTION</center></H4>
<P>
1.1 In 1997, JUSTICE, the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association and the Asylum Rights Campaign produced a report, Providing protection, (copies of which have been made available to the Committee) which set out the principles of a fair and effective asylum determination system. Four main pillars of such a system were identified:
<P>
good, defensible initial decision-making:
<P>
access to accurate, independent and up-to-date background information on asylum-related issues;
<P>
a single comprehensive appeal which covers all the grounds relevant to whether a person should be entitled to remain in the UK; and
<P>
access to high quality legal advice and representation throughout the determination process.
<P>
1.2 Past history demonstrates that piecemeal reforms and measures to deter and prevent people from seeking asylum in the UK do not result in a fairer and more effective asylum determination system. Although we, and others have stressed the importance of creating an integrated determination system during consultation with Ministers and officials, we are concerned that the Bill does not appear to offer a coherent strategy for improving the effectiveness and fairness of the asylum determination system as a whole.
<P>
1.3 There has evidently been some detailed thinking about the way in which the new support arrangements will operate1. By contrast, it is clear that little has been done to tackle both the operational problems and the low quality of decision-making in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND). In addition, there appears to be no clarity about how some of the reforms to the appeals process, notably the one-stop appeal2, will work in practice.
<P>
This briefing concentrates on those aspects of the Bill that will need to be amended, dealt with in other legislation, or substantially developed if the government's aim, of providing a coherent, effective and fair procedure, is to be achieved.
<H4><center>2 INITIAL DECISION-MAKING</center></H4>
<P>
2.1 The Bill (and to a large extent the White Paper3) is silent on initial decision-making. Yet the workability of the support arrangements and the reforms to the appeals process contained in the Bill will depend upon the effectiveness of the initial determination system. There are several key areas where assurances should be sought from Ministers, or where amendments or enabling powers need to be inserted.
<P>
1 see the Draft First Version of the Process Manual for the Asylum Support System, 17 February 1999.
<P>
2 Clauses 55-58, Bill.
<P>
3 Fairer, faster, firmer&#151;A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum, July 1998.
<H4><center>The asylum interview</center></H4>
<P>
2.2 The asylum interview is the first substantive part of the process and is also the key to the effectiveness of the rest of the asylum determination process. If all relevant evidence is properly presented and interrogated at this point, it is less likely that new evidence will need to be considered later on in the process. It also means that early decisions can be reached in respect of claims which are clearly well-founded or without foundation. At present, there do not appear to be any clear plans about how and when the process of presenting and interrogating initial evidence will take place, although this could be incorporated within the structure of the new support process104.
<P>
2.3 An asylum seeker needs to be able to accesss good quality legal advice early in the determination process about both the asylum procedure and the merits of his/her case, to enable him/her properly to prepare for his/her asylum interview. Ideally, any information which is relevant to his/her case should then be provided to the IND in an asylum bundle, upon which the asylum interview could be based. This would cut down on the need for applicants to add information later in the process, either because they were unaware that it should have been raised in the first place, or for other, unscrupulous, reasons.
<P>
2.4 A notable omission from the Process Manual is any description of how the new support system will interrelate with the asylum seeker's preparation for the asylum interview. It is important that, whether the asylum interview takes place before or after dispersal, an asylum seeker is able properly to prepare for it. Those involved in developing the new support arrangements must recognise the need both for early specialist advice, and for continuity in advice provision after dispersal. Assistants105 should not be expected to give an asylum seeker anything other than initial, diagnostic advice before referring him/her to a specialist legal adviser. The creation of a duty legal adviser scheme, which could work alongside Assistants, would be the most effective way of ensuring early access to specialist advice.
<P>
Asylum seekers should be able to access independent legal advice while they are having their application for support considered. The most effective way to do so would be by way of a duty solicitor scheme. This should be recognised in the Process Manual, and if necessary enabling provision inserted in the Access to Justice Bill.
<H4><center>Initial decision-making</center></H4>
<P>
2.5 The proposals for reforming the initial decision-making process contained in the White Paper were limited to operational changes, such as the creation of integrated caseworking teams and the introduction of a new IT system, and a drive for increased openness in IND through the publication of caseworking instructions and the creation of user groups106.
<P>
2.6 Whilst we welcome the greater openness in the IND, it is now apparent that the operational changes have resulted in increased inefficiency. The reorganisation of caseworkers into integrated teams has coincided with an office relocation in Croydon, and a breakdown in systems for dealing with mail, telephone enquiries and file retrieval. These problems are exacerbated by the continued delay in introducing the new IT system, upon which the new integrated caseworking system depends.
<P>

105 For a description of their role, please see the Draft First Version of the Process Manual for the Asylum Support System, 17 February 1999, pp 16-20.
<P>
106 op cit, Chapter 7
<P>
There should be a thorough investigation of the situation in the caseworking section of the IND.
<H4><center>3 REFUSALS AND APPEALS</center></H4>
<P>
3.1 In principle, we support the proposal for a single, comprehensive appeal. However, it needs to be both effective and comprehensive. We are concerned that the present proposals may be neither. In order to become so, there is a need for
<P>
effective pre-appeal processes within the Immigration and Nationality Directorate
<P>
an appeal which is truly comprehensive
<P>
an effective second-tier Immigration Appeal Tribunal
<H4><center>Refusal decisions</center></H4>
<P>
3.2 An appeal that deals with a variety of issues is heavily reliant on the quality of initial decision-making. Such appeals will be even longer and more cumbersome unless those issues can be clarified and identified prior to appeal.
<P>
3.3 Refusal decisions should therefore clearly identify those facts which have been accepted and those which are still in dispute. There should be an opportunity to review those decisions if further information is provided, or if it can be shown that the decision was clearly mistaken, or ill-informed. This could be provided either by issuing first a draft refusal decision, subject to confirmation within a limited time, or by an internal review of refusals, following further representations. This, combined with a more effective use of the period between refusal and appeal for representatives and officials to limit and refine issues, would allow special adjudicators to concentrate on disputed issues. It would also allow decisions which had been based on mistakes or factual errors to be revised without the need for a formal appeal. It is essential that there is a designated Home Office official who retains responsibility for a file during the period between refusal and appeal. This would facilitate better case preparation by both the appellant and the Home Office presenting officer.
<P>
3.4 Clauses 48 and 55 of the Bill make such reforms particularly necessary. As presently drafted, a decision to remove, or a refusal decision would attract either an asylum or human rights appeal, or the opportunity to put additional grounds. There is no indication in the Bill as to how those would be dealt with, or any requirement that the Secretary of State make a determination of those issues. If they go to an appeal without such a determination, the appellate authorities will in effect need to make primary decisions, which will involve lengthy hearings on fact and law.
<P>
Refusal and removal decisions should be subject to review and further representations before proceeding to appeal. This is particularly necessary in view of the new issues that may be raised under clauses 48 and 55 of the Bill.
<H4><center>A comprehensive appeal</center></H4>
<P>
3.5 Secondly, such appeals must address all the issues relevant to a person's removal from the UK, and must cover all persons who have such issues to raise. The present proposals to not provide this.
<P>
3.6 First, it appears that appellants will not be able to raise individual compassionate circumstances, which are not set out in prescribed concessions or which narrowly fail to qualify for such concessions, but which may militate against their removal from the UK. It is essential that adjudicators are able to make decisions on all matters relevant to removal and that they have appropriate powers to do so. If this is not the case, such matters may return to the Home Office by way of further representations, or be raised in the Courts on judicial review.
<P>
3.7 Secondly, we are concerned that there are some groups of people who should have access to the one-stop appeal, but do not, as the Bill stands, fall within its remit. They include those who have never had access to the new appeal at all (because their applications were dealt with prior to its introduction), those who in error failed to make valid applications in time, and those who have remained in the UK for considerable periods, and whom it may be inhumane or impossible to remove. If these groups of people are not ``passported'' into the one-stop appeal, it is likely that they will seek to raise asylum or Article 3 European Convention on Human Rights grounds in order to secure an appeal. Instead, they should be given an appropriate and effective appeal on its own merits.
<P>
3.8 It is clear from past experience that restricting opportunities for appeal does not lead to fewer appeals: it merely results in the use of inappropriate appeal mechanisms, which become overloaded and lack appropriate jurisdiction. This was clearly shown in the 1988 Immigration Act. The restriction of deportation appeal rights led to the use of asylum appeals by those who had no other means of ventilating the reasons why they should remain in the UK. The wholesale removal of deportation appeal rights is likely to cause an even greater overload on the asylum and human rights jurisdiction of the adjudicators, and cases will take far longer to determine than if they were able to be adjudicated against clear criteria.
<P>
For that reason, we suggest:
<P>
(i) the provisions of clause 55(2) should be used to include within the `one-stop' appeal overstayers who will lose in-country appeal rights and will not otherwise have access to the new appeal.
<P>
(ii) clause 55(5)(c) should be amended to provide for humanitarian grounds against removal to be put, and these should be specified in an appropriate immigration rule.
<P>
(iii) there should be provisions to deem applications to have been made in time, if people narrowly miss application deadlines or fail to complete forms correctly.
<H4><center>The Immigration Appeals Tribunal</center></H4>
<P>
3.9 The aim of the proposals for reform of the Immigration Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) contained in the consultation paper on appeals7 was to create a more effective body, whose decisions would rarely need to be challenged by the higher Courts. However, the Bill's provisions relating to the Tribunal are unlikely to achieve this result.
<P>
7 Review of Appeals. A consultation paper, July 1998
<P>
3.10 We welcome the fact that only lawyers with seven years' practical experience will be able to become members of the Tribunal8. However, neither this, nor the appointment of a High Court judge as the next Chair of the Tribunal will, in themselves, be sufficient to increase its effectiveness. Seniority in the legal profession does not necessarily guarantee appropriate knowledge of asylum or human rights matters. The effectiveness of the Tribunal can only improve if members are required not only to have the requisite legal experience, but also asylum, immigration and human rights expertise. They also need improved administrative and research support. Improvements in the quality of decision-making earlier in the process would mean that only the most complex and important cases would fall to be determined by the Tribunal.
<P>
3.11 Decisions reached by single member Tribunals9 will inevitably not be as authoritative as decisions reached by three member Tribunals. We also understand that the Tribunal may move to dealing with many cases on the papers, rather than by way of oral hearing. This is unsafe: the present Tribunal has sometimes failed to grasp the importance of written evidence until it has been argued orally.
<P>
There should be no major changes to Tribunal procedures unless and until it is a more effective and authoritative source of precedent.
<P>
3.12 The decision to retain the Secretary of State's power to certify asylum claims as allegedly unfounded10 will mean that a large proportion of asylum appeals will still be subject to a fast track appeals procedure. Appellants with certified appeals cannot apply for leave to appeal to the Tribunal if the special adjudicator agrees with the certificate. Leaving large numbers of appellants outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction has two results: first, it undermines the Tribunal's ability to set consistent standards; and second, it increases the use of judicial review as the only way of challenging the special adjudicator's decision.
<P>
The power to certify under Schedule 4, paragraph 9 should be removed.
<P>
3.13 We oppose the imposition of financial penalties on appellants or representatives who continue to pursue an appeal which the Tribunal has decided is without merit11. We are concerned that the procedure whereby it is decided to declare a case as being without merit will be used as an alternative to the current leave procedure, and might be used as a way to cut off an appellant's ability to challenge a leave decision on judicial review. Present Tribunal decisions on leave do not encourage optimism that such decisions will be sustainable, and the threat of such penalties may deter appellants from exercising their appeal rights.
<P>
The power to impose financial penalties under clause 59 should be removed.
<H4><center>4 LEGAL ADVICE AND REPRESENTATION</center></H4>
<P>
4.1 Throughout this briefing, we have stressed the importance of competent legal advice and representation at all stages (see our recommendation for a duty solicitor scheme and our comments about the problems dispersal of asylum-seekers will raise).
<P>
8 Schedule 2, paragraph 1
<P>
9 Schedule 2, paragraph 6(3)
<P>
10 Schedule 4, paragraph 9
<P>
11 Clause 59
<P>
4.2 The Bill does contain a provision relating to the regulation of immigration advisers and representatives12. Although we welcome the decision to clamp down on poor quality and corrupt advisers, we are concerned that there are no plans either to improve the quality of advice or to ensure that proper legal advice and representation becomes an integral part of the asylum determination system.
<P>
4.3 We note, for example, that competent advice at the point of refusal will be essential if the government's own aim, that all arguable grounds are immediately raised, is to be met. Without such advice, appellants are unlikely to be able to identify and present such grounds, and are likely to have `reasonable grounds' (under clause 5(9)) for not being able to do so. The aim of a single decision-making and appellate process will be undermined if new and valid grounds are only discovered later. Furthermore, given the short space of time in which appellants will have to raise additional grounds, and the fundamental human rights and protection obligations raised by asylum cases, it is essential that asylum seekers should have access to good quality advice during this period.
<P>
4.4 In addition, we are concerned that there is still no coherent plan for funding advisers and representatives throughout the determination process. The consequence of the present split funding provision between the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor's Department makes it difficult or impossible for a single representative, firm or organisation to see a case through from beginning to end. This diminishes the quality of representation, and adds to its cost (as cases have to be re-prepared). We consider that the most efficient means of funding would be by way of legal aid, which should be made available for appeals representation.
<P>
The Lord Chancellor should take powers, under the Access to Justice Bill, to provide funding for asylum and immigration advice and representation, from initial advice to representation before all courts and tribunals.
<H4><center>5 DOCUMENTATION CENTRE</center></H4>
<P>
5.1 One of the critical elements in a better determination system, both at the initial decision-making and the appellate stage, is the ability to obtain up-to-date, accurate, high quality, objective information on the legal and factual background to an asylum claim. The availability of this information allows the decision-maker to concentrate on the facts of the claim and assists in making more effective and defensible decisions. Such information needs to be seen to be separate from either party in a case and it is therefore more effectively provided by an independent, specialist documentation centre.
<P>
5.2 The merits of an independent documentation centre were recognised unanimously in a joint working group of officials and NGOs which met at IND to discuss asylum documentation during 199813. The group recommended that a study to look at the feasibility of such a centre should be commissioned as a matter of priority14. We are disappointed that the Bill, as drafted, does not provide for a power which would enable the Secretary of State to establish an independent documentation centre.
<P>
The Bill should be amended to include a provision enabling the Secretary of State to establish an independent documentation centre.
<P>
Ministers should be urged to set up a feasibility study as a matter of priority.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. May I welcome you to this rather special and unique Committee stage? I would like first to thank you for the written evidence you have submitted. May I ask you to speak up when answering questions as the acoustics are not particularly good? For the record, will you begin by introducing yourselves and state the organisation from which you come? Is one of you acting as general spokesman or will you take it in turns?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hardwick </B>(Refugee Council): We will take it in turns. I am the Chief Executive of the Refugee Council, which is an umbrella body of refugee agencies and community organisations. We provide direct services to refugees and asylum seekers and we support other agencies in their work.
<P>
<B>Anne Owers </B>(Justice): I am the director of Justice, which is a legal human rights organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mick Chatwin </B>(Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants): I am the legal director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. We provide casework, advice work and training as well as information on immigration matters.
<P>
<B>Jan Shaw </B>(Amnesty International): I am Amnesty International's refugee officer.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): I welcome this important Government initiative to hear evidence on the detail of our Bill. We intend to listen carefully to that evidence and we have undertaken to consider it carefully with a view to seeing how we can improve the Bill.
<P>
I shall begin by asking Nick Hardwick of the Refugee Council about the statistics that he presents to show that cash is not a pull factor attracting people to claim asylum in Britain. He draws attention to the fact that of the people who claimed asylum in 1998, 49 per cent. claimed in country and 51 per cent. claimed at port. He will know that that is a dramatic change from the situation that existed in 1995 when 67 per cent., or two thirds of applicants, claimed in country and only one third claimed at port. The change came with the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, which withdrew benefits from those claiming in country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> I shall begin by saying that we, too, are grateful for the opportunity to come here and present our evidence. We are grateful that the Government have made this commitment to listen to our evidence, and to make changes if that seems appropriate. We welcome that.
<P>
I shall preface my remarks by saying, for the record, that we completely accept that not everyone who applies for asylum has a well-founded case. We all want to see a credible asylum system that fairly and speedily differentiates between poeple who have a well-founded or compelling humanitarian case to stay here, and those who do not. I imagine that that constitutes common ground between us.
<P>
In direct response to the Minister's point: as he knows, and as we have said repeatedly, we do not accept his assertion, and we do not accept one of the fundamental assumptions on which the support arrangements are based, which is that cash is a huge pull factor. The Minister has said that there was a very sharp drop in the number of people claiming asylum in country after the 1996 Act was introduced. The drop was from about two thirds of all applicants&#151;as he said&#151; to about half. I am not sure that that counts as the huge change that he has suggested.
<P>
The more compelling figure is that since 1996, the balance between in-country asylum applicants who are dependent on support-in-kind, and port applicants who get cash, has remained consistent at a 50:50 split or thereabouts. Numbers have bobbed up and down a little, but over that whole two-year period, the proportion of in-country and port applicants has remained constant. If, as the Minister says, cash was a huge incentive, I think one would expect to have seen a much bigger change than has acutually happened.
<P>
Another point is that, to compare the proposal that the Government are making with what occurred in 1996 is not a fair comparison. In 1996, the choice for asylum applicants was between a no-support system and a cash system. For people who applied in country in 1996, there was no support at all, but that will not be the case if the Government's proposals come to fruition. In that situation, there would be support-in-kind on offer, and there is no reason to think that the numbers will change from what they are at the moment.
<P>
My final point is that there are cash-based systems open to in-country applicants. As members of the Committee probably know, in Scotland, whether one applies at the port or in country, support is delivered by cash. Frankly, there has not been a mass stampede of asylum seekers up the A1 to get their hands on the cash benefits that the Government say are such an incentive. Our experience of the thousands and thousands of asylum seekers that we assist every year is that the real draw for people is to be near their families and friends where they feel secure and supported. Against that, whether we are talking about support in kind or cash, there is not enough evidence to support the Government's assertion or this whole system.
<P>
I should like to make one further point.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> May I interrupt you, Mr. Hardwick, because you simply have not answered my question? I asked you quite clearly how you would explain the move from two-thirds applying for asylum in country and one third at port in 1995, to approximately 50:50 in 1997 and 1998. Why did that happen? I hear your comments about Scotland but, frankly, most people do not enter the country through Scotland. Will you try answering the question&#151;why did that change happen?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> I think I have. I am sorry if you do not feel that I have answered the question: let me try again. First, the fall in 1996 was from two-thirds to a half, which I hardly think is the sort of scale on which to base this whole alternative support system. Secondly, if what you say is true&#151;that cash is such an important factor and people are making decisions based on it&#151;why has the split remained at 50:50 for the last two years?
<P>
Finally, for those people who can make a choice, if the options open to them are a no-support system and a cash system, then that may account for some of the moves that occurred in 1996. That is not what the Government have on offer in the proposals, which amount to a support-in-kind system versus a cash system, and there is no evidence to support the view that people will make the behavioural changes that the Government are suggesting.
<P>
<B>Ms Diane Abbott </B>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington): Thank you very much for coming to give evidence and I hope that it does not feel too much like the Nuremberg tribunal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> Only a bit.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I wanted to ask you first whether the Refugee Council is in favour of the forced dispersal of asylum seekers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> No, we are not in favour of forced dispersal of asylum seekers.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> That is interesting, as we were given to understand that you were.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> We are not in favour of forced dispersal without any choice being offered to asylum seekers. We recognise the pressure that concentrations of asylum seekers have created in some areas, but it does not follow that we should move from that into a system that offers no choice at all. We do not accept that that is necessary.
<P>
Dispersing people has been tried before and every time it has been tried, it fails. To avoid the same kind of problems that occurred in the past, you need to do two things&#151;to settle people in clusters where they can get support from their communities and to ensure that support is provided for community organisations so that people can turn to others in their own community, providing not just the physical support but the moral support that they need to make it work.
<P>
Our worry about the Government's proposals is that they are based on the assumption that they will meet the aspiration of a six months' time target. I would like to say a few words about that. The plan is that initial decisions will be made in two months and appeals will be dealt with in four months. There is simply no evidence to support the view that the Government are going to be successful in that.
<P>
In 1998 the backlog rose by 13,000. It was not just that progress was slow; the system went in the other direction. If you look now at the current chaos in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate in the Home Office, there are two and a half miles of shelving of unresolved cases. Some have been there so long that they have to be fumigated to prevent mice from eating them. There are fights outside the immigration offices daily involving not people who want to come into the country, but those who want to go out of it, but cannot because their passports are stuck in some crate inside the immigration offices.
<P>
The Government then turn round and say, ``Do not worry; this is just a temporary hitch caused by our attempt to move offices.'' If that is the result of moving 1,000 civil servants half a mile down the road from one office to another, it defies credibility for the Government to say that they can ship 30,000 people all around the country without any problems. The fact is that successive Governments, with every asylum Act, have said: ``Do not worry; we shall sort this out and cut the decision-making time.'' They have never achieved it.
<P>
We should like the 200 additional staff, who will be employed simply to administer the new system, to be put to clearing the two and a half miles of shelves and making speedy decisions. They could get through 40,000 cases a year. That is the real answer. Put the resources, energy and thought into making fair and fast decisions&#151;not into mucking about setting up the parallel support system.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Thank you for making the point about the likelihood of hitting the six-month target, of which some Members of Parliament will be putting to Ministers later.
<P>
In your submission you say,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is a real danger that the new system will be as chaotic as the existing support mechanism and that asylum seekers will become more and more socially excluded.''<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> Our basic proposition is that we do not believe the Government will meet their time targets. Consequently, if, as seems likely, people are in the support system for a year rather than six months&#151;it is 22 months at the moment&#151;the costs will be twice as much. It costs twice as much to support people for a year as to support them for six months. The Home Office will then have the Treasury on its back. There will be pressure to cut corners and do things as cheaply as possible. Although the Government may come out now with fine words about how they will try to put people in clusters and make sure that there is support for them, we think that that is dangerous on the back of a failing system.
<P>
We know of lots of examples of individual asylum seekers being put on their own in places like Devon, or in monocultural areas where they will face racism and humiliation. If one adds to the problem of dispersal the stigmatising and humiliating effect of offering vouchers, that is a real recipe for disaster. In those places everybody will know that certain families are asylum seekers and refugees. They will use the special asylum-seeker and refugee currency&#151;the vouchers that the Government are going to introduce because they are not to be trusted. They will not be able to move out of the areas in which they are put. They will be trapped in those areas because they will not have the money for a bus fare. They will be able to move away only as far as they can walk. Their children, as we know, will not get into local schools. The young men will have nothing to do all day. We will see the same kind of stuff as we have seen time and time again in local papers in past months&#151;that these people are the sewage of Europe, who have come to pollute the locality. The sorts of attacks and harassment that are now happening will be repeated. The Government, on the basis of a completely unproven hypothesis, are taking a huge risk, and we will have to face the consequences of that for years to come.
<P>
I want a credible asylum system. I think that it needs to be sorted out, but from our experience at the Refugee Council of dealing with thousands of people a year, and from my experience of working at Centrepoint with the homeless, it is possible to look at the proposal and see that it bases a huge support system on unsustainable theories about how people will behave. If it all goes horribly wrong, as we suspect it will, the social consequences not just for asylum seekers but for the whole community will be deep and fracturing for a long time to come.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): Deterrence is crucial, but other factors come into play. Has the number of in-country applicants changed from before the support arrangements were introduced?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> I do not have the absolute figures to hand without scurrying through my files, but our key point is that the proportion has remained consistent. Our figures are taken from those provided by the Home Office. I have the printouts here. They are the Home Office figures. Every year the proportions have stayed the same&#151;50:50. That simply does not support the argument that cash is a huge draw and that if you withdraw it all the ``bogus applicants'' will go away. There simply is not the evidence to support that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Your contention is that if we continue with a benefit system or a support-in-kind system it will make virtually no difference to the number of applicants, but what would make a difference is the time taken to deliver the decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> Absolutely. If you accept, as we do, that there are people who make unfounded claims, the best possible deterrent to someone making an unfounded claim is the knowledge that a fast and fair decision will be made on the case and that that decision will be enforced. That is the best answer to unfounded claims. It is also the best answer to people who have a good claim for protection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Finally, if the system goes ahead in spite of opposition to it, do you feel that it would improve the Bill to have a fixed cut-off period for the temporary arrangements, at which point benefits would kick back in, say at the time when we expect people to have their claims determined under the Government's proposals?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> That would be an improvement. We would rather not have the system at all. It seems self-evident that fast and fair decisions will be the most effective deterrent to unfounded claims. If that is the case, you have to ask why the Government are going to all this expense, energy and thought in setting up this parallel system. I think the answer is that I have yet to find a single person in the Home Office or any other Government Department, apart from Ministers, who believes that the six-month target can be met.
<P>
Some of you will have heard us talk about a culture of disbelief within the Home Office. Having worked in the field for two or three years, a more worrying thought is that there is a culture of failure. Officials do not believe that they can make quick decisions and enforce them. Therefore, they have had to fall back on making life sufficiently unpleasant for people that they will no longer want to come. The support system is an attempt to manage failure.
<P>
I hope that the Committee offers an opportunity to give the Government a message: you can make it work if you put the same energy and resources into making faster, quick decisions. That will produce a credible system and deter unfounded applications and it will be in the best interests of refugees. I say to the Government, it is not too late to change your mind. This should not be some kind of test of strength. If you look at the evidence, it simply does not support the Government's contention. We all want a credible asylum system. This is not the way to do it.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I have listened with great interest to your evidence so far. We could all construct theories as to how things came about, but what is beyond peradventure is the great pressure on our system from the number of applicants. There was a large number last year. The system faces that pressure and it is a difficult area of policy. As you said at the beginning, many or the majority of asylum claims turn out to be unfounded, but some are founded and some people are genuinely fleeing persecution.
<P>
I should like to ask you a little bit more about the system of dispersal and how it will work. You have made some interesting comments based on your experience. One feature of the proposed system is that it involves not just dispersal but, as we said earlier, forced dispersal. It will be driven by the availability of accommodation. That is the factor to which the Secretary of State must have regard in the Bill. Could you say a little more about how you think it might work in practice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> May I just correct one thing? I do not think that I said that the majority of claims are unfounded; I said that some are. That is important because a misapprehension remains, and in the past we have had arguments with Ministers about statistics. In 1998, 35 per cent. of all claims on which a substantive decision was made resulted in people being given either refugee status or exceptional leave to remain. Of those who subsequently appealed, 11 per cent. were successful. Those figures apply to people who will be in the support system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Fair enough. I am quite happy to take it that there is a mixture; that some appeals are valid and some invalid. It is the dispersal that particularly interests me.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> The real worry is that because financial pressures will be created on account of the Government not meeting their time targets, other aspects that they look at in addition to availability of accommodation might go by the board. We do not want people to be dispersed, but if it happens, it must be dispersal to multicultural areas where some support services such as language help and the other things that people need in order to survive are available, and this may need to be stated. Such people need community organisations for the support that they give. We need to talk to a refugee or an asylum seeker, but most of them do not come to us or anyone else first; they go to their own community. That is where they look for support: it has been the tradition for people coming to this country for ages. It simply is not there outside London, so it must be created in some way. We are, as you say, worried about people being forced onto the sink estates where property is available simply because of unemployment and other aspects of social exclusion. If large numbers of penniless, humiliated asylum seekers arrive there, that will not only be bad for them as individuals, it will knock those areas into an even faster spiral of decline. There is a real danger of that happening. At present, all that is written into legislation is that the Home Secretary has to take account of where accommodation is available. That will not be sufficient to avoid the situation going rapidly downhill when the financial pressures begin to bite. A statement must be written into primary legislation that some of the other issues need to be taken into account. There must be a more rigorous set of criteria for the Home Secretary to have to consider in deciding where people should be placed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before calling the next question, may I ask whether any other witness has anything to say on the subject?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> There are some points that we made in our submission regarding the possible human rights implications of support arrangements which the Committee may wish me to comment on.
<P>
When we considered the Bill from the viewpoint of the Human Rights Act 1998, we identified two matters of concern. The first concerns the drafting of the Bill: there might be problems with human rights compliance in relation to people with protection claims that are still ``live''&#151;still being considered by a court under judicial review, still under consideration by the Home Office, or at appeal&#151;where support arrangements are unavailable. The Bill proposes to withdraw support arrangements from people whose claims are going to judicial review, and there are circumstances during consideration of claims when support could be withdrawn. We see that perhaps creating a double whammy in terms of the European convention on human rights in the sense that if people were destitute and forced to abandon their claims and return to a country where they first faced persecution, or inhuman or degrading treatment, there would be a breach of this country's human rights obligations. Similarly, if they faced such treatment here because they were destitute, that would also be a breach. The courts took a pretty robust view of that under the previous Government's arrangements and I have no reason to suppose that they would not do so under these.
<P>
The second point relates to Nick Hardwick's comment about how long the arrangements continue. Although it is unlikely that there would be an immediate breach, we remain concerned. If the arrangements were to carry on for some months, there would be a real risk of breaches of article 8&#151;the right to a private life, which means not just that you have privacy in your life, but that you have dignity of life and the ability to construct normal, social relationships within your community. You are not therefore socially excluded.
<P>
Issues such as no-choice accommodation, which may not be where your community or your friends are; living without cash, which immediately singles you out from everybody else; the standard at which support is provided and the extent to which it is substantially different from that given to other people that the state supports, which raises discrimination issues; while they may not create immediate human rights issues, will begin to do so if these arrangements last for a lengthy period. That goes back to an earlier point about whether it may be necessary to have a fall-back arrangement which kicks in at some period when these arrangements are clearly not temporary, but continue for a considerable time.

<P>

<B>Jan Shaw:</B> I want to raise something on which the Bill is silent. It is in connection with support arrangements, particularly for those asylum seekers who are forcibly dispersed around the country. Most of the access to legal advice and representation is concentrated in the south east of the country. When the legal aid consultation process took place last year, the consultation paper stated that most of the quality advice and representation, access to law firms and legal representation is located around London and the south east. So the worry is that when people are dispersed to different parts of the country, particularly in a support system which is almost cashless, early access to legal advice and representation, which is something that we would advocate, will not be available. Asylum seekers should have assistance in stating their claims for asylum, in actually setting them out and in being legally represented. There is absolutely nothing in the Bill that guarantees access to advice and representation to people who will be sent out to the regions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall </B>(Bedford): I want to explore the matter of dispersal and the location and accommodation of asylum seekers with Mr. Hardwick and with anyone else who wants to comment.
<P>
I take on board what has been said about the advantages of the current system, but surely there must be some attempt to relieve the pressure on local authorities in London and the south east, especially their social services departments, in dealing with the existing voucher system. What do the Refugee Council and others suggest would relieve that pressure?
<P>
If I am wrong I hope he will correct me, but Mr. Hardwick seemed to say that if dispersal were to take place it should be to other big cities where there is an existing ethnic minority population. I do not follow that argument because most members of established ethnic minority communities in this country are British citizens who were born here. Asylum seekers may come from anywhere in the world, not necessarily the Indian sub-continent, for example. Why should it be assumed that established ethnic communities in this country would have any particular relationship with asylum seekers who could be from anywhere in the world and could offer them help and support? I should be interested in Mr. Hardwick's response to those two points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> I accept that local authorities have been under enormous pressure because of the current arrangements. For the most part, they have dealt with matters extremely well, but the pressure is being created in large part not because the asylum seekers happen to live in a particular area, but because the local social services department has to make arrangements for their support when, frankly, the social services department has better things to do. That is where the real pressure originated and it is worth remembering if you look at where pressure on local authorities has occurred. We warned at the time that the proposals in the 1996 Act would lead to chaos. Nobody took any notice of what we said and local authorities were left to pick up the tab. In such situations, unforeseen problems will be created, unless great care is taken. You can bet your bottom dollar that local authorities will be in the firing line again.
<P>
Social services' duty to provide support under the National Assistance Act 1948 and the Children Act 1989 creates more pressure than people in particular areas. The other day a councillor from Dover told me that large numbers of people had settled in his ward; he said that there were too many people in a concentrated area. That argument must be acknowledged.
<P>
However, it does not follow that one can tell people: ``Look, it is not feasible for you to stay here''. That gives people no choice about where to go. Someone who is told that they cannot stay in Dover might have an aunt or relative in Liverpool or Birmingham. However, that will be excluded from consideration. It does not follow that people who are told that they cannot live in a certain place should be told that they have no choice about where else they might go.
<P>
Why should people be in multiracial areas? Talking to refugees and asylum seekers, I have learned how frightened they are about the arrangements. They are partly frightened that they will be put in monocultural areas in which they will be the first migrants to settle. They are worried about racism in those areas and how that will affect them. They would feel safer in multicultural areas, in which there are support services, such as interpreting services, along with the expertise that people need to deal with new arrival.
<P>
Let us consider the simple matter of schools. In some areas, local schools do an excellent job because they have built up the resources, skills and procedures needed for children from another country who may not speak the language, along with the issues that go with that. That expertise exists, and not only in London. However, putting a person in a Devon village which has not dealt with such issues before is a recipe for disaster.
<P>
So it is not simply a matter of support from pre-existing communities. It is also matter of recognising where a local infrastructure is likely to have developed which will meet people's needs, and where they will feel safe and secure. At the moment they are frightened.
<P>
<B>Dr. Stephen Ladyman </B>(South Thanet): Mr. Hardwick spoke about the impracticality of dispersal, comparing it with the alleged mess that the Government have got into with an office move. He mentioned Dover, so he has obviously visited east Kent. My experience is that many refugees living in Thanet did not come throught the port of Dover, but were dispersed there by the private sector, which took such action for profit. If it is practical for the private sector to disperse large numbers of people, why is it not practical for the Government to do so also?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> I doubt whether the private sector is able to do that.
<P>
I do not wish to over-egg the pudding. Our research&#151;which has been sent to Committee members&#151;shows that many refugees who have been dispersed are happy where they are. We certainly do not wish to argue that London is the only place for refugees. Traditionally, we have let things find their own level, and people have had some autonomy in making their own choices.
<P>
Ministers and their officials are open to discussion about the logistics of setting up and running a huge operation from scratch. Asking whether it is credible to set up the systems needed to do that means that track records must be examined. It must be asked, ``Can this outfit do it?'' I have to say, with the best will in the world, that I do not think that they can. I think that it is going to be a mess. It is not even a question of the motivation behind this. I just do not think that, with their track record, they will be able to deliver.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mile Hall </B>(Weaver Vale): Mr. Hardwick, tell me whether I have misunderstood you. Are you saying that money is not the incentive for people seeking asylum to come to the United Kingdom&#151;that that is not an issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> It is not an incentive to the degree that the Government say that it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> Let us be straightforward. Is it an issue or not? I am clear in my own mind, but are you saying that it is an issue or that it is not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> I think that it may be an issue. Realistically, it must be an issue for a very small number of people. That would account for the small shift in behaviour that happened. However, for the vast majority of asylum seekers, I do not believe that is is an issue. I think that people make choices for the same reason that you or I would make a choice if we ended up in a strange country knowing no one. The overall drive for people is to be near someone they know, who eats the same food, who speaks the same language and has been through the same experience. I think that, compared with that, the drive of cash is minute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> I do not want to put words into your mouth, but are you saying that it is an issue, but not a significant issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> I am saying that it is a very minor issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> On a different tangent, you said that local authorities were being asked to provide support for asylum seekers, and that it was not the numbers of asylum seekers that caused the problem. Do you have a tolerance factor, because we know that we get about 46,000 asylum seekers each year? At what point would you see that becoming a position that was very difficult to accommodate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> I do not have a threshold. I am not sure that I would agree with the assertion behind your question, as I understand it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> I did not make any assertions. I asked you whether there was a tolerance factor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> I am not sure that I agree with the assumption. I do not think that the number of refugees, in itself, creates the kind of pressures that you suggest. In time, things find their own level. The question is whether there is a system set up, or whether the arrangements for supporting these people are adequate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> Local authorities do not accept that, do they? They have a finite supply of houses. There are problems in Dover and there are certainly problems in London. There is a possibility that there is accommodation elsewhere that could work under more flexible arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> There is certainly a problem if local authorities have to arrange accommodation for people, because there will be a limit to what they can achieve. The advantage under a benefits-based system, a cash-based system, is that the asylum seekers have to make their own arrangements. The local authority does not have to provide accommodation&#151;apart from for families that are homeless&#151;and if people are making their own arrangements, things find their own level. I do not think one can set a target that says, ``This number is okay, that number is not.'' It will depend on local circumstances.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hall:</B> So you do not accept the line given by some local authorities, that it does cause problems for their area?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> All that local authorities have said to me is that their responsibilities under the National Assistance Act 1948 and the Children Act 1989 cause them huge problems. I have worked closely with local authorities, and I have not heard them say that the numbers per se would be a problem, if they did not have those other obligations to support them. Before the National Assistance Act came into force&#151;if we go back to the early 1990s, when the numbers were perhaps comparable&#151;large numbers of asylum seekers were still arriving in particular areas, but because local authorities did not have those other responsibilities they got on with it, and on the whole did a very good job. What I have heard local authorities say is that the obligations under the National Assistance Act and the Children Act are the issue, not the numbers per se.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I appreciate that this is a very important part of the Bill, and that people have a great interest in it, but I have three other Members who wish to ask questions, so we shall move on to another area.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): Thank you, Mr. Maxton. I apologise for having to step out just when you were going to call me previously.
<P>
There is little doubt that some of the provisions of the Bill can be described only as draconian. The question is whether the waves of immigration that we have been experiencing justify them. I was interested by Mr. Hardwick's statistics, which, if accurate, were very important. If I understood him correctly, he said that of cases that were resolved, 35 per cent. of the immigrants were found at the first attempt to be geniune and an additional 11 per cent. on appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> May I explain that? The figures need care and I tried to choose my words carefully. First, I said that, of substantive decisions, 35 per cent. resulted in either refugee status or exceptional leave to remain. I do not include cases that were not brought to completion or were dealt with under third country provisions. Substantive decisions are relevant, because they concern the people who will be in the new support system.
<P>
I also mentioned 11 per cent. of people who went on to appeal&#151;which not everyone does&#151;in 1998. It is not a simple adding up job, but I think a figure of about 40 per cent. overall would be right.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I want to put a simple question on a matter of fact, particularly to you and Mr. Chatwin&#151;but Jan Shaw and Anne Owers may also have figures at their disposal. What studies have your organisations done over, say, a five-year period, to suggest what percentage, roughly speaking, of would-be immigrants are found to be genuine or bogus? I am sure that the reason for some of the draconian provisions of the Bill is a widely held perception that about nine out of 10 asylum seekers are found to be bogus. Is that, from your point of view, a complete misunderstanding?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> Yes. The biggest problem that we are up against is the idea that there is a tiny number of genuine applicants and that the rest are all bogus. The figures show that in the 1980s about 80 per cent., I think, were recognised. Then the figure went the other way and only about 20 per cent. were eventually recognised. Now the numbers have risen. I think, to be fair, that there are complex reasons for the rise in numbers. It depends on where people come from. At the moment, many decisions are being made on people from Kosovo and Somalia, where there is a high recognition rate. That accounts for some of the rise.
<P>
A profoundly mistaken idea is that in any case there is one group&#151;however big&#151;of genuine applicants and another of bogus ones, and that the bogus ones are here purely to exploit the system. I think, in truth, that there is a spectrum of people who apply. Of the ones who are rejected, some will just not be suffering the right form of persecution. Others might be more like a family whom I met, and who were mentioned in The Observer. They were a Roma family from central Europe. They had been returned. They made no bones about the fact that they were economic migrants. However, the woman's explanation was that back in Romania she had five children, and four had died. She came to Britain because she thought her fifth remaining child might live here. She was sent back. To make a leap from such examples to the attitude that these people are all here to rip off the system is mistaken. However, I acknowledge that there are abusive claims, by people who come here for a short time, plan to work, and get sent back. I understand that, but there is a spectrum, and while people like that Roma family wait for a speedy decision&#151;these are some of the most wretched people on earth&#151;we can treat them in a humane and dignified way.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> Mr. Chatwin, do you take the 40:60 figure as a rough guide?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chatwin:</B> I certainly would not take it as a guide of any sort if it means that 60 per cent. of those who seek asylum in this country are bogus. Part of the difficulty in recent years has been a tendency to equate all those who fail in an application for asylum with bogus applicants and to assume that everyone who makes an application that is not granted is somehow out to abuse the system or rip off this country.
<P>
That does not follow by any means. Certainly, a good many people who go through to appeal their cases may end up with what amounts to a near miss in one way or another. It is also certainly the case that by reference to the nationalities of people seeking asylum in this country, you could establish that a high proportion of those whom we have represented are Turkish Kurds. A good many of those will fail their initial applications, but that does not mean that they have no grounds for seeking asylum in this country.
<P>
Every one of those cases&#151;certainly every one that we have been involved with&#151;has had very good reasons for wanting to seek asylum in this country; none the less, many were judged as not having sufficiently strong cases. Sometimes the circumstances at the end of the process have changed. After three years waiting for the Home Office to make a decision and another year and half to get through an appeal, the initial circumstances that led people to seek asylum might have changed, five years down the line, and the initial fears expressed when people came into the country might have been calmed by the mere fact that they have effectively had a form of unregulated status for those five years.
<P>
Branding all those people as bogus from the outset does nobody a service. It certainly does not do a service to people in the Home Office who are trying to cope with these cases. We end up creating a presumption that the great majority of people are over here simply to rip the country off. That is by no means the case.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> Finally, if we ageed to drop the word ``bogus'', would you accept that there is still a difference between people who want to come here genuinely for a better life&#151;not to rip off the system&#151;and people who should be granted political asylum because their lives are at risk from persecution? Is that not a valid distinction?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chatwin:</B> If we start by dropping the word bogus, we can certainly get somewhere. We can have a more useful discussion if we leave out the most emotive terms. That is certainly a step forward, but it all depends on what you mean by having a better life.
<P>
The Under-Secretary referred to his own family as economic migrants and saw nothing shameful in that. The problem is that we are now criminalising people who are seeking to come into this country for whatever purpose. We are turning them into criminals in that everything we do to the system is intended to make it impossible for people to get here other than by unlawful means. The difficulty then is that if some are allowed through, those who are not allowed through all become criminals and end up being treated by systems which are designed to deal with people who have committed offences. That should not be the case.
<P>
It would have been possible to say&#151;and no doubt was said at the time&#151;that many of the Jews who fled pogroms in eastern Europe and then fled the Nazi terror were coming here for a better life. Indeed, it is an easy parallel to draw&#151;it all depends on the terms that you adopt. What is clear is that the terms of the 1951 refugee convention are express and relatively narrow, and that many of the people who wish to come to this country and who may appear on moral grounds to have good cause to do so will nonetheless fall short of the rigorous standards that the convention applies.
<P>
<B>Ms Oona King </B>(Bethnal Green and Bow): The last line of questioning by Dr. Lewis was helpful and instructive. We need to consider how damaging it is to continue to talk about bogus claims&#151;though there are, of course, some abuses.
<P>
I want to ask more about dispersal, but I preface that by asking about economic migrants. The law says that if the state in a migrant's country puts his life at risk, we have a duty to show compassion and offer him asylum. If economic circumstances put a person's life at risk we are not willing to do anything. That, unfortunately, is the situation.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As Member of Parliament for Tower Hamlets and a Hackney resident I want to look at dispersal constructively. There are 46,000 asylum seekers last year. Local authorities are under massive pressure. I would like to hear what constructive alternatives might be possible. As someone born in Sheffield I believe it is possible for areas outside London to try to offer what the Government are suggesting. If the Government are right&#151;obviously I hope and believe that they are&#151;and will get it down to under six months, all is well and good. If you are correct and the Government are wrong, piling asylum seekers into London will be a catastrophe. In those circumstances what can you constructively suggest?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> First, as you have acknowledged, one of the keys to taking the pressure off local authorities is to make fast decisions. If you do that, there are not so many asylum seekers waiting for a decision. That is very important, as is removing authorities' responsibilities under the National Assistance Act. I certainly will not argue that the only place an asylum seeker or a refugee can be is London. The evidence we have is that a number of people have been settled successfully in other places.
<P>
There are two points to make. The first is the degree of choice that people have. I do not understand why it is necessary for the Government to jump from saying that people can more or less choose where they are going to saying that they can have no choice at all. Why cannot people have options? Why cannot people express some preference?
<P>
<B>Ms King:</B> But this is in relation to receiving housing from the state. All my constituents have the same option when they are homeless. I might wish that they had three choices like other people on the housing list, but homeless people in Britain are given one choice. Are you saying that we should put these people in a better position than our other constituents?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> No, I am not saying that. There is a difference between saying that someone cannot have a choice of accommodation in a particular area and saying that they will be sent off around the country. That is my objection.
<P>
May I make two other points? If this is to be done, there are two critical bits. I suppose the group we are most worried about is families with children and the impact of this on children. I know that you will be seeing some people from Dover later. Out of 600 asylum-seeking children in Dover, only 200 are in school. Our staff have told us how these children have to run a gauntlet of abuse to get to the classroom. You see that building up for periods of time.
<P>
It is not just about dispersal. These families will have even less than income support to live on. That support will be delivered by vouchers and this tiny amount of cash is now being talked about. The vouchers can be used only at a supermarket which may be two and a half miles away. What will happen to the single parent with a child who runds out of nappies because they are careless and they get things wrong, as we all do? What will happen if the kids need some Calpol? The impact on the physical and emotional well-being of children will be terrible. The safeguards in the Bill for children are simply not enough.
<P>
The other point about dispersal that must be got right is that if you accept our figures that 40 per cent. of claims are successful, what will you do for those 40 per cent. who are allowed to stay? If the Government are correct and you whisk through this fast decision-making time, some people&#151;the ones everyone says they want to help&#151;will get refugee status in a few weeks, and suddenly they will be left with no support at all while asylum seekers are still provided with accommodation. There is a missing section in the Bill and a missing chapter in the White Paper on settlement. What are you going to do to help people who have made a successful claim to settle successfully? People do not want much; they are not asking for extra, just for some of the barriers to be removed and for the unemployment rates to be brought down from the existing 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. in refugee communities.
<P>
I realise that I am running out of time, but there is another point about communities that is very problematic, as you would know if you spoke to refugees who have status and who have been here for some time. I was speaking to a colleague who now has citizenship, who said, ``My citizenship does not mean the same as yours because, under the Bill's provisions, if I have distant family or friends or relatives who come to this country, I will have an obligation to support them. That family can stay with me but they won't get any other offer of accommodation.'' The existing refugee communities, who by all the indices are among the most socially excluded in the country, will have to shoulder a lot of the responsibility to provide support and accommodation.
<P>
When we look back on the Bill in 20 years' time, that will be one of its most worrying aspects. You must actually find some way of saying to people, ``You are allowed to stay; you are welcome.'' The message should be: ``You are welcome. We want you to make a success of starting your new life in Britain. We will face down some of the bigots out there and we will give you the support you need to build your new life here and to make the contribution to this country that every successive generation of refugees has made.'' I think we talk too much about refugees being a problem. The experience is that they are an opportunity and we ought to start talking about them like that too.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall call Mr. Blizzard, followed by Mr. Clappison and Mr. O'Brien; then we shall move on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Blizzard </B>(Waveney): Mr. Hardwick, you said that if dispersal were to go ahead and the Bill should contain rigorous criteria for selecting the places to which asylum seekers would be dispersed. You gave us some idea of what those criteria might be, but will you and the other witnesses spell them out?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> If that happens&#151;again, it is not what I want&#151;I would like to see people settled in clusters which are not so big that they create problems of the kind that have been described, but which are sufficient for people to draw support from others in their community. I would like people to be settled in existing multiracial areas where there is the infrastructure that people need to make a success. For example, there should be colleges with provision for English as an additional language, schools that are used to dealing with newly arrived people, whatever their status, and a voluntary and community structure that provides people with the support that they need. That would be top of my shoppling list.
<P>
If nothing else, I hope that I have persuaded you that what the Government are doing is really difficult. Make it as easy for yourselves as you can; put in place the sort of support and structure that does not build up long-term problems for the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I want to pick up two points that were made in answer to previous questions; the first is the matter of preferences. The Bill states that the Secretary of State must not take into account the preferences of refugees; it does not state ``need not'' but ``must not''. The Secretary of State has forbidden it. Do you think that that is appropriate?
<P>
Secondly, you mentioned safeguards for children. What safeguards would you like in the Bill to protect children?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> I agree with that point absolutely. I think that sometimes the Home Office cannot work out whether the punitive bit of the Bill is simply the dispersal and the cashless system or whether it needs to make life unpleasant for people on top of that. If one accepts the need for people to be dispersed, there is an argument for the Secretary of State to take into account the preferences of the asylum seeker and people's family and social structures. What happens to a male refugee who is joined by a female relative who wants to be near other people in her community? She might want to be near a brother or an uncle who can offer support and protection. What happens if two brothers arrive, one of whom goes to Liverpool, the other to Norwich? Such examples must be taken into account: there is no need to specify that the Secretary of State may not take such matters into account.
<P>
I am especially disturbed that refugee children will be the only group of children in the country to be removed from the protection of the Children Act 1989. That measure has had all-party support under successive Administrations, and has not been amended. However, it will be amended to remove important safety provisions. Such an amendment should definitely be modified.
<P>
Families with young children cannot be put into a cashless system. The proposals were not drawn up by people who go shopping for a young family. Life, however, is different. What happens when things run out, or children have particular needs, or little things happen at school? Refugees ought to be able to tackle such matters in the same way as their peers. Children in a cashless voucher system will not be able to do that.
<P>
There is no choice about the accommodation that people go to. I have seen families crammed into one fetid hotel room, from which the children cannot escape.
<P>
I will conclude with an example that made a big impression on me. A few months ago, a Columbian family came to our day centre for destitute asylum seekers. The family consisted of a man and a woman and their two young daughters, one of whom was about four and the other nine months.
<P>
The family had been placed in bed and breakfast in Crystal Palace. Twice a week, the parents carried the children on their backs from Crystal Palace to our centre in Vauxhall. I spoke to them for quite a long time. An interpreter explained to me that the baby was the result of the mother being raped by paramilitaries in Columbia. The parents explained that they carried the children to our day centre so that the four-year-old could talk and play with other Spanish-speaking children. Our day centre was also the only place where she could get toys to play with.
<P>
The conversation went on for about an hour and a half, because it was being interpreted. While we talked, the little girl&#151;who was the same age as my own child&#151;sat beside us, motionless. We had a Chess set, and all that she did for that hour and a half was pass a chess piece from one hand to the other. She was a very disturbed little girl. You look at such a child and think: ``My God, where will you be in 16 years? What are we doing to you?''
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> May I ask Nick Hardwick to confirm some statistics? We have been talking about a figure of 35 per cent. Last year, 17 per cent. were recognised as refugees under the 1951 refugee convention and 12 per cent. were granted exceptional leave to remain, many because they were part of a backlog that had been in the UK for many years. Is that correct?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> I do not have the Minister's figures before me.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It adds up to 35 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> The number of substantive decisions adds up to 35 per cent. That figure does refer to all cases, because people who are having substantive decisions made about them are in the support system.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not disagree about that. My question is straightforward: are the statistics right, as we have been talking about 35 per cent? Do you accept that appeals currently have a success rate of 9 per cent., which is less than the 11 per cent. that you quoted, although the success rate was 11 per cent. for a short period last year? That equates to fewer than one in 10 appeals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> The figure that I was given was 11 per cent. I will not argue, however, if it is 9 per cent. The point is that in 1998, approximately 40 per cent. of all the people about whom a decision was made were allowed to stay. If the figure is 30 per cent., I think that it is still a great number who will stay.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> You are assuming that we are disagreeing when I am merely getting you to confirm that we are working on the same basis, with the same figures.
<P>
I should like to ask Anne Owers a question. I note your concerns, Anne, about sham marriages. May I ask you a straightforward question? Do you accept that there is a problem about sham marriages for immigration purposes? If you do, how would you deal with it if not in the way that the Government suggest?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> I note the comment in the White Paper that there is a problem. As you know, it is not work that we do directly, therefore I cannot comment directly. What I have heard from the Home Office and others is that there is concern about serial marriages and about people who are not lawfully able to marry. It seems that if the Government set up any kind of system that is intrusive upon people's private lives and interferes with the right to marriage, or sets up a system of checks, you have to identify the mischief that you are dealing with and anything that you do must address that mischief directly. If what the Government are concerned about, and can show has happened, is serial marriages clearly contracted for immigration purposes, or marriages of people who are not lawfully free to marry, you could draft provisions that went to that rather than create this amazingly wide category of what is called a sham marriage which starts to bear all the hallmarks of the primary purpose rule that the Government abolished as one of their first acts when they came to office.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not think that the problem is particularly serial marriages or people being legally unable to marry, which, as you say, could be dealt with in other ways. The problem is people who enter into marriage purely to obtain immigration status. It sounds as though you do not accept that that is a problem.
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> I have no reason to believe that it is although I am not, as you well understand, coming to it as a practitioner in the subject, but as someone who looking at what the Government seek to do from a legal and human rights point of view. From any point of view, the definition that you have of a sham marriage whose purpose is to confer an immigration benefit looks horribly like the primary purpose rule. I cannot imagine how it will be put into effect without questions about intention being asked. Clearly, if a person marries a European economic area national, the effect is to change what they can do under immigration law. Once you start to look at purpose and intention, you get into difficult and intrusive areas. Mick Chatwin will know more about the actuality of this matter because it is an area that the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants deals with and we do not. As we said in our evidence, I am concerned about the article 8 implications.
<P>
I note also that the Government may have difficulty in justifying the religious discrimination in the Bill, as it is impossible for a person who is a member of the Anglican church to contract a sham marriage, whereas a person belonging to any other religion can go through a religious ceremony and still be under suspicion. I should have thought that in a multicultural multi-faith society the Government would wish to avoid that. I am not arguing that the provisions to which I object should be extended even wider, but I am suggesting that the Government need to get to something much more objective that would not be offensive to members of any religion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chatwin:</B> If I may, I will pick up some of the themes that Anne touched on. She is right to say that the Bill has extremely widely drawn provisions here&#151;a feature that appears in a number of places in the Bill&#151;when it appears that what is aimed at is relatively narrow. Why, if that is so, do the powers need to be drawn so widely?
<P>
The provisions as currently drawn give rise to a number of problems. Other issues of discrimination arise with the clauses. We have not yet seen the detailed regulations and it is not clear exactly what is being proposed. This, again, is a common feature time and again throughout the Bill, and it is rather difficult to know exactly what we are commenting upon without knowing what the details of the provision will be. It seems, for example, that we are talking about marriages contracted with people from another EEA state. That would immediately appear to contravene the law of another member state, not Britain's&#151;and it contravenes European anti-discrimination legislation. If that is not the case and it is intended that British citizens are also included in that definition of EEA nationals&#151;and it is certainly not clear in the Bill that that is what is intended&#151;then why on earth are persons of other nationalities not included? What is the point of excluding from that any other nationals who are resident in this country?
<P>
There are difficulties over definition and over what is intended by sham marriage. It is clear that what is intended is a marriage contracted for a certain purpose. In other words, we are back to the issues of primary purpose and guessing people's intentions. It will put marriage registrars in an invidious position: they are being asked to use reasonable suspicion. But without a series of safeguards, any provision by which public officials are expected to use reasonable suspicion to determine possible immigration offences, is a recipe for discrimination and prejudice.
<P>
There is a crying need&#151;in this area as in other areas of the Bill, and overwhelmingly in relation to the immigration service&#151;to ensure that a series of safeguards is put in place. If these proposals are to go ahead, we must ensure that they do not lead to widespread discrimination against persons simply because it appears that one party or the other is from abroad. Suspicions will arise in the minds of some registrars that there is a problem.
<P>
I do not see any difficulty that cannot be dealt with by existing provisions and existing Home Office powers. However, if the Home Office is determined that there is indeed a problem that has not been addressed in any other way, all the provisions&#151;and certainly the reporting provisions&#151;will need to be amended, as will the powers to halt a marriage from goind ahead on what appears to be an unsubstantiated tip-off. Those provisions in the Bill will lead to serious difficulties.
<P>
The safeguards at present to allow a form of appeal to the registrar general are by no means sufficient to avoid breaches of article 8 and possibly article 12 of the convention, nor are they going to avoid breaches of the Race Relations Act 1976.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> So you do not think that there is a problem and you do not think that this is the way to deal with it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chatwin:</B> Absolutely not. I see no problem, but if the Home Office believes that there is a problem, the powers are already there to do something about it. It is possible to deal with sham or bogus marriages or marriages of convenience, even after a grant of indefinite leave has been given, if it is appropriate. That power has been there in law for a good many years now. I do not see that taking further steps will achieve anything additional.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Clappison, you had a question on this subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We all want to tackle the problems connected with sham marriages. Have I understood you, Mr. Chatwin? Are you saying that there may be unintended consequences from the Government's proposals, which may lead to discrimination, problems with different religious faiths and possible breaches of the European convention? You told us about the need for safeguards. What safeguards would you like to see, and would you like to see them in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chatwin:</B> I would like the provisions for dealing with sham marriages to be far more detailed and specific to make it clearer exactly what is required. I do not think that that power is necessary, but if it is to be there, it must be spelt out in some detail. We made some suggestions in our submission about how that could be done, which were intended to be helpful. There will also need to be codes of practice for registrars. If this is to go ahead, registrars will need training in race relations and community awareness. There will need to be safeguards to ensure that, if superintendent registrars refuse to marry a couple because of information received, those people's rights are not infringed as a result. We must also ensure that we do not set up a snoops' charter that allows people to cause mischief. At present there is nothing in the Bill to ensure that that will not happen, so I believe that that safeguard is also necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I noticed Anne Owers expressing a view, and I wonder whether she has anything to add.
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> Not much; I would simply back up what Mick Chatwin has said. First, you need to identify the mischief that you are trying to deal with, and whether it can be addressed by questioning couples coming to be married. If you draw the provision too widely, you will be in a position of having to ask people intimate questions about their relationships. That will bring you straight away into collision with article 8 rights to privacy, and with people's normal rights. It will tend to operate in a discriminatory way.
<P>
If such a provision is to work, it has to be very much more targeted than at present, and it has to be something that can be objectively and clearly assessed without intruding into people's private lives. If it is applied, it must be without any discrimination&#151;whether racial discrimination, which could be addressed by way of codes to registrars, or religious discrimination, which assumes that some religious ceremonies lend themselves to sham marriages whereas others do not.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Faber </B>(Westbury): May I take us on to part III of the Bill, which deals with judicial oversight and bail? All of you have expressed concerns in your written evidence about this part of the Bill. Justice has said that part III may not meet the requirements of article 5 of the European convention on human rights, or of article 31 of the 1951 convention.
<P>
Amnesty says that a bail hearing is an insufficient guarantee against arbitrary detention, and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants similarly says that the limited bail provisions proposed are an inadequate safeguard against arbitrary detention. All of you, as well, consider the use of a television link to be unsatisfactory in giving evidence. I wonder whether you could all enlarge a little on your written evidence.
<P>
<B>Jan Shaw:</B> Amnesty has been concerned for a considerable period that many people seeking asylum in the United Kingdom have been detained for considerable lengths of time without access to judicial oversight or the possibility of challenging the decision to detain before a competent, impartial and independent authority, as in accordance with international human rights standards.
<P>
The latest figures that I have seen were in Hansard at the end of October last year. They showed that at any one time in the United Kingdom, there are something like 750 asylum seekers in detention. At the end of October, some 448 people had applied for asylum and were still awaiting the initial decision on their claim. That means that they had been held in detention since they had first applied for asylum. There are no written reasons currently given for the decision to detain. There are no statutory criteria and there is no access to a legal or judicial scrutiny of the decision to detain. The same set of figures also showed that 158 people were awaiting an appeal. The same could be said of those people&#151;that they had possibly been in detention from the very beginning, from the point at which they had applied for asylum.
<P>
As you have said, we do not think that a bail hearing is a guarantee against arbitrary detention. It takes into consideration criteria other than the lawfulness of the decision to detain, for example, the existence of sureties. I can see nothing in the Bill that will provide judicial oversight.
<P>
Our concerns have been shared by the United Nations Human Rights Committee's working group on arbitrary detention, which visited the United Kingdom last September because there were allegations that many people were being held in detention without judicial oversight. The working group shares many of the concerns that we have repeatedly raised with the Government. It did not see the Bill, but had access to the White Paper, and says that bail is not an adequate supervision of the decision to detain. It raises many concerns about the lack of statutory criteria, judicial oversight and written reasons for the decision to detain.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> What would be your alternative to the proposed magistrates' hearing at that stage of the process?
<P>
<B>Jan Shaw:</B> The way the Bill reads at present, it strikes me that clause 31 could be rewritten to incorporate a two-stage process whereby before a bail application was heard the decision to detain could be scrutinised by the magistrates. If the immigration officer's decision were found not to be lawful, temporary release could be arranged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chatwin:</B> I would make only a few short points.&#151;In addition to the working group report that Jan Shaw raised, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has also issued guidelines with respect to asylum seekers. Of the numbers of people referred to by Jan, at any one time something like 970 are in Immigration Act detention of one kind or another. That is because there are about 970 places available and they are always full. The people who find themselves in detention are not necessarily there for particularly good reasons compared with those who are released.
<P>
I argue that many of those who are in detention should be out, rather than that many of those who are are out should be in. However, our bottom line is that statutory criteria are necessary for holding people in detention; that people should be given written reasons&#151;ideally in a language that they can understand&#151;for the decision to detain them; that there should be a presumption in favour of bail, as there is under the Bail Act 1976 for criminal suspects and that there must be a right to a proper hearing with legal representation and legal aid to pursue that hearing. Those are the basic safeguards that we want.
<P>
We do not think that a video link is sufficient. It is inadequate to enable us to take instructions from someone whose first language is, very often, not English. We are anxious about the feasibility of that. We also doubt that people who are unfamiliar with procedures in this country, and probably with the language too, will have a sense of justice being done if they are sitting at the end of a video link.
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> In my capacity as human rights sweeper, perhaps I should underline some of the points that have been made. Once article 5 can be argued fully in this country, two pillars will be required for the kind of detention that we are talking about. The first has already been mentioned: clear critieria set down in statute, in the way, for example, that the schedule to the Bail Act 1976 sets out the criteria on which people can be detained or released on bail. Those criteria should be supported by regulations that also have a statutory basis, so that they are clear in both broad and detailed terms. The reasons for detaining each individual would need to be related to those criteria. That would provide something clear for the initial decision maker to work on. It would also provide something for a court to consider in exercising judicial control, which must be the second pillar of detention.
<P>
As Jan Shaw said, some fairly simple amendments to the provisions could enable hearings that are already provided for to examine the reasons for the decision in relation to the criteria, to decide whether the initial decision was right and, if the decision is found to be right, to decide whether the person should be released on some sort of recognisance. I think that, as well as having a human rights spin to it, the process would have a very practical application for the Government.
<P>
There seemed to be a suggestion on Second Reading that the Home Secretary thought that the most appropriate mechanism for looking at the lawfulness of detention was habeas corpus proceedings. In resource terms&#151;the Government having put in place what will be a very resource-intensive mechanism mandatorily to look at detention of people at two points during the process&#151;I cannot see why the process should not look at the issue of detention all in one go, rather than invite people to issue separate proceedings by way of habeas corpus. Why have they decided on this two-stage process&#151;first, asking if it was right to detain in the first place and, secondly, considering the issue of bail?
<P>
I agreed with the legal aid point. I would make another point, which is that the other matter that concerned the UN committee was the length of detention in total. That committee, like others, suggested a maximum period of detention, which is the case in many other countries. That would be our first choice, too. Failing that, there must be an opportunity for continuity of judicial control because the longer you detain someone on purely administrative grounds, the more that may start conflicting with their human rights.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Gerrard, is your question in this area?
<P>
<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): May I follow up the point from Anne Owers about the legal basis of detention? You said in your written evidence to us that, essentially, the legal basis at present is the 1971 Act, which provides a blanket power to immigration officers. You have just discussed what should possibly be in the statute in terms of asylum seekers. Do you see the necessity of examining the rest of the Bill so as to consider the issue further, because it is not only asylum seekers who are subject to detention?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> Absolutely. I did not mean to suggest&#151;I am sorry if I did&#151;that the criteria should apply only to asylum seekers, although I feel that they should be different for asylum seekers, who are not people who have offended against immigration laws but people who have come here, as they are entitled to do to seek protection, and whose claims are still being examined. As I understand it, there are internal guidelines in the Home Office that there should always be a presumption of temporary release for asylum seekers and that presumption should be displaced only if it can be shown in the individual case that that person's intention would be to abscond, and that he is making a claim that can clearly be shown to offer the likelihood that, if not detained, he would abscond.
<P>
I think that there must also be criteria for people at the other end of the process who are detained prior to removal. The UN working party on arbitrary detentions makes the point that if, for example, someone has been here for a very long period, issues of proportionality arise in connection with detention&#151;whether it is right to detain them when they have connections here that indicate that they would not go to ground anyway. In other words, the criteria for detention run across the board.
<P>
There is another point for the Committee to be aware of in terms of the Human Rights Act&#151;and the Act moves us into uncharted waters as regards all our legislation being under scrutiny, particularly in relation to detention under the convention. Legality does not just mean that there is a law that says you can do it; it means that there must be a very precise basis for taking away someone's liberty, and that you must be able to relate the taking away of that liberty to that precise basis. That is why the law will need to be amended in that respect.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> If things are to change continually as the Human Rights Act comes into force, do you advocate our writing a provision into the Bill, or trying in the Bill to establish a framework and then dealing with the detail through regulation?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> Absolutely. The guiding principles, at least, should be in statute, if not in a schedule. As I have said, there is a schedule to the Bail Act 1976 that provides a model of what might be done. Yes, there would be a gradual staged process, would there not, where you set out the main principles in legislation, define them further in regulations and apply them, by reasoned decisions, to each individual? That will be needed. I also think that it would assist in the sense that it seems that for all Governments recently the issue of detention has been a constant source of political controversy, inhumanity and genuine outrage among many people in this country that people can be shut away on what looks like the whim of a single official. That system could be brought under proper legal and judicial control. Then it would be used less in the wrong circumstances and would need to be justified. In the exceptional cases for which it was necessary, it would be easier to justify&#151;but it should be a very exceptional measure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chatwin:</B> To add to what Anne Owers said, it is not only opinion in this country which is affronted: the UN working group has been very critical and the UNHCR also has objection about the detention of asylum seekers. That makes it plain that we are doing badly in international opinion, and it is right to be aware of that.
<P>
I want to make a small point about having clear criteria for detention and being able to test them by judicial oversight in individual cases. What we have currently are guidelines as to when a person should be detained under the Immigration Act, which indicate that it should be a last resort and that it should be geared towards the removal of people only at the end of the process.
<P>
However, what we see in reality is that a large proportion of people held at any one time under Immigration Act detention&#151;I am not thinking of the relatively small number at any time who have completed a criminal sentence and are awaiting deportation, but those who have committed no offences at all under our law&#151;are waiting for a decision. They are not at the end of the process.
<P>
A great many of them are detained early on in the process and stay in detention for months before being released. Only in a few cases will there have been questions about the person's identity&#151;probably because they arrived with false documents. In the vast majority of cases, any doubts about the person's identity are cleared up to the balance of probabilities very early on in the process. People are then simply stuck inside and not released, which appears to conflict with the guidance that the immigration service currently has.
<P>
It would be interesting to know the extent to which there is an unwritten policy which indicates that detention is another part of the tough regime, intended to dissuade people from coming to this country. That has been repeatedly suggested, certainly in relation to the Roma people who arrived last year, when families were split up and heads of households were detained on arrival while the rest of the family were let out. Having clear criteria and proper judicial oversight would offer some hope of getting away from the situation in which such criticisms can be made both in this country and overseas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Can I be clear about what is meant by judicial oversight? Should we have a two-stage process in which there is a judicial decision at the beginning, or should there be a clear judicial review of administrative detentions?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> I think that it could be done either way. However, using the structure of the Bill and assuming that there was a mandatory hearing soon after the initial detention, the hearing would have to deal with two separate issues. It would have to decide whether the initial decision to detain was right&#151;and it could do that properly only if it were given the full reasons for detention in relation to properly established criteria. After that decision, it could then go on.
<P>
If it decided that it was reasonable and lawful to detain the person in the first place, the hearing could then ask whether that person should be released upon sureties or recognisances&#151;and if so, decide on a safe level. That could be done at the same hearing. Indeed, I would argue that the Human Rights Act will make it impossible to stop someone arguing about the lawfulness of their detention at those hearings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Is it your view that the current system of administrative detention, even with the oversight proposed, is likely to lead to findings against the Government once the Human Rights Act is in place? Is that more likely than not?
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> Yes. That is the advice that we gave the Government last year and it is clear from decisions in the European Court of Human Rights. Once the legality of detention can be argued, yes, a system will be needed that can look at it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Is it your view that in order to comply with the Human Rights Act we need a statement in primary legislation of the rules of detention such as that proposed by UNHCR, which Amnesty supports, or are there mechanisms for doing so outside that in immigration service rules?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> There is an in-between stage. Doing it simply within internal rules is not good enough. It must be attached to a statute. Regulations can be made under statute, but one would not normally expect the statute to address itself in great detail to the circumstances of an individual case. However, one would expect to set out in more detail than in the present statute why somebody was detained.
<P>
To take up Mr. Gerrard's point, the UNHCR guidelines address the issue of asylum seekers specifically, but we must consider everyone who is in administrative detention, and criteria would need to be developed for anyone likely to be detained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Finally, I have some specific questions on the nature of hearings under this system or the two-stage one that you propose, which sounds very interesting.
<P>
First, on the issue of legal representation, is it your view that it should be available for both the preparation and the representation phases and that representation is a key element?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> Yes. Looking at the way in which the Court of Human Rights considers detention issues, it is apparent that whereas there is not very much protection under article 6, which requires due process in public law generally&#151;that is, normal immigration and asylum hearings&#151;the Strasbourg court has been very clear about the need for access to courts and that must mean where people cannot afford legal representation in matters in which liberty is at issue. There will be a much stronger requirement to provide legal representation, which will have to be through public funds. We would argue that legal aid is the best and most sensible way to do that for people who could not otherwise afford it. That will have to go to representation at the hearing too. Of course, most detainees cannot afford to pay for their own representation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> To make a final point, you may be aware from the other submissions that the immigration appellate authorities said that in order to emphasise the independence of the appellate authority&#151;although there are still questions about who does it&#151;it is not appropriate to hold bail hearings at detention centres and prisons. Do you have a view on the location of bail hearings?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> I have not seen that submission, but I agree with it wholeheartedly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Mr. Chatwin relied heavily on the report of the working group on arbitrary detention, a copy of which I have and with which you are familiar. Will you comment on paragraph 20 of the report, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Working Group conducted separate interviews of a large number of detainees. The impressions of the Group were as follows: (a) A large majority of asylum seekers were economic migrants; (b) A large number of economic migrants were aware of the fact that their travel documents were either forged or that they were not in possession of the correct identification documentation, and of the risks entailed in being apprehended and discovered at the time of entry; (c) A small percentage were genuine asylum seekers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Do you agree with that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chatwin:</B> The Minister will not be particularly surprised to hear that my own view would not put the breakdown in quite the same way as the report, but the case may be made&#151;I do not know if that is your intention in drawing attention to the paragraph&#151;that detention catches those whom it should catch. If your intention in drawing attention to that paragraph is to say that those who are being detained are predominantly those with weak cases&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My intention is simply to say that you have relied heavily on that document where you have agreed with it. I am pointing out a particular paragraph and asking for your comments on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chatwin:</B> My comment would be that it does not make much difference to the need for the safeguards. If you have the kind of safeguards for which we and the document have called, and if those enabled you to test the bona fides of some of the people who are detained in a fairly rigorous way&#151;if you wish to do it&#151;that does not make any difference to the need to have in place a regime that allows the decisions that are made in individual cases to detain to be properly tested against fair standards.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Jan Shaw, you also relied on the working group document. Do you agree with the points quoted in paragraph 20 that it is likely in the conducting of a large number of interviews of detainees that those sort of conclusions could have been reached.
<P>
<B>Jan Shaw:</B> I agree with what Mick Chatwin has just said, but I would also say that of those asylum seekers held in detention under Immigration Act powers in 1997, many went on to get refugee status or exceptional leave to remain. In fact 89 people who were detained under Immigration Act powers got full refugee status and a further 132 got exceptional leave to remain. Among those held, often for long periods of time and often released before their cases are completely considered, are genuine refugees who will have been persecuted in their own countries and often held in detention before they have come to this country. We get calls every day at Amnesty from people held in detention centres and prisons around the country who cannot understand how, having been persecuted in their own country, they come to what they consider to be a country of safety where they should be able to pursue their asylum claim and have the protection that they need, yet they are held in detention centres or prisons for long periods of time.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I know that Mr. Clappison has some further questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My question moves us on.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If no one has anything else on this subject, we shall move on?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I should like to move on to a subject that we have not dealt with so far, that of carriers' liability, on which I know that Justice has some views, particularly for the road haulage industry. It is one of the features of the Bill that is not a bolt-on and where the Secretary of State takes a number of powers to himself. I put it no higher than that. May I ask three points? Is the regime of carriers' liability for road haulage compatible with the European convention? Secondly, is it likely to be effective and thirdly, is it fair?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> I shall try to take those questions in order. Whether it is compatible with the European convention raises two separate issues. It raises the issue of whether that regime undermines people's protection rights under the European convention. It also raises the question which we addressed to an extent in our submission about whether the way in which it is proposed to impose those sanctions raises issues under carriers' rights to due process and peaceful enjoyment of their propety. Issues are raised under both of those.
<P>
It is clear&#151;we and others have been saying this for a long time&#151;that the intention of carrier sanctions of all kinds, whether they are fines on airlines or the new clandestine entrant penalties, is to prevent people from arriving here. They are not operated in a way that distinguishes between those who come here because they need protection and those who do not. We suggested in our evidence some ways in which that could be mitigated by making sure that a defence was always available to the carrier if the person they carried really needed protection. That is not a solution. Most of us on this side of the table would argue that carrier sanctions cannot operate in a way that completely fulfils Britain's protection obligations. However, we recognise reality when we see it.
<P>
I turn to how penalties are imposed. We have heard the helpful advice of people who know a great deal more about that than I do. They raised serious concerns that a criminal penalty may, in fact, be being imposed. That relates to the imposition of a punitive penalty, to the available defences&#151;which are normally associated with criminal activity&#151;and, most compellingly, to the fact that intentionally bringing in someone who is seeking to enter illegally is a criminal offence, for which the accused has the safeguards of criminal law. However, under the Bill, there are no safeguards for unintentionally doing the same thing.
<P>
It is astonishing that the Secretary of State would ever trouble to impose a criminal penalty, if he could get away with imposing a similar penalty that did not involve the trouble of going to court.
<P>
We would like to have further discussions with the Home Office about that matter. It would be well to align the penalties with what the convention permits before the Bill is enacted, rather than confronting extraordinarily expensive litigation afterwards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Before you move on, let me address that point. That alignment may happen, but, even so, lorry drivers or road hauliers would not have recourse to courts and all the normal safeguards of justice.
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> I was trying to make that point. If the penalty is to be a criminal one, it can only be imposed by the courts, not the Home Secretary. Even if a civil penalty is imposed, that may mean that a vehicle is immediately impounded, which is especially significant for a lorry driver for whom that vehicle is his or her sole livelihood. The chances of such a person being able to afford to contest that penalty are so limited as to raise questions about whether he or she has proper access to a court.
<P>
If such penalties are to be imposed, the provisions for the Secretary of State to issue a code of practice telling people whether they have effective systems and whether they have operated them properly must be mandatory. People must not be put in the position of not knowing whether they have done what is required of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Do you think that that would be effective?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> Effective on whose terms?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My fear is that the whole burden is on lorry drivers, so that they have a big incentive not to co-operate in such matters, even though the majority of them are co-operative and responsible. It would be frightening for a lorry driver to find a clandestine entrant in the back of his vehicle, given the possible consequences.
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> That is certainly the case. Presumably, in such cases the temptation to clandestinely dispose of someone would be much greater.
<P>
Looking at how successive Governments have tried to tighten up such arrangements over the years, I am struck by the amazing ingenuity that people have used to get round them. It is not clear that provisions, such as those in the Bill, are effective. Our fear on this side of the table is that the Bill will deter people in parts of the world where an inhabitant desperately needs to get out, and cannot do so without their help.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Jan Shaw from Amnesty International has commented on this matter.
<P>
<B>Jan Shaw:</B> Yes. We object to visas and carrier sanctions being used to keep people out. They send a clear message: ``You are not welcome here''. Access for those fleeing from human rights violations is much more difficult if they have to have a visa. We object to carrier sanctions, as airline personnel are not trained to scrutinise documents of those fleeing human rights violations. In addition, asylum seekers may be forced to use forged documents, and they may fall prey to agents trafficking in human misery.
<P>
	The White Paper said that airline liaison officers, who had been placed in five positions around the world&#151;in Delhi, Colombo, Dhaka, Nairobi and Accra&#151;had been very successful in preventing people from coming to the UK. It proposed an increase of 15 airline liaison officers, some whom have now been posted.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that last year some 2,100 people were prevented from coming here because they were refused carriage. Among those people there would certainly have been asylum seekers. We believe that anything that obstructs people fleeing human rights violations from seeking protection in the United Kingdom is incompatible with the provisions of articles 31 and 33 of the 1951 UN convention on refugees.
<P>
As Anne Owers says, one has to realise when one is beaten. I know that the Government are not going to not impose visas when there is a situation like the one in Bosnia, or, more recently, when a large number of people started to come from Colombia&#151;each Government's reaction to that was to impose visas. The Government are not going to lift carrier sanctions.
<P>
The Minister, when he gave evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee, said that refugees will be prevented from coming to the United Kingdom because of these sanctions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> First, I have a question for Amnesty. You have told us in your written evidence, and you say again now, that problems are caused by the combination of carrier liability and the extension of pre-entry controls. What would you see as a reasonable level of pre-entry control, or do you not believe that there should be any?
<P>
<B>Jan Shaw:</B> I have been thinking about this carefully, and I cannot see what a reasonable level would be. If you were fleeing from the situation such as that in Bosnia, how would you get a passport, first of all, from your national authority? How would you then get a visa? you would then have airline personnel scrutinising your passport. We are not against immigration controls per se, we are against controls where people who are fleeing for their lives are obstructed from gaining protection in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> May I ask JCWI a question on a connected issue? In your written evidence you talked about clauses 9 and 10 of the Bill, which deal with passenger information. I think that that is all part of the same package of proposals. You said that you were concerned about the way in which that power might be used. Can you explain why you have those concerns?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chatwin:</B> This is another place where there is a narrow intent but a widely drawn power. What went through our minds was something with which we had been involved a few years ago&#151;it might have been Christmas 1994, or slightly before. A flight from Jamaica arrived shortly before Christmas day. Everyone was hauled off the plane and stuck in detention, and eventually all but a handful were sent back to Jamaica. A handful were allowed into the country. Recently, the Government have lost a couple of cases&#151;they have been sued over that case some years later. The applicants have made out their case and won some damages.
<P>
What we are concerned about is that people who operate charter flights, and things of that sort&#151;as occurred in that case&#151;will be put under enormous pressure and they will find that it is not worth their while to do it. We expect that these requests will be targeted in respect of certain nationalities, and flights from certain areas. It will put undue strain on certain carriers&#151;certainly the smaller airlines and the charter airlines&#151;to give up the game altogether.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> In the notes to the Bill, the Government said that the intention was generally to use the power for small ports, where immigration officers were not present as a matter of course. Do you see a problem with that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chatwin:</B> I do not know. It may be that people are arriving at Brize Norton or somewhere like that, where perhaps half a duty immigration officer is needed to cover the port. Some powers may need to be in place. But, as I say, if there is a narrow intent behind the provision, it needs to be spelt out. If it is not to be spelt out in the Bill&#151;it may not be necessary&#151;at least it provides another case for the Government to provide some draft rules and regulations about what they really intend to do.
<P>
Orders about ports of entry, which designate certain places as such, have been around for many years. The Government know where they assign immigration officers on duty. It would be easy to make it plain at this stage precisely what is intended by the clause. If it is limited, it should be set out on paper now&#151;otherwise, some undertakings should be made to the Committee about what is going to be done. If the drafting is in wider terms, we feel sure that immigration officers will use the power that is given them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): Having worked at some of the ports and having seen the conditions under which some asylum seekers arrive in trailers, do you honestly believe that there should be no obligation on some of the carriers at least to check their vehicles before they put them on a ship? Otherwise people may have to live in terrible circumstances, on open decks, freezing and sometimes facing life-threatening conditions. A simple check around a vehicle to see if anyone had gained access to it might prevent asylum seekers from being forced to live under such life-threatening conditions.
<P>
<B>Anne Owens:</B> I certainly do not want anyone seeking entry to this country to be placed under dangerous conditions. As Jan Shaw said, it can be a consequence of the desperation of people who have no other means of getting away from situations that they cannot leave in a legal, proper, humane or decent way.
<P>
There is no objection, at least on human rights grounds, to checks by lorry drivers or owners of ships or other forms of transport. First, if they are to have responsibilities, what they are required to do by way of checks must be clearly defined&#151;so there must be code. Secondly, the form of penalties and whether they should be imposed by a court, must also be looked at carefully. Thirdly, given the humanitarian reasons why some people may want to be concealed in order to escape, there must be some kind of defence available for people who bring in those subsequently recognised as needing protection&#151;but clearly they should not be brought into the country in inhumane conditions.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I am extremely alarmed at the proposal to confiscate lorries when people are found illgally on board. After the Vietnam war, when the boat people were risking their lives in the seas of south-east Asia, I recall that various sanctions were imposed against ship owners if they picked up any of those boat people, some of whom were nearly dead? In consequence, they were left to die.
<P>
That issue was touched on when the word disposal was discussed. Have the government thought through the scenario when a driver discovers late one night that he has a terrified family hidden on his lorry and he knows that if he does not dispose of that family his lorry might be impounded&#151;if it is not his lorry he might, at the very least, lose his job? I should like to think that 99 out of 100 lorry drivers would not do something desperate in that situation. Do you think that there is a risk that some might?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> I think there is a real risk, and you do not have to go back as far as the Vietnam war to find examples of it. There is a much more recent example of a Russian ship which carried refugee asylum seekers from west Africa. When the captain realised that he had stowaways on board and that he would be penalised by his owners, he threw them overboard. I am glad that that point was raised because it was where I was getting to in my answer about effectiveness, and perhaps not nearly well enough. The effectiveness is of two things: first, of whether, arriving here discovering you have someone on board, you have every interest in making sure that they evade immigration control and you evade your fine, and secondly, and much more crucially from a human rights point of view, whether, if you find them mid-way through your journey you get rid of them in a place which may be dangerous for them, or even threaten their lives.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> Precisely my point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gwyn Prosser </B>(Dover): There is a fair bit of anecdotal evidence and we have seen film coverage of would-be asylum seekers in the compound in Calais gaining access to the back of lorries. Attached to that is the additional evidence of their sometimes being aided and abetted by racketeers who are exploiting their plight, whether it is the genuine plight of fleeing from a country of danger, or the economic plight of fleeing from what most of us would consider the safe sanctuary of France. Either way, a considerable number of passages take place in this manner. Do you think that it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that his or her cargo is safe, and not broached, not only because of the illegality of carrying people in this way but taking up the point raised by Mr. Henderson&#151;because of the exposure to further danger on passage?
<P>
Putting that in context, you might remember that in the past six months, a tragedy occurred in Dover when a person fell from underneath a truck as it came over the link span and, sadly, died.
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> As I have said, I do not think any of us here would want people to be exposed to that kind of danger, or would think that it was unreasonable or unrealistic to ask lorry drivers to check their vehicles. But I think that some of what you describe&#151;racketeers, and the danger that there is&#151;is a direct consequence of people's inability to get protection where they need it. It has to be said that France is not always a safe country for every asylum seeker. In certain circumstances, for certain nationalities, there are situations where it is quite difficult to get protection in France. Perhaps Nick Hardwick has more to add than I can.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hardwick:</B> May I make a brief point because we have some experience of that, and I think that the last two questions are related? I would certainly be in favour of carriers checking their vehicles because under the new circumstances there are some very real risks. My opposite number in the Italian Refugee Council tells me that every day there are bodies washed up on the Adriatic Coast, and it is thought that this often occurs when traffickers simply turf people overboard from little rubber dinghies that they use to bring people from the Albanian coast to Italy and they are intercepted by the Italian navy.
<P>
I think there is a real possibility that if a lorry driver suspects that he has someone in a container, and the container will be parked perhaps in a port for a time, rather than make trouble for himself by finding out whether anyone is there, he will just leave them. I think that people will be open to all sorts of risks in that situation. The danger with what is happening is that in the past few years there has been a very substantial increase in a multi-million pound criminal industry that is trafficking people in ruthless ways across the world. Ironically, the more barriers we put up and the tougher we make it, the more the traffickers make, and the more they make, the more people they want to feed the industry.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That has a perverse effect; the people who rub their hands in glee at the controls are the traffickers, who act from ruthless financial motives. There is a real threat to individuals caught up in the industry; it is essential that the safeguards that have been discussed are put in place to ensure that, at the very least, people are not left in containers overnight or simply abandoned. There is a real risk of that happening, as it does in other European Countries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prosser:</B> There are lots of truck drivers in my constituency of Dover. In terms of the journeys from France and Belgium across the Channel, is it not true that a proportion of the truck drivers are part of the racket? Whether one is an owner-driver or part of a fleet, it is a huge temptation to accept &#163;500 per passenger just for going to have a cup of tea in a cafe in Calais and turning a blind eye. Some kind of sanction is needed to stop such practices.
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> Clearly, that could be done. We are in completely different territory if we are talking about people who accept financial incentives from racketeers to bring people in; the Bill does not directly address that problem.
<P>
I agree with what Nick Hardwick said. When carrier sanctions were first introduced we said, rather ironically, that perhaps this was a small business initiative. We were wrong: it has turned out to be a multinational, big-business initiative, run by very ruthless people. Our fear, as always, is that it is not the ruthless who will be caught, but the victims, who will not be able to escape.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> What would you do instead?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> Jan Shaw set out the principled approach. Carrier sanctions of all kinds undermine people's ability to leave their country to seek asylum here. Of course, sanctions do not undermine their ability to seek asylum in a neighbouring country. That may not come to the attention of the United Kingdom, but it certainly comes to the attention of the neighbouring countries of whatever country is in upheaval.
<P>
We have to be realistic and accept that nearly all countries now have carrier sanctions, and to consider ways of ensuring that people are not thereby prevented from offering humanitarian assistance to people in imminent danger of persecution. That can be mitigated a bit&#151;it is only a mitigation&#151;by offering them defences if they bring in people who really need protection, and by ensuring that the system operates according to clear regulations and codes that, as far as possible, comply with human rights requirements. That is as far as I can go.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> May I just push you, because I think you said that you would not do anything, that in order to destroy the racket you would make it happen, that you would have no sanctions or penalties.
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> There would not be a racket.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> You would legalise it?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> The racket exists because of the existence of carrier sanctions; that is simply a fact; that is what has made it a huge enterprise.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Bank robbery is a crime because we make it a crime.
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> Yes, but the point is that the criminals in this case are not the people at which the carrier sanctions are directed, they are people who are creating a crime out of misery. Neither Jan Shaw nor I think, realistically, that we can roll back the territory. Governments know that in terms of resources they get more bangs for their buck by stopping people getting here than by allowing people to get here and then determining their claims. That is a call that Governments make and we have to think of ways of dealing with its most unpleasant effects.

<P>

<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Depending how we interpret the statistics, we established earlier that between 10 per cent. and 35 per cent. of claims are granted. Therefore, the majority of claims are not granted. You seem to be arguing against carrier liability purely on the basis&#151;a principled basis&#151;that people genuinely seeking to avoid oppression will have great difficulty leaving their countries through official channels and so need to be given some means of escaping from those countires. Therefore, would not a more practical approach, as you hinted, be to allow as a defence the fact that a person was legitimately helping someone who was in desperate straits, rather than allowing all carrier liabilities to be dropped?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> That is what I thought I was suggesting as a realistic possibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson:</B> Do you know of other cases of carriers' vehicles, equipment or trailers being confiscated for carrying things that they should not carry on a vehicle&#151;drugs, for example?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> I do not know and I would need to take advice on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> The load in the vehicle would be classed as their responsibility. They would take responsibility for carrying the load and for ensuring that the vehicle and the trailer were checked when they left and that nothing was on board that should not be there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I want to ask Anne Owers about schedule 2, which has not featured in the evidence. Has anyone an opinion on the effective abolition of lay membership of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal?
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> We produced a report on determination procedures a couple of years ago in which we recognised that it was difficult to envisage the role of a lay member in a tribunal that primarily addressed itself to points of law and of fact where there had been a misdirection by the adjudicator. Oddly, it was the wrong way round: if there were going to be lay members, it would make more sense to have them at the initial fact-finding stage before an adjudicator than at the second-tier stage before a tribunal. Obviously, the resources required would make the Treasury blanch, so we did not expect it to happen.
<P>
Justice does not in principle have any objection to tribunal members being legally qualified. However, we do have a couple of worries about what is suggested in the Bill. The first is the idea of single-member tribunals sitting where it may be very difficult, particularly at the moment, to establish a clear line of reasoning, of case law, within the tribunal. Secondly just being legally qualified is not enough; it is a very specialised jurisdiction which requires a knowledge of human rights law and of asylum law. Someone may have been practising for many years in crime, planning or maritime law, but that does not necessarily make him immediatley fit to sit on the Immigration Appeal Tribunals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Most of the lay members are themselves magistrates who might argue that they have considerable experience of the problems faced by the people who come before them.
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> I accept that some of them are magistrates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Also, they come from an ethnic mix, which might well be lost if there were only legal members.
<P>
<B>Anne Owers:</B> That would be troubling, but if you were to keep lay members, you would have to be clear about the criteria on which they were appointed and what particular skills they brought to the process that the tribunal did not already have.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does anyone else have anything to say?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chatwin:</B> I would be inclined to agree with you, that a good proportion are magistrates. Almost the only black faces there are those of lay members. That kind of experience and perspective can be of value in some of the determinations. I also appreciate what Anne Owers said about the inquiries that have been made of this jurisdiction. There are other problems here, not only the question about single-member tribunals&#151;I am not sure how a tribunal can consist of one person. There is also the presumption of disposal on paper that will now apply.
<P>
This jurisdiction throws up a great many complicated problems. At present, too many cases go to the tribunal that do not have much in the way of substantive merits. Part of the reason for that is the crazy situation in which leave must be deemed to be granted if a decision on an application is not produced in time. There are a mere five days in which to submit full written grounds to the tribunal and then a further period of 10 days in which to turn the case around and get a decision on it. The members of the tribunal are spending as much as half their time simply sifting through leave applications which is a crazy situation.
<P>
Many cases are going ahead simply because they cannot be dealt with in time. If those counter-productive time limits could be relaxed somewhat and made more realistic, you could dispose of more cases. I am worried, given the complexity of the issues and the fact that so many of the concerns in asylum cases that go to the tribunal turn on assessments of the evidence and on the credibility of witnesses that disposal of cases on paper will lead only to more hard decisions and more challengable decisions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are running out of time for this session, but you have a question, Mr. Maclean.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): I have one brief question for the panel of witnesses. This afternoon we have heard a lot from you about serious potential loopholes in the Bill. As you know, this part of our proceedings comes to an end next week. The Bill will then move into Standing Committee immediately after Easter when we have considered your views here today. Will you all be able to submit to us draft amendments so that we can probe these matters further in that part of our proceedings?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I will take the nods to mean yes. I thank you for your evidence. I hope that you feel that you have had a fair hearing and that what you have said has been useful to the Committee. Obviously we have other witnesses to hear, but the Committee will take into account what you have said as we consider the next stage of the Bill.
<P>
The witnesses withdrew.
<H4><center>Memorandum from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</center></H4>
<H4><center>UNHCR COMMENTS TO THE 1999 IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM BILL</center></H4>
<P>
In the first place, UNHCR would like to welcome the initiative of the Government to conduct a review of the asylum system, and therefore also welcomes the draft Immigration and Asylum Bill as a step in this process. Furthermore, UNHCR would like to express appreciation for the opportunity to comment on the draft as it currently stands. UNHCR considers that overall the Immigration and Asylum Bill does appear to meet international standards and represents significant progress, but there do remain some areas of concern.
<H4><center>MAIN AREAS OF CONCERN IN ASYLUM BILL</center></H4>
<P>
In this written submission, UNHCR will limit its comments to four main areas of particular interest to the organisation, although there are other aspects of the Bill which are also of concern. In various aspects, and particularly that of detention, UNHCR is disappointed to note that the Bill's provisions seem to fall short of the proposals contained in the White Paper.
<H4><center>Detention and Bail</center></H4>
<P>
It is unfortunate that the Bill has missed the opportunity to regulate the detention of asulum seekers in conformity with international standards as they have evolved since the Immigration Act was enacted nearly 30 years ago. UNHCR would suggest that this situation be redressed, through the introduction of appropriate amendments to the Bill.
<P>
UNHCR addresses the question of detention of asylum seekers from the angle of international law standards, including the Refugee Convention, the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Conclusions of the UNHCR Executive Committee, as well as UNHCR's recently updated Guidelines on Criteria and Standards relating to the Detention of Asylum Seekers. Excerpts of immediate relevance to this submission can be found in Annexes A and B.
<P>
UNHCR's basic position can be found in the opening lines to the Detention Guidelines: ``Freedom from arbitrary detention is a fundamental human right and the use of detention is, in many instances, contrary to the norms and principles of international law''. As such, the detention of asylum seekers is, in the view of UNHCR, inherently undesirable.
<P>
UNHCR believes that all matters relating to detention should be placed on a statutory footing and that all exceptions to the general rule that detention should be avoided, must be prescribed by law. Based on EXCOM Conclusion No. 44 (XXXVII) (attached as Annex A(iii))*, UNHCR's Guidelines provide guidance on legitimate grounds of detention. This section of the Guidelines is attached as Annex B*. Detention of asylum seekers which is applied for purposes other than those grounds, for example, as part of a policy to deter future asylum seekers or to dissuade those who have commenced their claims from pursuing them, is contrary to the norms of refugee law.
<P>
UNHCR is disappointed that Part II of the Asylum Bill does not address detention as such but only bail. At the Second Reading of the Bill, the Home Secretary said that it will not be possible to raise the lawfulness of the detention in the bail proceedings which, because of the sweeping powers of detention of the Immigration Act, are in any event not the appropriate fora for scrutinizing the lawfulness of detention. Even where insufficient grounds for detention are advanced, hearings can only examine reliability of surety and its relationship to the applicant.
<P>
*Not printed.
<P>
That the issue of detention of asylum seekers should be the subject of legislative reform is also the view of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which examined the detention of asylum seekers during a visit to Britain in September 1998 and found the bail proposals of the White Paper, reflected in the Bill, no effective remedy (the Conclusions of the report are attached as Annex C*). These proposals seek to establish automatic bail hearings after one week detention and, if the detainee is not released, one month later. Furthermore, UNHCR is specifically concerned that the proposals may not meet international standards as:
<P>
there is no presumption in favour of liberty; it is up to the detainee to show that he should not be detained and to provide sureties&#151;a scenario which is worse than that of suspected criminals in pre-trial remand;
<P>
bail may be inappropriate for asylum seekers who are normally destitute and are strangers in a strange land;
<P>
there is no right to legal aid, lessening the opportunity to challenge detention;
<P>
no routine bail hearings are foreseen after the 37th day of detention, ignoring the fact that the longer the detention lasts, the more pressing is the need for judicial scrutiny;
<P>
if bail hearings may be held in prisons/detention centre (Clause 30), they are not public and will not be perceived as impartial and independent.
<P>
In the European Context, an individual's deprivation of liberty is usually surrounded by legal safeguards. In the view of UNHCR, and also of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 1971 Immigration Act gives exceptionally wide powers to immigration officers without effective judicial scrutiny as compared to those provided for in other Western European States, Schedule 2, para 16(1), provides: ``A person who may be required to submit to examination . . . may be detained under the authority of an immigration officer.'' Immigration Service Instructions authorize detention only ``where there is no alternative''; and say that the case for detention of an asylum seeker when he first makes his claim, must be particularly strong. The White Paper says that emphasis will be on detention of persons at the end of the asylum process whose removal is imminent. However, contrary to instructions and official policies, the majority of asylum detainees are new arrivals who have not yet received a first decision on their asylum request, and written reasons for detention are not usually given.
<P>
The provisions of the current Bill may also constitute a violation of international human rights law, in particular Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights (see Annex A(i)) and thus the Human Rights Act (which has not yet entered into force) because:
<P>
there is no presumption in favour of liberty,
<P>
consistent anecdotal evidence suggests that the majority of detainees may not be properly informed of the reasons of their arrest,
<P>
* Not printed
<P>
the legal grounds for detention are broad and vague (contrary to the lawfulness-test set by the European Court, which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to foresee the consequences of a certain action), resulting in the detention of 10,000 persons annually
<P>
no meaningful scrutiny of the lawfulness takes place
<P>
in the absence of effective scrutiny by a judicial, independent and impartial review body, the extraordinary powers of detention available to Immigration Officers could result in arbitrary deprivation of liberty.
<P>
With these considerations in mind, UNHCR would like to propose the following amendments to the Asylum Bill:
<P>
1. Grounds for detention should be defined, expressly and narrowly, in the Asylum Bill (see Annex C for concrete proposals)
<P>
2. Individualized written reasons, as opposed to repetition of generic formulas, for detention should be given to asylum seekers at the time of arrest.
<P>
3. Failure of I.S. to respect the deadline for reference to a court (according to Clause 29(4) and (9) before the ninth day of detention) should render detention unlawful.
<P>
4. Failure of the Secretary of State to substantiate the reasons for detention before the judiciary should result in immediate release.
<P>
5. Legal aid should be available for representation at judicial hearings on detention to ensure that judicial scrutiny is effective.
<P>
6. Alternatives to detention should be considered before detention is ordered.
<P>
7. Detention of an asylum seeker for longer than a few weeks should be exceptional; those facing removal following refusal of their claim should never be detained for longer than six months.
<P>
8. There should be automatic monthly judicial review of detention (Clause 29(4) and (5))
<P>
9. There should be specific provision to outlaw the detention of children, except where they are detained with their parents on the eve of removal from Britain. The age of an alleged minor should be determined in accordance with UNHCR guidelines.
<P>
Finally, UNHCR welcomes the provisions in Part VIII of the Bill establishing a statutory framework for the management and administration of detention centres.
<H4><center>Deception</center></H4>
<P>
Clause 16(3) creates the offence of seeking leave to enter the UK by `deception'. Before any scrutiny of an asylum claim by the Asylum Directorate, Clause 16(3) criminalizes a bona fide refugee who is compelled to use false documents to escape persecution. This Clause has the potential of violating Art. 31 of the Refugee Convention (see Annex A (ii)), which prohibits the imposition of penalties on account of illegal entry of asylum seekers. We therefore suggest that Clause 16(3) be amended to ensure conformity with Art. 31 so that it is clear that it does not apply to asylum seekers.
<H4><center>Appeals</center></H4>
<P>
UNHCR welcomes the proposal in Clause 47 that Adjudicators/IAT will henceforth have the power to allow an appeal against refusal of leave to remain on the grounds of breach of human rights, especially Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights.
<P>
Clause 54(3) confirms the practice of not allowing suspensive effect of appeal in `safe third country' cases. UNHCR believes that this makes the appeal ineffective and that the Bill should be amended to allow suspensive effect.
<P>
With regard to `one-stop' appeals, UNHCR would not, in principle, object to such a proposal and in fact would welcome it, providing that there are adequate safeguards in the system to allow for consideration of an asylum claim at any stage of the procedure.
<P>
With regard to the current proposals, it is UNHCR's understanding that clauses 51-52 set out the grounds on which asylum appeals can be lodged. Clause 57 then establishes the procedure under which such appeals may be heard, and expressly refers to the fact that the Special Adjudicator hearing the appeal ``may take into account any evidence which was not available to the Secretary of State when the decision appealed against was taken and which he considers relevant to the appeal''. UNHCR has no objections to this proposal.
<P>
With regard to `non-asylum' appeals, it is UNHCR's understanding that the grounds for such appeals are laid out in clauses 40-46, with Clause 55 setting out the procedure. Clause 55 expressly enables an asylum-related claim to be lodged at this stage, in order to enable a comprehensive appeal on all possibile elements of a case. Furthermore, Clause 56 adds that, should an applicant not have made an asylum-related claim according to clause 55, the applicant cannot rely on these additional grounds where ``the Secretary of State has certified that in his opinion the claim for asylum was made solely for the purpose of delaying the removal from the United Kingdom of the applicant . . .'' (Clause 56(4)). This presupposes some form of examination of the additional (asylum) grounds by the Secretary of State. If this is indeed an accurate understanding of the provisions of Part IV of the Bill, UNHCR would not have objections to the proposed appeals system.
<P>
However, Schedule 4, Part 1, paragraph 9 dealing with manifestly unfounded applications is worrying to UNHCR. While acknowledging that it does not introduce revisions to the current system, apart from the welcome removal of the so-called White List, it perpetuates an existing state of affairs which is of concern to UNHCR, namely the too broad criteria for establishing `manifestly unfounded' claims to include, for port entrants, failure to produce a passport, or production of an invalid passport, without a reasonable explanation.
<P>
In UNHCR's view, the lack of documents, or invalid documents, by that fact alone, is not ground for considering an asylum claim as manifestly unfounded. UNHCR submits that only those cases where the lack of documents is liked to the asylum seeker deliberately attempting to decieve the authorities should be deemed as manifestly unfounded, in which case there would be valid legal grounds for a rebuttable presumption that the claim is manifestly unfounded. The onus would then be on the asylum seeker to rebut this presumption by clarifying the intent behind the actions to show his bona fides.
<P>
Clause 59(5) gives the Immigration Appeals Tribunal (IAT) the unprecedented power to impose a financial penalty on an appellant and his representative, if it considers the appeal to have ``no merit''. Many meritorious appeals are lost because of involuntary omission of important facts, poor interpretation or inadequacy of legal representation. UNHCR proposes the deletion of Clause 59(5) because it may deter meritorious but ill-equipped asylum seekers from appealing. While acknowledging that certain requests for appeal may have no firm legal basis, UNHCR believes that the problem of spurious requests ought to be dealt with not through the imposition of penalties but through the welcome introduction of a registration and enforcement scheme for immigration advisers and immigration service providers, as provided for in Part V of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 73(3) says that support ends when the IAA has determined an asylum seeker's appeal, even if an application for judicial review (JR) is made. UNHCR proposes that the phrase ``as may be prescribed'' at the end of the sub-Clause be replaced by ``unless a court has granted leave for judicial review'' in order not to render an application for judicial review illusory.
<H4><center>Welfare support</center></H4>
<P>
There is no binding legal obligation, per se, on States in international law to provide assistance for all asylum seekers. However, all persons in the territory of the asylum State are entitled to be treated humanely and in dignity while they are waiting for the outcome of their asylum claims. The origins for this entitlement are found in the Preambles to the UDHR, ICCPR and the 
<P>
ICESCR.
<P>
Of most importance to asylum seekers is Article 11 of the ICESCR which places a positive duty on State parties to take ``appropriate steps to ensure realisation of the right'' [to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing and . . . to be free from hunger].
<P>
The work of the Committee on ESCR makes it clear that deliberately retrogressive measures would not be compatible with the ICESCR. Most importantly, a concept of ``minimum core entitlements for all'' is emerging from the work of the Committee, the Special Rapporteur on ESCR and the UN Human Rights Commission.
<P>
All asylum seekers are thus entitled to be treated in dignity and in a way which protects their minimum core entitlements under the ICESCR and the ICCPR. In principle, this may be achieved through an in-kind support scheme such as that proposed. However, the Bill gives the Home Secretary many powers to make secondary regulations. Hence, it is difficult to know how a cashless, in-kind system of support would work in practice.
<P>
UNHCR hopes that the Committee finds the above observations useful, and remains available for further comments, at any time, on general or specific issues.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Ms Hanlan, Mr. van der Vaart, thank you very much for coming before us today. As you know, we are not asking for an opening statement, but if you could introduce yourselves and say who you represent, we will then go straight into questions.
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> On behalf of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, I should like to thank you for having invited us here. My name is Hope Hanlan and I am the representative of the UNHCR to the United Kingdom and Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. van der Vaart:</B> My name is Peter van der Vaart. I am Mrs Hanlan's deputy.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The UNHCR considers that overall the Immigration and Asylum Bill appears to meet international standards and represents significant progress but some areas of concern remain. Is that a fair summary of your evidence?
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> We see limited progress and you are correct that we have some concerns, some of which are rather grave.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes. And you have pointed those out, particularly in the area of detention, but it is to the area of welfare support that I want to turn.
<P>
Also in your evidence to us you say:
<P>
``All asylum seekers are thus entitled to be treated in dignity and in a way which protects their minimum core entitlements under the ICESCR and the ICCPR. In principle, this may be achieved through an in-kind support scheme such as that proposed. However, the Bill gives the Home Secretary many powers to make secondary regulations. Hence, it is difficult to know how a cashless in-kind system of support would work in practice.''
<P>
You think that in principle our proposals would meet the needs. That depends on the detail, but do you not find the concept difficult.
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> We have some difficulties, in particular with the Government establishing a second-class group of children. That could be in violation of certain principles under the rights of the child.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Your evidence clearly says that in principle it could be achieved through an in-kind support scheme such as that proposed.
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> The emphasis is on ``in principle''. In other words, if the Government had absolutely no choice in the matter&#151;some Governments have no choice, but Britain is not among them&#151;yes, in principle, we would have to accept what is being proposed and hope that its implementation was consistent with international standards. We would hope that as a Government, with a long tradition of liberal attitudes but of being fair, you would ensure that the procedures that you plan to set in place were implemented fairly and equally without any privilege or discrimination.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Thank you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> May I ask a quick point to follow that up? Are there any minimum standards that you think should be applied in a support system?
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> The fundamental principle of equal treatment in all respects, particularly concerning children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> May I turn to one of your other main areas of concern which is the question of detention? You said that your basic position was clear and that freedom from arbitrary detention was a basic human right. You expressed some concerns about the operation of the Immigration Act 1971 and the powers that it gave immigration officers and that are obviously used in the Bill. You said in your evidence that the effective judicial scrutiny did not compare with what was provided in other western European states. Could you give us some examples of measures that you see as being effective in other western European states that you would like to see applied in this context to detention?
<P>
<B>Mr. van der Vaart:</B> The deterrent powers of the immigration service are contained in the Immigration Act 1971, which is nearly 30 years old. We think that there were hardly any asylum seekers at the time and the main reason why the powers were defined as they were was with a view to deportation and removal. Prior to removal, people may be detained to ensure that they leave the country.
<P>
Now there are many asylum seekers in detention. There are more than in any other comparable western European country.
<P>
The safeguards in operation in other countries are largely in accordance with the European convention on human rights. Britain, Ireland and Norway are the only countries in which the convention is not yet directly applicable. When the Human Rights Act 1998 comes into force, the convention will be applicable in Britain.
<P>
Other countries are more vigilant in ensuring that their detention policy on asylum seekers is in accordance with article 5 of the European convention. Those countries administer detention, but the lawfulness and reasonableness of such detention is considered through judicial scrutiny in a court of law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Are you saying that the Bill's provisions do not amount to that?
<P>
<B>Peter van der Vaart:</B> That is indeed what I am arguing. Neither existing measures nor the Bill's provisions are sufficient. My colleagues&#151;the other witnesses&#151;have already touched on that matter. The bail proposed in part III is not sufficient to meet such needs.
<P>
When the Bill received its Second Reading on 22 February, the Home Secretary said that officials hearing the application for bail would not have the power to examine.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the lawfulness or otherwise of the detention.''&#151;[Official Report, 22 February 1999; Vol. 326, c. 40.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We must consider whether the detention is lawful and reasonable.
<P>
The Bill and the introduction of periodic bail reviews until the 37th day of detention are a step forward. However, that step is insufficient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> You make a number of detailed proposals, some of which refer to detention. Will you clarify a couple of the changes that you propose?
<P>
You said that failure of the Secretary of State to substantiate the reasons for the detention before the judiciary should result in immediate release.
<P>
In other words failure to substantiate why bail does not arise should result in release.
<P>
<B>Peter van der Vaart:</B> Precisely. The emphasis should be on the presumption of the individual's liberty. Deprivation of liberty is serious, and insufficient or unsubstantiated reasons for it should result in automatic or immediate release of the victim or detainee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> You mentioned the detention of children, saying that it should be exceptional. You said that children should be detained only with their parents on the eve of removal. You then referred to the age of an alleged minor being determined in accordance with UNHCR guidelines. Will you clarify that?
<P>
<B>Peter van der Vaart:</B> The UNHCR is opposed to the detention of children under all circumstances, with the exception which I have mentioned. The guidelines provide guidance on how to determine children's ages, and how that should weigh in a decision to detain. The guidelines are available and I can provide them to Committee members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Let me skip back to the issue of welfare. Should the Bill be passed unamended, it will have the effect of removing those who claim asylum in ports&#151;who constitute half the people currently claiming asylum in UK&#151;from the benefit system and placing them in new cash and support arrangements. We have already heard about that. Do you regard moving people from a system that applies generally to UK residents to a system that applies to a particular group as a forward or backward step?
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> We would consider that a very retrograde step indeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> You mentioned children. I do not know whether you listened to all the evidence, but we heard examples of children not having enough money for school activities. Do you regard it as a serious issue whether a particular child has absolute equality with his or her peer group, in respect of taking part in school activities and so on?
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> A refugee or asylum seeker child is already seriously disadvantaged&#151;by virtue of not being in command of the language, of being in a strange country and of being brought up by parents who are already insecure. To compound all that, those children are denied equality in the playground and are pointed at as the voucher children. We regard that as fundamentally unacceptable and even inhumane.
<P>
I should like to refer to the relevant human rights articles. Article 3 of the convention on the rights of the child states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interest of the child shall be a primary consideration.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We feel that the provisions will not be in the best interest of the child. Article 2 of the same convention declares:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present Convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Finally, you refer to the minimum core entitlements for all in the work of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Would or could the UNHCR do anything if Britain enacted legislation that had the sort of consequences that you are talking about? Do you have any powers? What can you do to assert your view if we fail to respond to your entreaties?
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlon:</B> I wish that we had those powers. We would need to bring pressure to bear, probably to the permanent mission in Geneva, where our headquarters are. We would bring pressure to bear during executive committee meetings, which the UK Government attends and has been a member of since 1954.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I want to clarify your overall view of the Bill. I have heard you say that, in the view of the United Nations, certain provisions are inhumane. On the second page of your evidence, you say in dark type:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Proposals may not meet international standards'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and you list five failures. Further down the page you say that some of the provisions may constitute
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``a violation of international human rights''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and you list a further five serious failings. Do you stand by those comments?

<P>

<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> Yes, we do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> In that case, since those are serious and fundamental criticisms of the Bill, why do you say in the first paragraph of your evidence that the Immigration and Asylum Bill ``does appear to meet international standards''. Is that just a sop to the Government, not to be too critical at first, but to tear the Bill apart later on?
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> Something along those lines.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Following on from that, some of us are concerned about whether the legislation meets international human rights standards. It may be helpful as the Bill progresses to clarify your thoughts and perhaps submit once more to the Committee and say unequivocally how the Bill's provisions sit with our international human rights obligations. The danger is that Ministers&#151;not this Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire, of course&#151;might quote selectively from your briefing to give an impression of approval from you that is not reflected in what you have said to us until now.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to return to welfare support, which for some of us is the most troubling aspect of a troubling Bill. You talk in your section on welfare support about the concept of the minimum core entitlement. Have the United Nations commissioner on Human Rights or the special rapporteur gone any way towards specifying the minimum core entitlement? I ask because, once again, if members of the Standing Committee are to judge the Government's proposals, we need a measure against which to compare them. Are you able to say anything, or can you come back to us with anything specific about what, in your view, minimum core entitlements would be?
<P>
<B>Mr. van der Vaart:</B> As a United Nations organisation, we have global norms. They are fairly low, and are reflected in the international covenants&#151;in particular, the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights, which is also quoted in our submission.
<P>
When it comes to core rights and entitlements, we think of basic services: housing, food, health and education. That will mean something different in Mali or Niger from what it means in Britain. We do not want is an abyss of discrimination between citizens and residents of Britain who are destitute and those who come here as asylum seekers. It stigmatises all those people, as was explained so eloquently earlier this afternoon. The bare minimum in this country is higher than the international human rights obligations.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> With respect, I understand that the issues are relative. However, if we are to make a judgment on the arrangements that the Government are trying to put through Parliament, it would help us if you, as a representative of the leading international organisation in the field, were able to be more specific about whether the arrangements set out&#151;given the United Kingdom context&#151;meet your concept of minimum core entitlement. As we examine the Bill clause by clause, we can deal only in specifics. So if you would go away and reconsider, and come back with specifics, in a UK context, that would be of great value to those of us who wish to give the Bill the proper scrutiny that it deserves. When we consider the Bill in Standing Committee, we will move beyond generalities and into specifics.
<P>
My final question relates to children, which you, Miss Hanlan, mentioned, because children are also of concern to me. Can you expand a little more on the position of children in terms of the Bill? I take your point about voucher children. I have a seven-year-old child, and I am uneasy with the notion of voucher children in the playground. Do you have anything to add to that point?
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> May I first respond to your request that we be more specific? I think that is quite difficult and I shall explain why. Some Governments will take a minimalist view&#151;even western European Governments&#151;and we have seen a dangerous tendency towards minimalism in legislation concerning refugees and asylum seekers. If Britain wants to be part of a particular category of Governments who prefer to deal in deterrence instead of protection, then of course your Government will go into a different category. In other words, if you are aiming for best practices&#151;and this is what UNHCR expouses&#151;
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I do not want to take up the Committee's time, but I want to make myself clear.
<P>
Most Committee members want to make the Bill as good as possible. We will be greatly aided in doing that if you can reflect and be more specific about the standards that you wish the UK Government to meet? Otherwise, we remain in the territory of assertion.
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> We would be delighted to do that.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Good. I wanted to hear that.
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> However, you must understand that we will aim for best practice, not a minimalist approach.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Absolutely: that is fantastic.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall explain the correct procedures for submitting further evidence. If that is to be done through the Clerk of the Committee to the whole Committee, it must take place by the end of proceedings on Monday 22 March. Obviously, after that, organisations can send evidence or amendments to Committee members. However, formal evidence must be submitted by Monday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall:</B> Will you provide clarification on welfare support and the sentence about in-kind support that appears on page 5 of your evidence? When the Minister asked you about that, you said that, in principle, standards of dignity for asylum seekers could be missed by an in-kind support system. However, you said that that would occur only in cases in which Governments have no other choice, which did not apply to our Government.
<P>
Will you elaborate on that? Which Governments have no choice about what they do in their own countries?
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> If you work in a refugee camp in Sudan, Somalia or Angola, the Government must give refugees bags of rice, beans, dried fish and salt as a package of food. There is no other choice: there are no shops and there are hundreds of thousands of people to be fed. So the Government, with the aid of UNHCR, is obliged to give in-kind support. If cash were given, there would be nothing to buy, and nowhere to buy it. Britain is not such a country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> It might have been helpful to have made that clear in your evidence. You say that special conditions apply to refugee camps in certain parts of the world and cannot apply to western European countries.
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> It is not that they cannot apply, but they should not apply if best practices are espoused.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Using the same strict criteria that you have used to criticise the Bill, would you accept that current arrangements do not meet such standards?
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> I do not think that we would accept that, and I will ask Peter van der Vaart to expand on that. Certainly, giving cash to people allows them to have a modicum of choice. Much cash might not be needed, but they are not being denied the dignity of being able to buy something.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> However, under current arrangements, anyone who applies for asylum in-country, rather than at port of entry, gets goods in kind. Are you saying that existing arrangements do not meet UN standards?
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> Yes. What is done for the most deprived sector of British society should equally apply to the deprived individuals who have sought refuge in Britain.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Do you accept that the UN resolutions that you read out were intended primarily to deal with how people are permanently treated and discriminated against in some countries? Are you saying that those resolutions strictly apply to a short-term arrangement, which, under the Bill is intended to be as little as two months in most cases, although it might be six months in some cases? Are you saying that Britain would be in serious breach of the UN guidelines by introducing that arrangement for a six-month period?
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> For one day, you would be in breach of what we would consider to be best practice because you would be discriminating during that day against the refugee child as opposed to the average poor citizen.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> When I have moved abroad for a short time, I have never moved into permanent accommodation straight away. I have always found myself living in temporary accommodation. It is a normal state of affairs when you move to another country for a short time. We are talking about a period of only six months and we have all accepted from previous witnesses that a small proportion of the total number of people are genuine refugees. Do you seriously suggest that under those circumstances we must apply the strict code that you have laid down?
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> I was not aware that the previous witnesses had concluded that a small percentage would be genuine refugees. But we were talking about a cashless system. We were not addressing the issue of accommodation being provided. We were talking about the absence of cash.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> So you accept the possibility of detention arrangements as an acceptable part of a refugee strategy? Those are the same arrangements that exist in other countries around Europe where people may be kept in detention centres. Would you accept that as a legitimate part of a refugee strategy so long as the people within those centres were given cash?
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> In other countries people are not specifically kept in detention centres but in reception centres and are able to come and go. There is a significant difference between being in detention, being denied your liberty and your freedom of movement, and being in a reception centre and having reporting requirements with which you are obliged to comply.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> On a slightly different point, can you tell us whether the relevant human rights conventions recognise a distinction between those asylum seekers who are in fear of persecution and refugees&#151;not necessarily bogus ones&#151;who are genuinely fleeing a general condition of economic deprivation rather than threats to their lives or freedom? Are those two categories clearly distinguished in the obligations that are placed on us as to what we have to do for people in need of asylum?

<P>

<B>Mr. van der Vaart:</B> UNHCR's mandate extends only to refugees: those people who have a well-founded fear of persecution. Our mandate does not extend to economic refugees. They are not refugees in the sense of the word that we understand. We are pleading and arguing for the treatment of asylum seekers who are potential refugees. While it is being determined whether they are refugees, these asylum seekers should be given the same minimum as other destitute people in Britain. I cannot comment on economic migrants.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I feel it necessary to ask this question as I felt that some of our earlier witnesses tended to blur that distinction. Do you agree with me that it is important to keep our attention focused on those people who really are fleeing for fear of genuine persecution or life-threatening situations so that the vital need to protect them is not stymied by too wide a definition which clogs up the process with the adverse consequences that we have seen?
<P>
<B>Mr. van der Vaart:</B> We are in agreement with you but we are talking about a situation in which it has yet to be determined whether the person presenting himself as a refugee is indeed a refugee. The period can be long. It can extend to eight years. It is open to question whether the targets of two and six months for the entire procedure are going to be met from April 2001 or beyond.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Hope Hanlan:</B> I should like to emphasise that the High Commissioner herself has emphasised in various speeches that UNHCR is mandated uniquely to deal with refugees as opposed to economic migrants. However, if a person has been here with no determination of their case, for eight years, if a chap has been locked up&#151;detained, as we know some people are detained,&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt you. I should like to thank you for the evidence you have given, which I am sure will be extremely useful when the Committee comes to consider the Bill in more detail. Under Standing Orders of the House, the Committee has now sat for three hours, so we have to adjourn until tomorrow afternoon at four o'clock.
