<H4><center>Education committees to include parent representatives</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): I beg to move amendment No. 131, in page 9, line 15, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(g)which bodies the parent representatives report to and the mechanism by which reports can be communicated.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment relates to a matter that was touched on briefly in our previous sitting, namely, the mechanism by which parent representatives report and then communicate their reports to other parents and take soundings from them. It is not clear how the mechanism will be put into practice. We believe that such a procedure should be part of the Bill, hence the proposed additional paragraph (g) outlined in the amendment.
<P>
There seems to be confusion among the governors and the governing bodies about the exact remit that such parents will have. I am not saying that we do not welcome the involvement of parents, but there must be clear guidelines on the reporting procedures, stating which body the parents represent. For example, a parent who may sit on a specific governing body of a school could not be deemed to be representing that body, given the corporate significance of the governing body. How does the Under-Secretary envisage parents carrying out their roles and how representative will they be of parents' views? How will those views be communicated to other parents, so that the parents can be truly representative of others rather than acting as individuals expressing their personal perspective? Will the reports be communicated by written means or through meetings?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): I echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning). If the Under-Secretary casts her mind back to our previous debate on the clause, she will recall that we pressed her on the issue of parental representation. We discussed the importance of ensuring that parents who sit on education committees represent parents, not the governing body.
<P>
We have accepted the practical matter of how to elect a group of people who are representative of the parents the Government proposed that they be elected from among serving parent governors. Ministers have made it clear that, although parents on the education committee would have been elected from among parent governors, they would be wearing not governing body hats, but parent representative hats. It is necessary to take that debate further this morning and to receive clarification of how we can ensure that parent representatives elicit the views of other parents to put to the education committee. We do not want them simply to put forward their own views or those of the governing body, given that the views of parents will differ across different phases.
<P>
It is important for parent governors to understand what issues affect other parents. For example, parent governor representatives from a primary school may reflect the views of parents in the secondary sector and vice versa. Although the Under-Secretary accepts that the representative speaks with a parental voice and not a governing body voice, it is important that the Committee should know how that parental voice is to be determined and what liaison and communication will take place to ensure that the views put forward are genuinely the parents' views and not the views only of a school's governing body.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): The Liberal Democrats support the amendment. However, although we want the Government to accept the sense of it, we hope that it will not be pressed to a vote.
<P>
We did not support the principle of parents being on education committees with full voting rights, but it was accepted by the Committee and we must now make the best use of it. We want to know how parent representatives will report back. We are especially concerned that action zone forums may not include a local education authority representative. We therefore want to know about the inter-relationship between the parent representatives on education committees and on action zone forums.
<P>
We are also interested in who will pay. If we go the whole hog and say that because parent representatives will be full members of the education committee they should have access to all the information usually available to education committee members, all that information will have to be sent to all schools. The bill could be huge. Who will foot it?
<P>
The other matter that I want the Under-Secretary to contemplate is that if parent representatives are to be full members of the education committee, they will obviously take part in all the other activities of the committee. Does the hon. Lady envisage all that information, too, being communicated to parents? A host of issues are raised by the amendment. I trust that the Under-Secretary's response will be satisfactory.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> The Government are sympathetic to the thinking behind the amendment. It is important that those elected to represent parents on education committees do not serve in isolation. Their decisions should be informed by what parents have to say; they should be accountable and give parents feedback on their actions. That is part of the democratic process that we want to ensure.
<P>
We shall resist the amendment because we do not want primary or secondary legislation to restrict the mechanisms that could be used to allow feedback or to listen to parents. The mechanism might vary it could be anything from a newsletter report to issuing a summary of what has happened in the education committee. A local newspaper could run a monthly[Ms Estelle Morris]
column and, in some areas, it might be appropriate for one newspaper to report on all schools in a local education authority area. If we define in legislation how representatives can inform parents, we may restrict them from adopting mechanisms that are more appropriate in their particular circumstances.
<P>
In the light of my comments, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn. We shall issue guidance to make it clear that we expect feedback from governors and that we want parents to know how to get in touch with their representatives on the education committee. We shall set out a series of ways by which feedback can be achieved, but without restricting people to using that list. We shall invite them to be imaginative and creative.
<P>
We want to see examples of good practice models of how feedback could take place. If governors think that they have a better or more effective way of feeding back information about their activities to parents and other governors, I should want them to be able to adopt and develop it. That good practice could then be used in the next series of guidance notes that we issue to governors. That is why we do not wish to put it in primary or secondary legislation. We want to see how the system works. Nobody knows the best way of feeding back information. I am happy to put on record the Government's firm intention that parents' representatives should not operate in isolation. Appropriate ways of listening to parents and feeding back information will be made clear in guidance.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I have mixed feelings about the Under-Secretary's response. If the Government had acted in good faith on the promise that they made during the first sitting that before the Committee had to deal with such details, they would provide us with advance copies of draft regulations and codes of practice we would not be in this position.
<P>
The Under-Secretary says I accept her word that the Government do not want to view parents in isolation and that the format of accountability must be flexible. I understand why she says that she does not want to have a rigid format in primary legislation because that might deter some people from using avenues that they might find advantageous in their locality. However, we are reaching the heart of the Bill, and I ask Ministers to provide the Committee with the information that they promised us at the beginning so that we can see the code of practice. A code of practice would be a good way to deal with this matter.
<P>
I urge Ministers to provide the codes of practice for the Committee to scrutinise. We have reached clause 9, yet the Government have not provided us with a single document in advance of this sitting. Therefore, we have to take decisions on the Bill's detail in the absence of any specific information on which to make a judgment. I hope that Ministers will heed our request the Committee needs more information on the important issues that we are discussing. It is with great reluctance that I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 105, in page 9, line 15, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(7A)Regulations may also make provision 
<P>
(a)enabling the Secretary of State to determine, where he considers it expedient to do so in view of the small number of maintained schools in relation to which a committee or sub-committee acts, that the requirement imposed on the committee or sub-committee by virtue of subsection (6) is to have effect as if it referred to representatives of parents of registered pupils (rather than representatives of parent governors) at those schools;
<P>
(b)for any regulations under subsections (7) to have effect, where the Secretary of State makes any such determination, with such modifications as may be prescribed.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 106, in page 9, line 16, leave out "subsection (6)" and insert "subsection (6) and (7A)".
<P>
No. 107, in page 9, line 16, leave out "has" and insert "and `parent governor' have". [Mr. Byers.]
<P>
Clause 9, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Before the Committee considers the clauses on education action zones, I should like to deal with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton on the availability of draft regulations and codes of practice in advance of the relevant debates. I refer to the Minister's remarks in the first sitting. He listed several specific regulations, codes of practice and so forth that he understood the Committee would need properly to debate the relevant clauses. He said:
"During the next couple of weeks, we shall issue a further consultation document that will expose the Government's thinking on delegation."<P>

<P>
He said that precisely a couple of weeks ago. He also said:
"We shall also provide full details about school organisation, to which the hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) has referred." [Official Report, Standing Committee A, 20 January 1998; c. 24-25.]<P>

<P>
He stressed the fact that he recognised the importance of the Government setting out their thinking on the budgetary framework and on delegated powers for schools before the Committee considers those matters.
<P>
I understand that even the clauses on education action zones pave the way for a regulation-making power. The Minister did not refer to those powers a fortnight ago; he referred specifically to the other matters that I have mentioned, all of which appear in the Bill immediately after the clauses on education action zones which we shall consider next.
<P>
I look to you, Mr. Gale, to reinforce a widely-held view in the Committee that the Government should redeem the pledges that they made a fortnight ago to enable the Committee to make progress. I hope that we shall be able to debate the delegated framework by the end of the week and school organisation committees by early next week, but, so far, we do not have the material that the Minister promised the Committee to allow that.

<P>

<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. I gave that undertaking during our first sitting; we intend to meet it. It may help the Committee if, when we convene at 4.30 pm, I say precisely when the information will be provided and on which clauses we expect to have major debates on the relevant issues. That had been my intention; I am pleased to confirm it to the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The provision of papers is a matter for the Government. The Chair always takes the view that providing the best possible information for the Committee enables the best possible discussion of the Bill. The right hon. Member for Charnwood will have heard what the Minister said.
<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Establishment of education action zones</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 139, in page 9, line 20, leave out from "considers" to end and insert
"he can reasonably justify such action.".
<P>
The amendment would replace the words
"that it is expedient to do so"
<P>
with the words
"he can reasonably justify such action".
<P>
During our last sitting, we had an interesting debate about when and where the Minister, or the Secretary of State, would exercise his powers. We saw both sides of the Jekyll-and-Hyde character of the Government in the debate on clause 8. We heard Mr. Byers say 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is customary to refer to hon. Members either by rank Minister or by their constituency.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Gale. The Minister for School Standards said:
"It was not the civil servants who were asking for those powers; they were reluctant for us to have them. The Secretary of State and I wanted those powers".
<P>
Clearly, we need to restrain the powerful urges of the Minister and his Department. When we consider education action zones, which open up a whole new avenue for the exercise of the Minister's power, it will be incumbent on us to show the Minister ways in which he can exercise restraint. Later in that debate, the Minister said:
"all Secretaries of State and Ministers, in exercising any powers, always have to show that they are acting in a proper and reasonable manner." [Official Report, Standing Committee A, 29 January 1998; c. 211, 213.]
<P>
It therefore seems sensible to write a notion of reasonableness into clause 10.
<P>
As we know, there is a common law right of judicial review. However, we also know that it is open to Government through Parliament to override the common law. The entire Bill is deeply worrying because of the enormous powers that will accrue to the Department for Education and Employment. I fear that again and again we shall hear from the Minister the mantra that it is all right because there is the power of judicial review, which is somehow a belt-and-braces restriction on how the powers will be exercised. If it is intended that the powers should only be exercised reasonably, we should write that into the Bill. I hope that on reflection the Minister will accept the amendment and similar amendments to a number of other clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden (Blackpool, South):</B> The hon. Gentleman raised the question of judicial review in a negative fashion. To turn his point round, does not he consider that to accept the amendment would be to provide a mischievous feast for lawyers of any organisation that wanted to challenge the Minister?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is to avoid mischievous and lengthy legal proceedings that the Bill should spell out exactly how and when powers will be exercised. Otherwise, there will surely be recourse to the courts. If we pass the Bill unamended, we will not know exactly what we have passed, because we will not know how the courts will interpret the Bill. If, however, we spell out clearly and carefully exactly how the powers of the Bill will be defined and restrained, the scope for legal argument will also be restrained.
<P>
<B>Helen Jones </B>(Warrington, North): Will the hon. Gentleman explain how the concept of reasonableness in his amendment differs from the concept of reasonableness in judicial review? If it is different, he has an argument for his amendment, but if it is not, there is no need for the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Lady did not listen to my opening remarks, when I explained that the doctrine of judicial review is a common law right that has grown up in the past 20 years, and which could be slapped down by a dictatorial Government [Interruption.] God forbid that we should have one, although some fear that we have one already.
<P>
The other aspect is, where is the burden of proof? I am not a lawyer, but as a layman it seems to me if a case is taken to court, one has to prove that the Secretary of State has acted unreasonably. If we incorporated the amendment, the burden of proof might shift more on to the Secretary of State to prove that he or she had acted reasonably, which would be a thoroughly good thing.
<P>
In any event, I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us what he considers to be reasonable. Is it reasonable for the Secretary of State to act against the wishes of the parents, the schools and the local education authority? Is it reasonable for him or her to act against the wishes of one group if the other two support him? Is it reasonable to act if only one of the three groups support the Secretary of State's actions? Is there a test of reasonableness that relates to the views of those involved?
<P>
Does the Minister consider it reasonable, in any circumstances, to set up an education action zone in respect of just one school? A strict reading of the clause, and subsequent clauses, suggests that that could be done. Let us say that the LEA has plans to close a particular school, but the parents appeal to the Secretary of State to keep it open by overriding the LEA and making it part of an education action zone, either on its own or as part of a group of schools he would thereby be pre-empting the democratic decision of the LEA.
<P>
Will the Minister consider the example of a school although it is not failing whose methodology or way of teaching runs counter to the philosophy and thinking of the Secretary of State and his Department? Does the Minister agree that it would be unreasonable to try to create an education action zone predominantly on the[Mr. St. Aubyn]
pretext that the type of education being offered was wrong in the Secretary of State's view?
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> In supporting amendment No. 139, perhaps I should say that I have no intention of speaking about the Minister's powerful urges about which I have no personal experience, I hasten to add. It is a reasonable amendment, in fact, it could be argued that it does not go far enough. Some of the issues arising from the amendment have been ably set out by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn). As we have seen from Government publicity, the setting up of education action zones is one of the key areas of policy yet it is noticeable that there is scant detail in the Bill about how education action zones will operate and, more particularly, how they will fit in with all the other powers that we have already agreed will be given to the Secretary of State. We shall be coming to clauses giving extra powers of intervention to local education authorities.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept that the Secretary of State should act only in a reasonable manner in setting up an education action zone. He cannot complain about having to justify setting up an EAZ, which is what the amendment asks. That is important. I hope that in responding, the Minister will explain how EAZs fit in with other powers of the Secretary of State and of LEAs that are set out in the Bill.
<P>
If, as required by the Bill, an LEA sets up an education development plan for its area, and if several schools disagree with part of that plan, would it be reasonable for the Secretary of State to agree that they should constitute an EAZ? How do EAZs fit in with the various powers in the Bill and how will they operate? If they are a key element of policy, the Minister owes the Committee more detail on that. At the moment, the proposal is like some sort of gimmick that has been added to the Bill. I hope that that is not the intention. It would be unfortunate if we did not get more detail and if the Minister were not willing to accept that he has to be able to justify the establishment of an EAZ in particular circumstances if not, we would be tempted to think that the proposal is included simply as a gimmick and not as a key element of Government policy.
<P>
If the Minister maintains that he does not want reasonably to justify the setting up of an EAZ, I hope that he will explain more clearly how the Government believe an EAZ will fit into the powers being given to the Secretary of State and LEAs. Some of those issues will arise on other clauses, but it is important that the general issue of the circumstances in which the Secretary of State can set up an EAZ, as a key element of operation, are made clear to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Ms Joan Ryan </B>(Enfield, North): The amendment is at best misguided, if not a complete misunderstanding of the issue. EAZs are an innovative way of raising standards and they are not, as has been suggested, entirely to do with failing schools. They are to do with schools that face challenges but which might be doing so successfully. It is interesting that we have heard the word "justify" so often. In fact, it is up to the applicants to justify their application. The proposal will not be foisted on people; partnerships will come together to bid to be an EAZ.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> If EAZs are not to be foisted on people, is the hon. Lady saying that unless the schools concerned have the support of their LEA, the EAZs should not go ahead?
<P>
<B>Ms Ryan:</B> The partnership must justify its application. Criteria have been published and were sent to LEAs in January. Those that wish to form a partnership will know exactly on what grounds they must make their bid. That is part of accountability.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford did not adequately answer the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones) on judicial review. We do not make and remake legislation when there is no apparent need to do so and none has been demonstrated in this case. We know that the Minister must act reasonably, otherwise there can be judicial reviews. Why should we suddenly create some other procedure? I have heard no justification that would make that reasonable.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> To answer the hon. Lady's question directly, the reason is that the powers in the Bill are wide ranging and unfettered, yet they hinge on the idea of having to act reasonably. That should be spelt out in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Ryan:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not made his case. There is a degree of nitpicking opposition to the whole concept of EAZs is not being openly expressed. EAZs are about raising standards. They are about helping and supporting urban or rural schools in deprived areas. They will support all those in the community who want to ensure that standards are raised to give children the best possible future and the ability to reach their potential. That will enable us to have the benefit of the skills and talents of those children.
<P>
The case has not been made. The criteria are absolutely clear and judicial review exists if there is a problem. The amendment is not justified.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel </B>(South-West Bedfordshire): I want to make a few comments about the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford. He drew attention to line 23, which refers to "any particular maintained schools". He emphasised the plural of the word "school". In theory, we could be discussing Leafy Lane high school or Park View high school there is a school with a name like that in my constituency, so I will avoid that, but Leafy Lane conjures up visions of the green belt. It might be named Raynsford close or Prescott drive, but perhaps we should avoid that subject.
<P>
I want to reinforce the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford about the relationship of clause 10 to the powers of local authorities to deal with surplus school places. In Bedfordshire, we have the same school system as that in Norfolk schools for five to nine-year-olds; nine to 13-year-olds; and 13 to 18-year-olds.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): It is not the same.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> Perhaps it is not; I stand corrected. I thought that Norfolk had middle schools like those in Bedfordshire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It might help the hon. Gentleman to know that part of my constituency has a middle school structure that is the same as the one that he has described.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> Then the Minister will know of the problems and the challenges that can arise from that, especially the need to ensure the correct funding for children aged nine to 13 when they are two years away from their GCSEs.
<P>
Bedfordshire was a hung council from 1981 until 1 May last year. The Conservatives now have a majority of one. Between 1981 and 1997, there was much talk about how to deal with surplus school places, of which there were 12,000, but the parties could not agree. With no overall majority, that is a recipe for failure.
<P>
As there are so many surplus school places, the local education authority cannot spend its money to best advantage. It cannot solve the problem until it has the money to provide schools in the parts of the county where they are needed and close schools in which there are surplus places. The Government, like the previous Government, will not give the authority additional money if it fails to deal with the problem of surplus school places. That is understandable. The Government and the Audit Commission expect the local education authority to tackle that problem.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is very interesting, but I find it hard to relate the hon. Gentleman's remarks to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> I am bringing my remarks back to "particular maintained schools", Mr. Gale, and I will end in 38 seconds if I can.
<P>
If nothing is done about the problem of surplus school places, I understand that one of two things will happen. First, the Government could intervene and say, "We will bring in an education action zone because we think that it is essential. The only way to improve education is to do something about surplus school places and to direct money to areas where it is needed in the county, rather than to those where it is not needed."
<P>
Secondly, if the county council continues to be unable to agree on how to deal with the problem, it could go to the Government and say, "We cannot agree among ourselves on what to do about surplus school places and therefore we think you should establish an education action zone and take over the matter." There are one or two angles on that. My hon. Friend tabled a wide, probing amendment, but he rightly picked up this problem for schools which opens up a whole new world for the Government. Local education authorities, which for years have had the problem of surplus school places, want to know whether an education action zone would deal with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The proposition that in using his powers under the clause, the Secretary of State should not merely be required to satisfy himself that it is expedient which is an unattractive concept to use the powers, but should show within the context of a broad framework of policy that it is reasonable, is entirely proper. As my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Sir D. Madel) suggested, it would allow us to examine rather more broadly what the Government intend in proposing this new structure of an education action zone and when they would consider it either reasonable or expedient, but preferably reasonable, to use the powers contained within this part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Hope </B>(Corby): Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that places like Corby have been left in chaos by our inherited education system of LEA schools, grant-maintained schools and city technology colleges? People are not working together. There are variable resources and standards. The right hon. Gentleman's apparent objection to education action zones suggests that he is not in favour of action by this Government to raise standards for children in all schools, both secondary and primary. Can he not see that EAZs are one way in which this Government are taking action, which his Government failed to do?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind hon. Members that we are discussing amendment No. 139, which is fairly precise in its terms. I shall take what has been said in the debate into account when we reach clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Hope) should contain his impatience. He assumed that I was about to make a speech opposing the concept of education action zones. In fact, I was the only Front-Bench spokesman at the Bradford education conference who supported Professor Barber and the Government's idea of education action zones.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Does the right hon. Gentleman recall that during my speech at Bradford I made it clear that I was an even greater supporter of education action zones than the Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) offers the greatest support for education action zones, just as he did for grant-maintained schools some years ago.
<P>
One of the key contributions from Professor Barber was his suggestion that one of the freedoms the Government were interested in introducing in the context of education action zones was the freedom for Procter and Gamble to run schools where there was felt to be a need to rise to the challenge to use the words of the hon. Member for Enfield, North (Ms Ryan) presented by the education system in that area.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath was less than enthusiastic about the proposition that Procter and Gamble had a role to play. That was the basis of my remark that I was more fulsome in my backing for the Government's policy than he was on that occasion. However, the hon. Gentleman may seek to catch your eye, Mr. Gale, to define his position and profess himself even more enthusiastically in favour of the Government's policy than I have suggested.
<P>
We must clarify what the Government mean by "reasonable" and when it would be reasonable to use[Mr. Dorrell]
the powers in the Bill. The problem for the Government, and the reason why an amendment introducing the concept of reasonableness is needed, have been well illustrated in the contributions from Government Back Benchers this morning. The hon. Member for Enfield, North welcomed, rather fulsomely, education action zones as an innovative way to promote education standards.
<P>
There is a sense in which it is not a particularly new idea. We spent some time during the past few sittings debating the role of the LEA, the education development plan and the focus on what the Government see as the importance of a planned system in each LEA area for improving education standards. That is exactly what the education action zone is not. The hon. Member for Corby said that there was some variety to rephrase his remarks in education provision in his constituency and that that made matters more difficult. However, the Government's policy on education action zones is precisely to allow greater variety than the education development plan and the LEA-dominated education service would sometimes provide. The hon. Gentleman should explain how his aversion to variety can be reconciled with the Minister's enthusiasm for introducing Procter and Gamble into the management of Corby schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> Has not the right hon. Gentleman read the clause, which refers to powers to provide for
"schools to constitute collectively an education action zone"?<P>

<P>
It is a matter of schools working together. That is a concept that the right hon. Gentleman ignores in his evaluation the concept of schools, teachers, governors and parents working in the collective interest of the children in their area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am all in favour of schools and professional teachers working in the interests of each child in the school. It is by meeting those individual needs that the collective interest is best served. I do not favour the proposition that decisions about the type of school that would best meet the needs of individual children and of the area as a whole can be made only collectively. The hon. Member for Corby apparently believes that that proposition is true. I am pleased to support his hon. Friends on the Labour Front Bench, who appear to disagree with him. They are right and he is wrong.
<P>
The amendment is intended to tease out what the Government regard as a reasonable set of circumstances in which to use the relevant powers. The first and most obvious question is why it can never be reasonable in Wales to use a power that is so fulsomely welcomed in Corby and in Enfield, North. Is that an example of Wales opting out of new Labour? We know that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), is not the most uncritical supporter of new Labour ideas. It would be interesting to hear his answer to my question.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Peter Hain):</B> The right hon. Gentleman's intervention is about as surprising as a tabloid picture of the Spice Girls. Circumstances are different in Wales, as I shall be happy to argue later, given the opportunity. We support the Government's policy in England and may well apply it in Wales after consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> It is all very well the Under-Secretary saying that he may make that decision after consultation. A bit more than consultation will be needed, as the Bill explicitly denies the power to the Secretary of State for Wales. Subsection (7) states:
"Unless the Secretary of State by order otherwise provides, nothing in this Chapter applies in relation to Wales."<P>

<P>
I should still be interested to hear why circumstances are different in Wales.
<P>
Secondly, it is important for the Committee, and, more importantly, the education world, to be given by the Government a clearer understanding about the circumstances in which they would consider it reasonable to use the power. Would it apply to schools with specific educational problems or to feeder areas with specific social problems? Perhaps the formulation given earlier by the Education Under-Secretary is right the power applies to any school that faces a challenge. Probably the professional teachers at any school in the country, maintained or private, would regard their job as challenging, and quite rightly so. Relating the power to a school that faces a challenge does not confine it at all. We want to know when the Government think it will be reasonable to use this power, in what type of school and in what circumstances.
<P>
Thirdly, when an education action zone is succeeding, can it possibly be reasonable to bring it to an end, as is provided for in the clause? If a zone has been extended to five years because the first three years have been successful, we are asked to accept that it is then reasonable for a successful proposal automatically to be concluded. What is reasonable from the point of view of parents and children about the automatic ending of the provision?
<P>
Fourthly, under clause 10(3) the Secretary of State may add a failing school or a school that is subject to special measures. In other words, a school that is subject to clause 15 can be added to an education action zone, but the implication of the proposal seems to be that no other school, however reasonable, can be added to a zone once it is established. I do not see the sense in such a provision. If the only type of school that can be added to an existing education action zone under the Bill is one that falls within the terms of the clause, it calls into question the Government's proposition that it is a set of ideas that applies outside areas where there is educational difficulty.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford tabled an amendment that would impose a proper constraint on the exercise of ministerial discretion. Discussion of that amendment provides a welcome opportunity to probe the Minister and his Welsh colleague on what they regard as a reasonable set of circumstances in which to use the powers in the clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Sometimes when I am in the House especially when I am sitting in this Committee I think that it is like Alice in Wonderland 
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is not that interesting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I cannot recall an occasion in the past 18 years when the former Administration was reasonable in its education policy, but the right hon. Member for Charnwood and his hon. Friends want the beginning of every clause of every education Bill to state that in exercising his powers the Secretary of State should be required to act reasonably.
<P>
I had hoped that we were coming to the end of the constant battle between the Government and LEAs, schools and any other person or body who wants to improve the lot of our school children, and starting to work on the premise that Secretaries of State do act reasonably. As the Under-Secretary said earlier, if the Secretary of State is found not to act reasonably, it should be sufficient that there is proper recourse to the courts, through judicial review.
<P>
The Minister must consider the issue of reasonableness in the clause, especially the introduction of education action zones. I suspect that the hon. Member for Guildford was thinking beyond the narrow political point, for which I give him credit, and trying to get more detail from the Minister on questions that need answers. I hope that the Minister will provide those answers when he replies to the debate. For example, the LEAs have been told that they still have a role. The Secretary of State's letter to the Local Government Association made it clear that LEAs will retain their powers but in respect of what functions will an LEA have a veto over the education action zone? Will there be any circumstances in which the LEA has a veto? We need to know, because such a veto would be reasonable. Over which functions will a business have a veto, if it is leading an education action zone? Will it have a veto over LEA decisions? If the business is one of the United States companies that were mentioned in The Sunday Times article, how do we know that it will act reasonably? The Minister will meet a host of such companies in the Tea Room later.
<P>
How do we know that the Government will not agree to a bid through which business intends to make a profit from providing education? Would it be reasonable to know the level of profit that a company could make from an education action zone and from the taxpayer before such a zone was set up and before the business leaves it? It is important that those questions are answered before we give the Bill unqualified support.
<P>
What relationship will exist between education action zone representatives and the LEA schools admissions forum? Will there be a specific relationship that can be spelt out? Will it be set out in regulations? What relationship will education action zone schools have with the LEA's local management of schools scheme? Will education action zones be able to vary LMS criteria, independent of the LEA? The Minister must answer all those questions so that we can know that the Secretary of State will act reasonably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> First, I apologise for my sparse attendance in the Committee, which has been due to the Committee stage of the Government of Wales Bill being on the Floor of the House. However, my hon. Friend the Whip can summon me at any time to defend our sparse majority in Committee.
<P>
Wales is different, and the clause reflects that because the Government are committed to devolution. The previous Government were certainly not committed to that policy. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for acknowledging the difference and for accepting many points that the Welsh Office made.
<P>
Wales may require education action zones in a form that is different from that envisaged for England. In Wales, there are no large conurbations that include groups of struggling schools that are close together. Our urban areas contain a mixture of high and low performing schools, which are close together. Wales also comprises many rural areas, where the sparsity of schools renders grouping them in clusters difficult.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Will the Minister reflect on the comments of the hon. Member for Corby about collective operations between schools? Collective operations could work well for high and low performing schools that are close together, provided that the schools learn from each other.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> That may be true. I thank the hon. Lady for expressing her support for Government policy. We will investigate that possibility with local authorities.
<P>
Our LEAs contain far fewer schools than most of their English counterparts. Therefore, we can provide attention more readily to struggling schools. As a Minister in the Welsh Office, I have that advantage over my hon. Friends the Minister for School Standards and the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment.
<P>
Few schools in Wales have been identified as failing schools. The Welsh Office has worked with LEAs and Her Majesty's chief inspector to turn around those few schools 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister says that Welsh LEAs tend to be smaller than English LEAs and that, therefore, it is easier for the existing structures to deal with failing schools and turn them round. However, the Minister for School Standards claims that EAZs' objectives are rather broader than that. Can we hear the collective UK Government view on the circumstances in which they believe that the powers in the clauses will be used most appropriately? Is it when schools are failing or is it broader than that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> If the right hon. Gentleman can contain himself for a minute, he will hear the answer straight from the horse's mouth from my hon. Friend the Minister for School Standards.
<P>
There are only 22 LEAs in Wales, so I am able to meet directors and chairs of education in one room and to hammer out strategies and, if necessary, introduce education action zones. We intend to consult about their introduction. There is no difference in policy; it is a question of applying the policy in a more flexible and developed way in line with the Government's wider policies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Guildford for his amendment, which has allowed us to[Mr. Byers]
discuss in detail the role and function of an education action zone within the context of what it is reasonable for the Secretary of State to establish. It provides a convenient peg to hang the debate on, but I shall explain later why the addition of the concept of reasonableness would be inappropriate. First, I must deal with some of the issues surrounding that concept.
<P>
EAZs are not just for schools that are failing in terms of the usual Ofsted definition; they are also relevant to schools that are under-achieving a whole range of schools. Schools that are about average, or just above it, are an important element in some of the most serious problems facing our education system. Schools that are coasting can still be under-achieving in terms of their intake of pupils: such schools can be part of an EAZ as well as schools that are traditionally regarded as failing.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Was not the introduction of education development plans intended to deal with precisely that problem? The Minister made the same point in a previous sitting when he said that some schools were rating B-plus but could be A-minus. Education development plans were intended to address that situation. There appears to be tension between what the Government want to achieve through education development plans and through education action zones. Somehow, the two do not sit comfortably together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The two are complementary. The education development plans will cover every school in the country, whereas education action zones will cover a group of schools usually two or three secondary schools and their feeder primaries that are under-achieving. The EAZs provide a different way of raising standards in those schools; effectively, a test bed for examining different types of curriculum, new pay and conditions of service for teachers and so forth. They may involve not only the LEAs where appropriate I shall say more about that later but the private sector, which may be more efficient in delivering a management contract for organising activities and functions traditionally regarded as the domain of LEAs. EAZs will have the freedom to engage the private sector for such functions.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Why is it that EDPs do not embrace those functions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> For the simple reason that this Government unlike the previous Government, who were unprepared to pilot properly and jumped directly towards implementation of failed policies such as the Child Support Agency are prepared to experiment and regard the EAZs, of which there will be 20 to 25 by the autumn of next year, as a test bed. If they work well, they will be replicated on a national scale. That brings me to the important issue of what will happen after three to five years and whether there should be an exit strategy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I, too, will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about exit strategies, which are not mentioned anywhere in the documents. However, before the Minister moves on, I want to raise with him the potential confusion between development plans and education action zones. I draw his attention to the document issued by his Department on 5 January about how to apply for an education action zone. It states:
"Developing this Action Plan will be a key task for shortlisted applicants. We are asking here for a note on how this process will work. Clearly for LEA led proposals the Action Plan will link naturally to the LEA's Education Development Plan. For proposals which do not have an LEA lead we want to know that the Action Plan will be developed in consultation with the LEA. In turn, the LEA's Education Development Plan should reflect the Forum's Action Plan, providing it is sensible."<P>

<P>
Will the Minister explain what that means and who will have the final say on the LEA's education development plan?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing my attention to the detail of that document. I am delighted that it was not issued under my name; it was sent out by an official who may not be too far from me at the moment. To save that official the inconvenience of rapidly writing me a note, I should say that the safeguard in all such matters is that the Secretary of State will act reasonably 
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> But will he be sensible?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Always.
<P>
Both the education development plan and the action zone, which will be drawn up by the forum, will be subject to the Secretary of State's approval; he will ensure that one complements the other. If a local education authority has an education action zone established in its area, the education development plan must reflect that fact. There will not be a conflict between the two; one will complement the other. I can give the Committee an assurance that in approving an application for an action zone, the Secretary of State will ensure that there is proper cohesion between the two plans together, they will play a key role in raising standards in specific schools.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I recognise that we are making a great deal of this point, but it is essential that we understand how the relationship will work. Is the Minister saying that where an LEA has produced an education development plan without an EAZ that has been approved by the Secretary of State, and during the implementation of that plan a number of schools decide that they do not like what is happening and want to do something different, they could apply to the Secretary of State for a separate education action zone, and that the Secretary of State would then judge whether it was right to set up an EAZ separate from the original education development plan?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Given that the Secretary of State will have approved the education development plan, it is unlikely that he would be sympathetic to applications from schools that have come together purely because they object to the targets set for them. The Secretary of State would not be minded to approve such an application.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell</b><i> rose </i><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning </b><i>rose</i> <P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I hesitate to intervene again, given that my hon. Friends on the Front Bench want to intervene. However, this point is crucial to our debate about what an education development plan is about. In the Bill, the EDP is about more than just setting targets; it is about the method of delivering higher education standards in an area. With that understanding of an EDP, the question about EAZs is more relevant than the Minister suggests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The record of the Committee's proceedings shows that we have been clear about what would be approved in the education development plan, which will be extremely focused and tight when looking at targets for individual schools. The only other aspect that will be subject to approval by the Secretary of State will be a school improvement programme, which will look, not at the methods adopted in individual schools, but at the way in which a local education authority can assist individual schools to meet those targets. Methods of teaching and involvement in what goes on in the classroom are not matters for the education development plan. Therefore, the hon. Lady's concerns about individual schools escaping local education authority over-prescription through the education development plan will not arise, because that is not part of an education development plan's remit.
<P>
I hope that I have at least been able to reassure the hon. Member for Maidenhead on that point, because clearly I have not been able to reassure her right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the Minister reflect for a moment on what he said about the relationship between an agreed EDP and a proposed EAZ? The Bill is clear. It is envisaged that there should be an EDP covering each LEA. We do not need to return to that debate.
<P>
It appeared from what the Minister said that, once the Secretary of State had agreed to an EDP, the Minister could not imagine him then agreeing to an EAZ from within that area proposing to go further or do better than the EDP. If that is to be the principle, it seems to be a pretty comprehensive block on agreeing to EAZs. My hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead must surely be right that, where an EDP is in place and a group of schools proposes to deal with local circumstances better as an EAZ than is envisaged in the EDP, the Secretary of State has the freedom, under the proposed law, to agree to the better package. I thought that that was exactly what an EAZ was intended to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> In that context, there are probably two ways in which an education action zone can assist. The first is that, if a group of schools has been set particularly challenging targets in the education development plan, one way to help those schools achieve those targets may be for them to become part of an education action zone, using novel methods, drawing up new teachers' contracts, involving the private sector and so on. The second may be where a group of schools or parents feel that the local education authority has not been challenging enough and the school should be doing better. I can think of examples where that may well be the case. The Secretary of State would be interested to receive an application from those schools to become an education action zone and move a step beyond the targets set by the local education authority. There is no harm in that. That is why education development plans, wich I remind hon. Members are reviewed annually, contain the power to modify the education development plan approved by the Secretary of State to reflect any changes for individual schools that might arise from an education action zone application being approved by the Secretary of State.
<P>
I have been having such discussions with officials for many months. It is a coherent package. It gives schools the flexibility to move forward and the freedom to go beyond what the local education authority might expect, subject always to the Secretary of State's approval, which will have to be exercised in a reasonable manner.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Notwithstanding the fact that there may be exceptions to the level of standards in the EDP if that is not the bone of contention the scenario that the Minister has outlined does not sound too dissimilar to the philosophy behind grant-maintained schools.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the Minister will not go down that last route.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> There is probably a PhD to be written, comparing and contrasting the two policies.
<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough asked about local management delegated budget schemes. They will remain the same. Each school in the education action zone will receive its delegated budget from the local education authority, as it would have done before. The status quo also applies to schools that are admissions authorities; there will be no change as a result of an education action zone being established.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Will the Minister clarify whether the education action zone itself will have an admissions authority role or whether each school will comply with the LEA's admissions plans, supported by the Secretary of State's requirements?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is important to remember that each school will be subject to the code of practice, which we shall discuss on clause 76; clause 77 makes it clear that the code will be subject to debate and vote in the House. Therefore, even schools within an education action zone will have to comply with the code of practice that will result from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> One last time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman clarify further what he said about the resource flows into schools in EAZs? He said that they would be subject to the same budgetary framework as LEA schools in the same area. The question left open in whether resources other than those under the LEA's budgetary framework formula would flow into the schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I addressed that question in relation to local management schemes the LEA allocating its share of the national cake, so to speak. In addition[Mr. Byers]
500,000 half from the Government and half from private sector sponsorship will be available each year. That extra amount will be in addition to the local management of schools budget. It will allow the action zone to try new methods, new teacher contracts, new conditions of service and new ways of delivering the curriculum it will pump-prime those initiatives.
<P>
The local authority will retain its statutory responsibility for ensuring that children of school age have an adequate and appropriate education; the LEA will ensure that the action zone delivers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> If EAZ schools disapply the national curriculum, what will the LEA's role be in terms of provision?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> If an action zone decides to disapply the national curriculum which we have empowered action zones to do it will still have to provide an adequate and appropriate curriculum for an individual pupil. If the LEA thinks that that is not happening, it has the power under existing legislation, which we do not intend to amend, to challenge and to ensure that an appropriate education is being delivered. How adequate or appropriate it is will always be a matter for determination by a judge. We cannot today go through every example of how such circumstances might arise.
<P>
That subject is linked to an important point which the Bill expresses clearly, but which I will reinforce. It is for an individual school governing body, if it becomes part of an education action zone and if it wishes, to give up its powers to the forum. A governing body may, for example, agree to pool some of the money, which will have been delegated to it, for use in a forum-wide initiative. A governing body, if it is an admissions authority, can surrender to the forum the power to determine admissions. That will be a matter for each governing body to decide; it will not be imposed on it.
<P>
We have mentioned under-achieving schools that are not within the Ofsted definition of failing schools. We have today received the latest annual report of Her Majesty's chief inspector, which, for the first time, is complimentary about the education standards in a large number of schools. It would be remiss of the Committee not to put on record its congratulations to those schools that are doing well in present circumstances, thereby reflecting the complimentary remarks of Her Majesty's chief inspector.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood is right about subsection (3), which deals with the addition of a failing school to an education action zone. If it were thought desirable that a school should benefit from being part of a collegiate action zone, it would be appropriate to add that failing school to it. I think that that will be a relatively rare occurrence, but we did not want to rule it out. Because no other school can be added after an action zone is set up, we thought such flexibility appropriate, but only those schools under special measures will be involved. We think it inappropriate to go beyond that because the purpose of actions zones is to develop a feeling of people working together in partnership; that aim might be impeded if schools could be added annually. We think that such flexibility might help schools under special measures.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
One of the rules of interpreting statutes is that the plural includes the singular, but when interpreting a measure the context must be considered. I draw the attention of the hon. Member for Guildford to subsection (3), which talks of
"adding to the schools for the time being included".<P>

<P>
It later refers to "every school". It is clear that we are not creating a system in which an education action zone can include just one school. We have debated that matter in private. From the way that the Bill is drafted, it is clear that there must be more than one school to constitute an education action zone.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Would the Minister clarify what would happen if a Minister were to decide that it was expedient, for reasons relating to a school, to add that school to an existing education action zone of which it was never intended to be part? Could not the intention of the clause be circumvented in that way? Would not you agree that that would be unreasonable?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I would not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The only school that can be added is that included in subsection (3) a failing school under special measures, which might be just outside the boundary of the action zone. The Government's view is that a single school cannot form an education action zone. That is the intention of the wording of clause 10.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood raised an important point on exit strategies. In recent years, we have learnt about that subject when new ideas have been piloted. For example, some of the previous Government's urban regeneration policies worked quite well in some areas, including my area Tyneside. At the moment, the area's urban development corporation is undertaking its exit strategy and handing over responsibilities to other organisations and bodies.
<P>
We must ensure that when education action zones move into their third, fourth or fifth year a clear transition is mapped out. Even at this stage, we want applicants who wish to establish an education action zone to consider how they intend to move from being an action zone to the steady state of the rest of the school system. Having said that, we must not be prescriptive because education action zones are to be the test-bed for the school system of the next century.
<P>
I believe that, if education action zones are to work, the schools that leave the present system will not return to the school system of February 1999, but to a different school system in the year 2001-2002. That will be the time to discuss the detail of the transition from an action zone to a country-wide school system.
<P>
The purpose of education action zones this is an important political point is that the Government believe that there is a third way in public services. It is not like Conservative Members saying that Labour is the enemy of everything, which is the position that they used to adopt in government; it is not the old thinking that Government must provide everything. There is a third way forward in public services. We believe that education action zones can be the forerunner of ensuring that a third way forward is developed for our school system, and that it is done not in a dogmatic way, but in a practical way that puts the interests of our children first. In delivering those commitments, I am confident that the Secretary of State will act reasonably. That is why I urge the Committee to resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We have had a wide-ranging debate. When I lit the touch paper, I had no idea of the scale of the fire that I was starting. In the heat of the blaze, the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) said he thought that he was like Alice in Wonderland. We have known for years that the Liberals have been dreaming, but it has just been confirmed.
<P>
It also appears that education action zones are all things to all men. The Minister told us that a doctorate in philosophy was needed to distinguish between an education action zone and a cluster of grant-maintained schools. On the other hand, the hon. Member for Corby saw education action zones as a means by which the diversity perish the thought which had sprung up in his own area under the Conservatives might be constrained and limited. How sad many of us feel that would be.
<P>
The truth is found if we look at "Education Action Zones an introduction" published by the DFEE on 12 January. On page 4, under the title "Where will that be?", it states:
"Action zones will be in areas of educational underperformance whether urban or rural, where schools need additional targeted support."
<P>
Yet Labour Members made great play of the idea that the education action zone could apply to schools that were not failing and which had a good record but were, by the Minister's standards, not good enough.
<P>
<B>Ms Ryan:</B> It is important that we are clear about what we mean by under-performance and a failing school. I thought that I had made that clear in my speech. That is not necessarily about failing schools. An under-performing school is not necessarily a failing school, but one where performance could be better. We want it to be better. That definition is extremely important.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Enfield, North for pointing out that much about the clause needs to be made clearer. The amendment is only the start of trying to get some clarity into the clause and creating a framework within which it can be operated in a more acceptable fashion. I am grateful to the Minister for making an effort to give some bounds to the scope of education action zones. In particular, I am grateful that he clarified that they will not apply in normal circumstances to individual schools.
<P>
My problem is that the hon. Gentleman spoke of a third way, but there are many ways in which these zones could be used; there are many ways in which these powers could be used under the heading "education action zone". That is why it is essential that a test of reasonableness is put into the body of the Bill. I sensed in the Minister's answer that beneath the new Labour craving for respectability, there still beats the old Labour thirst for power. That is why we must press the amendment to a Division.
 <P>
Question put, That the amendment be made: 
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 139 was widely drawn and generated a wide-ranging debate. It is in the spirit of reasonableness that I say the remaining amendments to clause 10 are more finely targeted.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 132, in page 9, line 26, after "made", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"not later than six months.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is, as you say Mr. Gale, tightly drawn, and I hope that the Government will accept our reasonable proposal. Clause 10(2) provides that, at the end of three years that being the usual life of an education action zone the Secretary of State may choose to extend the life of the EAZ by two years. I propose that the Secretary of State shall be required to make that decision not later than six months before the end of the first three-year period.
<P>
The amendment is practical and we tabled it because it is entirely unreasonable for the Secretary of State to have a wide power under which he can, at the end of a three-year period, say suddenly that the EAZ should be extended for a further two years. One of the key reasons why it would be unreasonable is because of the powers under later clauses to vary the terms and conditions of teachers who are employed in the schools within that education action zone.
<P>
It would be unreasonable for people who are subject to one set of terms and conditions suddenly to discover that the EAZ will not be extended for a further two years, as a result of which they will have to return to their previous terms and conditions without receiving proper notice. Although the Minister did not clarify exit arrangements as clearly as we would have liked, he said that he believed that some transitional arrangements were necessary. I hope that the requirement on the Secretary of State that there be a reasonable period of time in which notice is to be given if the EAZ is to be extended for a further two years will be acceptable to the Government.
<P>
The Government may say that they accept the spirit of the amendment, but that a different period of notice should apply. I chose six months after a quick[Mrs. May]
calculation, thinking particularly about the employment of teachers. Let us suppose that a teacher wanted to give notice that he or she wished to leave a school if an EAZ was not to be extended. Given that the process of application in the teaching profession is fairly hidebound because of school terms, we feel that six months would be an appropriate period. I hope that the Government will see fit to accept this reasonable amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> We very much support the principle of the amendment. It makes good sense to give education action zones the maximum amount of time possible in which to consider what the Minister described as an exit strategy. I think that we were all unhappy with his comments. Having to design an exit strategy before an action zone is established will be extremely difficult. I am sure that, on reflection, the Minister will accept that that will be a near impossibility, particularly if we want the fluid approach that education action zones could bring to a host of schools.
<P>
It is important that clear guidelines are set out in the Bill for an annual review of education action zones. If the Secretary of State has set them up, there should be a mechanism for getting that annual review. We believe that there must be a minimum of 12 months' notice to end an education action zone, or, indeed, to continue it. If schools are unsuccessful, there could be a problem if they are allowed only a few months before going back into the LEA.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maidenhead talked about contracts and pay and conditions, which are important issues. Curriculum was mentioned before, and we were given an unsatisfactory response about what will happen to schools that do not apply it. We can imagine a group of schools especially secondary schools disapplying a key stage 4 curriculum completely and using a vocational curriculum, for example, leading to great difficulties of feedback.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
We in the Liberal Democrat party do not want a vote on the amendment, because we do not support it as it stands, but we ask the Minister to give an assurance that there will be annual reviews and a minimum of 12 months before a decision is made regarding the future of an education action zone.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> In supporting the amendment and the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead, I have to say that there are many unanswered questions, which hang on the issue of what is the exit strategy or, just as important, what will happen when the contract is renewed. The notes on guidance to those applying to become an education action zone state:
"The Secretary of State will be able to set up a zone for 3 years, extend its duration to 5 years and create a new zone to run for another 3-5 years. The new zone could contain some or all of the schools in the old zone."<P>

<P>
That has huge implications. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) referred to changes to the curriculum. The resource implications for a school that has been following one curriculum and which then, at short notice, has to apply the LEA's curriculum, are enormous. We know from the financial memorandum that grants of 250,000 will be made to each education action forum to cover administration costs, local initiatives and additional teaching expertise. Clearly, the withdrawal of some of those services at short notice would have an effect on certain schools and groups of pupils within them.
<P>
There is also the question of the governing bodies. If they hand over powers to the forum we can see that happening in schools that are under pressure because of difficulties and the EAZ disappears at short notice, it is important to consider the issue of restructuring the governing bodies to take control of the school when it returns to the LEA. The reintegration into the permanent structure is not clear. The Minister said that those who are currently applying to become education action zones must give their views on their exit strategy at the end of the period, but there is nothing in the application form showing that they should be thinking about that, nor is it in the guidance on completing the form. The Government might believe that that is important now, as people are making the initial applications, but it is not evident in the documentation that the Department has distributed.
<P>
We want much more information from the Minister about exactly what he has in mind regarding the transition period. Does the Minister believe that education action zones will be so successful that they will gather momentum, become more widespread and will be the majority over a much longer period? If so, three, five or eight years down the road, there will be no need for the role of LEAs, to the extent that exists now, or even for that of regional government which, under the Government's proposals, will have education responsibilities. This measure is paving the way for a different form of education administration at local level.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I certainly accept that reasonable notice of an extension should be given to schools in an EAZ. No reasonable Government would not give adequate notice. The reason that I shall ask the Committee to resist the amendment was highlighted by the contributions of the hon. Members for Maidenhead and for Harrogate and Knaresborough. The hon. Member for Maidenhead said I am paraphrasing that six months was something of a back-of-the-envelope figure that she happended to come up with; it could have been seven or five months, but she thought that six was probably reasonable. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said that he thought that a year, not six months, was reasonable.
<P>
If we accepted the amendment, we would not have the flexibility about which Opposition Members spoke. If six months were specified in the Bill, notice would have to be given at that period, but the Secretary of State, the forum and all concerned may need more flexibility. The Government accept that an EAZ will need to receive adequate notice about its future so that it can exit from the forum and make plans. After I have given way, I shall detail several mechanisms that already exist in relation to EAZs, which will enable that process to happen without the amendment being passed.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Given that the Under-Secretary accepts the principle of the amendment that reasonable notice should be given do the Government also accept that it would be reasonable at least to specify a minimum period of notice, beyond which it would be unreasonable to expect people to find out whether an EAZ was to be extended? Are the Government willing to come back on Report with a specific proposal on a minimum period?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> No, I would not wish to do that, but we accepted the need to be reasonable in the debate on the previous amendment and we have established that that is how the Secretary of State will act. The problem with specifying a minimum time is that everyone will be tempted to work to it. The minimum time may be close to the end of the EAZ and that may become a norm. I see no advantage in that. There are many disadvantages to specifying it in the Bill; it would remove the flexibility that may be necessary. I shall give way once more and then talk about the Secretary of State's relationship with the EAZ.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): The Minister appears to believe that people will work to a minimum period if it is incorporated in the legislation. Surely, if one does not incorporate a minimum time period, the minimum will effectively be at the end of the period and people will work to that. The Under-Secretary's logic defeats itself.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> We are talking about a Government who have put forward EAZs as part of an important education Bill and who want them to succeed. We are talking about schools, teachers, parents and governors and the life chances of children within an EAZ. No Government, of whatever political party, will deliberately take a decision about their future right up to the rail. It is in everyone's interest to ensure that schools can progress within the education action zone or outside it, as reasonably as possible. I hope that Opposition Members will accept that we want EAZs and the schools within them to succeed and that we will give a good, appropriate period of notice. We are asking for the flexibility not to be tied to a specific number of months. Both the Opposition Members who referred to the specific time period said how difficult it was to decide on an appropriate period of notice. I have stated that it will be appropriate.
<P>
I do not think that at the point when a decision is made about whether an education action zone should continue anyone will be taken by surprise. There will not be a sudden transition from not knowing one day to knowing the day after. It should not be forgotten that the form is to include representatives of the Secretary of State. The standards and effectiveness unit will constantly monitor activity within an EAZ and an annual review will take place. Because the zones will be the test bed of a series of educational approaches the Government will carefully monitor what happens. There will be communication. The Government and the standards and effectiveness unit will feed back the results of the action taken by the EAZ. In the forum, progress reports will be received from the EAZ. The decision, when it comes, will not, I am sure, be a surprise to anyone in the relevant zone; it will have been developed during its lifetime. Because of the mechanisms that will exist for closer-than-usual contact between the Secretary of State and any group of schools, I hope that the Committee will accept that there will be sufficient opportunity for communication and learning from each other. We have given an assurance of a good period of notice, and the amendment is not appropriate, because it would remove flexibility from the provision.

<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for her assurances. However, I hope she understood clearly what was being argued not just by me but by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and by my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton about the practical issues that would need to be dealt with in deciding whether to extend an education action zone. Governing bodies that had devolved their powers to the education action forum would need to know whether they would need to take them back. I hope that the Under-Secretary is mindful of the issue that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough raised, about schools' preparations for returning to the national curriculum. A suitable period for considering that matter would be needed.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> The hon Lady should remember that one of the reasons for establishing education action zones is to see what will work, and enable that to spread to other schools. As to curriculum, a successful approach would surely prompt us to seek ways, possibly outside the EAZ framework, to enable schools to pursue it. As my hon. Friend the Minster for School Standards said, the education world of three or five years from now will not be the same as today's. Practices that work and raise standards will be the ones that we will perpetuate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> It was an intervention.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I can forgive the hon. Gentleman for thinking that those remarks were a speech, rather than an intervention; they were rather long.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
We all accept the need to face the new challenges in the education world, but I expect that my hon. Friends and some other hon. Members will be worried by the prospect that the Under-Secretary has described of a group of guinea-pig schools testing all sorts of different ideas. Challenge is to be accepted, but such an explanation as the Under-Secretary has given of the purpose of education action zones will, I am sure, cause concern.
<P>
Resources are a matter of particular concern with reference to the amount of notice provided of the extension or otherwise of an education action zone. As the Minister fo School Standards confirmed earlier, the education action zone is expected to have an extra 500,000 a year to spend half from government and half from the private sector. In view of that, it is unreasonable of the Government to refuse to state a time limit by which schools in an AEZ will know that[Mrs. May]
they will no longer have the money to spend. I was disappointed at the comments of the Minister for School Standards about exit arrangements. The provisions do not go far enough. The concept that a group of schools, which applies to set up an education action zone, has to present an exit strategy, although it does not know for how long the zone will exist, is strange.
<P>
The Ministers confirmed that educaiton action zones are the Government's method of abolishing local education authorities. I raised that matter in a previous sitting. My views have been confirmed by both Ministers' responses to the amendement and to the previous amendment that we discussed.
<P>
I am especially worried about teachers' pay and conditions. There should be a minimum period before which the Secretary of State will have notified those who have been employed on different pay and conditions whether those conditions will continue for a further two years.
<P>
The Under-Secretary considers that she is being reasonable in asking us to trust the Government. But we have been asked to trust the Government on many aspects of the Bill. We have been told that it will be all right in the end. Different terms and conditions for teachers who work in different schools constitutes such an important issue that I shall press the amendment to a vote.

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 50, in page 9, line 33, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or by removing a school from the zone in circumstances where subsection (3A) applies.
<P>
"(3A) This subsection applies where the government body of a school makes representations to the Secretary of State that the school should not be a participating school.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My earlier comments in an intervention on the right hon. Member for Charnwood hold true. We fully support the principle of education action zones, which are an exciting intiative. However, we must probe the Government through amendments and discussion to achieve greater understanding of their thinking.
<P>
When Mr. Michael Barber spoke at the north of England education conference at the beginning of January, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the centrepiece of our modernisation agenda is the Education Action Zone an explicit encouragement by central government of bottom-up initiative and innovation in challenging areas."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the initiative is to be "bottom up", it is vital to ensure that those who are described unflatteringly as being at the bottom participate fully in the education action zone's work, or discontinue their involvement in the zone if they have good reason for that.
<P>
We know that the Government's proposal for raising standards through establishing education action zones has been widely welcomed. However, there are currently few examples of schools pooling their resources to provide a joint facility. There has been nothing to compare with the scale of the partnership envisaged in education action zones. It may be difficult to predict all eventualities, but we must ensure that the statutory framework of the Bill provides for as many possibilities as may take place.
<P>
In the introduction of the Department's information booklet on EAZs, the Secretary of State points to the need for
"flexible approaches which these local partnerships will bring to schools within the zones" 
<P>
and I stress the words flexible and partnership. Moreover, the Department's guidelines on how to apply to become an EAZ state that a "strong working relationship between schools and the forum would be essential". It is an exciting innovation but it must be a bottom-up initiative, flexible in its working; it will be successful only if there is a strong working relationship between the schools and the forum.
<P>
It is clear that partnership will mean more than agreement about shared aims and objectives; there will have to be agreement about the way in which the zone will work. I quote again from page 6 of the guidance notes:
<P>
"For each zone, we expect the participating schools to agree a similar way of working with the Forum so that responsibilities in the zone are clear."<P>

<P>
The EAZ will work only on the basis of a strong, clear and coherent partnership between all parties. Each partner must feel a sense of possessing shared aims and values and shared means of working. That is clearly a key.
<P>
However, there is nothing in the Bill to remedy an ineffective partnership, which may from time to time occur. However unlikely, it is possible that one school may wish to leave the EAZ, yet the Bill does not provide for that. A cohesive partnership will not exist if one of the partners is increasingly unhappy about the operation of the EAZ.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument. Subseciton (3A) of the amendment states:
"This subsection applies where the governing body of a school makes representations to the Secretary of State that the school should not be a participating school".<P>

<P>
Before a school pulls out, would the hon. Gentleman expect the governing body to ballot parents?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am not sure that I would want a ballot of parents but I would certainly want wide consultation: parents and other participating schools must be involved. Clearly I hope that schools will not want to pull out. A school that has real problems with the operation of the EAZ may be able to resolve it within the forum. However, we need to recognise that there may be circumstances in which a school definitely wishes to withdraw.
<P>
One can postulate a range of factors to explain why a school wishes to leave. It may be unhappy with the curriculum operating within the zone, following the disapplication of the national curriculum. Some people may be worried about the Minister's earlier comment that the only person likely to resolve certain conflicts may be a judge. They may not view that as the most satisfactory way of resolving the problem.
<P>
A school could be worried that the businesses in the forum are not delivering what they promised financially, managerially or whatever. The businesses leading the EAZ could appear to be making profits from their work in the zone and the Minister has given us no assurances that such a situation might not arise. Schools might feel that such money should be used for educational purposes; certainly, my colleagues and I feel that it should. There might be many other reasons why a school wanted to opt out of the zone.
<P>
Will the Minister accept that it would be helpful if the Bill included a plan for an exit strategy for individual schools that have, for good reasons, become dissatisfied with the working of the zone? I hope that that will not happen, and that if there were some concerns, that the problems could be resolved within the forum. As the amendment makes clear, I accept that the final decision should lie not with schools, but with the Secretary of State. Schools would have to make an application to the Secretary of State, giving their reasons for wanting to leave the zone. Although such cases might be unlikely, we must plan for their eventuality and I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who wishes to give the Secretary of State a further power, but, on this occasion, I shall ask the Committee to resist doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Is the Secretary of State's appetite sated?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Yes, more than enough.
<P>
With regard to education action zones, it is appropriate that schools should sign up for the three to five-year period. They will receive the benefits of the extra 500,000 funding a year. There might be some concern that a school might manipulate the situation to take advantge of that funding during the first year and then opt out. The amendment would allow a school to do that; the Government feel that that would be inappropriate. We want to establish a community of schools working together within the education action zone. If an individual school experiences a problem, that should be tackled, either by the forum or by the school itself. It could be tackled by a report from Ofsted, which will still have powers to inspect schools. Those are better ways of dealing with particular problems in individual schools. Schools would not run away from the problems, but would work them through with their partner schools in the education action zone.
<P>
The amendment would be inappropriate; it would introduce a degree of instability, as any school could opt out at any time. We do not want to progress in that way. I therefore ask the Committee to resist amendment No. 50.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response. He has explained a number of mechanisms that could be used by a school that was unhappy with its membership of the zone. Indeed, he has merely repeated what I said in my introductory remarks. Of course, those strategies are possible. The Minister then pointed out that there would be concern if schools could opt in and opt out willy-nilly. That would have a destabilising effect on the education action zone, but the amendment does not allow schools to do that. It requires the Secretary of State to make that decision. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is an undercurrent of murmuring. The speaker must be allowed to be heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am most grateful, Mr. Gale.
<P>
The amendment requires the Secretary of State to make the decision about whether a school should opt out.
<P>
I referred to another reason why a school might wish to opt out of the zone: a school might be concerned that the business partners in the forum were making a profit from their membership. The Minister did not respond to that point. Will he tell the Committee whether he envisages business partners making a profit from their work in education action zones? The Committee will note that the Minister is not rising to intervene on that point. No doubt I will have a further opportunity to raise the matter with him in a few moments' time. With those remarks, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 114, in page 9, line 37, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4A) Subject to subsection (4B) no application made under subsection (4) shall be considered by the Secretary of State other than one which included amongst the applicants making the application the local education authority, or, if there be more than one, the local education authorities responsible for maintaining the schools which it is proposed should be participating schools.
<P>
(4B) Subsection (4A) shall not apply to any local education authority which, at the time when an application is made under subsection (4) is an authority in respect of which a direction is given by the Secretary of State under section 497A of the Education Act 1996 is in effect.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In moving this amendment, I turn to the important issue of the relationship of local education authorities with education action zones. As I said earlier, Professor Michael Barber referred specifically in his speech to education action zones being a bottom-up initiative. The bottom tier of the pyramid consists of schools, which must have an important role in education action zones, but so too must local authorities.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Unsurprisingly, the Local Government Association also believes that local education authorities should have an important role in education action zones. In a press release issued on 6 January, the chair of the[Mr. Don Foster]
LGA's education committee, Councillor Graham Lane said:
"Local government must not be written out of the script when it comes to education action zones.
As the main providers of education in every locality, LEAs have a wealth of knowledge and experience to offer the new EAZs. To ignore this would be folly."<P>

<P>
I have considerable sympathy with those remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman then agree with Graham Lane that LEAs are the providers of education?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No, I certainly do not agree with Mr. Graham Lane that LEAs are the providers of education. Local education authorities, working in partnership with schools and central Government, play a central role in education. One of the aims of our debates has been to receive an acknowledgement that all three strands schools, LEAs and central Government have a significant role in the provision of education. Sadly, we have still not received from the Minister a clear delineation of the separate roles and responsibilities of each of those organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the quotation from Graham Lane, which he endorsed, said specifically that LEAs are the providers of education?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am very grateful to the Minister for reminding me of the quotation that I read out. I did not say that I agreed with it in its entirety; I said that I had considerable sympathy with it. As the Minister will know, having no doubt been an avid reader of Education Magazine and Education Journal, I have had many a spat in the columns of those journals with Mr. Graham Lane.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I will, but the right hon. Gentleman may want to wait a second, because I will make it even more exciting for him. The importance of the LEA is not something that only Mr. Graham Lane, the LGA and I believe in; the Secretary of State himself agrees. The Secretary of State told the House on 7 August last year [Interruption.] No, it must have been July. The Minister may not be able to do his tables, but I am not too good on the calendar. On 7 July, the Secretary of State said:
"We are speaking of a new era of co-operation, not the conflict between schools and local education authorities that was the hallmark of the previous regime."<P>

<P>
He also said:
"I have always said that if local education authorities did not exist, we would have to invent them." [Official Report, 7 July 1997; Vol. 297, c. 617-622.]<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. The Minister's intervention was interesting; he asked the hon. Member for Bath whether he agreed with Graham Lane that LEAs are the providers of education the hon. Gentleman does not, and I categorically do not. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to inquire how many Government Back Benchers agree with that. He is right to say that the role of an LEA is a critical issue, and in truth it divides the Minister from many of his Back Benchers sitting behind him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful for that intervention. I hope to explore with the Minister and with other Back Benchers who may seek to catch your eye, Mr. Gale the relationship between the LEA and the education action zone, which will lead us to a wider debate about education action zones and the role of the local education authority.
<P>
The relationship between the LEA and the EAZ has been clearly stated by the Government, but the development of the Government's thinking is quite revealing. For example, a policy paper issued on 15 April 1997, entitled, "Education Action Zones: Labour's proposals to raise standards in schools", states:
"These pilots will be planned and delivered by partnerships between business, schools and LEAs there will be an important role for TECs and colleges."<P>

<P>
It is quite clear that, on 15 April, local education authorities were to be key partners in education action zones.
<P>
The Labour party clearly held to that view once in Government. Under the heading "Education Action Zones", at page 39, the White Paper states:
"We expect the new Action Zones to operate on the basis of an action forum which will include parents and other representatives from the local business and social community, as well as representation from the constituent schools and the LEA."<P>

<P>
It is clear from that that the Government believed that the LEAs would be formal partners in local education action zones.
<P>
The Government's position then becomes somewhat confusing. When the Bill was published in January 1998 we discovered that it made no reference to LEAs being partners in EAZs. However, avid readers of the Department's web page can find out the most up-to-date position. The most recent statement that I have seen I am assured that it continues to say much the same was dated 15 January. I printed a copy of that web page because, in the section headed, "Why Education Action Zones?", it mentions
"sustainable local partnerships which build on the roles of schools, local communities and LEAs."<P>

<P>
That may not be a clear ringing endorsement that LEAs are to be included; it may simply imply that action zones will build on what LEAs have done in the past.
<P>
In the next section of the web page, headed "What are Education Action Zones?", the web page makes a much clearer statement. It refers to
"local clusters of schools usually a mix of not more than 20 primary, secondary and special schools working in a new partnership with the LEA, local parents, businesses, TECs and others."<P>

<P>
It is quite clear, at least in the Department's web site of 15 January, that the LEA was to be a formal partner in education action zones. However, that view seemed to waver when the Bill was published, because we discovered that the LEA was not listed as a formal partner.
<P>
Matters then become even more confusing. In that wonderful document of 5 January to which I have already referred, entitled "Education Action Zones: How to Apply", we read on page 5 at section 3 that
"We would typically expect any forum to include representation from parents, at least one person appointed by the schools, a business representative and the LEA."<P>

<P>
There is some confusion on the Government's position on that matter. I happily give way to the hon. Gentleman because he has long experience in local education authorities.

<P>

<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> I am sure that the Committee is enjoying hearing the history of Government statements. I know that I am a new Member, but I though that it was the responsibility of the hon. Member moving the amendment to address it. His amendment would not make clear what the norm would be, but 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the Chairman believes that the mover of the amendment is out of order, he will say so.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> My point to the hon. Member for Bath was on whether he recognises the difference between a norm, in which an LEA is regularly and routinely involved, and a legal requirement, which would mean that it had to become involved. He must convince the Committee that the Bill should contain a provision that would result in an LEA becoming involved in every case. As the former member of an LEA, I would not recommend that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman because he helps me to develop the argument to which I was just about to come. He is right to say that it is important for me to develop my case and make clear whether I believe that in all circumstances a local authority should automatically become a partner in the education action zone and in the forum. If the hon. Gentleman has a little patience, he will see that I intend to make such a case by building on the way in which the Government's thinking has shifted over time. I hope to demonstrate that I am willing to go along with the Government's shift in thinking and come to a conclusion that I hope is acceptable to the hon. Gentleman and his Front-Bench colleagues. I shall explain the thinking behind the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the words in the guidance on completing the application forms to become an education action zone? It states:
"We also want to examine the range of other expertise in the partnership and any track record of the partnership working together on other projects; we accept that the LEA will usually be involved in the partnership. Where it is not, we will expect it to be consulted in the development of Action Zone proposals."<P>

<P>
Is it not the hon. Gentleman's point that the role of the LEA is extremely ambiguous? It is supposed to be a partner, but the guidelines suggest that it will be a consultee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> By using yet another example, the hon. Lady illustrates the Government's shift in thinking. It is perfectly reasonable for them to do that as long as they explain the rationale behind it. Unfortunately, the shift of thinking has left us in a murky area where there is lack of clarity on what the new thinking will be.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes </B>(Stretford and Urmston): I had hoped that, in developing his thinking and explaining the reason for the amendment, the hon. Gentleman would deal with one issue. Does he not agree that the amendment would give a local authority a power of veto over a partnership that all the other partners want to develop? Is such a power of veto desirable? Will the hon. Gentleman deal with those points?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I certainly will, but I do not think that an LEA should have a power of veto. [Interruption.] Labour Members are waving their hands at me. Instead of that, I hope that they will intervene to explain how the amendment would do what the hon. Lady has suggested. I shall briefly explain why it would not.
<P>
There has been a shift in Government thinking, but we have been left in a murky area in which no one is clear about the Government's thinking on the future role of LEAs in relation to education action zones or anything else. Not long ago, the Minister for School Standards said that LEAs do not have
"a God-given right to run and lead everything".<P>

<P>
Even within the past hour, the Minister has said that education action zones were a test bed for a new education system for the next century. He predicts that that system will be different from that currently in place. One is left to wonder what his thinking might be about the role of LEAs in that future system.
<P>
Many of us are aware of the rumours that have circulated about meetings between the Minister, the chief inspector of schools and the Prime Minister about the future of LEAs. I have no way of knowing whether they are true and the Minister may wish to intervene to clarify that. Any such meetings would have been held in private and we have not been told of their outcome or the thinking behind them.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
But one thing we know in this period of uncertainty is that people are confused about the Government's thinking on the future role of LEAs. Some would argue that there is almost a conspiracy theory building up about the Government's thinking. Were that to be the case, we could all feel that we have no need to be concerned and that it cannot be true because in his letter of 8 January to Mr. Graham Lane, the chairman of the education committee of the Local Government Association, the Secretary of State writes:
"What has excited recent press coverage is a perception it seems to me due at least in part to the reactions to the letter that was circulated and to Michael Barber's talk at the North of England education conference that zone policy is a covert attempt to start removing the education service from LEAs or even to `privatise' education.<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I can reassure you that there is no fuel to feed the conspiracy theorists."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If we are to take the Secretary of State's words on trust, we must believe that there is no conspiracy, that meetings did not take place between the Minister, Her Majesty's chief inspector and the Prime Minister and that we are all barking up the wrong tree. If so, it would be reasonable for the Minister to reassure us about that by accepting my amendments.
<P>
An effective local education action zone is extremely unlikely to succeed without the active co-operation of the LEA. Such zones can bring many things to the party. In the words used in the White Paper and in the original proposal for education action zones that came[Mr. Foster]
out before the election, the LEA has a key role as a partner, but only as a partner: it should not dominate and dictate what happens in the forum. That is why my amendment proposes that it should become one of the partners. It should not have a veto on the action but should be included within the forum.
<P>
The Minister will say that there will be circumstances in which an LEA has failed all the schools in the area. In such circumstances it would be inappropriate for the LEA to play a part in the education action zone. Indeed, if it sought to play a part it could be a destructive one and of no benefit to the schools in that area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that he thought an education action zone would be extremely unlikely to succeed unless the LEA was directly involved. I can confirm that in the example that I quoted earlier in Northamptonshire, of which I am a former county council member, that would be the case. However he has not pointed out that if his amendment were accepted, an education action zone would be extremely unlikely to be set up at all if the LEA decided not to co-operate. The line-up in Corby is a Labour Government, a Labour local authority and a Labour Member of Parliament: people are working together. But it is not difficult to predict a potential disagreement between myself, for example, and a future LEA of a different political colour. In those circumstances I might find myself unable the Government might find themselves unable to raise standards in my constituency, faced with a local authority that was not prepared to co-operate in the way that it is doing at present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, because I wondered what would happen in the circumstances that he describes. The hon. Gentleman is describing the situation that I was leading on to, where a local education authority fails to raise standards in its schools and fails to carry out its functions. In those circumstances the local education authority should not have, as of right, membership of the education forum. That is why I urge the hon. Gentleman to look carefully at the amendment and to note the second part, which contains the get-out clause in the case of
"an authority in respect of which a direction is given by the Secretary of State under section 497A of the Education Act 1996".<P>

<P>
I remind hon. Members who do not have the 1996 Act to hand that section 497 says:
"If the Secretary of State is satisfied (either on a complaint by any person interested or otherwise) that a body to which this section applies" <P>

<P>
and that includes a local education authority 
"have failed to discharge any duty imposed on them by or for the purposes of this Act, he may make an order declaring the body to be in default in respect of that duty."<P>

<P>
Where that applies and where clear evidence has been given by the Secretary of State, on advice that he has received, that the local education authority is not delivering on behalf of the schools in its area, it should not have the right to become a member of the education forum.
<P>
<B>Helen Jones:</B> The hon. Member for Bath waxed eloquent in moving his amendment. His conspiracy theory is extremely interesting. No doubt if he ever leaves this place, he can look to a future post on an American talk radio station. I shall attempt to be brief and perhaps to return to the facts of the case rather than to the conspiracy theory.
<P>
 We must remember that all a local education authority's powers remain in place throughout the life of an education action zone. There is no proposal to take those powers away. The LEA retains legal responsibility to maintain its schools in the zone and retains statutory responsibility for the education of those children. In most cases we would expect LEAs to be closely involved in the setting up of education action zones and to participate in the forum. Many of them already do so.
<P>
However, the hon. Gentleman's amendment, except where failing authorities are concerned, does precisely what he says he does not want to do by giving LEAs a veto. The first part of the amendment says:
"no application ... shall be considered by the Secretary of State other than one which included amongst the applications making the application the local education authority."<P>

<P>
I can envisage a situation which involves not a failing authority, as defined in the second part of the clause, but one which is opposed to education action zones. Are we then to say that a group of schools that wishes to set up a zone should be subject to veto by the local authority? It is not a relevant argument. Education action zones are, by their nature, experimental and they are partnerships, and it is essential that the partners involved in them are willing partners.
<P>
In moving the amendment, the hon. Member for Bath rightly referred to the bottom-up approach, but the amendment could in certain circumstances veto moves from the bottom up by giving the local education authority, if it chooses not to be involved, an effective veto over the Education Act. What would happen in that case? Would schools and education departments be told, "You have very good ideas and plans, but because your LEA does not want to participate, we will not allow you to try an education action zone." That is contrary to the thrust of the measure. The proposal would be over-legislating, and stifle innovation and experiment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am listening to the hon. Lady's argument with care, as I agree with everything that she says. I was saying, under my breath, that I congratulate the Minister for School Standards on his capacity to tutor his hon. Friends in his way of thinking.
<P>
If it is within the rules of order, Mr. Gale, will you allow the hon. Lady to explain why she thinks it is illegitimate for an LEA to block the aspirations of schools co-operating with an EAZ I agree with her in that respect but legitimate to reimpose LEA control on grant-maintained schools that have been exploiting the same freedoms as the Government want to extend 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I fear that that will not be within the rules of order.
<P>
<B>Helen Jones:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. We are discussing partnership in education. The right hon. Gentleman's amendment would veto many worthwhile partnerships. I do not need tutoring in that view; I have worked in education for many years and I would be happy to discuss grant-maintained schools with the right hon. Gentleman at the appropriate time.
<P>
The amendment is over-legislative; it is over-prescriptive and its effect would be contrary to the intention of the hon. Member for Bath, as it would disrupt good relations between the parties involved. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I have little to add to the excellent contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North. We do not want the power to veto applications to rest with the local education authority, for the reasons that my hon. Friend stated and because a local education authority may support the concept of education action zones but not want, for example, to support a group of schools in the southern part of the authority because it backs a bid from a group in the northern part of the authority. The LEA should not be able to deny schools and parents the right to make an application in such circumstances.
<P>
For those reasons, and for the reasons given by my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North, I ask my hon. Friends to resist the amendment if hon. Members seek to divide the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> One of the great advantages of debate in Committee is that we consider the amendments in detail. Sometimes, and I hope it is true of other hon. Members, one realises that the amendment one has tabled would have an unforeseen consequence. I hope that other hon. Members are prepared to admit it when they have made a mistake. When I was challenged earlier about the veto, I confess that I was confused. But now that the matter has been eloquently explained by the hon. Member for Warrington, North, I can see that there is a slight flaw in the amendment as drafted. Myintention was to ensure, except in the circumstances that I described, that the LEA would, if it so wished, serve on the forum. If the amendment had been so drafted it would have had universal support, judging by the remarks made by hon. Members, and I intend to ask leave to withdraw it.
<P>
Although some of us are still concerned about conspiracies, whether or not they exist, none of us will forget that the Secretary of State, in the same debate on 7 July, said:
"I will merely say, with a twinkle, that there will be only 25 education action zones in the beginning, but if I were being mischievous... we could move to 419 over the life of this Parliament." [Official Report, 7 July 1997; Vol.297, c.624.]<P>

<P>
I hope that hon. Members will remember those words when they consider their decision. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. On some occasions hon. Members try to be helpful by thinking that they have got the timing right. What advice would you give to hon. Members in such circumstances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale, it is not usual to delay 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It may be for the convenience of the Committee to be reminded that papers may be left in the Room and to know that depending upon the Bill's progress, I intend to suspend the sitting between 7 pm and 8.30 tonight.
<P>
It being One o'clock The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
<P>
Adjourned till this day at half-past Four o'clock.
