dispute, the area of the statutory project shall be determined by the
Upper Tribunal as a question of fact subject to the following

the authorised purposes within the area of the compulsory purchase
instrument, save to the extent that it is shown (by either party) that
it is part of a larger project;

depart from that, which I hope will be rarely, it is right that locally
elected people, rather than the inspectorate, make the decision. I
shall reflect on the Bill’s provisions to ensure that the
primacy of the plan is unambiguous, as we intend. In fact, some weeks
ago, when we considered amendments about establishing the importance of
plan making over the development control appeals route, I undertook to
reflect on whether we could make the provisions even less ambiguous. I
will certainly do that, and I hope that that answers the understandable
concerns raised by my hon. Friend. I hope that he has been persuaded to

                           </span> I would like to
speak to new clause 19, which is about compensation for compulsory
purchases. It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Amess,
particularly now that we have reached the new clauses in the
Committee’s last
sitting.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000030">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Locally
led regeneration is crucial to our communities, but there is a feeling
that it is being undermined by the system for compulsory purchase and
compensation. As we know, local authorities use compulsory purchase
orders to secure the control of land that they need to deliver the
regeneration of an area, and that is essential to the delivery of
infrastructure such as Crossrail. The statutory provisions that govern
the compensation payable for compulsory purchase are now widely thought
to be over-complicated and, in some cases, out of date. That can result
in extended negotiations and, unfortunately for those involved,
litigation. Compensation payments to landowners can be delayed and can
become unpredictable, and I will give examples of that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One area of
particular concern is how to ascertain the planning status of land that
is being compulsorily acquired. To assess the value of land for
compensation purposes, assumptions must be made about what development
might have been permitted through the planning system were it not for
the compulsory purchase order. For example, could a dilapidated factory
that is being acquired have been redeveloped for housing, or must it
have remained in industrial use? Clearly, reaching the right answer to
that question can have a dramatic effect on the compensation paid for
the
land.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a feeling that the rules governing the statutory planning
assumptions are in need of reform. That has been highlighted in the
Lands Tribunal, the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords—the
Supreme Court will now be the final court of appeal. Two cases in
particular have resulted in seemingly perverse outcomes that
demonstrate the failings of the existing system. In the case of
Greenweb Ltd <em>v</em>
                           <em>.</em> Wandsworth council, the claimant received
compensation in the Court of Appeal of £1.6 million for a piece
of land that was 0.22 acres, or some 20 yards by 50 yards. It was
established to be worth only £15,000 outside the compulsory
purchase system, and it had been bought for £30,000. In that
case, we had £1.6 million versus £15,000. A little-known
law that was intended to compensate victims of German wartime bombing
had been invoked during the procedure, which meant the land had to be
valued as if it had planning permission for housing, when it had, since
1979, had planning permission only for use as open space. Wandsworth
council therefore had to pay £1.6 million for the
land, rather than some price between £15,000 and
£30,000.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Press reports
from that time make interesting comments on the case. The judge who
reluctantly ordered Wandsworth council to pay that very large sum
described the law as “utterly deplorable”. The council
appealed against the valuation by the Lands Tribunal, arguing that the
law was absurd, but three Appeal Court judges upheld the decision,
while making clear their serious concerns about the fact that the
legislation, based on wartime bombing, still existed. Lord Justice Sir
Richard Buxton called on councils to lobby the Government for repeal of
the law to
avoid<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000034">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Lord Justice Sir John
Thomas said it was “highly regrettable” that taxpayers
had to fund the purchase of the land for more than 100 times its true
value, and Lord Justice Sir Stanley Burnton said that he upheld the law
“most
reluctantly”.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000035">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
second case shows the law working the opposite way. In Spirerose
<em>v</em>. Transport for London, the claimant received significantly
reduced compensation in the House of Lords, compared with that awarded
by the Lands Tribunal and later supported in the Court of Appeal. A
legal technicality meant that the land could not be valued as if it had
planning permission, although it almost certainly would have got it; it
could be valued only according to the hope of getting planning
permission, which is a much weaker claim. Transport for London had to
pay only £400,000, as opposed to the £608,000 that the
land was said to be
worth.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000036">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“It
may be that Parliament should consider whether the present system is
fair to landowners or whether the law should be changed. The case will
have important implications for compulsory purchase valuations. The
difficulty with this decision from the point of view of landowners
facing a compulsory purchase is that once a Government body or local
council has announced its decision to proceed with a new project by
compulsory acquisition, the landowner will not be able to obtain
planning permission for an alternative scheme because the land is
required for a public purpose. He will

                        <p>The
Greenweb <em>v</em>. Wandsworth council case was in 2008, and the
Spirerose <em>v</em>. Transport for London case was in 2009, so they are
recent cases. In the second case, the constraints of the current law
prevented a proper assessment of the planning status of the land at the
valuation
date.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 19 would prevent the issues involved in those two cases and
similar issues from occurring, and the Bill is a suitable place to
introduce that new reform. The new clause would replace the statutory
planning assumptions in sections 14 to 21 of the Land Compensation Act
1961 with ones based on the recommendations of the Law Commission
reports, “Towards a Compulsory Purchase Code”, which were
published in 2003 and
2004.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000040">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister may tell me that the previous Labour Government could have
done something at the time. If he does, I shall say that it was not
considered a priority to bring forward a planning Bill, but this Bill,
which we have debated for so many weeks, can change that situation;
much is already changing in planning legislation, with the localist
principles being brought in for neighbourhood planning, and the new
policy planning
framework.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new clause would introduce a new alternative development certificate
that is more relevant to the modern planning system than the
certificate of appropriate alternative development that it would
replace, and it would be of more assistance in assessing compensation.
The new certificate would reflect the planning situation at the date on
which the compensation is assessed, whereas the existing certificate is
based on the planning situation when the compulsory purchase order was
first made. Clearly, a in compulsory purchase might have been made
decades before such a situation arises. The new certificate would be
issued by the local planning 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 945<a class="bkMark" name="Column945">&#160;</a>
                           </div>authority, as is currently the case, but appeals would be to the Lands
Chamber of the Upper Tribunal, rather than to the Secretary of
State—given the other provisions in the Bill, we should perhaps
consider easing the load on the Secretary of State. The Lands Chamber
of the Upper Tribunal also determines disputes on compensation for
compulsory purchase
generally.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
case for reform through the new clause is supported by the Compulsory
Purchase Association; the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors; the
Law Commission, obviously; the Institute of Revenues Rating and
Valuation; and the planning and environment committee of the Law
Society. Those who acquire land and those who represent landowners
whose land is being acquired recognise the need for reform. Situations
do not often arise in which we can see injustice on both sides of a
case—for those having to pay for land and for those trying to
sell it.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The new
clause would not change the basic approach to compensation for
compulsory purchase. It would provide the same broad rights within a
clearer and fairer system that would allow land required for
regeneration and infrastructure to be acquired compulsorily, with a
more efficient use of public and private resources. Given everything
that we have said in Committee and in the House recently, it is
important to help councils that are in situations such as that faced by
Wandsworth council. Most importantly, the change would save local
authorities much-needed resources and would help to encourage
regeneration schemes, which are vital for the growth that the economy
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000044">&#160;</a>

Member for St Austell and Newquay, I am a new boy, albeit an older one.
It has been a fascinating experience, and the Committee has done
important work, with mature debate. We have had sharp disagreements,
but we have found a degree of consensus too, particularly on the
planning provisions. We hope that will be carried forward in the next
stages, with much-needed changes to the Bill, not least because as it
stands, it is a bizarre combination of localism and Leninism. Those
with a memory of Soviet history will recall the legend, “All
power to the Soviets”—I am not sure that it was all power
to the parish councils—which gave way to a determined centralism
in the old Soviet Union. The Secretary of State wants to retain 142
powers at the centre, so changes are needed in the Bill. I am not sure
that a new legend of “All power to the Pickles” would
inspire the people of Britain.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000046">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I wish to
speak to new clause 15, which is an enabling clause to ensure that the
recommendations in the Killian-Pretty and Penfold reviews are
implemented as soon as possible. Those reviews were commissioned by the
previous Government to simplify the planning system and were widely
endorsed across the spectrum. At present, the Bill does not introduce
any powers to bring forward the recommendations of Killian-Pretty and
Penfold, some of which would require change to existing statute. It
would be helpful, therefore, to have an enabling clause that allowed
change to be made to statute where it met the crucial test of securing
an efficient and effective planning system.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000047">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In recent
years, a great deal of progress has been made in modernising and
simplifying the planning system, even if only in finding common ground
on the fact that further changes are necessary. Along with other work,
that has included the Barker review of land use planning in 2006, the
planning White Paper in 2007, and the subsequent Planning Act
2008.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Killian-Pretty review, which was published in November 2008, moved the
reforms on by making a range of recommendations for further improvement
to the planning regime. Those recommendations related to
proportionality, process, engagement, culture and complexity. The
Penfold review was established later to explore whether the process for
obtaining non-planning consent delayed or discouraged businesses from
investing. It focused on changing working practices, simplifying the
landscape, improving the interaction between planning and non-planning
consents, managing the landscape and so on. I stress again that those
things commanded substantial consensus across the political spectrum
and in the world of planning. Not all of them commanded consensus, but
most did. New clause 15 would ensure that the recommendations in the
Killian-Pretty and Penfold reviews can be taken forward at the next
stages. We would welcome the Minister’s
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000049">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Members for Worsley and
Eccles South, and for Birmingham, Erdington, for raising the issues.
The hon. Lady proves herself an accomplished parliamentarian when she
anticipates the arguments that I will deploy against her and
effectively rebuts them, so I will not say that the situation reflects
badly on the previous Government because they did not take up the
chance to deal with a very real set of concerns. She is right to draw
our attention to the courts’ determinations over a period of
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000050">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Our
reason for not including the measures in the Bill—as every
Member of the Committee knows, it is already pretty full with 207
clauses—is, I am sure, the same as the previous
Government’s reason: in legislation, we have to draw a line
somewhere, and the matters are quite technical and complex. We judged,
perhaps incorrectly, that the appetite of the Committee to take on more
than 207 clauses might be limited, but that is clearly not the case.
Such is the enthusiasm under your chairmanship, Mr Amess, that there is
clearly appetite for
more.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000051">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
will reflect seriously on what the hon. Lady, who has been expertly
advised, has said. We will sit down with those experts to consider
whether, if we were to find space, it would not open up a whole set of
other concomitant changes and amendments to the law that might
seriously overburden our work. I cannot give a commitment that we will
be able to include the measures, but I will certainly, with an open
mind, consider the representations that she and others have made to see
whether we can do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000052">&#160;</a>

endorse the conclusions of the Killian-Pretty and Penfold reviews. They
were both excellent reports, and all three authors have done a service
to the country through the work that they put into their reports and
the recommendations that they made. Of course, in the Bill, we are
taking into account many of their recommendations. The simplifying of
national planning policy, acknowledging the crucial importance of
pre-application discussions, and community engagement are very much
part of the Bill. There is a lot in the Bill. We found, on reflection,
that we did not need the power to introduce the other measures that are
necessary. There is other statute, including the Town and Country
Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2010, that
can, I am advised, be used to that
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000058">&#160;</a>

for simplifying things, with the best of intentions, when necessary. I
daresay he will be comforted to hear that we do not consider the new
clause necessary to implement the useful and important measures in the
Bill. If he is looking forward to a future role for himself, I fear
that we are going to deprive him of having this particular power if our
positions are ever reversed. With that reassurance that the measure is
not necessary to achieve what is aimed at, I hope that he will not

always seem to have other opportunities to bring forward legislation,
the Bill seems the right place for the measure, so I hope that the
Minister will look seriously at it. We have urged that many other

                           </div>slightly further on a few points. Importantly, my right hon. Friend
acknowledged that under the reforms, departures from a local or
neighbourhood plan would still be possible. He said that some degree of
flexibility was necessary and that the question was who should decide
on such departures. He said that rather than the remote and unelected
Planning Inspectorate, it should be the local authority that decides,
as it is better placed to make a sensitive judgment, and I completely
agree with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, the local authority already makes the decision when planning
consent is a departure from the local plan, and it must advertise that
when it occurs. Under the reforms, local authorities are meant to draw
up plans in close consultation with local communities. In those
circumstances, if the local authority agrees on a departure from the
plan, it is fair for the community to have a further right of appeal.
It is an important check, so that if a community decides to challenge a
departure, the matter can be looked at again by an independent
body—in this case, the Planning Inspectorate. If the Planning
Inspectorate is the right body for developers to appeal to—there
is nothing in the Bill that restricts or removes those
provisions—why is it not also the correct body for local
communities to have recourse to in limited
circumstances?<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is still my contention, and that of my hon. Friend the Member for
Bradford East, who sadly cannot be with us today, that a limited
community right of appeal would be an important check and balance in
the Bill. It would add to the suite of community rights and would be an
important check against the ability of developers to steamroller
unwanted applications through. I must say that new clause 11 is
supported by several well-respected organisations, including Friends of
the Earth, the National Trust, the Open Spaces Society, the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds, the Woodland Trust, the World
Wildlife Fund, the Campaign for National Parks, Buglife and Amphibian
and Reptile Conservation. I am particularly grateful for the support
that the Campaign to Protect Rural England gave in researching the new
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
right hon. Friend the Minister has brought another red
herring—if I may put it that way, Mr Amess—to the
Committee’s attention, which is the question of cost. At the
moment, a planning application can ultimately be appealed through
judicial review, which is hugely expensive, complicated and
time-consuming for local communities that go down that route. New
clause 11 simply says that we need a level playing field when it comes
to the rights of the developer and the rights of the community. I
welcome the Minister’s commitment to reflecting on the matter.
With that in mind, I am happy to withdraw the new clause for now,
although I signal my intention to return to the matter on Report. I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the motion.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000064">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I shall not
detain the Committee for long. New clause 12 would simply
improve existing tenancy deposit schemes so that legislation works
better for tenants and landlords. It would clarify the circumstances in
which landlords must protect deposits, and give judges greater
discretion over the size of the penalty for landlords’
non-compliance to ensure that it is
proportionate.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the Committee probably knows, Government-backed tenancy deposit
protection schemes were introduced in April 2007. The legislation was
designed to set out clear responsibilities and time scales for
landlords to protect tenants’ deposits, and to provide a quick,
efficient way of resolving deposit disputes. Such schemes benefit more
than 2 million households in the private rented sector. Those 2 million
households’ deposits have been protected, and that includes my
own, so I probably need to declare an interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Ambiguities
in the existing legislation have meant that it is failing some private
tenants because they do not have their hard-earned deposits protected.
It is also failing landlords, who struggle to find accurate
information, and the process is wasting the time of the courts and the
advice services. In the past year, for example, citizens advice bureaux
dealt with almost 15,000 inquiries relating to tenancy deposit
protection. Almost 4,000 people went to the housing charity Shelter for
advice relating to their rent deposit, three in four of whom did not
have their deposits protected. Despite the best efforts of the previous
Government to introduce much-needed protection in this area, the system
is not quite working as the House intended. Each of the individual
schemes that provide tenancy deposit protection, as well as national
landlord and property organisations, has given strong support to
improving the schemes and, indeed, to new clause 12. The broad support
for such change is a clear sign of the need for reform to ensure that
legislation works better.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The first
provisions of new clause 12 are designed to clarify the circumstances
in which landlords must protect deposits. It removes the
“initial requirements” wording in the original
legislation and instead requires landlords to protect their
tenants’ deposits by complying with the requirements of one of
the authorised schemes. The original wording implied compliance with
the initial requirements of the individual schemes, but the courts have
found that particularly difficult to enforce and landlords have been
unclear about which requirements they were supposed to follow. The
amended wording 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 951<a class="bkMark" name="Column951">&#160;</a>
                           </div>would make the requirements much clearer, so landlords would have a much
stronger idea of their responsibilities and the courts would find it
easier to make
judgments.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new clause clarifies specific grey areas in existing legislation.
First, ex-tenants, as well as current tenants, would have access to
recourse if their landlord failed to protect their deposit. Secondly,
if a tenancy that began before the introduction of tenancy deposit
protection schemes was subsequently renewed, the landlord would be
required to protect the deposit. Finally, if a property changed hands,
the new landlord would also be under an obligation to protect the
deposit.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The second
aspect of new clause 12 would give judges greater discretion over the
penalty for a landlord’s non-compliance. The new wording would
remove the all-or-nothing sanction of three times the deposit, and it
would enable judges to make a discretionary judgment as to whether the
landlord should pay a penalty of between one and three times the
amount. As hon. Members are aware, judges have been reluctant to impose
the full penalty of three times the deposit, particularly when the
landlord had protected the deposit but outside the strict 14-day limit.
A Court of Appeal judgment of 11 November 2010 concluded that the
sanction of three times the deposit does not apply if the landlord
belatedly protects the deposit at any time up to and

giving judges discretion on the level of sanction that they can apply,
new clause 12 would ensure that they would be better able to take into
account the range of factors that contributed to a landlord’s
non-compliance on protecting a tenant’s deposit. That would
enable them to impose lower penalties on landlords who were evidently
ignorant of their responsibilities, and higher penalties on landlords
who wilfully failed to protect their tenants’ deposits. I
believe that the change would lead to more proportionate sanctions for
landlords, while offering a clear incentive for them to comply with the
will of the House. I have no intention of pressing the new clause to a
Division, but I shall be grateful if the Minister will respond to some
of these issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000075">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I thank my hon. Friend for tabling the new

                        <p class="tabbed">Like
the dissenting judge in such cases, we think it right that sanctions
for non-compliance with tenancy deposit obligations should be robust
and a disincentive to bad practice. The ambiguity in the present
wording should certainly be put right, and I congratulate my hon.
Friend, and my absent hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East, on
their attempt to do that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Unfortunately,
new clause 12 goes beyond that basic aim because it would make changes
that do not flow from the Court of Appeal decision. Sadly, it also
misses one of the issues that did arise in the Court of Appeal, and I
will deal with that omission first. The key finding 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 952<a class="bkMark" name="Column952">&#160;</a>
                           </div>of the Court of Appeal concerned the application of a financial penalty
for non-compliance with the requirements of tenancy deposit protection
legislation in a situation when the tenancy is still in place and the
landlord has protected the deposit after the deadline of 14 days. While
the new clause tackles that issue, one of the reasons behind the
Court’s view concerned the ability of a landlord to use section
21 of the Housing Act 1988 to evict a tenant when they were found to be
in breach of tenancy deposit protection legislation. Under the
legislation as it stands, a landlord who fails to comply with the
deposit protection legislation cannot use section 21 to evict a tenant.
That is important, because section 21 is one of the key characteristics
of assured shorthold tenancies to which the tenancy deposit scheme
relates. It allows a landlord to evict a tenant, having given
reasonable notice, on a non-discretionary basis and without having to
give a reason. The ability to gain possession of their property is key
to a landlord’s confidence in letting out that property in the
first place, and in the current economic climate, we would not want to
undermine that
confidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the Court of Appeal pointed out, under the tenancy deposit protection
legislation as currently drafted, it could be argued that once a
landlord has failed to protect a deposit, they would be unable to use
section 21 in connection with that tenancy, even when they had
subsequently protected the deposit and, where appropriate, paid the
fine imposed by the court. That outcome is not the intention of the
legislation, and we are therefore clear that any amendments aimed at
tightening up the requirement to protect tenants within 14 days must
also address that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s view is that to address fully the concerns
underlying the Court of Appeal’s decision, it is important to
allow the courts greater discretion than currently available when
setting the financial penalty. My hon. Friend the Member for St Austell
and Newquay relayed the current regime to the Committee. However,
subsection (11) of the new clause does not offer sufficient
flexibility, because as well as allowing flexibility up to a maximum
tariff, it still leaves the minimum of one times the deposit. We think
that there should be no lower limit. If the objective of such
legislation is to encourage landlords to comply and to protect the
deposits they take, it cannot be right to levy a substantial penalty
when a well-intentioned landlord had made a mistake that, for instance,
could result in the deadline for protection being missed by only one
day. It is essential that the courts have the discretion to do justice
in those de minimis cases, but that would not be possible if the
minimum sanction were to be the payment of a penalty equal to the full
amount of the
deposit.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I mentioned, the new clause also contains measures that, although they
seek to clarify legislation, go beyond issues considered by the Court
of Appeal. Proposed new subsection (8A) of the Housing Act 2004, which
the new clause would insert, is particular example of that. I
understand the wish to clarify what happens when a landlord acquires a
property with an existing tenancy in place, and it turns out that the
associated deposit has not been protected, but my hon. Friend’s
proposal would place all the responsibility and cost for rectifying
that on the incoming landlord, regardless of the facts and regardless
of who was responsible. That cannot be right in cases when, for
whatever reason, the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 953<a class="bkMark" name="Column953">&#160;</a>
                           </div>outgoing landlord has not assigned the deposit to the new landlord. The
matter needs further consideration, and I am not even convinced that
legislation is the answer. Proposed new subsection (8B) is less
problematic, and I have great sympathy with the wish to clarify the
situation. However, there does not seem to be convincing evidence of a
widespread or intractable
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000081">&#160;</a>

of any consultation undertaken under section 98C(5) with respect to
those proposals.(5) Section
98C(6) does not apply to an order under section 9C(3) or (4) which is

new clause would give the six integrated transport authorities a
general power, similar to that of the fire and rescue authorities, in
recognition that integrated transport authorities are single purpose

would seem perverse, having discussed those powers, that integrated

                        <p class="tabbed">The major
reason why integrated transport authorities require a general power is
the straightforward fact that they want to deliver better services more
efficiently through collaborative working, which will become
increasingly important in these times. Without a general power, the
integrated transport authorities and their passenger transport
executives will not have the legal comfort that local authorities will
enjoy, which we debated extensively in our earlier
sittings.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Services
in the public sector are being challenged to do more with fewer
resources, and to work in different ways to deliver services. Transport
authorities should be able to support growth through local enterprise
partnerships, so their ability to work collaboratively across partners
will be increasingly important as these new structures develop. A
functional general power would facilitate working in that way much more
readily. It would put beyond doubt the legal uncertainty that might
hold back innovative initiatives in metropolitan areas. In
non-metropolitan areas, the transport function sits with the local
authority, which will have a general power of competence, so this
starts to be a divide between transport authorities that have that
general power, and ones that do not.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A general
power for the integrated transport authorities and their passenger
transport executives would assist them in joint procurement,
partnership working and innovative service provision. For example, the
Government have said that they want the majority of public transport
journeys to be made using smart ticketing by 2014, and they have
provided passenger transport executives and Bristol, Nottingham and
Leicester local authorities with funding to achieve this. The PTEs are
working with Bristol, Nottingham and Leicester authorities on issues
such as systems testing, data analysis and ticketing equipment to
ensure that that Government objective is met in a timely and
cost-effective way. However, if, as we imagine, the Bill completes its
passage through Parliament without any change to the general power of
competence, local authorities in Nottingham, Leicester and Bristol will
have that power to engage in joint enterprises and deliver such
programmes, but passenger transport executives will
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000145">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
are a few other areas in which a general power might offer improvement,
such as in the provision of real-time information and other
technologies, for which joint service provision and shared back offices
would deliver efficiencies and help to reduce costs. It will become
increasingly important to facilitate joined-up service delivery, and a
general power would help to permit that. Passenger transport executives
would then be able to take a bigger role in joining up services across
districts and help realise efficiencies, which would be important in
the metropolitan areas that I have talked about. Allowing greater
innovation in how transport authorities procure services will be key.
For example, individual areas could deliver unique services and look at
commercial opportunities, such as supporting visitor attractions. I
have not yet managed to get in a plug for the fact that Salford will
become the host of Media City and for the BBC’s move to Salford.
That will be a major visitor attraction, so transport to and from that
part of Salford will be important.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000146">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The ability of
transport authorities and their executives to work closely with the new
local enterprise partnerships would be enhanced by a general power, as
they might need an opportunity to work across boundaries that might not
be the same as a transport authority’s. That would help to
establish suitable governance arrangements and help the bodies to join
initiatives started by local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
integration of transport is key. It is frustrating for our constituents
if they can make a journey by one method—for example, by bus or
by tram in Greater Manchester—but not get a joined-up service
that takes them to where they want to go. A general power would allow
passenger transport executives to do anything reasonable to pursue that
aim. For example, passenger transport executives might adopt a greater
role on rail stations, and a general power would help them to integrate
better, such as by assuming responsibility for railway land and
non-railway land. The ownership of land around transport facilities
might be unclear, and the acquisition of that land might help. A
general power would assist integrated transport authorities to secure
transport provision into and out of their areas, such as through
increments to long-distance rail franchises linking to London or other
cities—I hesitate to mention High Speed 2 at this
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000148">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that those examples have helped the Committee to understand that a
general power would give integrated transport authorities and passenger
transport executives the legal comfort to pursue some of the things
that I have talked about, which well-being powers are not able to give.
The general power of competence is important, because it will allow
that for local authorities and fire and rescue
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
I would like to touch on an anomaly. On Monday, a Delegated Legislation
Committee will consider the draft Greater Manchester Combined Authority
Order 2011. I think the Under-Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst, will be a member of the Committee, as will I. The order
aims to establish a combined authority for Greater Manchester. If
Parliament agrees to the order, it will dissolve the transport
authority and transfer its functions to the new Greater Manchester
combined authority. This Bill would give a general power of competence
to those 10 local authorities, so the Greater Manchester combined
authority, as the transport authority, will have a general power. It
will be the only one to have that; other transport authorities will
not. It is important that the Committee supports the new clause so that
all our transport authorities are put on the same
footing.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000150">&#160;</a>

some common cause with the hon. Lady on new clause 17 because she and I

consequences of the different

important that such bodies, like local authorities, have the suitable
powers to perform their roles. As she rightly pointed out, different
cases have different circumstances. We are about to create a new
specific case for Greater Manchester, so we need to be sure that any
powers provided by Parliament are the right ones, and that we do not
leave any unintended gaps or create any unintended
consequences.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000152">&#160;</a>

reassure Labour Members—particularly the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Erdington, who may be worried that I seek to add to his
count of Henry VIII clauses with the new clause’s wording.
First, I do not intend to press the new clause to a Division, and
secondly, my desire is to focus on a specific issue that affects my
constituency. I suspect that it also affects other parts of south
London, and it has been noted that a number of Members from south
London constituencies are on the Committee, but it is a shame not to
see the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich here

reasons that I will come to.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000162">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As Members
know, I represent Croydon Central. I have lived there all my life, and
I do not see myself living anywhere other than south London. It is a
great privilege to represent my home town in Parliament, which is only
slightly blighted by the fact that this building was built on the wrong
side of the River Thames. That is mitigated a little, however, by the
correct location of City Hall.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In a number
of ways, my constituents feel that they are being asked to pay for
things that they do not benefit from. People write to me about the
Olympics, questioning why there is a council tax levy for it in Croydon
when in Essex districts, much closer to the Olympic park, there is not.
I also get businesses asking why they are being asked to pay a
supplementary business rate for the Crossrail scheme, when my
constituency does not benefit directly. In those two cases, I give
fairly robust replies that such projects benefit Greater London as a
whole, and it is right that all Londoners contribute.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
particular example that I wish to raise, however, is the Lee valley
regional park levy, which council tax payers right across London have
to contribute to. For Members who are not aware of that issue, the Lee
valley regional park authority was created by the Lee Valley Regional
Park Act 1966. That was a piece of private legislation, so a specific
amendment to that legislation could not be added to the Bill because it
would have made the Bill hybrid. If that makes me sound as if I, as a
new Member, am familiar with the detailed intricacies of this matter, I
would like to clarify immediately that it is only thanks to the advice
of the Clerks that I managed to avoid submitting a defective amendment
and I am grateful to them for their
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000165">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
governance arrangements of the authority demonstrate how certain parts
of Greater London, Essex and Hertfordshire have a very distinct
interest in that authority and other parts of Greater London much less
so. There are 28 members of the authority, of which 20 come from what
are referred to as the riparian authorities—those councils that
have a bit of the park in their area—the county councils of
Essex and Hertfordshire, the Hertfordshire districts of Broxbourne and
East Hertfordshire, the Essex district of Epping Forest and the London
boroughs of Enfield, Hackney, Haringey, Newham, Tower Hamlets and
Waltham Forest. There are just eight members of the authority from the
other 26 London boroughs and the City of
London.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
authority has the power to place a levy on council tax payers right
across Essex, Hertfordshire and Greater London, so that, wherever one
lives within Essex, Hertfordshire and Greater London, one is asked to
pay the same contribution towards the costs of the authority. We are
not, I should make it clear, talking about huge sums of money—it
is about £3 for a band D council tax payer for the financial
year 2010-11—but obviously, when those sums are multiplied, they
are actually quite significant. For the London borough of Croydon, the
contribution is about £400,000. At a time when local authorities
across the country, for reasons that we will not go into today, are
facing significant reductions, that is a significant sum of money that
could be spent on the upkeep of parks and open spaces in the London
borough of
Croydon.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden will know that the London boroughs
of Croydon, Merton,

			Column number: 963<a class="bkMark" name="Column963">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Sutton and Wandsworth have joined together to promote a regional park
for the Wandle valley. That regional park does not have the ability to
ask council tax payers elsewhere to contribute towards it. The
contribution to the Lee valley regional park from those four boroughs
amounts to about £1.5 million that could be being spent on local
parks in our part of south London. I have never, in my 12 years as a
local councillor or my short time as a Member of the House, ever met
anybody from Croydon who has had the opportunity to visit or use that
park and when one takes into account the significant contributions of
public money being spent in the Lea valley under the Olympic Delivery
Authority, the case that this is not consistent with the principles of
localism is a strong
one.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Members
on the Front Bench have demonstrated throughout our proceedings on the
Bill a willingness to listen to the arguments that have been made. With
due respect to the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, whom I have not known
for so long, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells
and my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, whom I have
known for a long time, all of whose commitment to the principles of
localism has been of very long standing, the case I want to put to the
Front Bench today and ask them to go away and consider is that it is
surely not consistent with the principles of localism that the people
of Croydon are asked to pay for something that they do not use and have
never asked to be provided with. It would be much more consistent with
those principles if the resources that are currently devoted to the Lee
valley regional park could be spent on local parks and facilities in
south London. Having made that argument, I will not detain the
Committee
further.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000169">&#160;</a>

Committee’s business, I join in paying tribute to the fantastic
way in which you and Mr Bayley have chaired the Committee, Mr Amess. It
is always a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. I am sorry that
we have not managed to stray into debating Southend-on-Sea, as we
sometimes do from time to time, but we all appreciate the good humour
that you and Mr Bayley have shown and also the support we have had from
the Committee Clerks. I know that my right hon. Friend the Member for
Tunbridge Wells will be saying more about that in due
course.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000170">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon Central for
raising this point. I want to put it on the record at once that the
suggestion that Croydon is the South Carolina of Greater London and
will be the first to secede is not entirely well-founded. We are doing
our best to avoid any repeat of Fort Sumter at Crystal
Palace.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000171">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">However,
it demonstrates a legitimate concern and perhaps something of the
history of the matter, so I understand the point. My hon. Friend is
quite right. The specific issue that arises comes from a localised and
local Bill that was passed—hence the way in which the amendment
is drafted. You will know, Mr Amess, that I am in a slightly hybrid
position myself as far as this issue is concerned, being an Essex man
who, I hasten to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 964<a class="bkMark" name="Column964">&#160;</a>
                           </div>add, moved voluntarily to south London, and who tries one way or another
to straddle both sides of the river—not an entirely comfortable
circumstance, particularly if you are 5 feet 6 inches. But, in all
events, it perhaps demonstrates the way that these things are sometimes
thrown up as an accident of
history.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
should bear in mind that, at the time when the 1966 Act was passed, it
was not intended that the people of Croydon or Bromley would contribute
to the regional park, but it was intended that those of London,
Hertfordshire and Essex would, since they were the three promoting
authorities of the private Bill. It was simply the case that, in those
days, the Greater London council had a parks function. And there were
other Greater London-run parks. Crystal Palace park was one of them,
which, upon abolition of the GLC, ironically and interestingly
transferred to Bromley, which was responsible for its upkeep, although
the park was in closer physical proximity to Croydon and, I suspect,
probably more people from there used it than those from Bromley. That
is just one of those anomalies. Brockwell park in south London is
another example.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Therefore,
the Act reflected functions at the time. The difference was that when
the GLC was abolished and the responsibility for the funding
transferred to the boroughs as its successor authorities in relation to
the parks, and the Greater London authority was created—I am
sure, if he was here, the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
would be able to explain the exact process by which that was arrived
at—it was thought, precisely because the GLA was not intended to
be a service delivery body, that it was best to leave with the London
boroughs the responsibility for this particular body. There was,
therefore, no magic in the way this has arisen. But it is an event of
history. And it is, of course, worth knowing—I want to make sure
that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington, is not left out of
this—that the Lea valley has been a highway for commerce and the
transport of people since, it is believed, pre-Roman times. There are
significant archaeological finds, including Greek coins, which indicate
the extent of trade and commerce between the Lea valley and other parts
of Europe.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000174">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The nub of
the point is that the Lee valley regional park authority has a
particular function and the sums involved are not large, although I
understand why they are sensitive in the current circumstances. The
provision for the payment comes under a broader power—the
Levying Bodies (General) Regulations 1992—and it would be
difficult to unscramble this particular levying arrangement in
isolation, without looking at the wider implications of other bodies
that might be subject to that levying power.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, the
Lee valley regional park authority has some quite significant
functions. I have visited the park and had done so before I was a
Minister. There is a balance between those facilities which are local
and those which are regional. It was conceived as regional in the
Greater London sense. We should bear it in mind that the body delivers
important functions which I do not think the Government or indeed my
hon. Friend the Member for Croydon Central would wish to prejudice. It
manages a very substantial linear park running through that part of
London—some 10,000 acres of green space in an area that is in
parts not well served with green spaces, as you and I are aware, Mr
Amess, knowing that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 965<a class="bkMark" name="Column965">&#160;</a>
                           </div>part of the world from the past. Its zone of sporting excellence
attracts people from across London and, of course, it will be playing
an important legacy role in managing post-Olympics the velodrome and
several other key sporting facilities. We obviously would not want the
matter of fairness in funding to prejudice those necessary
objectives.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000176">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am grateful
to my hon. Friend for saying that he will not press the new clause to a
Division. I am more than happy to meet him to see what we can do, but I
suspect that there would have to be a consensus among the participating
bodies that currently fund the park for a change to be made, and I do
not hold out great hope that such a provision is likely to be
deliverable. Nevertheless he has drawn attention to an anomaly in
history, which it is reasonable to explore in order to explain what
benefits might or might not be achieved. If funding goes in that
direction, we can make sure that people from our boroughs in that part
of London receive the benefits that, I imagine, the promoters of the
1966 Act intended they should from receive a broader regional
facility.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000177">&#160;</a>

educated in the history of Greater London governance and wider western
European culture than when we started. I am grateful to my hon. Friend
for recognising the anomalous nature of the park. As he said, it was
one of several parks that the Greater London council had responsibility
for, and its status was different from that of some other parks, such
as Crystal Palace park on the border of my constituency, when the GLC
was abolished. Given the nature of this morning’s debate on the
royal parks, and when the Government are clearly looking at transfer to
the Greater London authority or perhaps to the boroughs, the anomalous
status of the park could be further accentuated. I am grateful for my
hon. Friend’s offer to have further discussions about it, and I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000178">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On a point of order, Mr Amess. Thank you for your
guidance and advice, which have seen us through the Committee. On
behalf of the Committee, I pay tribute to the way you have conducted
proceedings, which has been firm and expert, but always genial. We have
enjoyed hugely your presence in the Chair. I hope that you will convey
to your colleague, Mr Bayley, our thanks for his equal diligence,
expertise and patience with us. We are very grateful.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000201">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On behalf of
my colleagues, I extend thanks to the Clerks who have served on the
Committee. I do not know whether they consider that they drew the short
straw, because this is one the longest Bills before Parliament. We are
grateful for their expert handling of the many clauses and complex
amendments. They have served us extremely well.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000202">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am
grateful, too, to the Doorkeepers. Perhaps the Doorkeeper who is
present might thank his colleagues. Consideration of a large number of
clauses and amendments involves many shouts and jumps up and down for
the Doorkeepers to ensure that we are present and correct. We have been
well served, for which I am grateful.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000203">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I also thank
my officials who, as members of the Committee will have seen, have been
dispensing inspiration from the first day of our proceedings. They have
had the frustration of not always seeing their words of inspiration
necessarily being translated into words that made it into 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 967<a class="bkMark" name="Column967">&#160;</a>
                           </div>
                           <em>Hansard</em>, which must be a particular source of frustration and
grinding of teeth. However, they have borne that willingly and
courteously, and we are grateful to them.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000204">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that all the Committee will want to extend thanks to our Whips,
on both sides, who have got us through this far. In fact, rather like
our performance in the Ashes this summer, we have had almost an innings
to spare to complete our proceedings. They have done that with only one
of our number having to be transported to eastern China to keep us in
order.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000205">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
think we all would agree that the Bill has had a thorough airing, which
is a remarkable achievement. We have had time to consider each of the
clauses, and have a little time at the end—I do not propose to
use it all. The judgment and pace that the two Whips have reflected
have ensured that, in the best traditions of Public Bill Committees, we
have had the chance to consider, at the appropriate length, each of the
clauses before the Committee. I have certainly enjoyed serving under
the guidance of them both, for which I am
grateful.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I thank all
members of the Committee, who have been remarkable. The Bill has been
wide-ranging in content, and detailed and expert in some of its
particulars. When we began, I mentioned that the Committee was
over-subscribed. Usually, the Whips have to threaten consequences to
hon. Members for not serving on Committees, but on this one we had to
let people down gently. All hon. Members have taken a determined
approach to give the Bill proper scrutiny. We have heard speeches from
both sides that have been passionate and committed, and have reflected
individual experience of all the matters in hand. We have benefited
greatly from the contributions of hon. Members from both sides of the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000207">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Our
proceedings have been noticed elsewhere. Some of the conversations that
I have had with some of the groups that follow these proceedings
suggest that they have been impressed at the degree of scrutiny and the
seriousness with which these matters have been approached. That is, in
large part, a tribute to my fellow Ministers, who are experts in the
area of which they have been speaking, and at the end of it, they are
the world’s living experts on the areas that they have been
leading on.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would also
like to extend my thanks to the Opposition Front Benchers. One thing
that has been clear is that this has not been a ritual exchange of
preconceived ideas, merely as an opportunity to read into the record
party political and partisan views—quite the opposite. We have
made progress; we have deepened our understanding. As the Bill
progresses through Parliament, every member of the Committee will see
reflected in it the improvements that the Committee, comprised of
Members from all parts of the House, has suggested. I am particularly
grateful for the manner in which the Opposition Front Benchers have
conducted proceedings. It has made for a better
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
I thank Members and organisations outside the Committee Room for their
advice. This is an important Bill for many organisations, whether they
are voluntary groups or members of the planning profession. They have
spent a lot of time and attention on helping to guide our discussions.
I hope that they feel that we have

                           </div>listened and responded to their suggestions. We will continue to do that
as the Bill continues its passage through
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000210">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Further to that point of order, Mr
Amess. On behalf of my colleagues, I would like to add our thanks to
you and Mr Bayley. I think he is in an interesting place today. I
forget where he said he was going—India, I think. Is that far
enough for the Government Whip? You have both really helped us,
particularly those Members and shadow Ministers who are new to their
role. I remember speaking to you on the first day and saying,
“You do realise that we are all new to this.” You have
helped us—I am grateful for that—as have Mrs Davies and
her team. The advice that they give is invaluable to those of us
without parliamentary draftsmen and civil servants to back
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am always in awe of <em>Hansard</em> and its ability to turn what we say
into a coherent debate. That is a great thing. I want to thank all the
officials, if you can pass on the thanks to all the people who have
been here, Mr Amess. We had at least one late night. I also
want to thank the Doorkeepers, who are having to adjust to the new role
of having two doors to deal with at once when there is a Division. I
know that there are some anxious moments
then.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000212">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
agree with the Minister that when we have argued in the Committee it
has been on questions of principle. There have been some heated
debates, as they are often called, but if it is about principle, rather
than about personalities, that is as it should be. It has been welcome
to have Liberal Democrat Members trying out the context of arguing
within the coalition, even if it was only the hon. Member for Bradford
East, who for ever dubbed Mr Amess as Mr Bradford, who followed through
with his vote. I look forward to reports of more courageous stands at
the Liberal Democrat spring conference this weekend. Let us hope that
it does not lead to too much foreign
travel.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
thank my hon. and right hon. Friends on the Committee. I particularly
thank my fellow shadow Ministers. It is a lot of work to be the
Opposition on a Bill. I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for
Plymouth, Moor View cannot be here, as she had to attend a family
funeral. The passion that she brings on housing has enlivened our
debate and I thank her for that. My hon. Friend the Member for
Birmingham, Erdington has brought wisdom, historical knowledge and
humour to our proceedings. I hope that all the Dog and Duck pubs in the
country are grateful for all the mentions they have had. Members will
be saddened to learn that I checked and found that we do not have a Dog
and Duck in Salford. We have a Dog and Partridge pub in my
constituency, however. That is the closest we will get, I
think.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I also want
to thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich,
who has been delayed—I think he will miss this final sitting as
well. He has the benefit of layers of experience of previous
legislation, which I have found helpful. I thank him for his
contributions. I thank all members of the Committee, particularly
Labour Members, as they have brought to the Committee the wisdom and
insight gained from experience. I feel that I know a lot more about
Lewisham, Mitcham and Morden, Gateshead, Sunderland and 
<div class="columnNumber">

government, housing and planning—has been valuable.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000215">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is unusual
to thank the Whips, is it not? I would particularly like to thank my
hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde, who stepped in at the
last minute. That is a good thing to do, and I thank him for his work
and patience. To the hon. Member for North Herefordshire I say that we
have reached where we said we would
reach.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000216">&#160;</a>

of time to do all the reflecting and thinking that they have promised
to do. I look forward to returning to our consideration on Report,
because we have a bit of work to do to finish the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11031044000217">&#160;</a>

have just heard as flattery, soft soap or flannel, but I do not. I
greatly appreciate all the kind remarks that have been made, and I know
that Mr Bayley would appreciate them if he were here. For us both, it
has been an absolute pleasure to chair the Committee, not least because
of the way hon. Members have conducted

had not served on a Committee before, or indeed were new to their posts
as Ministers or shadow spokesmen, the way the business has been dealt
with, in time, has been quite remarkable. At a time when
parliamentarians sometimes feel that they are under siege, the
Committee has set a high benchmark. That reflects great credit on the
way this Parliament and this Committee have conducted
