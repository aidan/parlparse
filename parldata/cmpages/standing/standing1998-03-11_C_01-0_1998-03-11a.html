<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 13, at beginning insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Subject to subsection (2A) below,'.<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) In making an order under subsection (2) above, the Secretary of State shall have regard to the need to make regulations under section 47 of the Weights and Measures Act 1985 in relation to the sale of draught beer and cider.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Wells. Members of the Committee are reassured that you will be presiding over our proceedings. Although we shall want to give the Bill thorough consideration, I am advised that that need not be at an excessive level--provided that we do justice to the important issues that are before us. With respect and deference, may I suggest, Mr. Wells, that you consider allowing our debate to range slightly wider than usual.
<P>
For proper procedural reasons, the Bill did not receive the usual Second Reading debate. It was approved on the nod, as a result of which the context in which the Committee will be considering the matter has not yet been explained. I hope that you, Mr. Wells, will allow me some latitude so that I can explain why I have tabled the amendments, but I shall be guided by you.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am willing to allow a certain latitude, given the right hon. Member's representations and the lack of a debate on Second Reading. However, we must stick fairly strictly to the amendments, so I shall not allow too much latitude.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I accept your guidance, Mr. Wells, for which I am grateful.
<P>
Occasionally, we hear references to issues before us in the House or in Committee being matters of froth. Usually, that expression is only a term of art, or even a term of abuse--but in this case it is an accurate description of the Bill that we are about to discuss. Much of the debate will revolve around froth--or, to put it more accurately, the head of certain beers.
<P>
I emphasised the word ``certain'', because we must take into account the enormous number of beers that are available to beer drinkers in this country. I have done some homework on the matter. I concede that some Labour Members' experience of such matters far outweighs mine. In fact, many of them outweigh me--probably because of their appreciation of this subject.
<P>
When I looked up the figures, I found to my astonishment that, in this country, there are about 370 variants of draft cask-conditioned beer, 335 non-cask conditioned beers, 290 lagers, 430 light pale and export ales, 25 stouts and 30 brown ales. That shows the problem confronting anyone who seeks to standardise the delivery of beer, especially given the huge variety of outlets and products. That would be bad enough, but matters are further complicated by the head on beer.
<P>
Members might be interested to know that I have been given figures that show the variation in the head of beers, which is a mixture of liquid and gas, not just liquid, wherein lies another of the problems with which we must grapple today. There is 3 per cent. liquid in the head of a pint of Fuller's London Pride; 5 per cent. in a pint of Fosters lager; 25 to 33 per cent. in a pint of Guinness, 40 per cent. in a pint of Mansfield Smooth; 50 per cent. in a pint of John Smith Smooth. We are confronted by a variation in not only 1,500 kinds of beer--from draft cask-conditioned to stouts--but from 3 to 50 per cent. liquid in the head.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Cummings </B>(Easington): It is interesting to hear about those percentages, but perhaps the Committee might be interested in another proportion. There are 88 pints of beer in a cask, but that increases to between 90 and 94 pints when the head is taken into account. That equates to many tens of millions of pounds, given the volume of beer that is sold.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; he helps to show the difficulty with which the Committee is faced in considering how to maximise customer confidence in the amount of beer that people receive in their local or any other place where beer is sold. The difficulty arises partly from the way that beer is traditionally delivered and partly--in contradiction to the sponsors' desire, which I well understand--from seeking to maximise customer confidence and satisfaction. There is no disagreement between us on that. The disagreement arises in trying to identify the best way in which that can be done. I believe that the existing arrangements are satisfactory, which is why I tabled the amendments.
<P>
Apart from anything else, I do not understand where the dissatisfaction arises. Before the Minister does so, I shall draw the Committee's attention to a letter that arrived by some mysterious process on his desk this morning from the Local Authorities Co-ordinating Body on Trading Standards, the body for which he has responsibility. Having seen these modest amendments, which I tabled on Monday and which appeared on the amendment paper yesterday, LACOTS told the Minister--I think that I paraphrase the letter fairly--that it does not like the amendments at all. LACOTS believes that the amount of beer dispensed can be measured satisfactorily under the Bill. However, I contend that it is more reasonable, fairer, and more efficacious for trading standards officers to measure several different items in measuring the amount of beer dispensed. Not only the trade but trading standards officers acknowledge that there is a degree of variation in the amount dispensed.
<P>
The trade responds to that point by saying that it is very much aware of its need to please its customers, who are discriminating and who want to ensure that they are getting full measure. The trade says that if customers feel that they have received less than full measure, it will always provide a top-up to satisfy them that they have had what they should have.
<P>
Against that background, we can readily see that if trading standards officers were to check measures on the basis of only one item, that could lead to a false conclusion. The purpose of my amendment is to allow--indeed, to insist on--a degree of variation by enlarging the sample size to ensure that a proper measure is taken. That is not unreasonable, given what I have said about the enormous variations in the product itself--bitters, lagers, stouts and so on--and in the head, which is the matter of contention.
<P>
Let us for the sake of argument consider a flat product--I use that term in a rather non-technical sense--such as milk. The Minister may correct me, but I think I am right in saying that milk bottles, which some of us still have delivered to our doorsteps--I am happy to say that I do--do not all contain exactly a pint; there are overages and underages. Other products that we drink are rarely, if ever, subject to the degree of precision sought under the Bill.
<P>
Milk is not an effervescent product--again, my language is not strictly technical--it is not grassy, or whatever. The head of the beer provides the real complication, as it contains a volatile mixture of gas and liquid. That means that it is difficult to take a precise measure of what has been dispensed.
<P>
If we then consider the different possible configurations of the container--whether there should be a line marked on the container; how far above that line should be allowed for variation in the head; what allowance should be made for the collapse of the head over what period of time--we see that considerable complications and difficulties arise in finding one simple, standard, elegant way of measuring beer, which is dispensed in a huge variety of ways. It may be dispensed by the traditional hand-pull pump; there may be free flow into a glass with a measure; it can be metered.
<P>
The Bill is an attempt--wrongly, I submit--to find one way of providing the consumer with a measure of confidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex): Has my right hon. Friend read a letter dated 6 March from the Local Authorities Co-ordinating Body on Trading Standards, from someone purporting to be a senior executive officer, whatever that may be? The letter states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Cabinet Office, the Welsh Office, the Scottish Office''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
all great Ministries of State, which I should have thought would have many more important things to do--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``COSLA and the Local Government Association have . . . agreed''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
something called ``an Enforcement Concordat''.
<P>
My right hon. Friend will be glad to hear that the enforcement concordat is the method by which LACOTS intends to apply the best principles of good enforcement. Has my right hon. Friend had time to study those regulations? If not, may I draw his attention to a document issued by the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association with a title that is one of the most moving and memorable that I have ever read: ``Guidance Notes on the Dispense of Draught Beer by Free Flow and Hand Pull.'' If my right hon. Friend has had time to study that document, he will know that the Bill is a meaningless waste of time, since that guidance recommends that requests from customers for top-ups
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``should be received with good grace and never refused''--<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> My hon. Friend touches on an important point. I suppose that that would explain a difference of approach that may emerge during our proceedings between that taken by Labour Members of the Committee--and possibly by the two Liberal Democrat Committee Members sitting alongside me--all of whom are instinctively more comfortable with a regulatory, interventionist, simple, standard approach to matters, and that taken by me and my hon. Friend, who are more at home with a commonsense approach to the matter.
<P>
We start from the basis that the brewers' own interest lies in pleasing their customers. Why should we start with the assumption that producers and dispensers of beer would want to fool their customers? They rely on customers returning again and again to the same product and, ideally, the same place. That is the concept of a regular. Where is someone's regular place of drinking; where is someone's local? It is somewhere where people go because they feel confidence, because they know that people there want to please them, and so on. That is the core of the difference of approach.
<P>
I also have a copy of the document to which my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) referred, which gives firm guidance to the dispensers of beer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Hall </B>(Weaver Vale): When will the right hon. Gentleman get round to explaining the amendment?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should like the right hon. Gentleman to refer to the amendments and perhaps to explain subsections (2A) and (2B), to which they refer. The time has come when the Committee would benefit from that.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> The amendments would allow a broader approach to be taken on the measurement technique used to discover whether beer is being dispensed properly. Therefore, it is important to consider the confidence factor, to which I have referred. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex has said, top-ups are given when customers ask for them if they think that they have not been given full measure. I should be interested to know whether any Labour Member can give an example of that not happening.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Nigel Griffiths):</B> I have a copy of a letter that was sent to a Conservative Member in which his constituent says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I am fed up of asking for every pint to be topped up.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an example of a Conservative Member writing to me asking me to do something about that. Fortunately, I can rely on my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. Turner) to do it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> That is partly helpful, but that example would have been more interesting if the letter had gone on to say, ``I had been refused a top-up.'' That illustrates the problem very well.
<P>
I am interested to know how Labour Members believe that greater accuracy can be achieved without other problems arising. We shall briefly debate the merits of lined glasses, brimful glasses and so on, which are different elements of the debate.
<P>
Labour Members must satisfy me, and perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex, about how they envisage the alternative suggestion in the Bill, which seeks to return us to the section 43 provisions that previously existed. I am saying that the status quo--that is, without section 43--is perfectly adequate and, moreover, that measuring should be carried out on a broader basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsha Singh: </B>(Bradford, West): Two issues are involved in top-ups. First, customers might want to have good relationships with their local landlords and, if they continually ask for top-ups, there might be problems with those relationships and there might be no other local with the same amenities which they want to attend. Secondly, when a pint of beer is pulled and settles that is regarded as the customer's pint. If the customer asks for a top-up, the pint is unsettled. Many people want a settled pint of beer, but a top-up disturbs the head and the whole pint of beer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I accept that that is an important element of the judgment to which we must come. I have not yet mentioned the other side of the argument: if a line is put on glasses at the point where the liquid content is 20 fl. oz. and the head is on top, which might give the confidence that we all want customers to have, the problem will be that customers will get more than the liquid element of the existing measure and the price of a pint will almost certainly have to rise.
<P>
It is highly likely that the Bill will require the price of pints to be increased. In order to give satisfaction based on the line measurement technique which lies behind the Bill, the customer will have to receive more than a pint.
<P>
It is up to Labour Members to make their own judgment whether the reassurance that they believe will flow from the Bill is worth an inevitable increase in the price of a pint of beer. My judgment is that that would not be worthwhile. The existing regime satisfies the vast majority of customers and that there is a good relationship between the millions of beer drinkers and the brewers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Singh:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree in principle that it is better for a customer to know that he has been served a pint of beer than to suspect or know that he has not been?
<P>
<B>Mr Forth:</B> Of course I agree with that statement. The difference between us concerns how we best arrive at that end. We are not disputing ends; we are disputing means. When we discuss another amendment, I will argue that a brimful glass is superior to a glass with a line on it, for reasons on which I will elaborate later.
<P>
I do not disagree with the hon. Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Singh) about what we want to achieve. Although I agree with what the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East wants to achieve, the way in which he is seeking to achieve it--the approach that underpins the Bill--could well be detrimental to the relationship between beer producers and beer drinkers, and would inevitably lead to an increase in price. That would not be a good deal for beer drinkers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cummings:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Wells. May I apologise to the Committee? I was so captivated by the eloquence of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) that I omitted to declare an interest at the beginning of our proceedings. I act as a parliamentary adviser to the National Association of Licensed House Managers. I spoke to the Registrar of Members' Interests this morning, and he advised me that I ought to declare that interest this afternoon, but that that would not inhibit my making a contribution to the debate. I apologise, Mr. Wells.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the Committee is obliged to the hon. Gentleman for making that statement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dennis Turner </B>(Wolverhampton, South-East): May I at the outset offer you our warm congratulations on your chairmanship, Mr. Wells? I am sure that if you bring to the Committee all the attributes and skills that you bring to so many of your other parliamentary duties, we shall be most grateful for your chairmanship. In his opening remarks, the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst pointed out that the Bill received a formal Second Reading and was not subject to debate on the Floor. For that reason, I hope that you will indulge us and allow us to make a few general comments.
<P>
The Bill is intended to deal with the highly unsatisfactory situation regarding the sale of draught beers and cider. The courts have ruled that the gas contained in the head--the combination of gas and liquid that forms when beer and cider are poured from the barrel--may be included when measuring how much beer or cider the consumer has received. Those rulings have created considerable uncertainty about what volume of liquid the consumer is entitled to receive when he requests a pint of beer or cider.
<P>
Local authority trading standards departments have found it difficult to bring successful prosecutions for short measure. Too many people in the trade have taken advantage of the law's uncertainty and have been content to serve consumers with less than a full liquid measure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there have been a number of successful prosecutions in different parts of the country, which suggests that it might not be as difficult to bring prosecutions as he suggests? It varies in this matter, as in so many other matters of law, according to the differences between one part of the country and another--different courts, different trading standards officers, different bars and so on. Prosecutions have been brought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Turner:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has already referred to the Local Authorities Co-ordinating Body on Trading Standards report, which mentioned the unsatisfactory situation found by trading standards officers. Trading standards officers have not been able to bring many prosecutions and, in some areas, they have given up testing because of the almost impossible position that they have been placed in by case law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> May I urge the hon. Gentleman not to take LACOT's evidence too seriously? I had dealings with LACOTS when working at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and it has some fine people working for it. However, too many enforcement officers regard the business of enforcement as scalp hunting, and the number of prosecutions that they can achieve is generally regarded as a measure of their good efforts--which is, of course, quite untrue. Might not the problem with the LACOTS submission be that trading standards officers cannot find much evidence of the sort of confusion that the hon. Gentleman mentioned because it does not exist? The hon. Gentleman seems to be labouring under the misapprehension that publicans the length and breadth of the land are quite deliberately short-changing their customers. That is not true, which is why LACOTs cannot find any evidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Turner:</B> I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's contention. We are talking about people who are doing a job of work; they are involved in regulation on behalf of the Government. As a Minister in the previous Government, the hon. Gentleman would have been expected to support people working on behalf of the consumer in sometimes difficult circumstances. We should be more appreciative of their work, instead of being critical.
<P>
	In 1979, the Labour Administration sought to deal with problem that we are debating today through section 19 of the Weights and Measures Act 1979. As the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst said, that a provision was subsequently consoldiated in section 43 of the Weights and Measures Act 1985. Under section 43 of the 1985 Act, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry could have appointed a day from which full liquid measures would have to be served. Regretably, section 43 is no longer on the statute book. It is the purpose of my Bill to put it back--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I asked the Committee to return from the Division in 10 minutes, but the Clerk has been a teller and has not yet returned. I crave the Committee's indulgence for a few more minutes until he does so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Wells. Several members of the Committee will have received copious briefing on the issue; I hope that you have not been troubled with that, Mr. Wells, as you have many other things to concern yourself with. Extremely unusually, even the Department of Trade and Industry has issued guidance notes on the Bill; I cannot remember such an occurrence before, but I welcome it. It is very good of the DTI to have taken such trouble to set out what is at stake in the Bill.
<P>
I have also been subject to a barrage of paper from brewers, licensed victuallers and others. I understand that it is important that I should know what they think. However, I have received a piece of paper from the British Weights and Measures Association, on early-day motion 627, signed by Mr. John Gardner, the parliamentary liaison officer for the association, who gives his address as the House of Commons, SWI; it is not written on House of Commons writing paper--and that is not the subject of my complaint. I know that organisations such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union have offices in the House of Commons, but I was not aware that the British Weights and Measures Association did. Would you, Mr. Wells, draw to the attention of the Serjeant at Arms the fact that a branch office of that association exists in the House of Commons? I am not sure that that is the right place for it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for the Chair, but I shall draw the attention of the Serjeant at Arms to the matter because it seems, prima facie, to be of concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dennis Turner:</B> I have come to an interesting part of my contribution, of which the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst should take note. He may want to comment on it, in the light of his earlier contribution.
<P>
I ask the Committee to recall the fate of section 43--as was--of the Weights and Measures Act 1985. In the run-up to the 1992 general election, the Conservative Government acknowledged that there was a problem with short measures. A date of 1 April 1994 was set for section 43 to come into force, but many in the trade complained that serving a full measure would force up prices dramatically. The Government therefore cancelled a commencement date for section 43 in exchange for the voluntary agreement to which the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has referred. Under that agreement, the trade undertook to serve not less than 95 per cent. of a liquid pint, with a top-up to a full pint only if the consumer requested it.
<P>
Rather than waiting to see if the voluntary agreement would give consumers a fair deal, the Government used the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 to remove section 43 from the 1985 Act. A survey of local authorities undertaken by the Campaign for Real Ale--CAMRA--last year found that only 20 per cent. of so-called pints contained a full pint, while 55 per cent. contained between 95 per cent. and 99 per cent. of a pint and 25 per cent. less than 95 per cent. of a pint. That concerns us greatly. Some courts have also failed to find for local authorities, even when a licensee is found to be in breach of the 95 per cent. voluntary agreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Jones </B>(Cheltenham): I am concerned that one in four pints are sold at short measure. I had a fax this morning from Mr. Tony Aburrow, the chairman of Gloucestershire CAMRA. He said that the main purpose of the Bill is to put a stop to such practice. I would not expect to key in to the cash machine downstairs that I wanted &#163;20 and to receive a &#163;10 note, a &#163;5 note and four pound coins. It is all very well for the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst to say that a person can ask for a top-up, but I would not want to walk to the nearest NatWest bank to claim my extra pound.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dennis Turner:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. As he said, 80 per cent. of pubs serve short measures. My Bill will introduce a new section 43 into the Weights and Measures Act 1985. It will provide that the gas contained in the head of beer or cider is disregarded for the purpose of measuring the quantity of beer or cider that is served. The consumer will be entitled to receive a full liquid pint, including the liquid in the head, but excluding the gas in the head.
<P>
In one respect, the proposed new section 43 goes further than section 43 in the 1985 Act. My Bill covers shandy, lager top and low-alcohol or no-alcohol beer and cider. That will ensure that consumers of those drinks receive the same protection as beer and cider drinkers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman about to explain how to deal with the problem of the huge variation in the head of the liquid content? I said earlier that that could vary from 3 per cent. to 50 per cent. and I referred to the difficulties of the visible liquid part in respect of measuring the full 20 fluid ounces. There will be more beer in the head, which can vary from product to product and pint to pint and which may cause an increase in the price.
<P>
<B>Mr. Turner:</B> The issue is simple. The liquid in the froth is part of the full liquid pint. The gas in the beer is not. With the lined glasses that we recommend should be introduced, it will be possible to take the beer to that line or, if the measure has a large frothy head of beer, to take it to just below the line to give a full measure of beer. That will happen if the Bill is enacted.
<P>
When my Bill was published, sections of the trade again raised the spectre of price rises. Such claims constitute scare-mongering by an increasingly isolated minority of those in the trade. Price increases would not be justified if full regard was paid to how the Bill would operate and the realities of the market. First, the Bill would not come into force immediately following Royal Assent, but on a date to be appointed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. I know that she intends to give the trade a reasonable period within which to phase in any changes necessary to comply with the Bill to minimise the costs involved.
<P>
Secondly, most licensees who do not currently serve a full measure will introduce larger beer glasses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Jenkins </B>(Tamworth): As my hon. Friend knows, in our part of the world there is already a brewery that guarantees a full pint. That brewery does not charge any more for its beer than other breweries. Different breweries certainly produce pints differently, but one of the worst sorts of beer is the modern innovation of smooth-flow beer, which is very profitable for the breweries. More than &#163;5 million a week is taken out of beer drinkers' pockets and put into landlords' pockets by that. The mechanism can be simply adjusted; if it can be done by one brewery, it can be done by others. It is surely the duty of the sellers to ensure that the contract is delivered--that they deliver a full pint.
<P>
<B>Mr. Turner:</B> My hon. Friend makes his point dramatically. I can tell him that 20 per cent. of all retail outlets already give a full, fair pint. It is patently untrue to say that it cannot be done. It is happening every day. In the midlands, including Worcestershire, the area that the right hon. Member from Bromley and Chislehurst represented before the general election, one large regional brewer has been giving a full pint for 20 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> That may be true, but does the hon. Gentleman, with his well-known love of beer, seriously suggest that we should seek to standardise the nature of beer, and the production, distribution and dispensing of it? He said a moment ago that a price increase scare had emanated from a small isolated minority in the trade. I have here a letter from Bass, which can hardly be described as a small isolated minority brewer. I shall let him see it, although he probably has a copy. In it, Bass says that it is unhappy about the Bill, not least because it seeks to standardise a product--one whose diversity I expected us all to glory in.
<P>
<B>Mr. Turner:</B> The real issue between us is obvious. The two Conservative Members speak for the large brewers. We speak for beer drinkers. There is a clear difference in our approach. We do not want standardisation. We want to give beer drinkers a full, fair pint of liquid beer. That is the essence of the Bill.
<P>
The Bill will result in less spillage when beer is pulled, giving savings in overheads for licensees and leading to fewer requests for top-ups. The beer contained in the froth would form part of the liquid measure, so the licensse would not have to serve more than the measure required by the consumer.
<P>
Some licensees have voluntarily served a full pint for a number of years, and I gave an example a moment ago. They have not priced themselves out of the market, even though many of their competitors have been serving less than a full measure. If any licensee raises prices, he is in effect giving notice to his customers that they may hitherto have received short measure. In its voluntary agreement, the trade acknowledged that where a consumer asked for a full pint he would be entitled to receive that measure without having to pay a higher price than consumers who were served only 95 per cent. of a pint as mentioned earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Keetch </B>(Hereford): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that cider makers have been penalised for many years because cider does not have a head? Cider makers have to produce a pint of cider. Cider drinkers get what they pay for--a pint of cider--whereas some beer producers produce a pint of which the customer gets only 95 per cent. The Bill is not only about fairness to consumers, but about parity between brewers and cider makers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Turner:</B> That is well put and I entirely endorse the point--[Interruption]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. All members of the Committee are very knowledgeable about the issue--on which people throughout the land are moved to great passion. However, it is out of order to exchange sedentary remarks across the Committee, and I would ask hon. Members to stay in order.

<P>

<B>Mr. Turner:</B> Although the problem of the short measure has existed for many years, the passage of time has not reduced consumer dissatisfaction. A survey commissioned by CAMRA last December found that 84 per cent. of those interviewed thought that they should receive a full liquid measure of beer. The courts, market forces and the trade's own agreement have, despite many opportunities to do so, failed to give beer drinkers a fair deal. It is time for Parliament to intervene, and I commend my Bill to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I join others in saying how pleased I am, Mr. Wells, that you are chairing the Committee. As my former Whip, you know my grave deficiencies and I shall endeavour to keep them under control.
<P>
In the spirit of harmony, I should declare a small, if irrelevant, interest. For many years, my family owned a brewery called Holes Newark Ales and it brewed a splendid beer, which generally gave what Jeeves called almost universal satisfaction. All that I have left from that wonderful time is an extremely dilapidated, cigarette-stained tin ashtray with the company name written on it. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East said that my right hon. Friend and I represent the big breweries, but nothing could be further from the truth. If anything, I speak on behalf of a very small brewery in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude), which has taken the trouble to tell me its views.
<P>
I shall do something that you would not believe I could do, Mr. Wells--stick to the matter under debate. Much as I love the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East, he gave a first-class Second Reading speech which ranged over the width of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding the Committee that we are discussing an amendment. I think that we can agree to terminate the Second Reading stage and I should be obliged if the hon. Gentleman, and subsequent speakers stuck very closely to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I was going to say, Mr. Wells, that the hon. Gentleman gave us such a good canter through the Bill that it would be futile to ask whether I can stray even a little.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and I seek through the amendment to retain--to the advantage, not disadvantage, of consumers--the different types of beer that are sold to the public, in the correct measure. I deprecate any bad behaviour on the part of publicans in flouting the rules; that is disgraceful and, indeed, extremely short-sighted. Any publican who behaves in that way would surely lose much custom. The competitive nature of the brewing industry and of the pub business is today so great that that cannot be sensible business practice. It is stupid. Like bookmakers, the one thing that publicans are not is stupid.
<P>
One of the great glories of this country is the diversity of our beers. I am sure that you, Mr. Wells, know better than most of us about the wonderful different types of bigger head, thicker head and lesser head of beer that are available. As the hon. Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins) rightly said, many new beers are swirled into glasses. There may be room for argument. I am not supporting bad conduct; it is my job to stick up for the interests of the consumer and the one thing that the consumer does not want is boring standardisation--the very point that my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is making.
<P>
People know that different pubs sell different beers. Indeed, a person could change his mind and have a pint of cider--in which case there would be no argument as the glass would be full to the top.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keetch:</B> When a person buys a pint of cider, he will receive a pint of cider. Yet when he asks for a pint of bitter or stout later in the evening and it is served in a glass of the same size, he will receive only 95 per cent. of a pint. Surely, the right hon. Gentleman accepts that a slightly larger glass that would allow a full pint to be given would not stop the sale of a great variety of bitters, which we all support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> Looking at Labour Members of the Committee, one sees an enormously cheerful, happy and contented bunch of people. They are in government. The wind is blowing in the spinnaker of their boat; they are creaming through the water at a rate of knots. But look at this side of the House--we are a beaten party. My majority was cut from 16,000 to 6,000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robin Corbett </B>(Birmingham, Erdington): You moved!
<P>
Mr. Soames
<P>
: My majority was still cut. If I had not moved, I would not be here now. Many of us derive great pleasure from crying into our froth. In recent months, I have spent hours blubbing into the froth of my pint. It gave me great pleasure and consolation to do so. I love cider, but blubbing into a pint of cider would not be the same. For those of maudlin disposition, a pint of beer filled to the top of the glass with froth is the only answer.
<P>
I wish to refer to a letter from Mr. King, the managing director of King and Barnes in Horsham, the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham. Disappointingly, that company--rather like Labour Members of the Committee--has a slightly north-of-London bent. I do not suppose that many Labour Members have heard of King and Barnes, but it is a prince among brewers and, along the Harvey's Lewis Ales, it brews some of the finest beer in Britain. Mr. King is an admirable and sensible man. I shall read one paragraph from his letter because it is germane to the issue that we are discussing.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Whilst I appreciate that in some instances, particularly in the North of England, an excessive amount of `head' may be unacceptable--certainly in the South, particularly our own trade, I cannot recall any instances where complaints have been made about the amount of beer dispensed in a pint or half-pint glass.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I realise that the Bill is a Government hand-out and that it was given to the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East, who is an absolute jewel in the crown of Parliament. Everyone loves him: he is an absolute star. The Minister's officials will have looked around to find someone to take on the Bill. They will have asked themselves whether a suitably obedient Back Bencher would be kind enough to take it on--and their eyes lit on the hon. Gentleman, who is a hell of a nice man. He was suckered into taking it on, and so much does Parliament love the hon. Gentleman that it did not even bother to give the Bill a Second Reading. Yet the Bill is not a minor measure: it will affect the drinking habits of the entire British public. It is not like the School Standards and Framework Bill; this Bill will affect the real lives of hundreds of thousands of ordinary people.
<P>
Labour Members must be careful about their zeal for standardisation. I do not want to stray out of order, Mr. Wells, but those of us who have groaned under the beef on the bone measures, who have seen the Government's drive for standardisation and harmony, who have seen Cool Britannia being pushed forward into every corner--there is nothing Cool Britannia about the Bill--have witnessed the end of diversity.
<P>
The Bill spells the end for ordinary punters, who know and love their beer and who know perfectly well when they are being ripped off by the publican. This is the end for them. From now on, because of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East, who has the junior Minister at his side--or under his arm--diversity and the wonderful variety of British beers will disappear. They will end up being all the same. Every pub in Britain will have to have huge glasses; they will be so bloody heavy by the time the Government have finished that we shall not be able to lift them.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee has thoroughly enjoyed the hon. Member's contribution, but I draw his attention to the fact that clause 1 and the amendment are not about the variety of beers. They are about the packaging and measurement of beer. I should be grateful if the hon. Member would bring his remarks to order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Wells. It is an emotional matter--I was carried away.
<P>
The Bill may not be about variety, but is about the measurement of beer. The point is that many beers have vastly different characteristics. That variety is reflected in the amendment, because the different size of glass will mean that beer is drunk in a different way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Corbett:</B> Can I save the hon. Gentleman further emotional stress? Whether it is Old Speckled Hen or Red Orchard in the glass, a pint is still a pint. The quantity does not depend upon the make of beer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman lives in a sort of urban fastness and does not venture out much, so he summoned the first two names that he could remember. He probably drinks milk in pint glasses when no one is looking. For those of us who really drink beer, these things matter.
<P>
It was quite wrong of the promoter to categorise this as being the big brewers--or, indeed, the small brewers--against the rights of the drinking public, the theme that ran through the whole rear end of his speech. That is one of the most stupid and silly arguments that I have heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cummings:</B> Is it not a matter of an extra &#163;3 to &#163;9 profit per keg over the normal profit made by brewers? Can the hon. Gentleman say whether VAT and duty is paid on that extra profit?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman answers that point, I have to tell the hon. Member for Easington that it is not covered by the amendment, which deals with the measurement of beer. I should be grateful if all members of the Committee stuck to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> That is what I am struggling to do, Mr. Wells, while a pack of drag hounds are laying false trails all over the place. I am sticking to the line of my fox and shall continue to do so.
<P>
As you have instructed, Mr. Wells, I shall not deal with the point raised by the hon. Member for Easington--other than to say that new Labour Members do not understand the position of the brewing industry. It does my heart good to see the young, spruce boy who is the Minister, with his pink cheeks, nice haircut and decent tie, sitting next to three old Labour Members. It is a source of deep pleasure to someone who was raised in more spacious days--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> But it is not in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> A hint of malice to brewers ran through the hon. Gentleman's speech. For all the talk about profit per keg and so on, most of the brewers I have met are poor men--[Laughter.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman is tempted down that route, I remind him that the amendment concerns measurement, not the wealth of brewers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> Returning to the issue of measurement, Mr Wells, my point was that if brewers were engaged in a conspiracy to defraud punters by serving them the wrong amount of beer, they would quickly go out of business. One of the most successful pub chains in the land--which I frequently visit--is J. D. Wetherspoons; it is a brilliantly run operation. It has changed to lined glasses, a commercial decision that it perhaps took because it believed it was in its interest in terms of accounting methods, staff training and so on--to follow the pan-national trend and sell beer in such glasses. Good luck to J. D. Wetherspoons--for all I know, that commercial decision may be the reason why, as I read in the newspaper today, the company has again achieved record profits. If that is the case, Bass, Whitebread, and all the other breweries that own tied houses and publicans would surely say to themselves, ``We do not need Turner's legislation; we shall decide ourselves to change to lined glasses because it is the sensible thing to do and it will encourage punters into the pubs.''
<P>
I have a serious question for the Minister. How many complaints has the DTI received about short-changed pints of beer? I hope that officials will be able to tell him. My related point is that I am sure that CAMRA is an admirable organisation; I know nothing about it, but I respect and applaud its championship of real ale. It has my wholehearted support in that. However, it is not an official organisation; it is a lobby organisation. It is as if the Government were to pay attention to everything that the Institute of Directors were to say to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> The information that I have been given is that CAMRA represents--or purports to represent--the consumers of a product which constitutes about 11 per cent. of the total market for beers. Before my hon. Friend becomes too impressed with CAMRA--which, I have no doubt, has an important part to play concerning that element of the market--I hope that he does not imagine that CAMRA speaks for all beer drinkers. In a strict sense, it cannot claim even to speak for all those who drink real ales.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman replies to that intervention, I remind him that remarks on CAMRA are in order only in so far as they apply to measurement of beer, in whatever receptacle the hon. Gentleman cares to choose. We are discussing measurement, not CAMRA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I ask you, Mr. Wells, to accept that I am not trying to breach the rules of order; I am genuinely trying to keep within them. Of course I accept your ruling, but we have all been briefed by CAMRA, which has been extensively quoted by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East as having the last word, as it were, on all things to do with pints, quarts and so on.
<P>
I completely accept what my right hon. Friend says; I want to warn the Committee that it must not take what CAMRA says as the be-all and end-all. CAMRA is not the only organisation that has views on the question of the size of glasses and the ways in which beers are dispensed. The Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association--
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkins:</B> Oh God.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> You say that, but the association is an important body within the industry. It represents thousands of people engaged in the trade and it knows what it is talking about--not something of which the hon. Member for Tamworth could be accused.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That last exchange illustrates the point that I was trying to make to the Committee. Sedentary exchanges do nothing to advance the Committee's debate and business, and I should be grateful if members of the Committee would refrain from either making them or responding to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Wells. I regretted that remark immediately I said it, and I withdraw it unreservedly. The hon. Gentleman knows a great deal about what he is talking about, and I should not have risen to the fly as it floated across; I should have stayed like a salmon lying upstream in a pool and lazily ignored it.
<P>
The points made by the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association about the Bill are pertinent. We are talking exclusively about measurements. The association states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is no widespread evidence of consumer dissatisfaction. In 1991 (the last year for which Government figures are available) there were 23 complaints from the public. That works out at one complaint for every 256 million pints of beer sold that year.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the halcyon days when I was a Minister and you, Mr. Wells, were a Whip at Ministry of Defence debates, we used to come to Committees armed with every form of statistic, and I know that the Minister will have some smart-arse reply to give me. I know that in 15 years as a Member of Parliament, I have never received one complaint from a constituent about being short-changed in a pub.
<P>
There is no percentage in the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association trying to rig the figures. The fact is that there is very little complaint about the matter. As I want to stay in your good books, Mr. Wells, I will shortly conclude my remarks.
<P>
I beg the Committee carefully to consider whether the Bill is necessary. The people responsible for enforcing measures, who are represented in a turgid brief from LACOTS, are interested only in their own personal convenience. They are not interested in the convenience of the punter. They are not interested in the fact that the system has worked perfectly well for hundreds of years. They want perfect symmetry. They want their beastly inspectors to be able to go into every pub in the land, armed with something called a concordat, and pursue a lot of innocent publicans. My hon. Friend's amendment goes to the heart of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Which amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> The one to do with the size--the measurement--of the beer.
<P>
All Labour Members have come here with their minds already made up. I am a free spirit. I am not persuaded by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East; so great is the cry of indignation and rage every night from every pub in the land, from people complaining about being short-changed, that I doubt whether the Minister can persuade me. Of course, all that stuff about putting money into something and getting only 10p out when you ask for it is wrong. But is there a cry of indignation raised the length and breadth of this land that demands that further time and effort be given to this private Member's Bill? I say there is not. I shall wait with great interest to see if I am to be shot down.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we continue, I must tell the Committee that I have been most indulgent about the Second Reading nature of the speeches made so far because, as was pointed out by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East, there was no Second Reading debate. The Committee now must remain strictly in order. Other matters can be dealt with on other amendments. I believe that the Committee must now get strictly down to the clauses and amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> On behalf of the Government, I would like to speak to amendments Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 5. I wonder, Mr. Wells, if you will pander to my eccentricity.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It will be the first time that any speaker has done so. Thank you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I shall say why it would not be in the consumers' interests to extend the provisions of sections 37 and 47 of the Weights and Measures Act 1985 to beer and cider sold by draught, as proposed by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. The Committee may find it helpful if I explain the impact and meaning of those sections of the 1985 Act and to elaborate on why we oppose the amendments. May I also say--I hope, Mr. Wells, that this will be my only digression--how much the Government welcome the work that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-East and many others have done. This is a good opportunity to take consumer rights a landmark step forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> How much work on the Bill would the Minister apportion to the Government and how much to the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I freely admit that the Government have helped my hon. Friend in every possible way. Indeed, we have extended democracy by making our notes available. I know that the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex has been driven to drink since he last commented on the matter in the House, because on 28 October 1993 he told us that he did not drink beer. The election defeat must have got to him since then, and we greatly sympathise with him. However, I am being led astray.
<P>
The average system suggested by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst allows a trading standards officer to test the quantity contained in a package against the quantity indicated on the packaging. It is therefore not so relevant to beer. However, in the stage beyond that, one needs a statistically representative sample to calculate the average. Any trading standards officer who goes into a pub in civvies and asks for 20 pints and then measures them will get nothing but the full liquid pint. Therefore, it would be difficult to detect malpractice if we agreed to the amendments.
<P>
There are several ways to carry out the tests. None of the conditions apply to the sale of draught beer, cider or other unpacked products. That is why I shall urge all hon. Members to reject the amendments.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman did not move the amendment very convincingly. I heard the same arguments--verbatim and with the jokes--when some of the big brewers met at the Department of Trade and Industry. Frankly, the amendment appears to be a cheat's charter.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> At the risk of incurring your displeasure, Mr. Wells, may I ask the Minister to answer my hon. Friend's reasonable question? I had the impression that the Minister had an answer. How many individual complaints have he and his Department received on this matter from the millions of drinkers that there are?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I am surprised that someone who formerly occupied the Government Front Bench should ask such a basic question. The right hon. Gentleman knows that the way that such complaints are monitored has not changed. That is not a matter for the DTI, which does not generally receive such complaints. Local authorities are the prime recipients of complaints about short measures.--[Interruption.] The right hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that we have received no complaint, but I have given an example, which was passed to me by a Conservative Member, and there are others. Indeed, almost a million people have signed a petition to complain. One of the reasons why we are in government and Conservative Members are in opposition is that they are oblivious to the public's complaints or feelings. I did not expect that I would have to give such a senior Member of Parliament a lesson on how the DTI works.
<P>
The amendment would force prices up, which is what the right hon. Gentleman alleges the Bill will do. The criticisms of the Bill are entirely spurious. Pubs such as those in the Banks' chain are selling products in lined glasses. Without reference to the amendments, which refer to averages, they are giving the full liquid pint in lined glasses or oversized glasses and charging less than their competitors do for same-strength beers. There is no evidence that that forces up the costs. I urge my hon. Friends to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> That was not the most convincing argument that I have heard. Indeed, the Minister's speech revealed what my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex and I suspected: there is no volume of complaint from real people. Beer-drinking customers are far too sensible in their knowledge of the product, their pub and their publican to go about the matter in that way. I do not want to detain the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr.Soames:</B> My right hon. Friend is being too kind. I want to detain the Committee for the simple reason that I want the Minister to give the information that we requested of him. How many formal complaints--forget petitions--have been made to the DTI suggesting that there is righteous clamour throughout the country for the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> We know the answer: one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Pickthall (West Lancashire):</B> Are Conservative Members saying that their constituents, faced with the problem of an undermeasure, should immediately phone the Minister or the DTI to complain? Conservative Members should be asking, ``How many complaints are received by trading standards officers in local authorities?''
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I should have thought that the Minister who has responsibility for this area would have known that and might have offered us that as an alternative. I am prepared to be flexible in my approach. I do not want to be unduly restrictive. The Minister said that he had had one complaint from the entire nation of beer drinkers on this matter direct to the Department. Maybe he can give us some figures for complaints to trading standards offices.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we can proceed down this line, I must remind members of the Committee that the amendment relates to measurement and packaging and not to the number of people who have complained about this matter. Although relevant to some degree, it is not central to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I agree, Mr. Wells. We have probably flogged this one to death, but I shall allow myself one more lashing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cummings:</B> Rather than being a matter of people complaining, is it not a matter of people aspiring to receive, as of right, a full pint of beer? I live in a community with five pubs, five clubs and five chapels and churches--so there is a good balance--where everyone, automatically, on entering licensed premises, receives a full pint of beer in a lined glass. I believe that that is what other people in this land would aspire to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> We shall come on to lined glasses in a moment. That will be an important part of the debate, so I do not want to anticipate it. The hon. Member for Easington (Mr. Cummings) is illustrating a point that is crucial to the argument that my hon. Friend and I have been trying to make.
<P>
I applaud what the hon. Gentleman said about his community. He illustrated clearly what his community expects and gets from his publicans and his clubs. That is fine. But I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, who I know is a generous man, would not expect, if he came to Chislehurst or Bromley, to find the same sort of clubs or pubs. Indeed, he would not find many churches and chapels either.
<P>
Such is the variety of the product, which is dispensed in many different ways in many different containers to many different people, that the standardisation of approach and measurement inherent in the Bill is inappropriate. That is the kernel of what we have said.
<P>
In spite of what the Minister has said, and having listened to the debate, I believe that it would be inappropriate to press my amendments to a vote. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<B>Mr. Soames:</B> It would be wrong to allow the clause to go through without a nod in the direction of our friends in Northern Ireland. Those of us who have spent many happy hours in pubs in Northern Ireland should say a word for the Northern Irish consumer. Again, we must ask how many complaints about the rules have been received, in this case in Northern Ireland. You tell me, Mr. Wells, that I am not allowed to press that question and stray from the subject of the discussion, but the Minister's reply was extremely high-handed. To say that there had been only one complaint and that most complaints are made to local authorities--
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I did not say that I had received only one complaint; I cited one complaint. We have, in fact, received 23, although as the hon. Gentleman knows, my Department is not responsible for such complaints. I advise him to speak to LACOTS and the Northern Ireland trading standards office to find out their figures, but I know that as he and the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst are so dismissive of trading standards they would not believe those figures anyway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> On the contrary, I am not at all dismissive of them. I regard them as fulfilling a vital role. I was asked earlier how many complaints had been received in relation to trading standards. There are many complaints in my constituency, as I am sure there are in the Minister's constituency. I receive complaints about mattresses and hi-fis about which I often write to the Minister, and he courteously writes back.
<P>
The Minister could tell me how many complaints he has received from Members of Parliament about any number of matters, but he cannot do so in relation to beer because there have been none. There is not a great feeling across the land that the punters are being defrauded or that people must all write to their Members of Parliament, who will write to the Minister. So serious is the point that the last year for which the Minister has figures is 1991, by which time there had been 23 complaints.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> It is different 23--there have been 23 complaints since the general election. In 1991, when there were 23 complaints, the Conservative Government promised that they would introduce legislation; a promise that they broke like so many others.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The question of how many complaints have been received is not germane to the meaning of the clause, even in Northern Ireland. I ask the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex to bring his remarks into order so that we may get on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Wells. There seems to be the most magical symmetry in that there are two figures of 23, and those of us who play the lottery and roulette will perhaps take comfort from that. If the Conservative Government promoted such an idea, they were, as in many other things they did and many things that the Minister's Government will do, wide of the mark.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that there was an early-day motion in 1993 supporting the previous Government's action, which was completely out of step with the Bill that we are considering today, and that that early-day motion was sponsored by two Labour Members and supported and signed by no fewer than eight Labour Members who are now Ministers?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The discussion must relate not only to the measure but to Northern Ireland. I ask the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex to make certain that his reply to the right hon. Gentleman is in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> Indeed, I will, Mr. Wells, and I shall conclude my remarks. I genuinely do not wish to try you in any way.
<P>
There is no evidence that there is, in Northern Ireland, an upsurge of people crying out to have these arrangements altered. If there were, the Minister's officials would have come prepared with information, such is the efficiency of Government. Nobody admires more than I do the way in which Departments liaise. I used to love reading the notes--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We do not need any further out-of-school tales to conclude the hon. Gentleman's remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> You are a very old hand at all this, Mr. Wells. You know perfectly well that if there had been a big outcry in Northern Ireland, the Minister and his officials would have come armed with that information, which would say that in Northern Ireland there have this year been so many thousand complaints.
<P>
I shall not press the clause to a Division, because there are other matters in which I wish to take a more detailed interest, but again the Committee needs to pause for a moment, to lower its sails and to ask, ``Is there in Northern Ireland a great cry of rage about people being short-changed in pubs?'' As there is not, why do we need the Bill?
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Short title, commencement and extent</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Clause 3 is an interesting and intriguing clause, which requires some explanation, probably in this case from the Minister rather than the promoter of the Bill, but that is for them to decide.
<P>
Subsection (2) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Sections 1 and 2 come into force on such day as the Secretary of State may by order appoint; and different days may be appointed for different purposes.''
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the right hon. Gentleman continues, I remind him that the issues involved in clause 3 were discussed with amendments Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 5 to clause 1. I do not wish to hear a repetition of the arguments that we heard on clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Of course I will be guided by you, Mr. Wells, but I wanted to obtain an explanation of the meaning of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``different days may be appointed for different purposes.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The introduction of the word ``purposes'' into a Bill of this kind suggests that there will be a range of matters on which the Secretary of State will have to deliberate and decide whether, on different days, different things will happen. I am not clear what these different things will be. Are we talking here about introducing the measures in the Bill in different regions at different times, for different products at different times, or what? These matters are highly germane, and the trade and consumers will need to have some idea of what lies behind those words. I suggest that it is slightly unusual for a Bill of this kind to contain a provision which is as vague, as broad and with such potential as the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``different days may be appointed for different purposes.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>We have no idea at this stage what they mean, partly, I admit, because we did not have a Second Reading debate. If we had a Second Reading debate, the Minister could have availed himself of the opportunity, if he had caught Mr. Speaker's eye, to elucidate not only the earlier clauses but to tell the House then, and the Committee now, what lies behind the wording.
<P>
If it were proposed that the Bill be enacted across the land at one time, that would be one thing, but if it is even being suggested that it be brough in at different times for different purposes, we need to know about it, because we may need to consider that on Report and, for all I know, in another place. The measure could have a serious impact on the costs incurred by the brewing trade and its distributive elements and on consumer health, not to mention CAMRA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> Following my hon. Friend down the avenue he is treading so carefully, may I ask whether he is aware that the Capacity Serving Measures (Intoxicating Liquor) Regulations 1988 were drawn up in relation to the law as it then stood? If the law is to be changed, subsidiary changes to other legislation will flow from that. What does my hon. Friend think of that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Do we know that?
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The intervention has nothing to do with clause 3, which we are debating. I advise the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst that answers to the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex would be out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): On a point of order, Mr. Wells. Is it not the case that the interventions of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst are vexatious, as has been proved, on each occasion that you have necessarily and properly pulled him up, by the huge grin that has appeared across his face? Is he not unnecessarily detaining the Committee from its important task of putting the Bill on the statute book?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for me. I shall decide when the hon. Gentleman becomes vexatious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> For my part, I had better ensure that I do not smile too much. Obviously, if I were to appear to be at all happy with our proceedings, I would incur the hon. Gentleman's wrath and I certainly would not want to do that.
<P>
It is surely legitimate to explore the provisions, because this is their Committee stage and they could well become law, thus affecting everyone in the land. We are debating whether clause 3 should stand part of the Bill. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``different days may be appointed for different purposes.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have no idea what that means, Mr. Wells. You might have no idea of what it means, either, because neither you nor I had the benefit of hearing the Second Reading debate. We have, perhaps regrettably, had little opportunity to hear from the Minister or, indeed, the Bill's promoter. The Minister or the promoter must tell us a lot more about the meaning of those words in particular before I will be satisfied and able to support the motion that clause 3 should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I went to all the trouble of giving full briefing notes to the hon. Gentleman, but he did not care to read them. I should have thought, however, that the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex, who spoke so eloquently on Northern Ireland a moment ago, could provide him with a ready answer, which is that the wording gives us flexibility depending on the trade's investment plans, the nature and type of the drink--whether it is cider or beer--and any differences between the UK and Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Jones:</B> (Cheltenham): I have a small question. Can the Minister give us an idea of how long it will be before the Secretary of State tables the relevant statutory instrument? The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East, who introduced the Bill, said that a reasonable amount of time would be allowed, which is right and proper. Outlets will have to replace their glasses with larger ones, which one or two hon. Members have referred to as buckets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> It is so nice to have a relevant intervention. We are consulting with the trade about the time scale. We want to ensure that the glasses are available. We have been informed that at least one United Kingdom manufacturer can produce not just the proper sized glasses but toughened glasses, should that be necessary. The hon. Gentleman will know that there is a considerable breakage rate. We would like to introduce the measure to accommodate that breakage rate, which may be as much as a whole set of glasses per year. We are advised that a glass lasts for about a year on average, but I imagine it being a little longer than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> The Minister talked about a year. Can we be assured that the measure will be in place in time for people to celebrate the millennium with a full pint?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Should Parliament pass the Bill, we would see that as a tribute to its promoter and all those who support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I have sat down.
<P>
	Mr. Soames rose--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has sat down. He has answered an intervention; therefore, there is no further intervention to be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I merely want to make one point about the new glasses. I hope that members of the Committee are aware that if we go ahead with the measure, the lion, which stands proudly on the side of every British drinking glass in a pub, will be struck out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cummings:</B> Why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> Because it will be. Can the Minister tell me and the drinkers of Britain categorically that the lion will be not be struck out in the new glasses?
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>New Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Measures in which Draught Beer and Cider are to be sold</center></H4>
<P>
`.--Paragraphs 2(1)(b) and 2(2) of the Weights and Measures (Intoxicating Liquor) Order 1988 are hereby revoked.'.--[Mr. Forth.]
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
This is an important part of the consideration of the Bill. It is crucial to our understanding of what is or may not be necessary to carry out the Bill's intentions. We have to look in a bit of detail at the relative merits of different techniques of measuring the dispensing of beer to customers in bars and pubs. A number of different options would be available were the Bill to become law and section 43 to come back into effect.
<P>
It has been put to me that beer would have to be served flat or nearly flat in a brim measure, crown-stamped glass. If the beer had a head, it would have to be served in an over-sized crown-stamped, lined glass or through some method of meter dispensing. Again, that leads us to the variability of the product. Those who are familiar with flat beers without a head will take one view of the way in which the product is measured and dispensed, but those who are familiar with heads of different types, varieties, densities and gas and liquid contents will take another view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that we are coming to the nub of the point that we were talking about in the earlier debate? The measure will automatically do away with the diversity of beer. He has already made the point that any bloody fool can pull a pint with flat beer, but what will happen with a full pint?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Indeed; I believe that the onus will be on the promoter of the Bill and perhaps on the Minister to explain how those matters will be dealt with under the terms of the Bill. The trade believes that it will be difficult to achieve certain purposes--which I know are in the promoter's mind--without creating difficulties for the consumer and the brewers.
<P>
Consumers have come to expect a full glass; that is one of the traditions of beer drinking in this country. I think that the promoter will suggest that the answer is to have what I will characterise as an oversized, lined glass, although I crave the Committee's indulgence for my loose terminology. If so, one of the difficulties that arises immediately is that an oversized lined glass might not be full if the liquid is dispensed up to the line and the head is above it. Many consumers would look at the glass and say, ``I'm being short-changed.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Keetch:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman suggesting that customers in pubs where there are already lined glasses feel left out? To pursue the argument of the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex, who is leaving, is there any evidence of customers who feel deprived complaining to the Minister?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> We are talking about a new regime. We are contemplating what I believe the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East has in mind. I put it no higher than this, but there is a danger that, in attempting to create a new degree of consumer confidence, we might do the opposite.
<P>
The problem becomes worse when we consider the possibility that I am sure I heard the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East mention. He said we could have an oversized lined glass but dispense the liquid so that it did not quite come up to the line. That strikes me as rather perverse. We would yet again be defeating the object of the exercise. The argument was that seeing the liquid at the level of the line gave customers confidence, but we are now being told that the liquid would not even have come up to the line because there would be a head of varying size and composition. That too defeats the object of the exercise.
<P>
That is why the matter requires greater clarification, and that is where the new clause comes in. I am seeking to liberate the approach that producers and dispensers of beer may take and to give them a degree of flexibility. That would allow them to meet variations in the product and in consumer expectations in different parts of the country and to provide the measure with those in mind.
<P>
We have a dilemma: once we introduce the concept of lines and oversized glasses, we end up with an over-measure and encounter the difficult point about price increases. As I understand the Bill, the publican might have a strong argument for increasing the price if we forced him to deliver more beer than the pint. The consumer might than have an objection different from that which Labour Members have mentioned. They have said that people up and down the country are frustrated because they allegedly receive short measures, although we have seen little or no evidence of that. I can, however, envisage people saying, ``What are you lot in Parliament playing at? You have passed this law with a fancy name and we end up paying more than we are used to for a measure that is more than we wanted. We wanted to drink pints, but now we are drinking more than a pint and are being forced to pay for it.''
<P>
A series of very real problems is entailed in the temptingly simple and elegant solution before us. That is always the problem. Members of the Committee who have been in the House for a while and who have sat on several such Committees will know that there is nothing worse than a seductively simple solution to a complicated problem. One of the difficulties that I have with the present measure is that it comes into that category. We are being asked to believe that there is a simple and elegant solution with which everyone will be pleased and which, at the wave of a wand, will solve all the problems, real or imagined, that have existed in that regard. I am not convinced of that, and I doubt that, had we had a Second Reading, I would have been convinced then.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The new clause is not only an attempt to elicit more detail about how the Bill's promoter and the Minister envisage the measure working in practice--we do not know any of that yet--but also a bid to provide legitimate flexibility and a range of choice to producers and dispensers of beer while meeting the proper aspirations of the promoter. We all want pint drinkers to be given proper pints. The only point of debate has been--importantly--how one satisfactorily defines a pint and deals with the problem of the variability of the nature of the product, its head and so on. We are now discussing the best way of permitting or restricting the container within which that pint is delivered.
<P>
If we were over-restrictive and said that, to meet the Bill's requirements, beer must be delivered in a container with a line on it marking 20 fl oz--as it would undoubtedly be--and more room to permit a variable size of head, that could give rise to as much or more confusion than we have now. I do not believe that there is much confusion now--but according to the arguments of some Labour Members, there is.
<P>
That is how I see the problem, and there are several solutions to it. It is fair to say that the trade believes that using brim-filled unstamped glasses would be a much more satisfactory way of allowing some flexibility--
<P>
<B>Mr Nigel Griffiths:</B> No lion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth. No line.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I said, ``No lion.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I misunderstood the hon. Gentleman. I am not as obsessed with the lion as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex was. As he is not behind me at the moment, I think that we can allow that to slip by.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not the lion or the line that I am concerned about but sedentary exchanges across the Committee, which are out of order. I ask members of the Committee not to make them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I apologise, Mr. Wells. I succumbed to the temptation to reply to a friendly and tiny intervention from the Minister.
<P>
I hope that the Committee has understood the nature of and the motivation behind the new clause. It will, crucially, give the Bill's promoter and the Minister, if he sees fit, the opportunity to explain matters in detail, in fairness to those whose livelihoods depend on our getting it right. Let us be under no misapprehension--when we talk about legislating in an area such as this--although I can well understand Labour Members having the consumer interest at the forefront of their minds--we must, as legislators, also always bear in mind the interests of those who make and sell a product on which their livelihood depends. They have a legitimate interest, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keetch:</B> The right hon. Gentleman used to represent a Worcestershire constituency, where there are many fine cider makers. Cider makers who produce flat cider produce pints of cider, in competition with brewers who sell in the pubs pints that are 95 per cent. beer and 5 per cent. froth or worse. How would he explain that to the cider makers of Herefordshire or Worcestershire? Is it fair; and should the situation continue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I understand why the hon. Gentleman is obsessed with bringing cider into the debate. The Bill, of course, refers to cider as well as beer. However, I fear that as, on the hon. Gentleman's own admission, cider does not have a frothy bit on it, it is not really relevant to the considerations that I am addressing.
<P>
The thrust of my argument is the 1,500 different varieties of beer and the almost infinite variations in the nature of froth or of the head and the difficulties that they cause. That is the matter with which I am concerned. It was suggested earlier that if beer drinkers up and down the country were as unhappy as the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East seems to imply, they could switch to cider. That may be the best possible news for cider producers. The matter is for consumers to decide.
<P>
If we get the legislation wrong for any reason or in any significant way, people's livelihoods could be at risk. I do not wish to overstate the matter, but it should be in our minds constantly when we consider such legislation. We can all imagine its benefits, but if we get it wrong in some respect, there could be considerable dangers and disadvantages. The price of beer may well increase and customers may switch to cider, in which case livelihoods could be lost throughout the brewing and pub industry. I hope that none of us want that. That is why I urge the Committee to be cautious. I wish to give the promoter of the Bill the opportunity to respond to my points. I wish to give the promoter of the Bill the opportunity to respond to my points. I hope that he is able to satisfy me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I shall say briefly why I reject the hon. Gentleman's new clause. It seeks to remove the requirement of the Weights and Measures (Intoxicating Liquors) Order 1988 for draft beer and cider to be served in brimmed measures, in lined glasses or in metered dispensers. It is interesting that he seeks to remove from the orders, which he signed on 16 November 1988, powers that he gave himself. It is a bit bizarre. Let me tell him how I envisage that the Bill will work.
<P>
Wetherspoons has just introduced oversize lined glasses without any reported problems. The trade must make its own judgment about how it adopts the measure proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-East to give people a full liquid pint. They may do so by using brim measures, lined glasses or metered dispensers. Those matters will be subject to consultation. My hon. Friend and the Government will want to ensure that people get what my hon. Friend and all reasonable hon. Members want--the full, liquid pint.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I shall give way to the right hon. Gentleman, but perhaps he will answer a question. He suggested that people are not troubled by the short measure. If people receive a bit over, as he suggests is likely, does he imagine that they will complain?

<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> They would complain if the price went up in order to reflect the fact that they were getting more. That was the point that I wanted to make. I hope that the Minister will accept that.
<P>
I detect something important in what the Minister said. Is he saying that he has an open mind about how the Bill's aims could be met? The matter could be important for me and for the trade. Did he say, that he envisages consulting the trade about what measures or combination of measures would be most appropriate, and that he will only then decide how the aims will be achieved? Such an approach would not only be helpful, but important for the Committee's decision concerning my proposed new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I certainly am saying that. I hope that we can now make progress and ensure that the Bill is enacted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> If that is the case, I am very encouraged. I have obviously misunderstood the position. I had imagined that the promoter of the Bill and the Minister had decided quite definitely how the Bill's aims were to be achieved. The Minister has now said that that is not the case, that there will be consultations and that a measured view will be taken of how its aims can best be delivered. I gather that that will include the possibility of a non-lined brimful oversized glass, which I mentioned. Given that reassurance, for which I am grateful to the Minister and to the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
