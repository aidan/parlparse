<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I beg to move amendment No. 198, in page 312, leave out lines 15 to 18 and insert

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`becoming a dependent subsidiary within the meaning of section 86 of the Finance Act 1988'.<P>

<P>
No. 235, in Schedule 15, page 341, leave out lines 11 to 14 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a dependent subsidiary within the meaning of section 86 of the Finance Act 1988'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As we continue our discussions, many matters will arise under schedules 14, 15 and 16. In the main, we support the enterprise initiatives and our amendments are designed to make the scheme more workable. At present, it contains many unnecessary and niggling catches that are likely to cause legal disputes or result in people being disqualified from participating. The initiatives are to little end, in terms of tax revenue or fairness. Amendments Nos. 198, 199 and 235 deal with qualifying companies. We believe that the present list is too restrictive, as it would exclude an unlisted company with a majority shareholder such as a venture capital house or other strategic investor. Surely, they are the businesses in which employee share ownership is key and at which the scheme is aiming.

<P>
The object of the exclusion is to ensure that enterprise management initiatives are operated only by independent companies. There is already a test for that in the employee share legislation, which is that a dependent subsidiary is a subsidiary that is operated on a non-independent basis, with most of its business on a non-arm's-length basis with the root companies and, hence, does not create an artificial share price. There is a requirement that a company escapes dependent subsidiary status only if the parent company auditors are willing to certify that it is independent. That gives a valuable third party control that the Revenue can rely on. Although we understand the thinking behind the provision, we consider that it is not necessary. It undermines a key category of company at which the scheme is aimed. Amendment No. 199 would change the qualifying company definition and amendment No. 235 deals with the corporate venturing scheme.

<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> The amendments are grouped together because they propose changes to the rules for identifying the independent companies at which the enterprise management incentive scheme and the corporate venturing scheme are aimed. EMI is being introduced to provide tax-advantaged share incentives to help small, independent, higher risk trading companies attract and retain key personnel. Those companies will often be at an early stage or just beyond their initial stages of development. The CVS is aimed at encouraging equity investment in the same types of company and it is hoped that it will also help to promote corporate venturing relationships involving small, independent, higher risk companies.

<P>
Both schemes target small independent companies and the parent groups of small independent groups, because such companies have greater difficulties in attracting key staff and finance than do companies that form part of or are controlled by larger groups. We do not intend shareholdings of subsidiaries to be directly involved in either scheme. In the case of CVS, we doubt that equity investment in a subsidiary of a small trading company will be more attractive to, or, indeed, more practical for, a potential investing company than investment in the parent. EMI is aimed at small companies and groups of small companies in cases in which improvements to the value of a subsidiary company brought about by the efforts of a key employee will be reflected in the share price of the parent. That intention is reflected in the targeting rule, which excludes 51 per cent. subsidiaries and companies controlled by another company in which they are not 51 per cent. subsidiaries.

<P>
The amendment would allow subsidiaries and controlled companies to qualify as issuing and qualifying companies for the purposes of the CVS and the EMI respectively, with the exception of dependent subsidiaries-a narrow category. It would also impose a regulatory burden on the company's directors. The result would be to add unwelcome and unnecessary complexity and uncertainty and would be a burden for companies to operate. As the test can be applied only at the end of a period of account, in the case of EMI, for example, a company would not know at the time of granting an option whether the option qualified for EMI. The directors of the parent company would be required to certify that the relevant requirements had been satisfied, and an auditor's report would need to be obtained.

<P>
There is no need to amend the Bill to allow employees of subsidiaries to benefit from EMI. Nothing will prevent EMI options from being granted to employees who work in a subsidiary; they, too, can take part, as long as the options relate to shares in the parent company. In the case of the type of group that will qualify for EMI, the increase in the value of the subsidiary will be reflected in the value of the parent.

<P>
Taking the approach suggested in the amendment might identify independent subsidiaries when the opportunity for value shifting by the parent is minimal. However, it would not ensure that EMI relief is targeted at companies that are less likely to have the resources to recruit and retain key employees.

<P>
We understand the anxieties expressed on one aspect of the matter-that companies controlled by venture capitalists will not qualify for EMI because the company that wants to offer options to its employees is not independent. The anxieties expressed about companies that will not be able to use EMI because of venture capital funding were considered during the consultation period, but no practical suggestions emerged-not even the solution suggested in the amendment, which, as I hope that I have explained, is not practical.

<P>
Even if we were to accept that we wanted to allow companies controlled by venture capitalists to qualify for EMI, it would be difficult to provide a test that identified venture capital backing as opposed to any other kind of financial backing. It would also be difficult to distinguish or identify which venture capitalist companies should be allowed to control an EMI company. We would also need to provide a new definition of control, which would in itself introduce complexity and possible avoidance opportunities.

<P>
The solution proposed in the amendment would not solve the venture capital problem. Although the use of the dependent subsidiary rules would in theory deal with the anxiety expressed about value shifting and tax avoidance, it would not meet the policy aim of ensuring that EMI relief is targeted on companies that are less likely to have the financial resources to recruit and retain key employees.

<P>
Many companies will experience no difficulties with the EMI legislation. When several separate and unconnected venture capital funds own in aggregate more than 50 per cent. of the target company, it may well qualify for EMI. It is only in the unlikely event that a single venture capital company holds more than half the ordinary shares that the target company will be a subsidiary of a venture capital company and therefore will not qualify for EMI. It will therefore be possible for a company that has received a large amount of venture capital backing-up to 50 per cent.-to qualify for EMI.

<P>
The amendment would also allow subsidiaries of quoted companies to be included in the CVS. However, that is not the purpose of the scheme. In the case of both schemes, nothing would prevent the tax benefits from being obtained in cases in which the issuing or qualifying company is controlled by a large group by means other than share ownership. The scheme is not aimed at such companies because they will generally have access to the resources of the controlling group, and nothing would prevent share price manipulation.

<P>
Although we sympathise with one aspect of the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight), I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn. If not, I urge the Committee to oppose it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As the Economics Secretary commented, and as I made clear, the amendment relates to small businesses that are backed by venture capital houses or strategic investors. As I said, we understand that the logic applies more widely. In a normal mature group the subsidiaries can-although not always-be covered by participating under the current rules. The dependent subsidiary definition route is operative although, as I pointed out, accountant certification support is needed. Although it would not be the norm for a venture capital house promoting a company to have 50 per cent. or more of it, it is not that unusual, especially for a strategic investor. If the matter is not addressed, the scheme has a hole in it. Representatives of the venture capital industry have said to me, ``It's a great scheme, but it won't work in about a third of situations.''

<P>
I am not quite sure what the Economic Secretary is saying. If she is saying that the Government are looking for a method of addressing the problem, I shall withdraw the amendment. However, if she is saying that the Government cannot be bothered, I shall want to press the matter to a vote, as a highly important principle is at stake.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his remarks.

<P>
In January this year, the British Venture Capital Association commented:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We want to commend HM Treasury and the Inland Revenue for the manner in which the consultation process was established and taken forward  We are particularly pleased to note that the consultation has resulted in the acceptance of a number of improvements to the original proposals.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman does not doubt our bona fides in terms of the way in which the consultation has been conducted and its results. We have not been able to find a route through the problem that he has identified because, as I said, it has consequences elsewhere. For all those reasons, there is no answer on the cards. That is not due to a lack of willpower in the Treasury; it is a result of the difficulties that the issue presents, and the fact that it was not raised during the earlier consultation.

<B>The Chairman:</B> This might be the appropriate moment to express my confidence in the fact that all members of the Committee are honourable. I am sure that I can leave them all on their honour when I suggest that the newspapers that I have seen in the Room this morning must contain material that has direct relevance to the Bill, and will be especially pertinent to issues under discussion. If I find out that that is not the case, I shall be less than pleased.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I accept your ruling. I have brought a newspaper into the Room in aid of your efforts, as from time to time, the Government Whip has been heard chuntering.

<P>
<B>Mrs Jackie Lawrence </B>(Preseli Pembrokeshire) rose-

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I wanted to draw your attention, Mr. Cook, and that of the Committee to a most interesting article in The Independent this morning about the activities of the Government Whip in another forum.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are here to discuss the Finance Bill and to examine its contents line by line, not to discuss gossip columns. Please put the newspaper away.

<P>
<B>Mrs Lawrence:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook. I realise that hon. Members are expected to address the Chair, but could the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) speak a little clearer and louder? Those of us at the other end of the Room find it difficult to hear him at the best of times, and he seems to have a tendency to mumble.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I thank the hon. Lady for that point. I am averse to specifically directing comments at individual members of the Committee, so I shall refer to myself. I am partially deaf, and have great difficulty hearing. My eyesight is not so good that I can lip read at a distance. The hon. Lady's comments were well made and apply to several members of the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> This group of amendments is mainly about the definitions of trading companies, and also about the types of business that are included and excluded. I am disappointed that amendment No. 206 has not been included, as it is central, and I should point out that the main story in today's newspapers has some relevance to it.

<P>
The definitions of trading companies are being increasingly restricted by the Inland Revenue. The new approach considers whether a business consists
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>wholly or as to a substantial part.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Revenue guideline notes have suggested what the Revenue believes that a substantial part might be, but that guidance is not statutory and has not been included in the Bill. Practitioners therefore regard the situation as hollow and not legally sound. It could be difficult to succeed at law merely under the Revenue guidance.

<P>
There was nothing wrong with the old formula, which worked extremely well. It used the words ``wholly or mainly'' and had long usage. It never proved aggravating, unlike the change that the Revenue has sought to make in recent years, and it has been used successfully in virtually all relevant situations. Amendments Nos. 200 to 205 propose that we revert to that definition.

<P>
The provisions under discussion are oddly drafted and although the singular generally includes the plural in statutory interpretation, the linguistic distinction is strained. Therefore, to avoid doubt, we have tabled an amendment making it clear that a company can qualify when it has more than one business, provided those businesses are qualifying.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 207 and 208 would remove non-qualifying exclusions and were tabled in conjunction with amendment No. 206, which we will come to.

<P>
Amendment No. 272 relates to the same territory-the trading issue for enterprise investment scheme investments. The definition in the Bill of a company's trading and the parent company of a trading group are so restrictive that a genuine trading company may be refused treatment as such if it has the misfortune to have significant assets. The value of those assets may have grown over time, but without significance to the company's affairs overall. Despite the Revenue guidance notes, there is dispute over the import of references to ``a substantial part''. If the Revenue will not revert to the old definition of ``wholly or mainly'', which worked well for years in the shortfall legislation, the alternative potential approach is to define the company in question as not an investment company.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 229 and 230 deal with the same issue but in relation to the corporate venturing scheme. Similarly, amendments Nos. 231 and 232 ask what is meant by ``a substantial part'' in relation to that scheme and propose reversion to the well-established definition of ``wholly or mainly''.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 244 to 249 focus on the same issue. The current wording relies on ``wholly'' and it may be difficult for an issuing company to prove that there is no element of excluded activity in its business, especially if it operates credit terms for customers. It would be wiser to revert to the long-established wording of ``wholly or mainly'', which the Bill accepts for issuing companies under paragraph 25.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> This is one of those occasions in Committee when one is bemused by what Opposition Members say. I am bemused by the hon. Gentleman's remarks because I believe that the EIS and the venture capital trust rules are the same as those for the EMI and the CVS, and that there has been no restriction on the aspect of the rules that he mentions. EIS and VCT rules use the wording
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>wholly or as to a substantial part;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
they do not use ``wholly or mainly'' in that context, and I do not believe that they have ever done so. Those rules have worked well for some time for EIS and VCT and were introduced by the previous Government. I am bemused that the hon. Gentleman thinks that we are changing them, because we are simply extending the existing rules into other areas.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As the Minister must be aware, ``trading company'' is a legal concept that has much wider and more significant tax relevance than EIS or VCT. It is axiomatic that it is better if the definition of trading company and references to it are consistent. If the Treasury were to consult a panel made up of, say, 20 leading lawyers, the hon. Lady would find that there was widespread irritation that the terms ``wholly or mainly'' are not used throughout the rules, including those for EIS and VCT. Although, as yet, a major tax issue has not arisen in the VCT and EIS territories as a result of the changed wording, it is viewed by the legal profession as generally unsatisfactory. The mere fact that the previous Conservative Government made the change is no excuse. We shall not press the issue to a Division, but this is a technical point and well worth sorting out and standardising throughout the world of commerce. The point that I am making would not necessarily have been made by those whom the Government consulted, but if the Treasury consult the legal profession, it will find that this is an issue of concern.

<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware that we have carried out extensive consultation on all such matters, and I should be surprised if his point was not raised by someone at that time. I do not want to rely on the track record of the previous Government in defence of my case, but the words ``wholly'' and ``substantial'' are used as definitions in the context of EIS and VCT and we have found no problem with them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): I do not want to interfere in such a technical area, but it would be to the advantage of the Committee if the Economic Secretary could clarify whether the tests to which my hon. Friend referred are a straight lift-word for word-from their previous application in relation to EIS. Or, have they been modified in some way? If they have been modified, can she tell me where and the reason for such action? Clearly, my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs feels uncomfortable about the situation, just as the Minister is bemused by his remarks. He reflects the discomfort of those who have read the schedule, and the amendments would relieve that discomfort. The Minister has said that the tests are exactly the same as those applied in other areas of tax legislation, but there is clearly a difference of perception. I repeat that it would be helpful if the hon. Lady could tell us whether they are a straight lift and, if not, where have they been modified and why.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The phrase ``wholly or mainly'' is generally taken to mean more than half, as I am sure I do not need to point out to the right hon. Gentleman. As for the remarks of the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, the proposal would be too loose for the targeting rules for the scheme. The focus and the targeting of the scheme are the reasons behind rejecting the locution ``wholly or mainly''.

<P>
As for the question asked by the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack), yes, the tests are a straight lift, subject to the different structure under discussion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Economic Secretary has opened up a new dimension. She has said that the tests are a straight lift ``subject to'' a different structure. I am trying to get to grips with her remarks about the changed focus. I am open to contradiction if that is not exactly what she said. The hon. Lady's remarks gave me the impression that there had been a change in the focus of the new proposals, which the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs would address, especially in relation to the phrase ``wholly or mainly''. There may be a good reason why the original wording has been adjusted for the purposes of the scheme, which is different from the two mentioned by the Economic Secretary. I am anxious to establish, on the record, whether changes have been made and, if so, why. That may enable my hon. Friend to feel that there has been a response to his discomfiture, and ease the Committee's bemusement.

<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I confess that I am still a little bemused. There is some relaxation, in connection with licence fees and royalties, which will be more accommodating. That is not a restriction, but a lifting of a restriction. There is no other significant difference in terms of the application of rules in relation to EIS, VCT and the schemes under discussion. I am bemused by the point made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. We have a problem with the phrase ``wholly or mainly'', as it would not sufficiently target those businesses that we would want to target.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As I said upfront, what lies behind the words is the Revenue's attempt to narrow the definition of ``trading companies''. The ``substantial part'' language in the guideline is taken to mean that no more than 20 per cent. cannot be trading, whereas the case law of ``wholly or mainly'' refers, in essence, to a maximum of 40 per cent. Whether in relation to EIS companies, corporate venturing or other areas, the more narrow definition ultimately excludes-not for any moral crusade-a number of businesses that should not be excluded. The existing definition, in the circumstances that I described, has already been a problem in relation to EIS.

<P>
We are not discussing earth-shaking party political matters but, essentially, the Revenue's motivation to raise as much stealth tax as possible. It is petty and silly. The intention is supposed to be the promotion of a great entrepreneurial revolution, like that in America, but what lies behind such wretched legislation is a mean-minded attempt to exclude anything that might be just over the boundary. I repeat that there was no abuse of the ``wholly or mainly'' condition in the past; it was a perfectly fair borderline. I shall encourage members of the legal profession to write to the Economic Secretary, if the Treasury has not bothered to consult them properly. The legal profession is irritated by the matter, has been lobbying the Treasury for some time and views the definitions as unsatisfactory.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am still a humble seeker of truth and clarification. I do not impugn the Economic Secretary-truth is perhaps the wrong word; clarification is enough. I am sure that her replies are entirely straightforward.

<P>
When the legislation was presented to the Economic Secretary by the Inland Revenue, it would have been accompanied by a note. That note would have said, ``Here is the draft of schedule 14. It contains tests to establish the qualifying business, which replicate measures in previous schemes. However, the Minister should be aware that we have tinkered with the wording.'' Would she comment on whether there is a before and after effect? Clearly, there is a difference. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, who has identified a concern about the narrowing of the business test, is still not satisfied. When the Economic Secretary looked at the note, was she troubled by the change in the before and after effect of the tests? If not, why not? She has talked about targeting, which tells me that there are specific types of company that the Inland Revenue feels should qualify for the scheme. That is a change from the previous legislation. It might assist my hon. Friend if she told us more about that focusing.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I referred to focusing only in the context of targeting the policy on companies that we want to help. I want to be sure that the right hon. Gentleman and I are talking about the same use of the word ``focus'', because I do not want him to take my use of that word and transpose it to another context.

<P>
I will be absolutely categorical about the current situation and why we would not want to support the amendment in any event. There is no difference in how the rules will work from the way in which they work now for EIS and VCT. There is no change in focus or targeting, but there would be if we accepted the proposed amendment of ``wholly or mainly''. There has been no narrowing of the rules; the only change is in relation to licences and royalties, which have existed for six years. The companies targeted are the same ones that were targeted before. Although the Conservative Government introduced many things which one would not want to maintain, in this area their policies were right and continue to work well. Even with the new schemes, we are using the existing provision.

<P>
I must take quiet exception to the remarks made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs about consultation and refer him to the remarks that I quoted from the BVCA, made in January as a result of the EMI consultation. The BVCA document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We want to commend HM Treasury and the Inland Revenue for the manner in which the consultation process was established and taken forward. This has resulted in draft proposals that, we believe, when enacted will make a positive difference to the ability of companies to attract and retain key employees. We are particularly pleased to note that the consultation has resulted in the acceptance of a number of improvements to the original proposals.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's comments about consultation were unjustified.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I do not want to waste the Committee's time, but I will repeat that we believe the EMI scheme to be welcome, and are aware that the venture capital industry is pleased with it. I was making a separate point. The definitions of trading companies is a legal issue with knock-on effects, and not an issue of which the BVCA is aware although it manages to work within it. The Treasury will find that the legal profession is not happy with the attempt to narrow the definition of trading companies. Although a major problem has not yet arisen and been taken to the courts, it probably will. To restrict to 20 per cent. the amount of non-trading that is permitted, which is the intention behind the use of the word ``substantial'', may often result in unfairness. I will ensure that the Treasury receives a heavy and learned paper from the legal profession on the subject. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 206, in page 314, leave out from line 44 to line 27 on page 318 and insert-

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 206, to which I shall refer in some detail, makes a serious point in a somewhat light-hearted way. The exclusion of certain trades from qualification under EMI, CVS and EIS and the restriction of those schemes to certain approved business activities, which are somehow deemed morally superior, is inherently arbitrary. Why does the civil servant in Whitehall know best? Who is to say that some people's moral judgments on business activities are held by the nation at large? There is also an issue about what is likely to be economically beneficial to the nation in terms of growing national income and growing jobs.

<P>
The present list of exclusions carries the traditional and puritanical socialist stamp. Why should farms or nursing homes be excluded from CVSs? The collapse of nursing home businesses is an acute problem, as is the lack of nursing home provision. Farms and nursing homes need encouragement at a time when the countryside is in crisis and there is an increasingly aging population.

<P>
Amendment No. 206 suggests a list of business activities to exclude that the solid ranks of the Women's Institute and middle England would regard as economically useless and not to be encouraged. It includes the marketing buzz, public relations, political surveying, millennium doming, consultancy, fashion modelling, newspapers, magazines and so forth.

<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Just a second. The list could be added to. It is a little sample of what some would call the candy-floss economy. I do not seriously suggest that such businesses should be excluded, but the present list of exclusions is barking crazy. It is 100 years out of date and is still in the age of teetotalling and moral fervour. Amendments Nos. 155 and 156 take the other approach of simply abolishing exclusions.

<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): I find the hon. Gentleman's argument amusing and congratulate him on his style. He said something about nursing homes. Perhaps he would comment further on why he would include businesses such as those in his proposed new sub-paragraphs (c) to (f). Has he considered the consequences of doing so?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Our broad point is that it would be a better bet not to have exclusions at all. If we make exclusions, we are involved in moral judgments. There is an issue about what businesses are legal in this country anyway, so the Government can use other measures to stop a bad business.

<P>
Lurking in this territory are some tax arguments that may have been valid in an age of inflation, in terms of wanting to discourage tax incentives for anything that would drive inflation up, such as property speculation. For the commercial sector, that is pretty much something of the past. There may be other solutions. Agreement could sensibly be reached on some exclusions, but the present list is out of date and makes little economic sense.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> We were all intrigued to learn in reference to which of the proposed activities the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends declared their interests, but he was silent about that. I find his remarks surprising. The list in the Bill has been used before.


<P>
I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the remarks on the technical note, which were received as a result of extremely extensive consultation with interested parties on all the proposals. The adaptive venture managers said that the list of non-qualifying activities undertaken by the recipient target company is entirely appropriate. The Confederation of British Industry said that the conditions on business activity for VCT and EIS are equally applicable. The Chartered Institute of Taxation said that it was sensible to import the EIS definition, as we have. The Enterprise Investment Scheme Association said that the investee company should qualify for VCT and EIS purposes. The Institute of Directors-which is not renowned for supporting Whitehall civil servants, who the hon. Gentleman suggested lay behind the proposal-recommends reproducing exactly the EIS definition of a qualifying company, as we have.

<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I am surprised at the hon. Gentleman's proposal. The list works. It makes sense in the context of experience, and there are reasons for some of the references in the list. He mentioned nursing homes and farming. The list of exclusions includes several activities that relate to property. The reason for that is straightforward. Businesses involved in such activity would not generally be regarded as high risk. They are more able to raise capital than businesses that are not based on property. That is the reason for much of the existing list, including the reference to nursing homes, to which he referred.

<P>
Farming is also on the existing list, which is based on the list used for investment reliefs. Activities that relate to property are excluded because of past exploitation under the business expansion scheme, a forerunner of the schemes, under the previous Government. I remind Opposition Members that they excluded farming from the business expansion scheme as long ago as 1984 because of distortion in the market and because, as a result of investment relief, large amounts had been invested in farmland, making it difficult for those already engaged in farming to acquire additional land.

<P>
I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman should be arguing the case that he is, albeit flippantly. I am not sure that the Committee is a place for humour in tabling amendments. I appreciate his point, but I am surprised at the way in which he presented the argument.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Regrettably, the Economic Secretary's comments show how out of date Treasury thinking is. Admittedly, 10 or 15 years ago, farmers argued that it would be in their interests to exclude farming. Now, however, they would only too dearly love to sell their land. As a result of the Government's policies, farming is bust. Similarly, 10 or 15 years ago, in the age of inflation, everyone was worried about people making too much money out of property. Now it is the Chancellor, supported by the report on productivity in the United Kingdom, who points out that one of the problems that prevents productivity from growing fast enough is our planning laws and the lack of provision of suitable buildings. A case can now be made for making financing such activity easier rather than more difficult. As the Economic Secretary will be aware, quoted property companies are now de-listing, because they are finding it difficult to raise money because of the discount on their shares.

<P>
The mere fact that the establishment has ticked off this old list that has been around for some time, and that was, admittedly, introduced when we were in power, shows exactly why such matters should be considered. For most of the exclusions, in today's economy, there is no great logic for exclusion. As I flippantly pointed out, it would be possible to conceive of other activities through which, morally, it might be thought that people make too much money or that are economically worthless, and exclude them, too. It is not good enough simply to say, ``It is an old list that we hawked around to get the establishment's tick of approval.'' The list is wrong. If we consider the matter radically, there is little case for any exclusion. There is not much point in pressing the amendment to a Division, but I hope that members of the Committee will take note of our argument because it is so easy just to fall in with the traditions of civil servants and what has gone before, and not to think about such matters, which is exactly what the Treasury has done now.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> When the Economic Secretary responds to my hon. Friend, I should appreciate it if she would refer to the interaction between paragraphs 18 and 19 of the schedule. The amendment would amend the list of excluded activities, and my hon. Friend postulated his argument on the grounds that the list is old-fashioned and said that, in modern times when business moves at great speed and new ideas come along, account should be taken of certain developments. He proposed a new list of exclusions.

<P>
Will the hon. Lady say a little about the flexibility that may apply to both the amendment and the list in the schedule, and consider circumstances in which a company was carrying out research and development, and the subsequent adjudication-if I can describe it as such-whether trading activity arose from that research and development and whether a company may qualify, as opposed to not qualifying? Such interaction would apply some interesting flexibility to the interpretation of both lists of current excluded activities.

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs says that the list is out of date. Changes were made to it as recently as 1998. It is not a fixed list, but changes from time to time to reflect current developments. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman understands why it has a strong property base element. I loved his comment that he would write off the views of the CBI, the Chartered Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Directors. I am sure that they will be interested to hear of the standing in which the hon. Gentleman holds their remarks on such matters.

<P>
As for research and development, I point the hon. Gentleman in the direction of those companies that receive licence fees and royalties and which are excluded from EMI and CVS. Many such companies are not excluded. When an intangible asset that gives rise to royalties and licence fees has been developed in the company, the company will qualify. The relief is designed to help high-risk companies grow through their efforts. When fees are derived from intellectual property that is developed by someone else and bought in by the company, no risk arises and EMI will not be appropriate. The changes that were suggested during the consultation period were widely welcomed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We shall not press the amendment to a Division, as the appropriate issues have been raised. The various organisations mentioned by the Minister referred simply to the list and when it was previously amended. Their comments did not reflect the idea to step back and think whether the list was correct. That question was not asked of them. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are dealing with another tangential exclusion issue, and especially with that of policing. Manufacturers sometimes need to assist in the disposal of their products by providing that they are leased by customers rather than bought outright. The leasing of a manufacturer's product should not be the cause of disqualification when any part of the product is produced by an agency using the manufacturer's intangible assets, by which I mean intellectual property or know-how. That should not be a problem.

<P>
The leasing issue arises in amendments Nos. 210, 211 and, to some extent, 273, which is about intangibles. The relaxation for relevant intangible assets provided for in relation to EMI is welcome, but there is a separate exclusion problem. Under the Government's proposals, it might often be the case that a company has to acquire another piece of intellectual property to make what it has work and to sell it on as an assembly. It is clearly equitable to allow royalty and licence fees paid in respect of the whole not to disqualify a relevant company. I hope that the Economic Secretary will respond by saying that, in the Government's view, the provision is already covered. Amendment No. 273 and those on the same issue would cover it.

<P>
Amendment No. 273 focuses on EIS, for which the point is most important. The amendment would hook in and expand on the enterprise management incentive view of royalties and licence fees, as a previous amendment would have expanded the proposals for royalties under EMI.

<P>
I apologise for jumping around in the order that I talk about the amendments. Amendment No. 212 focuses on the issue in relation to EMI. Although the relaxation for relevant intangible assets provided is welcome, again, a company may have to acquire another piece of intellectual property to make what it has work and to sell it on as an assembly. For EMI, the amendment points out that it would be correct to allow royalty and licence fees paid in respect of the whole not to disqualify an EMI company.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 255 and 256 deal with the leasing point in relation to corporate venturing. Amendment No. 257 similarly deals with the intellectual property point in relation to corporate venturing. Amendment No. 290 picks up the leasing issue in relation to EIS.

<P>
In summary, two themes flow across EMI, corporate venturing and EIS. The Government's proposals for EMI already meet some of the point, but it is unfair to exclude companies that have to use leasing to sell their products. When intellectual rights are needed to make a whole to on-sell, it would be wrong to exclude businesses purely because they had received all the fees on the intellectual rights, some of which they had developed and some of which they had bought in.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The EMI, the EIS, VCTs and CVS-I hope that everyone is all right with those-are targeted on small, higher risk companies that find it difficult to recruit and retain people with the right skills or to raise equity finance. Leasing companies that can offer shareholders the underlying security of an asset's being leased are not in general an appropriate target.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight indicated assent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I see that the hon. Gentleman agrees with that.

<P>
The existing EIS and VCT rules-and the proposed rule for CVS and EMI-already make provision for leasing activity by a company that manufactures or produces assets, by providing that an excluded activity, such as leasing, is permitted as long as it is not a substantial part of the trade.

<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We have returned to the issue of the ``substantial part'' and the problem with that definition, which means 20 per cent. Is a manufacturing company that sells 100 per cent. of its goods by leasing excluded? Its main business may be production, but it may be in an area in which the best way of getting rid of the goods is by leasing. Currently, if the figure is more than 20 per cent., the company is excluded.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct, but it is not an argument against the proposals. The proposals need to make sure that a substantial non-leasing element exists, because, although we accept that leasing happens, it is not the sort of activity that the measure is mainly aimed to support. The arrangements provide flexibility, while excluding low-risk activities. One of the arguments against leasing is its low-risk element. I am therefore not persuaded that relaxation is desirable.

<P>
It would also be wrong for the schemes to include companies that were passively exploiting intellectual property and other intangible assets acquired from third parties. The exception to that rule, which we are proposing for EMI, EIS, VCTs and CVS, has been welcomed as a considerable improvement to the existing rule for EIS and VCT.

<P>
The amendments concern companies that combine their intellectual property with that of others to qualify for the schemes. The scope of the amendments is excessive. No lower limit is put on what the small company must contribute in terms of intellectual property, so those companies that make no significant input, and take no risk, could qualify as a result. I repeat that the measure is aimed at risk taking and supporting risk takers. Royalties or licence fees received by a company can be attributable to its own intangible assets, even though they build on intangible assets created by others. In such circumstances, there is no need for the kind of change that the amendments would introduce.

<P>
I would add that the rule that we are proposing does not require that the whole of the amount of royalties or licence fees is attributable to intangible assets created by the company or its group. That provides additional flexibility.

<P>
For those reasons, I am not persuaded that there is a need to amend the existing leasing exclusion or to amend the treatment of royalties and licence fees, as the rule is already considered more generous than the EIS and VCT rules that it replaces. We will keep the operation of those rules under review.

<P>
In the light of my remarks, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn. If not, I must urge the Committee to reject it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am afraid that I was not entirely clear in my mind about what the Economic Secretary was saying, and what it meant in practice. There may be scope for Revenue guidelines. I think that she was saying, in principle, that the Government do not want to exclude a company that, in essence, is a manufacturing company, merely because its method of sale is leasing. I think that she confirmed that, under the current arrangements, if more than 20 per cent. of a company's sales are by leasing it would be excluded. There seems to be precious little logic in that. The Government might want to consider a fair revenue approach to the matter. It is not a huge issue, but, as the structure of economies changes, it is more rather than less likely, under new economic parameters, that manufacturers will sell more and more by leasing contracts.

<P>
In relation to intellectual assets, I said that relaxation had been generally welcomed. However, the Economic Secretary agreed that perfectly bona fide situations exist in which a company must acquire a piece of intellectual property to add to its own, so that it may sell on the assembled combination. I am not sure whether the Economic Secretary was saying that that would disqualify the company, or whether the fact that the royalty and licence fees were paid on the whole package-not just the part developed by the company-would serve as a disqualification. I should have thought that the Revenue could work out a fairly sensible guideline that permitted a fair degree of buy-in. I take the Economic Secretary's point that if moral judgments are made about which companies qualify, a company that buys in all its intellectual assets should be avoided. In the light of technical developments, it is impractical to exclude a company just because it is not doing all of its own intangible intellectual work. It is necessary to allow for a reasonable amount of buy-in to create a whole package.

<P>
I would like to be reassured on that point by the Economic Secretary but, subject to that, we would not want to press the amendment to a Division. For both issues, flexibility and common sense are needed, and not the tight and inflexible definitions that we have.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I have listened carefully to what my hon. Friend and the Economic Secretary said. The Minister, not unnaturally, prayed in aid the import to the legislation of some features of the EIS and VCT schemes that were designed to stop some of the abuses that occurred in the business expansion scheme. On reflection, however, I find that there is a difference between the aims of the BES with its successor schemes and those of the current scheme. The former schemes dealt with investment and capital from external investors in new business initiatives. The new proposals deal with the investment in an enterprise of the personal skills and talents of individuals. Although there is less risk of abuse in that scheme, the Government are transplanting previous anti-risk legislation on to it.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs rightly said that if one aims to encourage new inventiveness, investment and enterprise, as the Economic Secretary claimed, one should be more flexible. The dangers that she wants to prevent in the legislation that my hon. Friend would amend are not the same as those that existed in the business expansion scheme. My hon. Friend is right to probe the boundaries of the Government's intentions, because we want to generate new businesses.

<P>
Let us imagine, for example, that a group of marketing entrepreneurs in the United Kingdom decided to generate a new business and make available a highly risky overseas product. Businesses might say, because of the risks involved, that they liked the idea but did not want to buy the product-that they could manage a short-term leasing arrangement but there would be a cut-off. The group might decide to take that risk and to set up a company to market the product-perhaps a piece of software or hardware. A lot of persuasive marketing people would need to be involved to make such a project a success. Those people would say, ``It is an embryo business so we will have the options. We will be able to invest our talents against the risks of the business.'' Such an enterprise might produce, as a spin-off, a vast distribution exercise making work for other people. The individuals involved might invest their skills to develop a leasing business for a novel process, with no abuse of the type that such imported legislation will prevent.

<P>
When the business expansion scheme was in operation, at times I wished that I had a great deal of money because it looked like a wonderful money-making scheme, particularly for companies that were involved in land or property. I accept that a Conservative Government introduced the scheme, but it got a bit out of hand and I can understand why the Administration of which I was a member constrained it. However, the Government are now being over-cautious.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I wish to point out that all those worries about property and BES schemes were dealt with quickly by the market and more people lost money under them than made any, so most of the great moral concerns turned out not to be justified.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My hon. Friend marks his place in my mind as someone from whom in future I will seek advice before venturing any money.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I counsel the right hon. Gentleman against taking advice from the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. My information is that, contrary to the impression that the hon. Gentleman gave us, the business expansion scheme was introduced in 1983 and it took a full 10 years before the then Conservative Government abolished it in 1993. That badly targeted scheme lasted all that time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I do not want to go down that road-[
Interruption.] The Government Whip had better not tempt me, because I could be capable of doing so. With a bit of care, I expect that I could weave my way back into that subject and still be within the bounds of the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs. Governments-usually with good motives-embark on particular schemes to encourage the development of new enterprises. However, in reality, not all the aspects of schemes are obvious. As my hon. Friend said, it is easy for Ministers who are receiving the sage advice of experts to accept it. Given that certain schemes went a bit awry in the past, Ministers do not want to be tarnished by that sort of brush.

<P>
My hon. Friend argued that, in the new world of business, new types of enterprise may emerge, and that we should not constrain ourselves by removing a provision related to leasing. It is an important part of modern business practice and assists the development of the embryo company that does not have a large amount of capital to invest in fixed assets. It could be argued that the amendment is reinforcing the argument advanced by the Economic Secretary when she justified the scheme.

<P>
The hon. Lady said that she would keep the matter ``under review''-a phrase that is often used by Ministers who have started to edge into a corner. There is a ceaseless flow in the Treasury of bits of paper used to keep matters under review. I should be happier if she said, ``I will, after 12 months, publish a report assessing the gains or otherwise of the proposals and give industry and commerce an opportunity to consider the amendment to see whether they would like to discuss it with the Treasury''. The Treasury will lose nothing by such action. It will give us a genuine opportunity to see whether my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs was right or whether the Economic Secretary, with her more cautious approach was right. The Economic Secretary might like to reflect on whether she could satisfy all our curiosities by committing herself to publishing a piece of paper in 12 months that will give us an insight into how the scheme is operating.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> So far, I have remained silent on schedule 14, because I had the impression earlier that I might have a direct personal interest in its outcome, not least because my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs proposed amendment No. 206, which I thought might have related to me personally. However, I find that I do not have a personal interest to declare, except in the usual sense that the investment bank in which I have an interest may have clients that have an interest, and it is from my knowledge of that that I add a point of practical importance.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am intrigued about which item on the list the hon. Member for West Dorset thought might conceivably involve him. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs did not identify in which item on the list he would have an interest, and nor did the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory). I am intrigued to know which item the hon. Member for West Dorset was worried about.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall not be tempted into exchanging badinage, however amusing, with the Economic Secretary, lest I be accused of mumbling.

<P>
I raise a practical point that the Economic Secretary may easily be able to answer to allay my fears. One of the types of company now coming to the fore is telecom start-ups. Companies in the telecom field, especially in infrastructure provision, including in particular web hosting and advanced service provision, typically start with a thin capitalisation, and in many cases would or could be covered under the 15 million gross asset test. Such companies face particular problems in identifying highly skilled manpower in incumbent and major telcos that pay their staff extremely well. A start-up therefore needs to offer such people high capital gearing in order to attract them to the business, which is exactly what the Government and the Economic Secretary are trying to encourage. In this country, we have a tremendous record of leading-edge companies in the field, which are now expanding into Europe and the United States, among other places. That is a practical case that exactly fits the image that the Government have of the sort of company that they are trying to help through the scheme, and may indeed help if they get it right.

<P>
Unfortunately, a large part of such business now uses items known as indefeasible rights of users-a sort of lease. Instead of buying a large number of assets and selling on services as British Telecom has typically done, because the new start-up company is thinly capitalised and its customers are unsure how long they will want to use particular assets in a fast-moving technological scene, typically it will take out a lease on particular assets and resell the services, partly in the form of leases of capacity or IRUs on wavelengths. We are now dealing with highly intangible markets in which people buy the ability to send signals at particular rates from particular points to other points.

<P>
Those items would, I suspect, be classed by the courts ultimately, and by the Inland Revenue in the meantime, as leases. The business of such companies that is in that form is typically not 15 per cent. or 10 per cent.-under the 20 per cent. limit to which my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs referred-but 70 per cent., 80 per cent. or even, in some cases, 100 per cent.

<P>
We are discussing an entirely legitimate trading enterprise that is not a finance leasing company, and such activity is not a tax dodge. The enterprise is a high-technology start-up that requires skilled labour, and it is a trading business that in due course may be worth 1 billion or 5 billion. Some such companies grow very fast, and they are exactly the sort of businesses with which the Economic Secretary is trying to deal.

<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde sometimes disingenuously claims to be a seeker after truth. He is being disingenuous because he already knows the answers, but I am genuinely seeking truth because I do not know them. Will the Economic Secretary assure us that those companies will not be caught by the leasing provision? If they will be caught, that error needs attention fast, as the category under discussion is the single most important one in the endeavour. Emerging telecom companies are the single item most likely to benefit from the provisions, so it would be sadly ironic if they were largely excluded.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I will tackle the hon. Gentleman's final point first. The Revenue is happy to give guidance on new businesses such as the telecom start-ups to which he referred. We are already giving tax relief for IRUs in the Budget, so I do not see a need to further address that issue.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells exhorted us to provide guidelines. The Revenue, which already produces EIS and VCT booklets, will produce a booklet on CVS and EMI that will provide the guidance that he wants.

<P>
There is nothing to prevent a company from acquiring intellectual property and using it to manufacture goods. The restriction is not on the payment of the licence fees but on their receipt.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde described the measures as encouraging new enterprise, but such a description needs qualification. Smaller high-risk companies find it difficult to attract capital. Therefore, the purpose of the schemes is not simply to encourage new enterprise, although we are keen that it should develop across the piece, but to encourage it in such companies, on which the provisions are targeted and focused. I noted the right hon. Gentleman's description of the BES as a wonderful money-making scheme, which it was. That is why, after 10 years, it was brought to an end. It made too much money for various people because it attracted money into areas in which it was easy to make it with relatively low risk. The new scheme is focused on high-risk businesses for which it is more difficult to attract support.

<P>
The list does not define which trades qualify, but includes some that do not. In other words, everything is included that is not excluded, which is the least restrictive way of identifying high-risk companies. That list is kept under review and modified from time to time.

<P>
We have had a long dialogue and a thorough consultation with industry, so there is no need to report on the scheme after only 12 months, as the right hon. Gentleman suggested. That is not a long enough period in which to see whether the scheme is working, but we have given an undertaking that we will review it after five years.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> There may have been a misunderstanding between the Economic Secretary and myself. In her explanation, she suggested that Revenue guidelines would be given, but went on to say that tax relief is given for IRUs in the Budget. Did she mean that the Revenue has recognised IRUs as a depreciable asset? I would have no quarrel with that at all, but it does not address my point, which relates not to the balance sheet but to the revenue of the companies involved. They do not merely take out IRUs; they sell them. Their business is to sell leases. They actually sell the underlying capacity, but the means by which they do so is to sell leases.

<P>
Unless I have misunderstood, if 100 per cent. or, indeed, more than 20 per cent. of a business consists of the sale of capacity by lease, that business would be excluded. If the Economic Secretary said-I hope that she did-that that was a misunderstanding and that the guidelines would make it clear that a genuine trading telecom business leasing its capacity would not be excluded, that would be extremely important for Pepper v. Hart purposes. It would be entirely welcome and would clear up the problem.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I did not say that. I said that we had made changes in the Budget, of which the hon. Gentleman appeared to be aware. I am happy to write to companies that write to the Revenue. If the hon. Gentleman has specific examples in mind from his experience, I shall be happy to respond to individual cases. It is not clear that there is a problem for us to tackle in the way in which he outlines.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We have tried to raise two specific issues. My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset has clearly explained the leasing point, which is that there are many high-tech areas under new economy trading terms where bona fide businesses end up leasing something. I cannot see that it is in the interests of anyone to exclude them, as they are the sorts of businesses that one wants to encourage. That situation needs consideration, as the provisions exclude them. Our amendment was designed not to exclude them.

<P>
I am not clear in my mind about what the Economic Secretary said about intangible assets. When an intellectual business sells its intellectual creativity and packages, often in today's world it will buy in something, put it together with what it already has and sell that. Those high-tech businesses are the subject of our debate. It would clearly be nonsense to exclude a business when it was responsible for part of the package that it sold, while another part was bought in from someone else. It is crackpot thinking not to recognise that that is the way in which commerce works now. Despite the relaxation, our legal understanding is that the sale contract for the two parts combined will be excluded. That must be wrong.

<P>
We have beaten both issues to death, but these are practical matters. I do not believe that the Government want to exclude bona fide situations. Will they please consider the points that we are raising? The glib answers miss what we are trying to get at, which is of special relevance to the new economy's high-tech sector. The Economic Secretary has broadly said that she will consider the matter. If the Government make a genuine attempt to achieve their objectives, we shall withdraw the amendment. I hope that our points have been understood.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do not want to give the hon. Gentleman the impression that I shall return with some different proposal. That is not in my mind. The sort of situation that he outlines varies so much depending on circumstances. I do not criticise him for outlining it in general terms, but it makes things difficult. Under some circumstances, it may be possible for such companies to qualify, but not under others. If he wants to write to me with several cases, I will happily consider them further.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Economic Secretary has made it clear that her position is not as I had hoped. Both issues are clear, and the legislation should be sophisticated enough to deal with them. The Treasury should have thought about them, so we must put them to a vote.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 157, in page 319, line 36, leave out ``25'' and insert ``20''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 158, in page 319, line 37, leave out ``75%'' and insert ``60%''.

<P>
No. 159, in page 319, line 39, after ``spend'', insert ``or in fact spends''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendments were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) and me. They straightforwardly suggest that for EMI the number of hours a week that individuals have to work to qualify should be reduced from 25 to 20, and that the percentage of their working time should be reduced from 75 to 60 per cent. At the same time, they should not simply be ``required  to spend'' the defined time, but should actually spend the time.

<P>
The issue needs consideration from the point of view of the company wanting to use EMI. We want to attract key people, and EMI benefits will be used sparingly by businesses because they will be a significant cost to them. A key individual to a business could work 20 hours a week and spend 60 per cent. of his working time at that business, but it is difficult to draw a line. It is questionable whether it is right to draw lines about the amount of time, but we understand why the Government have done so.

<P>
If lines are drawn, our view is that it is better to make territories sufficient to include people who might be key to the success of a business and who spend the majority-60 per cent.-of their working time there, but may have some involvement with other businesses as well. A boundary that excludes people with key experience of other business backgrounds does not make much sense. This proposal would not make much difference to the tax revenue. Those who run businesses must have the flexibility to decide which key people make a significant contribution to their business and, thus, should be motivated with EMI options.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am again a little bemused by the hon. Gentleman's remarks and I wonder whether he fully understands the provisions. Paragraph 29 of the schedule ensures that EMI options benefit those employees who devote a significant amount of time to growing businesses. EMI options are not intended to benefit those looking to make a quick killing from dabbling in new businesses, while retaining their interests and earnings in other paid work. To qualify, those key employees will need to commit their working time to EMI.

<P>
To ensure that the relief is targeted at those prepared to make such a commitment, the Bill requires than an employee who will receive an EMI option must work at least 25 hours a week for the company or devote 75 per cent. of his working time to it. That second stipulation does not set a number of hours, but relates only to 75 per cent. of the time that the employee works. The requirement concerning 25 hours a week is a simple test and one that companies can meet easily. If they do not wish to use that test, the alternative test of 75 per cent. of working time allows all part-time employees to benefit from EMI options, too, and those who are required by their employer to complete their work in whatever time that it takes, which is not unusual.

<P>
The amendments would undermine that safeguard. A dilution of the working-time rule risks opening the door for EMI options to be given to employees who are not key employees. Reducing the requirements for the commitment of working time would enable employees who may be devoting a significant amount of time to one or more other, possibly rival, companies to obtain EMI options. They are not the people for whom such generous tax relief is intended. The amendment would allow someone who devotes 40 per cent. of his working time to another company to qualify. Such an individual will not have taken a risk in moving to, or staying with, the company offering the EMI option. We want to support those individuals who take such a risk. EMI options are about rewarding risk takers who make a real difference to a company's success. They are not about rewarding people who are already well-rewarded in safe jobs elsewhere.

<P>
Amendment No. 159 proposes that those who are not required to work at least 25 hours a week or devote 75 per cent. of their working time to the company should be eligible employees if, in fact, they go on to spend that time working for the company. It would make the scheme unworkable. Companies must know at the time of granting an option whether an employee is eligible. An employee's committed time, as defined under paragraph 29(2), was deliberately drafted as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the time he is required as an employee  to spend,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
following recommendations from the private sector advisory group, which helped to design the relief. It stressed that it is important for companies to be able to determine with certainty from the outset which employees are eligible. Companies can ensure that an employee is eligible at the time of the granting of the option by requiring an employee to commit at least 25 hours a week or 75 per cent. of his or her working time. I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I completely understand what this part of the schedule is about. The key people in the small businesses that I have known are frequently those who give about 60 per cent. of their time to those companies. They would not have qualified in another business because if 60 per cent. of their time was given to one business, 40 per cent. would be too little. Such people have had some experience in a similar business elsewhere, which is what is needed when trying to make a business grow. They may be 50 years old, so they would not give all of their time and may still have a semi-executive position in the company in which they gained their experience.

<P>
If I were running a small business, I would be immensely mean about giving out EMI options because they would dilute my company. I keep making that point, but those in the Treasury do not seem to understand it because they have not had experience of running a business. There is a discipline, because options are not given out unless it is genuinely necessary to make the enterprise succeed. I argued for slightly more flexible boundaries, which would permit the type of person that I described. It is not a question of do or die; it is difficult to make a judgment on what is right. However, 25 hours or 75 per cent. of time broadly excludes the type of person that I have in mind, who can be invaluable to a new business.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but our intention is to encourage people who are prepared to take risks. In the scenario that he envisages and says that he has experienced, in which there is a 60:40 split, the person is not taking a risk, which is what we are trying to reward. I accept that the person may be making a valuable contribution, but that is not the point. The purpose of the scheme is to attract and reward those who are prepared to take risks, and a 60:40 split does not represent a risk. The rules were drawn up by an advisory group made up of small business people and their advisers. Apart from those in the Treasury who have experience of such matters, the Treasury has other means of making sure that it consults business on what will work, and does so successfully on many occasions. I do not deny that those to whom the hon. Gentleman refers are making a contribution, but they are not the people for whom the scheme was designed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I have listened to the extremely interesting exchange between my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs and the Economic Secretary, and I think that I understand her line of argument. We appreciate the difference between somebody who dabbles as a sideline and somebody who is taking a serious risk. However, I wonder whether she is thinking hard enough about the concrete realities underlying her proposal.

<P>
The Economic Secretary spoke about small businesses. The proposal or bundle of proposals may be of use to some small businesses, although I doubt that it will be of much use to many very small businesses. Certainly, the economy will not benefit greatly if it is only of use to very small businesses. I suspect that the hon. Lady will agree, if she thinks of specific examples, that she is aiming not at small businesses but nascent businesses. In the light of the American example, many such businesses become very large within a few years of coming into being. Those are the businesses that we most want. If we merely provide a slight tax subsidy for those who devote their lives, however worthily, to the fostering of slightly larger corner shops, the economic effect that the Government rightly want will not be achieved.

<P>
I shall return to the examples of nascent telecom or software businesses-the two prime examples in the UK of small items that would qualify for the scheme and stand a chance, within a few years, of becoming large items, and, in some cases, enormous items. Will those firms be able to make the hugely difficult transition from being tiny to being enormous if they cannot attract people who will devote only a small proportion of their time to them? In some cases, the answer is that they will not be able to do so unless they can attract such people.

<P>
It would not violate your admirable principle of not talking too personally, Mr. Cook, if I were to cite the example of my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Norman), who has almost unrivalled contacts in British industry. If I were to set up a small software or telecom business, which I hope quickly to make into a large business, one of the people whom I would be most inclined to attract into my business would be my hon. Friend. I do not refer to him as more than an example, but he is a good case. I suspect that he could transform the prospects of such a business. Such businesses depend on two factors. The first is a couple of clever boffins who have a jolly good idea. They will qualify under the Economic Secretary's rubric as it stands, because they will tend to occupy 100 per cent. of their time in business. The second is, critically, someone who can find customers to buy the item that the clever boffins have invented. In the absence of the second, the first is useless.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Unfortunately, British economic history is littered with examples of admirable ideas produced by very clever boffins who cannot sell them and eventually emigrate to California, where they find such people, sell their ideas and become very rich. One of the world's three largest computer companies, Compaq, fits exactly into that pattern. Its history includes a regrettable instance of clever boffins in the UK having to disappear because they could not find a means of selling their ideas properly in the UK. I assume that that is exactly the sort of circumstances that the Government are, admirably, trying to change through the introduction of the scheme.

<P>
If 5 per cent. or 10 per cent.-our modest suggestion is for a much larger proportion of 60 per cent.-of a person's time must be made available to such a business, and if that person is enormously valuable to the business and the only way to attract him is to offer him options, it is surely part of the intent of the scheme that it should be possible to attract him, even if it is for 10 hours a week or 5 per cent. of his time. Indeed, I am amazed at the moderation of our amendment. I am surprised that the Economic Secretary is not objecting to it on the grounds that it is too moderate.

<P>
The Economic Secretary might have argued not only that it was a question of trying to limit eligibility to risk takers, although I do not see why we need to limit eligibility to risk takers in the full sense if we are trying to reverse the problem that I described, but also that we want to prevent abuse whereby someone who has nothing to do with the business but is simply being given a favour in response to another business transaction is given a share option that qualifies under the scheme and attracts a tax subsidy. That would be a genuine abuse, which none of us would favour.

<P>
If the Economic Secretary were trying to prevent such abuse, she would be right. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs has answered that point conclusively. It is almost unthinkable that such businesses would want to dilute their capital, which is their most precious asset, and, indeed, initially, their only asset, by giving some of it away-quite large proportions in most cases-to someone whom they did not need. We would have to devise an extremely elaborate scheme to make that a valid and sensible business proposition. Such businesses, 99.9 per cent. of the time, will give away share capital only if they are extremely clear that the person whom they want to attract is genuinely absolutely necessary to the business, especially if a small proportion of that person's time is involved.

<P>
The Economic Secretary would be wrong to argue that she needs the constraint to prevent abuse. If she is not right to say that, the only ground for limiting application of the scheme to those who take a risk in the full-blown sense is some kind of misguided principle of envy. If the contribution is, as the Economic Secretary admitted it could be and as I argue might well be, critical to the solution of a serious problem in our economy, and if the scheme could make that contribution more likely to be made and could help to solve that problem, there are no grounds for restricting eligibility to those who are taking a full-blown risk so long as there is, as I believe, no potential for abuse.

<P>
I hope that the Economic Secretary will forgive the somewhat inelegant exposition, but I do not think that the logic stands up. I understand how the Treasury arrived at that position, and I can see how I might have done so if I had asked myself the wrong question: ``How can I reward risk taking?'' However, that is the wrong question. We should ask instead how we could make nascent companies large and successful. That is the underlying thought that somehow the Treasury has translated into a reward for risk takers. I do not suppose that the Economic Secretary will comment on that now, but she and her colleagues should reflect on the real aim and ask why they should reward risk takers rather than fostering the ability of nascent companies to grow.

<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I begin by reminding hon. Gentleman that the 60 per cent. working time employee can always get an option of up to 30,000 free of income tax under the company share option plan. That is a valuable way of rewarding the people involved, but it is outside the present scheme because that 60:40 split does not fit the design of the scheme. Several reports that I could quote-the CBI Textiles report, the Bank of England report, and the reports by Lord Trotman and Lord Williams-all support the need that the EMI scheme addresses. They agree that we need to reward risk takers. The core debate is about whether those people working 60:40 splits are risk takers in the sense meant by us. We say that they are not and, when hon. Gentlemen assert that they are, they are arguing about a definition. The point of all those reports is the need to focus on rewards for risk takers and the need for access to management skills, given the difficulties of recruitment in that area.

<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset was less than charitable and helpful in his remarks on EMI. He said that the design of the scheme was the result of envy in the Treasury. Did he really say that? I find it difficult to accept that that word crossed his lips. EMI has been widely welcomed. I have a sheet of press comments on the value of the scheme, but I particularly draw his attention to the fact that David Gill, who is the head of the innovation and growth unit at HSBC, welcomed the move. He reckoned that current rules aimed to weed out minority ``fat cat'' exploitation, which is an interesting remark in the context of the debate.

<P>
The founder of Phoenix Relocation said in The Times on 22 March that it would take advantage of the EMI scheme because
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it will help us get a higher calibre of people.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the objective of the scheme and I believe that it meets it well. The amendment would do nothing but destroy the focus of the scheme and I urge the Committee to reject it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We have made our points clearly and there is an interesting conceptual difference between the two sides of the debate. The objective of the scheme might be either to recreate the successes of the United States or, more narrowly, to assist key full-time risk takers. Our point is that it would be wiser to make the objective broad rather than narrow, but we understand the Government's thinking. Although the letter ``R'' is placed by my name on the amendment paper, I have not declared an interest so far in our proceedings because all the businesses in which I am involved do not qualify. I repeat my welcome for the scheme, but not its picky-picky approach to exclude this, that and the other.

<P>
The Government will be surprised and slightly disappointed to find how many businesses and particular people who should be incentivised will be excluded. It is such a silly thing to do; it is not a huge tax risk anyway. If the Government want an entrepreneurial revolution, they must go for it and not put all their effort into tying everything up here, there and everywhere. We shall not press the amendment to a Division. We have made our point. The Government have made their position clear and they will suffer politically because the scheme will not deliver all that they hope that it will deliver. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We come now to an issue that is similar to the one that we discussed earlier. EMI options cannot be granted to individuals who hold a material interest in the underlying company. Clearly, that is a general principle for approved schemes, too, and is designed to prevent owners of substantial proportions, who make the economy go-those people described by the Treasury as fat cats and wicked capitalists-from extracting value in such a tax-favoured manner.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will tell me when the Treasury was supposed to have said that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Minister used the phrase a few seconds ago.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I used it in a particular context; I was quoting what someone had said.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The hon. Lady used the quotation with some glee, thus showing her approval of it.

<P>
A 30 per cent. threshold where there might be three key founders is on the low side. It is unreasonable that they should not have EMI options. Where to draw the line is a difficult judgmental issue.

<P>
THE CHAIRMAN'S attention have been called to the fact that thirteen Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and thirteen Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps I should tell the Committee that it has effectively dispelled any masochistic glee that I had today until two minutes ago.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Before the Committee was suspended, I was saying that it was not easy to judge the right proportions, but we believe that it would be preferable to err on the side that can include everyone whom we want to include than on the other side. As I said, a situation in which three key people owned 30 per cent. of the company-10 per cent. each-would exclude them, which is why we have suggested 50 per cent. A huge issue is not at stake, but it is wiser to have a scheme that includes many of the right people rather than one that excludes them. Amendment No. 228 makes the same point in relation to corporate venturing.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The amendments would change the material interest rules under the enterprise management incentive and corporate venturing schemes so that, in the case of EMI, individuals could benefit even if they owned or controlled up to 50 per cent. of the company that employed them. In the case of CVS, the same would apply to companies that owned or controlled up to 50 per cent. of the company in which they had invested. For EMI, there is also a let-out for breaches of the rules for less than a year.

<P>
Although in each case the test of material interest would increase from 30 per cent. to 50 per cent., the origin of the two rules is different. For EMI, the material interest test is a common feature of other employee share schemes. However, it is more generous than any existing approved scheme, as the limit is set at 25 per cent. for all-employee schemes and at 10 per cent. for the company share option plan. The test is to target the valuable EMI relief towards key employees who do not already have a substantial holding in the venture. Individuals with large holdings are unlikely to need tax incentives to recruit them to or retain them in the company, as they already have a significant interest in the company's success. The proposed let-out would mean that the rules could be manipulated easily. It would be open to companies to reward those who already had a substantial holding and were in a position to bring themselves back within the limit by artificial means.

<P>
The purpose of the material interest test in relation to the corporate venturing scheme is to focus the benefit of tax reliefs on minority shareholding in independent small companies. We never intended that the reliefs should be available for large companies investing in their own subsidiaries. When an Inland Revenue technical note was published in March last year to allow consultation on the outline of the scheme, the original proposal was that the shareholding should be limited to 20 per cent. of the ordinary share capital. However, many responses argued that that limit was too low, so we increased it to 30 per cent. In response to consultation on the draft clauses that were published in December, we also relaxed the way in which the test is applied to exclude a wider category of preference shares.

<P>
Although a 50 per cent. interest would not technically give an investing company control of a small company in which it invests, it is clear that, with half its shares owned or voting rights controlled by the investing company, the small company would have no real independence and the objectives of the CVS would be subverted. For those reasons, allowing tax-advantaged share options to an individual with a large stake in the company is not the purpose of EMI.

<P>
The changes proposed are a step too far. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment in the light of my explanation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> In relation to corporate ventures, other provisions in the schedule ensure that the investor would not have control of the issuing company, even if there were an increase to 50 per cent. There could be good reasons for an investing company to want to have 50 per cent. in a deadlock with an entrepreneur when it would not want to have 30 per cent.

<P>
We will not put the amendment, which was to some extent a probing amendment, to the vote. Our view is that the higher proportion would not lead to the underlying abuses that the Government want to avoid, but we broadly share their concerns. Our motivation is to ensure that parties that might rightly participate are not excluded from doing so, either as investors in relation to corporate venturing, or as groups of co-founders. We have aired our point, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 219, in page 325, line 23, at end insert-
 `Manipulation of share price
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>46A. (1) This paragraph applies if, prior to the exercise of a qualifying option, there is an event which would have been a chargeable event within the meaning of section 78 of the Finance Act 1988 (charge where restrictions removed etc) had that qualifying option been an interest in shares for the purposes of that section.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 223, in page 325, line 23, at end insert-
 `Conversion of convertible shares
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>46B. (1) This paragraph applies if, prior to the exercise of a qualifying option, there is an event which would have been a chargeable event within the meaning of section 140D of the Taxes Act 1988 (convertible shares) had that qualifying option been an interest in shares for the purposes of that section.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) The charge to income tax which at that time would have arisen under section 140D shall arise on the exercise of the qualifying option, but for any other purposes of this Schedule there shall not be a disqualifying event in relation to that qualifying option.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Section 78 of the Finance Act 1988 contains a provision whereby shares are taxed when restrictions are lifted or rights attaching to shares are varied, which artificially inflates the value of employees' shares. A number of exemptions are designed to ensure that genuine commercial events do not trigger income tax charges on employees. Clearly, paragraph 49 of the schedule is modelled on section 78, and is designed to avoid an artificial inflation of the value of an EMI option by manipulation of the value of the underlying shares. In principle, we support that objective.

<P>
However, there is a problem in relation to paragraph 49, as it does not contain any of the employee safeguards of section 78. That is somewhat inconsistent. For example, the disqualifying event for conversion of shares in paragraph 50, which is based on that for direct shareholdings in section 140D of the Taxes Act 1988, includes the employee defences from the original. In addition, Inland Revenue consent requires disqualification of EMI options when there is a genuine commercial variation of share capital, such as the automatic lifting of restrictions on sale when a company floats or when shareholders authorise a purchase of shares. Is that the Chancellor's intention?

<P>
It is also unfair to charge the employee to tax before he has received value. To the extent that value is artificially manipulated in the option, it can be recovered when the option is exercised and the employee extracts value. The amendment creates an anti-avoidance liability on the employee, as was intended in the Bill, but collects the tax on the exercise of the EMI option, which is a more commonsense approach.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I thought that the purpose of the amendments was to prevent changes that increase the value of shares while they are under option from being disqualifying events. If there is a disqualifying event, the option will no longer qualify for EMI, and the option holders might lose valuable tax reliefs as a result. Although, under the amendments, the individual would pay some tax when the options are exercised, the generous tax reliefs provided by EMI would continue. If the amendments were accepted, it would be possible to give the employee options over shares that became much more valuable and exceeded the scheme's 100,000 limit. I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs appreciated that point.

<P>
We accept that there may be circumstances in which share capital may vary or shares may be converted for genuine commercial reasons-for example, when all shares convert prior to a company flotation. We have provided safeguards in the legislation to ensure that changes in terms of the option or the share capital of the company, which are for genuine commercial reasons, will not affect the relief. The legislation prevents misuse of EMI by artificial manipulation of share value without creating the complex tax charges proposed by the amendments. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> It would be tedious to repeat my technical points. The amendment would not, as the Economic Secretary fears, constitute a way of circumventing the 100,000 limit, even though, as we argued earlier, such a limit is silly. Its purpose is to ensure that section 78 applies as it already does in analogous cases.

<P>
I forgot to comment on amendment No. 223, which occupies the same territory. Its subject matter is the conversion of convertible shares, in relation to which it is also unfair to charge the employee to tax before value has been received.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> May I ask the hon. Gentleman why he believes that tax would be paid before an employee had received value? That puzzles me.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> That point relates to amendment No. 223. Section 140D of the Taxes Act 1988 provides for the taxation of the conversion of dummy, no-value, convertible shares into more valuable shares in terms of a capital event into employment income. Several exemptions are provided to ensure that genuine commercial events do not trigger tax charges on employees. Paragraph 15 incorporates the exemptions, but, as I said, in our view it would be inappropriate to charge employers tax before they had received the value. To the extent that there is an artificial manipulation of value in the option, it can be recovered when the option is exercised, as I suggested. We believe that schedule 14 will create such a liability for the conversion of convertible shares under the manipulation principle.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> People will pay tax on shares only when they exercise their options after the disqualifying event-that is, when they have shares to sell. They will not pay it at any other point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Is it not the case that without the two amendments a tax charge could arise?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> A tax charge will arise after a disqualifying event on the sale of the shares.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The point of both amendments, which we have been clear to establish and that we consider unclear under the Bill as drafted, is that that tax liability should not arise. We are trying to ensure that it will not arise until the shares are disposed of. In our view, under the Bill as drafted, the tax liability could arise merely as a result of the disqualifying event.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It is my understanding that the tax liability will arise only on the sale of the shares, even if that follows the disqualifying event. Tax will be paid not in advance of the exercise but on exercise. I hope that the hon. Gentleman finds that helpful.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am extremely grateful to have the Treasury's confirmation of that point. To the extent that we have doubts that that is what the present drafting means, if the Economic Secretary has placed on record that that is the intent, I rest content and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 216, in page 325, line 32, leave out ``ceasing to meet'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`not meeting for a period of more than six months'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 217, in page 325, leave out lines 43 to 45.

<P>
No. 221, in page 325, leave out lines 46 and 47.

<P>
No. 218, in page 326, leave out from line 29 to line 7 on page 327.

<P>
No. 222, in page 327, leave out lines 8 to 25.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> These amendments relate to disqualification. Amendment No. 216 relates to the fact that the consequences of the disqualification that will follow if one of the tests is accidentally and perhaps transiently met could be draconian. We feel that an adequate period of grace should be provided to allow amendment, and we propose a six-month period.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 217, 221, 218 and 222 relate to the same territory but on a slightly different front. They would make it a requirement that any alteration of the share capital without prior Revenue approval would disqualify the scheme, and they would remove the automatic disqualification that will occur on the conversion of shares.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I crave your indulgence for a moment, Mr. Cook. I am not sure whether in response to the previous amendment I said that the point at which tax will be paid is the sale of the shares. In fact, tax will be paid on the exercising of the option on the shares. I want to ensure that the record is entirely straight. I am happy to discuss the matter with the hon. Gentleman at some other point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> That is precisely what we object to. If tax must be paid on the exercising of the option, one will receive a tax bill before one has any money to pay it.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> One does not have to exercise the option. That is why it is an option.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are tending to re-discuss issues with which we have disposed. May we return to the amendment?

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful for your indulgence on that matter, Mr. Cook.

<P>
EMI has been targeted at smaller, high-risk trading companies to ensure that the relief is directed towards businesses that need help recruiting and retaining key employees. The legislation identifies the companies most deserving of EMI assistance and includes provisions to disqualify companies if they cease to need assistance.

<P>
Amendment No. 216 would allow a company to carry on non-qualifying activities for periods of up to six months without losing qualification for EMI. The current legislation allows a company to move between EMI qualifying trades, but not to move from a trade that qualifies into one that does not without the loss of qualification. That is simple and wholly consistent with the targeting of the relief.

<P>
The amendment would allow a company to spend as much time carrying out less risky activities as carrying out the higher-risk activities at which EMI is aimed, without the loss of the tax advantages of EMI status. That returns us to the fact that the provision is aimed at risk taking.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 217, 218, 221 and 222 would all remove provisions that prevent the company shares from being artificially increased in value. The current legislation would not prevent the relief from continuing in the event of genuine commercial alterations to the shares under option or the share capital of the company that do not inflate the value of the shares under option.

<P>
If the amendments were accepted, tax relief would be allowed inappropriately for that artificially added value. That would not be a fitting purpose for the tax relief. In effect, it would create a tax avoider's charter to benefit those who have no interest in helping small companies to grow, but who are interested only in enriching themselves at the taxpayer's expense. I am sure that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs would not want that to happen.

<P>
The amendments would remove safeguards designed to ensure that EMI is targeted where it is most needed, and therefore to prevent tax relief on artificial increases in share value. I therefore invite the Committee to reject them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am intrigued by the Economic Secretary's phrase about artificial increases in share value. Given the nature of the companies, we would not be talking about ones that were publicly quoted on any of the various markets. If an internal market for the shares were created by, for example, some sort of employee share-owning trust, the Inland Revenue would probably need to involve itself in the annual determination of the values of those shares, to entirely satisfy the question whether a proper valuation had been determined.

<P>
Is the Economic Secretary suggesting that, in her judgment, there is some laxness in the process that would enable artificial and incorrect valuations to be determined by the Department that she represents? It is important that she clarifies what she means.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I said that we would be concerned about company shares being artificially increased in value, and not having provision for it. The return to the employee under EMI will come from the increase in the share value. No one would want there to be an artificially created increase, as it would mean that no benefit would accrue to the company or that there was no legitimate reason why an employee should benefit. The legislation must ensure that genuine commercial alterations alone are at issue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am a little lost. I am not clear about the artificial valuation mentioned by the Economic Secretary. As always, I am anxious to get clear definitions on record for those who read about our proceedings. She implied that external financial manipulation of the company's affairs might occur and that that external activity, not the trading activities, might increase the value of the shares. I am groping for an understanding of what that activity might be. Will she tell us by what route or loophole she believes the activity might carry on? She has made the point that the scheme will encourage the establishment and development of small-scale, high-risk, innovative companies. We also know from our debates that the people involved in the scheme will be those who invest their time and talent to achieve the objective that she has set out. Under previous amendments, when we considered enterprises that would be disqualified, we tried to rule out areas of artificial financial manipulation and to concentrate on real added value through intellectual input by such people. Where does the artificiality lie in the process? Where would it come from and how would it enhance the value of the shares?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I referred not to artificial valuation but to artificial increases in value arising from internal changes to the shares that bear no relation to the company's external or real value. That is what gives us cause for concern.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Economic Secretary responds like a doctor who describes the symptoms without giving the cause of the problem.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The value of the shares might be artificially inflated by deliberately changing the rights of shareholders to benefit from the income or assets of a company, for example.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am not entirely persuaded by that line of argument. Some external injection of capital into the company within the boundaries set by the Bill, might have an effect on the share value. However, we are discussing embryo companies and it is not clear how that artificiality might be created in that context. The Economic Secretary's response has not satisfied me. If it is a technical matter, she might give an undertaking to write to me and explain it more fully, to save time at this stage.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have already given the right hon. Gentleman an example. Companies can increase the share value by changing the rights attached either to shares under option, or to other shares, or by converting shares to another class. Small companies as well as large can act in that way and, if they do, there will be a disqualifying event. Preference shareholders can have 1 per cent. of the equity and receive 99 per cent. of the dividends. Those are examples of the activities about which we are concerned, with which I am sure the right hon. Gentleman is familiar.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Our key amendment in this group is amendment No. 216, which-sensibly, given that small companies may be involved-calls for a period of grace in which to amend things that might have been done incorrectly. We should remember that we are discussing key employees who may suddenly find, as a result of someone else's mistake, that their EMI tax-privileged options have basically been blown. We understand the Government's anti-avoidance concerns, but simply to disqualify as soon as there is a change in the share capital seems stupid. There may easily be changes arising from, for example, the subscription of new moneys and the need to develop the business.
