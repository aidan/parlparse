<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``.--Within one year of this Act coming into force, the Low Pay Commission shall make an evaluation of the impact of any national minimum wage determined by regulations made under section 2 of this Act, as it affects workers covered by the relevant Agricultural Wages Order for each territory of the United Kingdom, and shall make a report thereon to the Secretary of State.''.--[Mr. Boswell.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 258, in Schedule 2, page 35, leave out lines 16 and 17.
<P>
No. 259, in Schedule 2, page 35, leave out lines 40 to 48.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The purpose of the new clause is to trigger a debate on the agricultural wages orders and enable us to voice our specific concerns. The new clause would require the Low Pay Commission to report after one year on the operation of the national minimum wage in the agriculture industry and in particular to produce a territorial report tailored to the various parts of the United Kingdom.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 258 and 259 are clearly probing amendments. We are deep into schedule territory and it is not always easy to unpick the Government's intentions, although they are helpfully set out in the notes on clauses.
<P>
I shall break down into two parts the analysis of the new clause. The first concerns the likely macro impacts of a national minimum wage being introduced into agriculture in parallel with the existing and continuing agricultural wages orders. The second relates to the continued operation of the agricultural wages board and how it will co-exist with a national minimum wage.
<P>
The new clause has given me an opportunity to study in more depth the National Farmers Union evidence submitted to the Low Pay Commission. I hope that the commission will carefully weigh that evidence in its considerations, as I hope the Government did in formulating their own evidence to the commission.
<P>
The National Farmers Union evidence confirms my knowledge of the industry, which is if nothing else based on long experience as it dates back not to when the first agricultural wages order was made in 1948 but to the early 1960s, when the agricultural minimum wage was first modified to take account of craft status. The evidence brings home more clearly than I would hope to be able to do the distinctions within agriculture and the likely impacts of the minimum wage on its different sectors and interests.
<P>
Agriculture is not a straightforward industry. Many parts, such as those that I mentioned earlier in our proceedings, are highly capitalised, highly skilled and rely on a small labour force that is satisfactorily paid even in comparison with industrial wages. That is not the issue here, except in so far as it relates to the future of the board, to which I shall return.
<P>
The NFU's concern is about those at the lower end of the wage scale such as casual workers, for whom a separate rate is prescribed by the agricultural wages orders, particularly in horticulture, which is a major employer of casual workers. It is difficult to find exact figures because the labour force survey is not undertaken in June when casual employment is at its peak. In round terms--the NFU believes this to be an under-estimate--some 70,000 workers are employed as casuals.
<P>
The distribution of casual workers in horticulture as against other sectors is difficult to estimate, but there may be 25,000 to 30,000 at any one time. We should bear in mind that total employment in horticulture is upwards of 50,000--it is typically the most labour-intensive sector of agriculture.
<P>
We should also make the point, as the NFU does in its evidence, that many of the casual workers who are employed in other areas, such as livestock, have significant responsibilities; they may, for example, be relief stock persons and are probably quite skilled. In horticulture, however, one typically still finds gangs and people with manual skills; such people are generally not highly skilled and do intensive seasonal work.
<P>
One interesting point needs to be made clear in relation to the agricultural wages order. We have debated continuity of employment periods. The order clearly specifies, however, that employment should not run for more than 20 weeks continuously. In other words, there is no question of quasi-permanent employment being dressed up as casual employment. The order is designed to fit--in so far as any order can--a seasonal production pattern.
<P>
The other points that I should make--perhaps more clearly than I have done so far--concern the sharp break between different rates. I have already mentioned that the order prescribes a minimum basic full-time agricultural wages rate of &#163;4.12 an hour. The casual rate, however, is &#163;3.06 an hour for a person of 19 or over. There is also a sharp differentiation by age, and the rate goes down at the age of 16 to a minimum of &#163;1.84 an hour. The NFU understandably uses that to argue for the importance of a separate youth rate--not just for agriculture, but across industry generally.
<P>
To summarise the general pattern, there is a two-nation agriculture. We are not talking only about skills, but about the nature of the job and whether it is mechanisable. We must consider two different situations. On the one hand, there is the highly capitalised set-up that typically offers full-time employment and employs two or three people on 1,000 acres or with a dairy herd. Such a set-up has a higher output per unit of employment. Although it offers mainly full-time employment, that may be supplemented by casual work--at harvest time, for example. Work at such an establishment is fairly highly paid and rates are in the range of &#163;4 to &#163;5 an hour or even higher for skilled grades. On the other hand, there is the significant number of employees who are paid between &#163;3 to &#163;5. It is difficult to be sure exactly how many such employees there are; there might be 25,000 or 30,000 at any one time, although not necessarily the same 25,000 or 30,000 because people enter and leave employment. Quite a number of those people will be paid at rates that are towards the lower part of the pay range.
<P>
I do not intend to summarise the whole of the NFU's evidence to the commission, but it is important to pick out one or two points that reinforce my argument. The first is exactly consistent with what I have said. The NFU's evidence states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The use of casual workers is spread across the industry but is particularly concentrated in the horticultural sector where growers use a large amount of casual workers and are extremely vulnerable to increases in labour costs.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The evidence refers to the fact that labour can amount to 50 per cent. of overall costs. It goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Given this we would like to stress to the Commission as strongly as possible that any NMW set at a level higher than &#163;3.20 per hour could have drastic effects upon the agricultural and horticultural industries and lead to a significant loss of employment. It is important to appreciate that in many horticultural businesses the existence of full-time and part-time jobs often relies upon the employment of casual workers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps I did not make that necessary qualification clearly enough.
<P>
The NFU points out that employment, particularly that of casuals, is extremely sensitive to rates. It estimates the potential direct cost to the industry of setting the national minimum wage at various levels: &#163;4.40, which is within the ball park of half national male median adult earnings, would cost &#163;202 million, which would affect full-time, part-time and casual workers; &#163;4 would cost considerably less--&#163;93 million--and affect only casual workers directly, as would any lower rate; &#163;3.50 would cost &#163;43 million; &#163;3.20 would cost &#163;14 million. The cost escalates sharply as the rate moves up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Does my hon. Friend accept that those figures do not allow for restoration of differentials between casual and permanent workers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Precisely so. I was coming to exactly that point. The next sentence of the NFU evidence states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Not only do these figures not take into account the restoration of differentials, they do not take into account the impact of other employment costs such as national insurance and pension contributions either.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The NFU concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Restoration of differentials will have a significant impact on costs.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are matters of concern.
<P>
Another point is relevant to how casual employment is carried out in the industry. I am not a significant employer of casual labour, but I used to run a fruit enterprise and employed a significant number of seasonal labourers. The NFU evidence points out:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``With some groups of pickers who come and go as they please (often for good reasons such as seeing children to school) it is very hard to know how many hours are worked by any individual.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	New pickers are given the option of one or two days' work at the hourly rate while they acquire the skills, the amount they pick is recorded . . . if they don't look like making it, the company usually agree that that job is not going to be for them. Earnings for the lower 10 per cent. of some of the weekly paid and engaged pickers do sometimes drop below the AWB rate but usually the next day comfortably exceeds it so the weekly average is maintained.''
<P>
That point is germane to pay reference periods, which I shall discuss later.
<P>
Casual employment in horticulture and the calculation of the hourly rate equivalent will cause difficulties within agriculture. I am not making a special case for agriculture: my hon. Friends and I have already argued that the severe problems with that type of employment are not confined to farming, although it is a sensitive sector. If the new clause is not agreed to, the Low Pay Commission will not be able to test the impacts of the minimum wage. Strategic business decisions may severely curtail, if not wipe out, horticultural employment.
<P>
In best business school fashion, the NFU derives from an extended case study the strategic business decisions that would appear likely following the introduction of a national minimum wage rate above current agricultural minimum levels. It suggests what might happen:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Increase productivity of overall workforce--most likely achieved by reducing workforce and retaining only the more productive workers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	Reducing the size of labour intensive horticultural enterprises and increasing the amount of land used for arable crops. This would lead not only to a significant drop in employment in the business, but to more general loss of economic activity and to increased imports of high value fruit and vegetables.''
<P>
I can confirm that from my own experience. When plums were harvested in my orchard of 10 acres--or four hectares--grain was harvested on the rest of the farm on an acreage that was 10 or 20 times larger, but which involved less employment than the intensive harvesting of horticultural crops in the orchard.
<P>
I am sure, Mrs. Dunwoody, that you share my distaste for French Golden Delicious. If English apples, pears, soft fruit or other English fruit were not available, everybody would feel the loss, whether or not they were employed in agriculture.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Opposition are anxious about those issues, and it would be helpful for the Commission to consider them in the light of events. We hope that, if the national minimum wage is set at a moderate level, growers and horticulturalists will be able to plan their strategies sensibly, and will manage the situation. That may well happen and, if the Low Pay Commission proves that it has happened, no one would be more pleased than me. I am not interested in unnecessarily low wages, and I am anxious for wages to be earned and increased appropriately. Hon. Members should, however, consider the consequences, and not stumble blindly into them.
<P>
The second issue raised by the proposed new clause is the relationship with the board. It would not be within the Committee's remit to debate the desirability of continuing the agricultural wages order, or to draw a final conclusion about the matter, which should be examined partly in the light of experience. The Ministers have reminded the Committee that the order will be due for review in 1999. Presumably, hon. Members will then have some experience of the operation of the national minimum wage.
<P>
I have warned Ministers that, if the board continues, it is important for agriculture that it is administrated together with the order as cleanly as possible, so that rates are not altered every couple of months like a yo-yo, as one and then the other is changed. That would be a recipe for mistakes, and I am sure that Ministers will take that point on board.
<P>
I said that I have no permanent vested interest in the continuation of the board against the wishes of agriculture. It should be emphasised that, even if the two systems mesh in terms of the lower rates, there are important differences. I hope that the Ministers will comment on the matter when I come to the amendments that I have tabled. It would not be right to be a tidy mind and to say that, because one structure is in place, the other should be dropped.
<P>
I shall make two points about the matter that will give the Committee a sense of the sublime as well as the ridiculous, and which relate to actual situations. The Agricultural Wages Board has extended its wings during some years. It has moved from being the setter or protector of a minimum return to all farm workers to being concerned with the wider concept of professional development and with the acknowledgement of such development within agriculture.
<P>
That change originated with proficiency tests, which are still part of the order. If an employee passes such a test, perhaps because an employer has required it, he or she may receive a higher rate of pay. That higher rate can be defended through various craft and appointment grades, and through the acknowledgement that is now available of national vocational qualifications and so on.
<P>
I believe that no fewer than 10 minimum rates exist. I do not wish the Minister to say that he wants 10 national minimum wage rates for national vocational qualifications of otherwise, but the solution is agricultural, and is for the agricultural industry. Whatever happens at the bottom--and I have been emphasising that because where the two systems meet, potential difficulty arises--there may be a role, if the industry wants it, for a wider cover such as an agricultural wages board.
<P>
There is another aspect to this: it may sound ridiculous, but it relates to real situations. Many people, as I have in the past, employ shepherds who are required to keep dogs for livestock tending. There is a provision in the order that people required by their employer to keep a dog can be paid &#163;4.65 a week for the dog. We do not have a national minimum wage, but we have a dog's minimum wage. These matters relate to a particular industry. Apart from their rather colourful impact--I speak as a Tory here--we should at least consider whether we should lightly throw away these colourful provisions.
<P>
Just because there is a meshing at the bottom does not mean that there needs to be monkeying about at the top. There is a separate Ministry which will continue to have responsibility for the orders. It will be answerable to the collective opinion of the agriculture industry. I hope that it will listen to the industry carefully, without being either unduly conservative and refusing to make changes--some administrative changes will be required for the two systems to harmonise--or too tidy minded, wiping things out simply because they appear different. The jobs are somewhat different.
<P>
Amendment No. 258 refers to the strange provision that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any reference to a pay reference period shall be disregarded.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The provision is contained in the enforcement powers in new section 3, outlined in schedule 2. As I understand it, the schedule is effectively taking over the enforcement powers of the Agricultural Wages Board in respect of minimum national wage rates and vesting them in the new machinery of the Bill. I am a little puzzled at the provision. I know that life was slightly different in 1948, and no doubt people living in the countryside are more disposed to informality and accepting the equity of a situation without worrying about the small print.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> You were a toddler.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend perceptively says, ``You were a toddler.'' He may have been referring to you, too, Mrs. Dunwoody. It was certainly a few years back--I was not quite as au fait with things then as I am now.
<P>
There seems to be no precise analysis in the Agricultural Wages Order of a pay reference period. That may be why new section 3A introduces a new enforcement provision stating that any reference to a pay reference period should be disregarded. We have flogged to death the point that the pay reference period is very important. The question of relevant remuneration will be critical if people are paid even in kind by the boxes of tomatoes that they are allowed to take away. It is important to get that right, so that farmers and agriculturalists acting in good faith are not caught out by an over-rigid provision that does not meet the reality.
<P>
Amendment No. 259 relates to new section 5 outlined in schedule 2. I am not sure whether this is the right place to debate briefly incapacity permits. I have a feeling that the Minister will want to speak to the issue when debating Government amendments. As the amendments in my name have been grouped and selected here, I should like to speak to them here; the Minister can reflect on my remarks and respond here or later, whichever is the more convenient.
<P>
I touched on the issue briefly on Thursday--we were catching breath at the time. The model and the thinking behind the Labour legislation of 1948 is at least worth pausing on in relation to the sensitive subject of incapacity.
<P>
I remind the Committee that we are not talking--nor have we been talking, as my hon, Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) said eloquently in relation to therapeutic earnings--about a tip-and-run raid on the concept of paying disabled workers. That is not the purpose of incapacity permits. They are a way of dealing with certain special cases where people who have been hale and hearty and able to do a full day's work--indeed, they might have been major contributors to the economy of the farm or farming business--become disabled, but still want to work. Farming is not doing very well at the moment, and the employer, while not wanting to get rid of them, may not be able to find a job for them at the money applicable under the agricultural wages order. There is a special provision in section 5 of the Agricultural Wages Act 1948 for such persons to apply to the Agricultural Wages Board in their locality for a disabled permit.
<P>
I emphasise that that is a minority situation. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food estimated in a recent written answer that in June last year, some 170,000 workers in England and Wales were covered by the agricultural wages order. The number of workers known generically to have a disability is not clear--although I presume that it is a significant number--but the number who are incapacitated is known, because at the latest convenient date only 102 permits were in force. That is a tiny proportion of the total. The permits are confined under the Agricultural Wages Act 1948 to a person
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``so affected by any physical injury or mental deficiency, or any infirmity due to age or to any other cause, that he is incapable of earning''
<P>
</UL></FONT>the agricultural minimum rate.
<P>
The Minister need not respond immediately to that. There are people in industries other than agriculture who cannot hold down a job at the national minimum rate; this is a different case from the general pressures that might apply in certain industries when the rate has been set, at whatever level. In human terms, we would want such people to continue to be able to work, even if their work was of limited economic value.
<P>
I commend to the Minister the concept of that system. It may be over-bureaucratic and not well known--I had never come across it before--but at least the concept is worth considering. Such a system need not be self-certifying, so the employer could make it up or stand over the employee and make him sign something, but there could be some test whereby people who have economically disabling incapacities can continue to work at a lower rate.
<P>
I understand from the notes on clauses that the enforcement provisions, which the amendment would exclude, mean that all those permits, insofar as they produced a rate which was below the national minimum wage, would be effectively nullified or adjusted to that rate. I am concerned that that might mean people leaving employment altogether. Although that would not affect the industry's overall strength, it would be a human tragedy for some.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I understand the logic of what my hon. Friend is saying. Will he confirm that the people for whom he suggests a differential rate because of their lack of capacity would, in any case, be compensated by benefits for their disability, so the likelihood of them suffering and being worse off is minimal and perhaps non-existent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. Ministers will not want me to point out that that is the situation under the present structure of disability benefits, but what may result from the Government's review is a matter for speculation. Those workers might be able to claim benefits, and if they did, that would benefit the Chancellor rather than themselves. They would be the losers because they would effectively be disqualified from the labour market. I hope that Ministers will consider that point on its merits.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I return to the general thrust of my argument, which is that agriculture is a special industry, although perhaps less so than in the past, in that it has a minimum wage structure tailored to it. A new national minimum wage structure, which will effectively chop that off at the knee while leaving in place the super-structure, may or may not work. Much will depend on the sensitivity with which the minimum rate is struck, but it would in any event be wise to require the Low Pay Commission, whose future, role we shall debate in a moment, to look long and hard at the industry, find out whether the minimum wage is working and how it meshes with the review of the agricultural wages order, which will be occurring almost simultaneously, and try to produce a workable system which has regard to the industry's special situation and does not damage it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The purpose of the new clause is to focus attention on the impact that the Bill will have on agriculture. Every member of the Committee is aware that the sector is under intense pressure and that profitability and earnings have fallen dramatically over the past few years. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) has already given the Committee figures concerning the estimated impact of a minimum wage set at various levels on the costs in that sector.
<P>
I cannot claim to be an expert on agricultural matters like my hon. Friend and my constituency would not be instantly recognised as an agricultural area, but it has a number of successful horticultural businesses. That sector expects to be particularly affected by the Bill because of its relatively high labour intensity and the high proportion of casual workers it employees.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry was a little modest in saying that he was not seeking to make a special case for agriculture. I accept that many other industries will feel that their profitability is under attack and expect to be adversely affected by the minimum wage. However, the agricultural sector is special because it already has a statutory regime for setting minimum wage levels. The Bill will impose the full burden of the national minimum wage in addition to the existing regime.
<P>
The new clause would require the commission to focus on the Bill's effect on agriculture and its interaction with the agricultural wages boards. I understand from people in the industry that the boards have, by and large, been regarded as a successful innovation--if, after 50 years, they can be called an innovation. I wonder why Ministers, in framing the Bill, did not carefully consider the only example of statutory minimum wage legislation that we have in the United Kingdom to see why it had been successful. What features have made it work and allowed it to be accepted on both sides of industry?
<P>
Two provisions leap off the page. First, agricultural wages boards can set different rates for full-time permanent employees and casual employees and for employees with different levels of skill. The starting level for full-time employees is &#163;4.12 and there is a series of rates above that for employees with different skills. There is flexibility in the system, but the Government have specifically rejected it for industry in general under the terms of the Bill. I wonder why they have chosen to ignore the positive lesson of the success of the agricultural wages boards.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry also mentioned the disability exemption certificates that are available under the agricultural wages legislation. The Bill will put a floor under wages for people who hold such certificates, which will effectively make them subject to the same regime as every other worker. The Minister has responded constructively to comments about the problems that the disabled face in relation to the minimum wage. Rather than imposing the rigid national minimum wage structure on disabled people who hold certificates in the agricultural sector, therefore, will he consider the operation of those certificates to discover whether the same model could be applied across the wider economy? In that way, we might resolve what my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry called the potential human tragedy of pricing severely disabled people out of work.
<P>
I want now to deal specifically with the concerns of the horticultural sector and to relate to them to new clause 10, which proposes a report on the Bill's impact on the agricultural sector. That sector employs many casual workers, who are paid at a minimum rate of &#163;3.06 an hour. Typically, many of those people will be paid piece-work rates and might earn significantly more. Their rate of productivity will, however, be affected by many factors, including the vagaries of the weather. The critical factor for the employer is the fall-back rate that he might be required to pay if the picker's productivity falls below a certain level.
<P>
The industry is exceptionally sensitive to labour costs--my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said that more than 50 per cent. of its costs are labour costs. It is also extremely vulnerable to imports. Every day, a specialist producer in my constituency finds that he is competing with Dutch producers in the spot market for his product. His product will not keep and is planted specifically to be harvested on a given day--the range of options is narrow and covers only two or three days. My constituent picks his product and takes it to market, and his price is dictated by the offering price of Dutch importers on that day. His company has sometimes seen prices fluctuate by as much as 30 per cent. in the space of a week or two.
<P>
Such producers have been severely affected by the strength of the pound over the past year. That is particularly important when viewed against the relative weakness of the Dutch guilder--one of the primary competitors for much horticultural produce is the Netherlands. Will the Minister reflect on the particular vulnerability of the horticultural sector, which produces low-volume, high-value products that can be easily imported by air over short and sometimes long distances? Will he consider the situation that producers who are essentially price takers in the marketplace will face if the minimum wage takes the form that is currently proposed?
<P>
The agriculture sector, uniquely across industry and employment, will face double jeopardy--dual rates imposed by statute. The floor set by the national minimum wage rate is likely to be higher than the current agricultural minimum wage for casual workers, but the rate for full-time workers will probably be higher still. Full-time workers will press for restoration of the differential between casual and full-time rates--the dual rates set by the agricultural wages councils--which has been enshrined in legislation.
<P>
There is no logical reason to impose on employers in what is perhaps one of our most vulnerable industries a regime that will be ``harsher'' than that faced by employers in than any other sector. They will face not the universal national minimum wage of which the Minister is so proud and for which he is so anxious to repeat the need, but two minimum wage levels--a minimum and a higher minimum for workers who currently receive the full-time permanent rate.
<P>
Agricultural will be discriminated against under the proposed regime of agricultural wages boards rates plus the national minimum wage. In light of that, there is a strong argument for focusing on the effect of the combined regimes on the agricultural sector. For that reason, I support the new clause proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry.

<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> New clause 10 and the amendments relate to the interface between the Bill and agricultural wages legislation. We discussed clauses 43 and 44 during the Committee's 14th sitting. My hon. Friend the Minister of State explained the key principles for applying the national minimum wage to the agricultural sector: first, the minimum wage should apply in this sector as it does in others; secondly--this is vital to our debate--we should not make wholesale changes to the agricultural wages regimes in England and Wales, in Scotland and in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The new clause and, in particular, the two amendments focus on the detail of how the two systems will work alongside each other, as the hon. Member for Daventry said. That is also the subject of schedule 2. The new clause would require the Low Pay Commission to evaluate the impact of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any national minimum wage determined by regulations made under section 2 of this Act, as it affects workers covered by the relevant Agricultural Wages Order for each territory of the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am happy to deal with the spirit of the new clause, which I take to cover the level of the minimum wage, and the calculation of the rate of remuneration.
<P>
The orders referred to are provided for by the primary legislation for England and Wales, for Scotland and for Northern Ireland which gives the Agricultural Wages Board for England and Wales, and its counterparts in Scotland and in Northern Ireland, the power to make orders fixing, among other things, minimum wage rates.
<P>
I accept that the new clause and the amendments may be probing, but the new clause would have unacceptable effects. It is over-prescriptive and would pre-empt the discretion of the Secretary of State to determine the timing and nature of any referral to the statutory Low Pay Commission. It is not impossible that the Secretary of State may wish the Low Pay Commission to consider agricultural issues at some future time. After all, the Government's evidence to the commission includes a discussion of the agricultural sector. However, it would be unnecessarily restrictive to require any such consideration within the arbitrary period of one year. Also a review by the Low Pay Commission after 12 months would in any case pre-empt the planned 1999 review of agricultural wages boards. That review was again referred to by the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We believe that the planned review will come at a convenient time. The Agricultural Wages Board, like all other non-departmental public bodies, is subject to regular five-yearly reviews. It was last reviewed in 1993, and the then Government concluded that it should be retained. Two Conservative Front-Bench Members were members of the previous Government who decided that that should go ahead, and conceded the principle of having a minimum pay rate, at least in that sector.
<P>
The next review would in the normal way be due this year, but the Government have decided to postpone it until late 1999, precisely to take account of the introduction of the national minimum wage. There will be a full consultation, and views will be requested on the way in which the two systems operate together. I hope that that will meet some of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Daventry about how the systems will mesh together. There will be time for that to take place.
<P>
There could be a role for the statutory Low Pay Commission in that review, if appointed under clause 8(9). But that need not and should not be decided now, as new clause 10 would require. The Secretary of State has the power, under clause 6, to refer any matters to a statutory commission if appointed, and no doubt we shall consider that possibility nearer the time of the general review.
<P>
It is important to get things right in applying the national minimum wage in agriculture and in looking at the future role of the agricultural wages legislation. However, it is too early to speculate about what role a statutory commission might have in the process, and unnecessary to do so.
<P>
I hope that I have said enough to convince the hon. Member for Daventry that new clause 10 is unnecessary. If, however, the hon. Gentleman wishes to press it to a Division, I shall ask the Committee to reject it.
<P>
As I said at the beginning, of my remarks, I sense that amendments Nos. 258 and 259 are probing in nature. I apologise for taking up a little of the Committee's time, but it might be convenient if I give some background details.
<P>
Amendment No. 258 would affect paragraph 3 of schedule 2, which inserts a new section 3A after section 3 of the existing Agricultural Wages Act 1948 relating to enforcement. In practice--and this is exactly what the hon. Gentleman outlined--new section 3A transfers the enforcement provisions of the Bill into the agricultural sector so that they can be used to enforce agricultural minimum pay rates as well as the national minimum wage in that sector. That includes all the main enforcement rights and powers on, for example, record keeping, enforcement officers and their powers, the enforcement of the right to a minimum wage, the right not to suffer detriment, reversal of the burden of proof, offences, liability of superior employers and restrictions on contracting out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister may not be able to respond to this straight away, but she said that the whole enforcement procedure would be injected into the agricultural wages provisions. If so, is she saying in effect, that any other officers appointed by the Secretary of State would not be able to involve themselves in allegations of underpayment, detriment or otherwise in connection with proceedings and that, for example, the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service would not be available to resolve any dispute? I hope that that is not the case.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, I am not saying that. I thank the hon. Gentleman for enabling me to clarify the matter. By doing that, we not only ensure that the same enforcement measures apply across the board for the national minimum wage, but we also ensure consistency with and within the agricultural sector, so that farmers and farm workers have only one set of enforcement measures to deal with.
<P>
Amendment No. 258 would delete new subsection 3A(3)(f). It is a specific amendment, but it is important to put it into the context of the overall framework. Subsection 3A(3)(f) makes it clear that in applying the Bill to the Agricultural Wages Act 1948, any reference to a pay reference period is to be disregarded. The reason for that is that pay reference periods do not feature in the 1948 Act.
<P>
I do not want to open up the debate on pay reference periods again and thus incur your displeasure, Mrs. Dunwoody, but we have had more experience of pay legislation since the 1948 Act. The notion of a pay reference period makes it possible, in agriculture as elsewhere, to average out the earnings of workers who are employed on an irregular basis. That contrasts with the approach of the agricultural wages legislation, which focused on minimum rates for each hour worked or for each piece of work completed, with no averaging out. Rather than introducing the notion of a pay reference period into the agricultural wages legislation, we are simply leaving the two systems to operate side by side for the time being. I hope that that assists the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
The Bill does not try to introduce the notion of a pay reference period beyond the application of the minimum wage floor in agriculture. Therefore, the provision that the amendment would delete is necessary to avoid confusion about the meaning of a notion that does not exist in agricultural wages legislation. We would simply be importing a concept from today into legislation of 1948, when it did not exist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am trying to follow this complex point. Is the Minister saying that if there is a possibility of underpayment in agricultural employment, which is assessed against compliance with the national minimum wage but under the agricultural wages order, a pay reference period will be calculable for that purpose and only that purpose? Otherwise, it would not be calculated on the same basis as for any other employee who was not covered by the agricultural wages order.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Two systems will run side by side. One uses a pay reference period, the other does not. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would delete a provision to disregard any reference to a pay reference period. We do not want such a reference there. The hon. Gentleman is trying to import pay reference periods into the 1948 Act, which is inconsistent with the rest of that Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The argument is complex but, if I am following it, it suggests that there will be a pay reference period for casual workers who are likely to be paid at the minimum wage, but not one for full-time permanent workers who, according to present evidence, will be paid more than the minimum wage. Two different regimes will exist.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No. I am advancing quite a narrow argument. I appreciate the difficulties of understanding the point. It is narrow, and I am trying to deal with the effect that the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Daventry would have.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will excuse me if I repeat myself. Two separate systems will operate alongside one another. The Government are seeking to put the enforcement powers of a section of the minimum wage legislation into agricultural wages legislation. The Government do not want to include the reference to the pay reference period, as the amendment seeks to do. The Government contend that to do so would confuse the picture and make it more complex, because the legislation would not refer to pay reference periods.
<P>
I hope that my explanation, although rather detailed, will persuade the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment. If it does not, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment because it would lead to the very complexities that the hon. Gentleman seeks to avoid.
<P>
I shall now deal with amendment No. 259. I should first make it clear what section 5 does not do. A first reading might suggest that the section means that agricultural permits for incapacitated persons--that term has a precise meaning under agricultural wages legislation, which is why I shall use it--may prescribe a rate lower than the national minimum wage, or at least prescribe that an employer may not be prosecuted for paying an incapacitated agricultural worker at a rate below the national minimum wage.
<P>
The Bill in fact requires the opposite. Everybody will be entitled to the national minimum wage. Therefore, unless a general exemption from the national minimum wage is made or a different rate is set using powers under clauses 4 and 3 of the Bill, permits for incapacitated persons will not be able to prescribe a rate lower than the national minimum wage, although the permit rate may be lower than the relevant agricultural minimum rate. The practical effect is that any agricultural worker who is currently covered by an incapacity permit will be entitled to the national minimum wage unless a general exemption is created for incapacitated persons, or a different rate is set for them.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Daventry said, the matter concerns a very small numbers of people. I understand that there are about 100 such incapacitated agricultural workers--or perhaps just more than that, as the hon. Gentleman suggested--in England and Wales, and that there are half a dozen or so in Scotland. The provision is very specific.
<P>
Amendment No. 259 would delete paragraph 5 in schedule 2. The paragraph makes an amendment to the provisions of the Agricultural Wages Act 1948 which deal with the ability of agricultural wages committees to grant permits of exemption to incapacitated persons. Such permits exempt the workers in question from the provisions requiring payment of an agricultural minimum rate.
<P>
When a permit is granted, the employer is not liable to prosecution for failure to pay the minimum agricultural rate. The hon. Member for Daventry will be well aware of how that occurs in practice. Currently, the prosecution would occur under the enforcement provisions of the Agricultural Wages Act 1948. The Bill's enforcement provisions will be transferred into the Agricultural Wages Act 1948 and implemented according to the purposes of that Act. The provision that the amendment seeks to delete is, therefore, simply consequential to the Agricultural Wages Act.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The effect of that provision is that, when an agricultural permit is granted for an incapacitated person to be paid less than the agricultural minimum rate, the employer is safeguarded against proceedings under the Bill's enforcement provisions as they apply for the purpose of enforcing the agricultural minimum wage. The Government are trying to assist employers and industry in the provisions. The employer must comply with the conditions of the permit which could specify a different agricultural rate.
<P>
The effect of the amendment, like that of amendment No. 258, would be to reduce clarity regarding the way in which the Bill and agricultural wages legislation will operate side by side. I apologise again, Mrs. Dunwoody, for the length of my remarks, but it was important to explain those complexities, which, despite seeming narrow, are important for the industry.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry tabled the amendments to probe the Government and seek clarification. I hope that I have provided that clarification and that he will withdraw them. If not, I ask the Committee to reject them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I find myself in the position of the person who went to a conference to seek enlightenment and upon his return said to the friend who had recommended his attendance that he was still confused but at a somewhat higher level. The Minister adopted a reasonable tone and has been trying to help us and I am sorry that I must revert to my rustic mode and say that I am finding it a little difficult to follow her argument.
<P>
I am still perplexed as to how it is possible to enforce a national minimum wage--whether or not the mechanism of the agricultural wages order is used--if there is no pay reference period, without which we would not know whether the national minimum wage was being paid. I think the Minister may be saying that the pay reference period is to be disregarded because the calculation of compliance with the national minimum wage is divorced from the enforcement procedures.
<P>
On amendment No. 259, the Minister said that she was being helpful to the agriculture industry because she would provide for the disapplication of the agricultural wages order where there was a permit, but the permit's effect would virtually be removed because the Bill would require a minimum to be paid even to permit holders. We may need to reflect carefully on her remarks. Perhaps she will look again at the exchanges to find out whether we have between us understood what is proposed and succeeded in carrying it through into legislation.
<P>
I do not want to make a meal of this or put amendments Nos. 258 and 259 to a vote, but we are in danger of having a debate about Hamlet without the prince, which in this matter is the general economic effect and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge eloquently said, the particular impact on differentials. As my hon. Friend said, it is difficult to have an agricultural wages schedule that deals with employment ranging from the lowest skilled through varying degrees of craft to that with a substantial pay rate and then superimpose on that a minimum rate that will knock off the lower end of that scale. That will immediately pose challenges up the scale as to whether the rates that have been set with reference to the economic conditions of the industry are to be adjusted to take account of the national minimum wage.
<P>
We must reflect. The Minister helpfully clarified the position over the review. I dare say that the agriculture industry will take comfort from the fact that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will take the lead, albeit with the Low Pay Commission having an input if the Secretary of State so wishes. That is the right way to proceed. We have no prescription for how the review should shake out, but the minimum wage will have real effects on agriculture.
<P>
The Minister said that she should not have her hands tied by an early review, although she helpfully said that one might be possible. However, we should tie her hands so that the matter can be studied more intensively. With no malice towards her and with gratitude for her clarification, we shall press the new clause to a vote.

<P>
No. 207, in page 32, line 15, leave out from `(c)' to end of line and insert `at least three members with other relevant knowledge or experience'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This clutch of amendments enables us to have another go at the issue of the Low Pay Commission, which we debated somewhat breathlessly at a late hour. It is right to reconsider how the commission is getting on and how it may or may not adapt to its statutory role.
<P>
I shall speak to amendment No. 238 first. It is slightly strange that under clause 8(9) of the Bill, the Secretary of State may switch on the statutory Low Pay Commission like a light bulb after the non-statutory commission has reported. Our amendment would provide an off switch--the commission could be stood down if it no longer has any useful purpose.
<P>
The notes on clauses clarify some of these matters. My inference is that the Low Pay Commission will do such jobs as the Secretary of State requires, but may be decommissioned unless and until it is required in future. We have had useful exchanges about its possible input to agricultural wages orders, but the Committee faces a dilemma unless and until the Government make their intentions clearer. Will they commission a statutory Low Pay Commission? What will it do? Will it be required to debate and give advice on the rate of the national minimum wage? Is so, how often? How on earth will it be got rid of if it is no longer required? The Government owe it to the Committee to say a little more about those matters.
<P>
I can conceive of a role for the commission. I do not want it to have no role and for there to be continuing expense and embarrassment because nobody can lay the thing to rest decently without being said to subvert the principles of the national minimum wage. In the same breath, I should say that the financial memorandum suggests that the commission's probable running costs will be in the range of &#163;500,000 to &#163;1 million a year, which is not a trivial amount of public expenditure. It is, therefore, important that we get value for money and that the commission has a specific remit.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 204 to 207 deal with the composition of the statutory commission, should it be put in place. We need to consider two separate issues. First, the Government propose in paragraph (1) that there should be a chairman and eight members. That is exactly analogous to the existing non-statutory commission. The schedule then says that a balance should be struck between various interests when those people are appointed.
<P>
I have two potential problems with that arrangement. First, is eight plus the chairman the right number for such a statutory body, which will work on a continuing basis? Secondly, is it better to write an explicit balance into the Bill? It is the view of engineering employers, who have commented constructively on the Bill, that there should be an explicit test. An interesting analogy can also be made with the Agricultural Wages Board, which was set up under Labour Government legislation in 1948. It was constituted of eight members a side plus five independents. If we were writing the legislation for that board now, we would probably not provide for so many members because a 21-member board is a bit large for decision making. On the other hand, I am not sure that the nine-person board that the Government propose for the commission is enough for its continuing investigations.
<P>
On the size issue, it is important for the Committee to realise that the commission will change gear after the initial report. I have no objection in this context to the way in which the Government have set matters up or to the timetable, but the existing non-statutory commission has a big job to do in a short time and in a compact manageable way. It needs to go round the country hearing evidence and taking oral submissions, and it has done that to the best of its ability. We do not want to argue about that and I have no cavil with what I have seen or heard of its work in Committee. When it settles down, however, it might need wider representation. Eight members makes it difficult to give it breadth and balance at the same time. My amendment provides for at least eight members. I am wondering whether it would be better to have 11 members, prescribing, as I do in amendment No. 207, which states that there should be at least three other members with other relevant knowledge or experience. That would provide a total of 12--that is, one independent chairperson, three outside independents and four a side from what used to be described--although I make no prediction about it--as both sides of industry.
<P>
That might be easier, and might also make it easier to accommodate the requirement set out in amendment No. 206 that at least one person should be appointed who has personal and practical knowledge of running a small business. I make no criticism of the appointment of Lawrence Dewar, whom I do not know, as chief executive of the Scottish Grocers Federation. He is not actually running a business at the moment, although I suspect that he will have done in the past. He is also a Scot, and I have no objection to that; it is wise to have good territorial representation. But some of the smaller business interests in England could feel on a continuing basis that that is not the right balance. That is not to say that Lawrence Dewar would not be included--I have no comment to make on that.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the danger of appointing just one person who runs or has run a small business is that it might appear to be nothing but a token gesture rather late after the initial event?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is always the difficulty. I realise the problem that Ministers have--I have done the job myself. There is a difficult balance to strike between having something unworkably large and something compact enough to be able to do things but which is still representative. I am not one for writing the small detail of what is to go in legislation. My alternative formulation--a chairman and 11 members, three of whom would be independent--would provide greater flexibility. It would be possible to have two people from small business--one as an employer and one as an independent person with business experience. I invite the Government to reply to that.
<P>
Our concerns are that the numbers may be rather small. Given the nature of the studies that may be required later, they could do with a bit of stiffening. That is not a criticism of the individuals or of the fact that the existing composition includes three academics. As a former Minister responsible for higher education, I like and respect academics--although I may be in the minority on the Opposition Benches--and if they are sensible, I have no problem with their being members. They will produce a good report, which we shall analyse and, if it is no good, we shall say so. But we need a few more people who in farming are called ``dirty boots'' type of operators--people who have run businesses and have credibility.
<P>
The size of the commission is relevant. As the commission finds itself in a new mode, it may want to carry out particular studies, but without every member taking part. It may want four or five people to look at the impact on agriculture, while at the same time another group may be looking at what is happening in the hairdressing industry or there may be a problem concerning juveniles or training. Such matters need looking at.
<P>
We are trying to be helpful and to impart to the Government the flexibility of slightly greater numbers without a huge increase of precise specifications and without criticising the existing membership. However, we request the Government to define a little more clearly their intentions and how they see the commission's future role. If there is no future role, or no continuing future role, there must be some means of turning down the lights and saying, ``Thank you very much, we will now get on with it ourselves.''
<P>
There is one other issue that I may be able to dispose of at this point, because I confess that I did not notice it in time to table an amendment. There are disqualifications prescribed for the House of Commons and the Northern Ireland Assembly. So that I do not have to raise the point separately, could the Minister save time by confirming that members of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly would also be disqualified from membership of the commission. The principle is that they should be.
<P>
My general remarks concern the constitution. We could all do with more time to hear a clearer rehearsal of the Government's thinking.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey (Eastleigh):</B> The amendments raise some important issues in regard to the operation of the Low Pay Commission and its future, particularly amendment No. 238, which calls for it to have a predetermined life. While I do not agree with the amendment's provisions, it raises a matter on which we have touched several times. This is perhaps the last opportunity for the Minister to try to clarify the Government's intentions, so I should like to ask a series of questions about the functioning and future of the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
Do the Government see the Low Pay Commission as a permanent body dealing with wage issues as time goes by and economic practices inevitably change? I still want to know whether the Government intend to make the Low Pay Commission a statutory body, which Ministers have the power to do. Do they think that the commission should be statutorily independent of the day-to-day machinations of Government?
<P>
Moreover, do Ministers intend the Low Pay Commission, operating in a permanent role, to receive further representations over time from all sectors of industry and commerce in regard to pay, conditions and changes in the economy? As the hon. Member for Daventry said, there may well be a need for such a body to address changing factors that have a salient impact on wages in a particular industry or occupation--he mentioned hairdressing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a weakness, because the Secretary of State will be able to ask the Low Pay Commission to consider and report on certain issues, but there is no power for the commission to do that if it sees a problem? The Secretary of State may not welcome its input if there is a problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. He obviously has a good memory for our debates, because I tabled an amendment that would have allowed the Low Pay Commission to receive independently representations made by industry and not just to call for them, perhaps at the behest of the Secretary of State. That is an important point.
<P>
The Low Pay Commission has an essential role as a conduit for reflecting changes in economic practices which affect wages. There would be a great advantage in making the commission act in that way as a permanent body.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Earlier in our proceedings, the hon. Gentleman argued for a formula according to which an annual uprating of the national minimum wage would take place. In light of that, to what extent--if at all--does he envisage a role for the Low Pay Commission in deciding on an uprating? Surely that function would be withdrawn from it by virtue of his preference for a specific formula?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> That is a very interesting intervention. I wonder whether the hon. Member for Buckingham reflected on the Minister's reply to my suggestion. I shall use his reply to respond to your intervention. The Minister stressed at length the need for partnership with the Low Pay Commission, a point to which I want to respond later this morning. Partnership works two ways, particularly when we discuss the representation on the Low Pay Commission of small business. If you say that it needs confidence--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not my intervention and I have no intention of commenting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was carried away with the thoughts that were rushing through my mind. If the Low Pay Commission is to have the confidence and support of all sectors of industry, it should indeed have flexibility and guidelines, and independence from the day-to-day political decisions of the Minister of the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> (Solihull): I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. At various stages of the Committee's consideration, when reference has been made to representatives of small business, I have asked Ministers--as I have asked the spokesman of my own party--what they mean by ``small business''. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman, as the leading Liberal Democrat spokesman, would say what he means by small business.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Chidgey, on the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody, I shall try not to stray too far--although it could be said that the amendment is in the eye of the beholder. Well-known categorisations of businesses are used in the European Community and by the European Commission. I forget the precise figures, but I believe that a business with more than 350 employees is large, but one with fewer is a small to medium-sized enterprise. Categorisations go down to businesses with 10 or more employees. It could be argued that businesses with 10 or fewer employees are vital to the matter under discussion. Such businesses constitute the backbone of new opportunities in industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I return to my comments on the amendment, and I thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody, for your patience in allowing me to respond to the intervention.
<P>
The relevant question is one of permanency, and of the statutory independence of the Low Pay Commission, about which I seek the Minister's guidance. As the Committee has discussed at length, the Bill allows the possibility of exemptions from its main provisions. I am anxious to know whether, underlying the Bill in the mind of the Government, is an intention that a permanent Low Pay Commission will continue to review, monitor and make recommendations for changes in the exemptions that may be made soon after enactment, but which may not be relevant as the years pass.
<P>
The Government's intention about the future role of the Low Pay Commission is unclear in that regard. I shall give one or two quick examples. The impacts of the new deal policy on the national minimum wage and on poverty wages are still unclear. I foresee that the Low Pay Commission could have a very important role in guiding Parliament and Government in relation to the impacts on the national minimum wage of such separate but associated policy. Similarly, the Government have made strong statements about their wish to review the welfare and benefit system. That system relates precisely and unavoidably to low pay and therefore to the national minimum wage. What role will the Low Pay Commission, permanent or otherwise, have with regard to that matter?
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry raised the issue of membership. I should add briefly but with some force that people are genuinely anxious about future representation on the Low Pay Commission. A few minutes ago, the matter of defining a small business was mentioned, a little to the side of the discussion. Small businesses are the backbone of the economy, and it is perceived that they will be so for a very long time. It is therefore essential that, if the partnership and confidence about which the Minister spoke so eloquently are to be created, the small business community should be adequately represented on the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
It may well be that, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, the commission's membership should be expanded to accommodate such representation. That is a question for further debate. The essence of the debate is to ensure that all sectors of industry and commerce, especially the small business sector, feel confident that the Low Pay Commission can express their concerns, priorities and, perhaps, their contributions to working towards a sensible and generally accepted national minimum wage. I rest my case, and I await the Minister's reply.

<P>

<B>Ann Keen </B>(Brentford and Isleworth): The Government feel that the amendments tabled with reference to the membership of the commission would add flexibility to the number of members appointed, but they would also add uncertainty. The commission could become unwieldy and difficult to manage. There is nothing to prevent it from calling on specialist consultants as and when necessary, without such experts becoming full members of the commission. Indeed, that practice has for some time been recognised in industry, academic circles and business and consultancy, where collective decision making and recommendation are required. The commission should consider that positive and dynamic approach.
<P>
The Committee's attention should be drawn to a recent article in The Daily Telegraph by John Cridland, the CBI's director of human resources policy, who represents the interests of business on all human resources matters. A member of the Low Pay Commission, he praises its work. He has been
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``travelling the length and breadth of the United Kingdom talking to people on low pay and their employers. We have ranged from unemployed centres in Londonderry's Bogside to meeting Asian homeworkers in Leicester.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	Our visit to Wales is of great value. My day in Cardiff involves meeting councillors, trade union representatives and wholesalers, retailers and textile employers. We return to London with several new insights and perspectives which will inform our thinking.''
<P>
That is an imaginative and dynamic way of taking an interest, in particular in small businesses. Taking evidence and listening to the views of people round the country is a positive way forward for the commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): I shall add briefly to what is, even at this late stage, a useful debate on the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
The amendments would add helpful flexibility rather than uncertainty. In this context, uncertainty is a curious concept. The Government will be the only recipients of advice from the commission and only they will determine the number of members. It is odd that they should be constrained so as not to confuse themselves by being able to appoint a number of commissioners different from that proposed in the schedule.
<P>
It would be useful to hear what the Government intend for the commission. First, the Minister has said that it will have a continuing role, but will not be a standing body. How frequently will Ministers ask the commission for reports? It could report not only on uprating the hourly rate, but on a range of matters. Ministers have often rested upon the proposition that they must respond to the commission's advice, not only in the first instance, but, I presume, subsequently.
<P>
Secondly, the Government may refer matters to the commission. How might its balance shift over time? We should not assume that the initial composition will always be appropriate. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry made fair remarks about using academic experience. I agree: the Committee has relied on academic evidence to understand the broader economic impacts of the national minimum wage rate, but the commission will probably be asked for contemporaneous practical evidence of those impacts. If they rest too much on academic method, the Government may act too late to remedy practical difficulties that might emerge. The second question is, therefore, whether the balance of the Low Pay Commission should shift over time? In particular, as my hon. Friend rightly said, should it shift from the academic to the practical through the inclusion of those who are concerned with the practical application of the minimum wage.
<P>
That brings me to a third question about balance. I was slightly surprised that the hon. Member for Eastleigh did not revert to the subject of regional variation, which is one of his and, indeed, our common themes. Although the intention is to set a single hourly rate and for there to be no regional variations, it is obvious that the impact of the national minimum wage will vary between regions. It is perfectly proper for the Low Pay Commission to take evidence around the country. We had a discussion about Northern Ireland and it was mentioned that the Low Pay Commission was aware of the situation, had taken evidence there and that the chairman had business interests there. Therefore, although we might not reflect this in the Bill, we should expect the membership of the Low Pay Commission to include people in due course who have practical experience of running businesses in different parts of the country and of the different regional and local labour markets that subsist in them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Is it not possible that the Low Pay Commission will be differently constituted for each individual inquiry that it is asked to make and that it might include people who are appropriate to the specific subject?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> If I may, I will answer my hon. Friend's in a moment when I have completed this thought. I will not labour the point, but I agree with my hon. Friends that the presence on the Low Pay Commission of people with experience in small business is essential. A legitimate criticism has been made of the fact that such a presence had been somewhat lacking until now. It will, however, be all the more important as time goes on, for the reasons that I just described. For the benefit of my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor), I should say that a business with 200 employees is not regarded as a small business in my constituency of South Cambridgeshire; a business with 20 employees would be seen as a small business. In this context, therefore, we mean micro businesses and not just those that fall within the European Union's categorisation of what constitutes a small business.
<P>
To come to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made, it is important to recognise not only that Ministers have the power to vary the Low Pay Commission's composition to the extent of reconstituting it for a particular task, but that it might be desirable to do so. On the assumption that Ministers broadly follow the Low Pay Commission's advice on the rate, we shall need to look for two things as time goes on. One is a degree of continuity. It would be undesirable for the Low Pay Commission, when reviewing the impact of the minimum wage and whether to uprate it, to be privy as a corporate body to the argumentation that led to its initial recommendations. We need also to make sure that the Low Pay Commission does not become an apologist for the decisions that were made in the first instance and does not seek to justify them through further reports and evidence to Ministers. The Government are proceeding down a path that is potentially fraught with difficulties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Is my hon. Friend making the point that changing the commission's composition would reinforce its independence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> That would reinforce not only its independence from Ministers and from its previous decisions, but its values. If one does not change the membership of a body over time, that becomes a self-reinforcing justification in regard to the contents of advice, the weight that is to be attached to it and the evidence that is to be listened to.
<P>
In that context, I should mention one additional point about the membership of such bodies, although it need not divide the Committee. There is a tendency to appoint to such bodies those who are representative of other organisations--for example, trade union officials rather than those who have been engaged in the work force, and trade association representatives rather than those who have run businesses. There is everything to be said for including those who are directly qualified rather than representatives of business or the work force.
<P>
I have several questions about the schedule which I would like the Minister to answer. It would be useful if he were to tell us what he believes is meant by ``relevant knowledge or experience'' in so far as it is not related to by membership or representation of trade unions or the work force or to knowledge and experience of matters relating to employers, as set out in paragraph (2)(a) and (b). There is additional relevant knowledge and experience. I assume that in this context knowledge comprises academic knowledge, but it would be useful to know what is meant by ``experience''.
<P>
A question which does not arise here, but to which we may usefully return at a later stage, is what will happen when members of the Low Pay Commission do not agree. There is an assumption in its structure that the commission will proceed by way of consensus and present one report to Ministers, but there will always be scope for disagreements that cannot be resolved. In those circumstances, there may be greater value in presenting Ministers with both sides of an argument in a majority and a minority report rather than creating a false consensus.
<P>
That question may relate directly to the schedule in the sense that the balance to be struck between members of the commission is designed to reflect their competing interests, and we must acknowledge that those interests may give rise to majority and minority opinions, which may not necessarily be reconciled. It may not be desirable to reconcile them. It would be helpful if Ministers at least acknowledged that and accepted the proposition that they may, from time to time, receive both a majority and a minority report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green (Ashford):</B> The thought occurs that my hon. Friend's suggestion would be particularly useful to the Minister. Given that the Secretary of State must appoint a balanced Low Pay Commission, it is conceivable that there will be occasions when those on one or other side of an argument, to put it in crude terms, feel so badly treated by the majority that if they cannot submit a minority report they would prefer to resign from the commission before it reported, which would clearly be disadvantageous to the good order of business of the commission and the Secretary of State.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes a helpful point. It would be undesirable if the expectation were to be laid on the commission that it must strive excessively to arrive at a single view. The responsibility for the decision will rest finally not with the commission but with Ministers in their recommendation to Parliament, so it would be better in some circumstances for members of the commission who found themselves in a minority, even of one, to present their view, rather than feeling that they had to absent themselves or resign from the commission.
<P>
I am sure that Ministers have it in mind that, over time, there will be a range of sectoral experience among members of the Low Pay Commission, and two issues arise from that. First, it is important that small businesses should be represented, but we all know that there are very different small businesses. Some offer high paid jobs and their products are high value added. They are not subject to particular competition in terms of their labour cost component. Other small businesses are in sectors with relatively low pay and face intense price competitiveness so labour is a significant component of cost. To say that one has a small business may be to mislead oneself as to the relevance of that experience to the impact of the national minimum wage rate on business.
<P>
Thus, regardless of the size of business, we must ensure that businesses will be represented on the Low Pay Commission which are, from personal experience, aware of the impact of that price competitiveness, particularly the impact of international price competition and of the relatively high exposure to imports in that sector, where labour costs form a high proportion of the total costs and where businesses are sensitive to the impact of the national minimum wage.
<P>
I hope that Ministers will look avidly for sectors of industry where such factors are important and try to appoint people to the commission with relevant experience in those areas.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> This set of amendments is sensible and well motivated, and I hope that Ministers will feel able to accept them.
<P>
I emphasise at the outset, so that there is no doubt, that we do not intend to cast aspersions on members of the commission. We are at an early stage--the commission's deliberations continue--and I have no personal knowledge of any current member of the commission. I am not saying that they are not good people, that they do not have experience or that they will not make a distinctive and valuable contribution. There is, however, genuine concern among Opposition Members about the composition of the commission. I hope that Ministers will consider that.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry made a reasonable point about size. I am interested to know on what basis a judgment was reached that there should be eight members plus the chairman. Presumably there was nothing scientific about that--it was an arbitrary judgment, and one could just as well have opted for another figure. I hope that the Minister will consider the future extension of the commission, either on an on-going basis or for the purpose of particular inquiries. For example, some inquiries might involve a particularly heavy work load or they might benefit from the experience of individuals who might not be able to serve over an extended period but who would be prepared to be members in the short term so that they could participate in an inquiry into a subject in which they had expertise.
<P>
It is notable that when the Government announced their intentions, there was a large number of applications to serve on the commission. That is both welcome in itself and a testimony to the commission's importance for some time to come. It would be wrong arbitrarily to circumscribe the number of people who can serve on it. If talented people come forward--perhaps people of whom Ministers are not even aware at the moment--they should have a chance to serve. It would be wrong to impose artificial time limits and to specify that after a certain period, members should be removed. If they are doing a good job, let them stay. Equally, if people have done a good job but could be usefully replaced by others who have not had the chance to serve, that chance should be given.
<P>
Thus, there is much to be said for amendment No. 238, which suggests that people should be allowed to continue on the commission until they have outlived their purpose. Similarly, I commend amendment No. 205, which requests that there should be an equal number of members with knowledge or experience of, or interest in, employees, employers and other germane matters.
<P>
In other contexts, the Government are fond of quotas. They are keen on having specific targets and set numbers and on giving re-issues for serving on particular bodies. In this context, however, Ministers seem anxious to preserve for themselves maximum flexibility. I do not expect them to say that a given number is to be imposed or even that given numbers of particular categories of person--employer or employee--will serve on the commission. I see no reason, however, why they should not be prepared to guarantee an equality of treatment between the different sectors. Ministers have said much about the importance of a partnership approach. It seems eminently reasonable that there should be equal representation of the various interests. Similarly, the argument in support of amendment No. 206 is compelling. My hon. Friends modestly request that one member of the commission should have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``personal and practical knowledge of running a small business.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Ministers were rather affronted when we queried the composition of the commission. I hope that they will not be so today. This is not a question of competence or of impugning the motives or integrity of members of the commission, but merely a statement of fact: some might have experience, but, unfortunately, no serving member of the commission currently runs a small business.
<P>
Ministers have anxiously reassured us that they are interested in the views of small business and have said that the rate, which will be set on advice from the commission, should be sensitive to the needs of and pressures upon small business. What is the harm in agreeing that, no matter how many members the commission might have--we recommend that there could be more than nine--at least one should be running a small business?
<P>
As the late Enoch Powell would have said, the advantage is so obvious that only a very clever person would fail to see it. Setting up a small business and experiencing the difficulties of attracting staff, breaking into markets, making a profit and keeping going in hard times is much more onerous than the role of administrator in a large company. It is a great pity that there is no small business representative on the commission. I hope that Ministers will be sympathetic to guaranteed future representation.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) alluded to an equally important point. He emphasised the distinction between direct and indirect representation. Ministers will have been well intentioned when choosing members of the commission. They will have read curricula vitae and references and interviews will have been conducted, but intermediate rather than direct representation has been opted for.
<P>
I invite Ministers to pick people from the coalface, not just in small businesses but across the board. Rather than having organisations representing small and large businesses on the commission, why not opt for a small business person and a major employer? That would avoid the potential cynicism of people saying, ``These large organisations are not necessarily representative of me or of the sector, or of the sector in my part of the country.'' There is much to be said for reconsidering the composition of the commission.
<P>
Finally, why are there no details of the remuneration of members of the commission, only a reference to facility to pay? Remuneration is deeply relevant to the composition of the commission. We are interested to learn--and are entitled to know--as much as possible about the Government's intentions. The Secretary of State ``may'' make payments, but it is not certain that people will be paid. Will judgments be made on the basis of saving money? Will members of the commission be remunerated equally? I hope that our amendments will be accepted. They were tabled in good spirit, are constructive and would enable the better operation of the commission. The Low Pay Commission is a mistake. We would be better off without it. It is not an infernal institution, but I fear that it is unnecessary. Nevertheless, the Government will get their way. The Low Pay Commission will exist, and I wish it every success in its deliberations. It has an important task, and it will benefit from the best possible composition, from the greatest encouragement and from maximum flexibility. If the Government secure those three objectives, some benefit could yet be derived from the commission's operations.
<P>
<B>Judy Mallaber </B>(Amber Valley): I apologise for my pager going off earlier. I was so keen not to miss the final session that I set it as an extra alarm. I should have hated to miss this morning's sitting.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady deserves credit for giving one of the most original excuses I have heard.
<P>
<B>Judy Mallaber:</B> I thought that I might be sent to the dungeons for making such a dreadful mistake.
<P>
Amendment No. 238 has not been covered fully. The Committee should not be talking about ending the Low Pay Commission before it has even started, a point that relates to the previous speech. Doing so does not give the positive message that the Government wish to convey. We do not wish to start the process while talking about how it might end.
<P>
The Bill sets out a positive process. It started well. The non-statutory Low Pay Commission started by doing a good job and winning a great deal of acceptance, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Ann Keen) pointed out. Pre-empting the Minister, I should say that that success has largely occurred because of his work during the past few years to achieve industry's acceptance of the establishment of the commission, and because of his argument that the scandal of low pay must and will be eliminated.
<P>
On Thursday, the Minister made the intellectual argument in support of the process set out in the Bill for eradicating and tackling low pay. He spoke of the need for ownership of the process, and said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The ownership of the process must remain with the social partners and the Government.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 12 February 1998; c. 990.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The whole point of the process is that it should be bedded down. We should not start off by undermining it by talking about ending it. The quotations of the CBI director of human resources were well cited in that regard.
<P>
I speak with some feeling about the matter. For many years, I worked for NUPE, which campaigned for decades for a statutory national minimum wage. For many of those years, the union argued for a formula in the same way that the hon. Member for Eastleigh did on Thursday. I have been back to the first intellectually set-out argument for a statutory minimum wage, ``Low Pay and How to End It'', a book written in 1974 by Alan Fisher, the general secretary of NUPE, and by my boss in the organisation, Bernard Dix.

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I cannot believe that, in discussing the Low Pay Commission, the hon. Lady judges it to be appropriate to refer to an authentic representative of old Labour.
<P>
<B>Judy Mallaber:</B> What is most interesting about the book is that it shows how, for many decades, arguments were made to convince other trade unions that actions taken to try to end low pay had not worked, and that the matter required political action, which is what the Committee is now discussing. The matter has been argued for many decades.
<P>
Interestingly, at the end of the book, Alan Fisher and Bernard Dix argued that a tripartite process should be used, which should require the involvement of Government, employers and unions. The authors were well ahead of their time. I pay my tribute to Alan Fisher and Bernard Dix, and to thousands of low-paid workers who have campaigned for decades to reach the present situation.
<P>
I spoke at Bernard Dix's memorial two years ago. I said that I would be in tears of emotion and pride when I walked through the Lobby to vote for a minimum wage.
<P>
I come back to quoting John Cridland who, at the end of the article which was referred to earlier, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I have ended the week on a high note and am doing a worthwhile and rewarding job''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
For goodness sake, let us not undermine that pride in the positive job that we are doing to end the scandal of low pay that has been with us for decades. Let us not undermine the work that has been done by all those low-paid workers. This process has been argued about for many years before we got to this stage. My hon. Friend the Minister has done a wonderful job in putting forward that process and arguing for it. Let us not undermine it by talk about ending it before we have even started.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> The cheque is in the post. [Laughter.] It has been a curious discussion so far in respect of Conservative Members' tactics. They have tabled amendments which seem to be probing but which in truth, do not complement each other. Back-Bench Members argue for flexibility, yet the Front-Bench spokesperson tables amendments that aim to get rid of flexibility. We then see what I can only call mealy mouthedness, with Conservative Members saying that of course they are not attacking the integrity of the Low Pay Commission's membership or implying that the process for appointing members was not open and just. They say that of course it is not a question of the members not having the qualities and knowledge to do the job, but then they target and name an individual on the commission--someone who cannot defend themselves--who has been appointed through the known process by being interviewed and then being offered a place. Unlike the procedure under the previous Government, no one appointed to the commission receives a fee. They are doing it for the public good. When the previous Government appointed their friends to quangos, they had to stuff their pockets with money on occasion to get them to do business for them. It is not a subtle attack, but a direct attack on the membership of the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
Let us get this absolutely straight. This Government have done more in 10 months to foster relationships with small and medium-sized enterprises than the previous Conservative Government did in 18 years. Conservative Members attacked Lawrie Dewar. He was grocer of the year and from that achievement as a small business person he took a small financial award and built up his business. He has been a small business person for nearly two decades. The only reason that he is not doing it now is that the small business community headhunted him and asked him to be its representative because of his knowledge, commitment to and understanding of the day-to-day workings of small businesses. It ill behoves Conservative Members to single out Mr. Dewar on the basis that somehow he does not represent small business. Of course he does. His lifetime's work has been spent in the small business community.
<P>
When the Low Pay Commission's membership was appointed, there was not a section in commerce and industry which did not applaud those appointments. Each one was appointed for his or her skills and knowledge of the labour market, pay systems, employment relations, small businesses, large businesses, textiles, and all the sectors in which low pay exists. The chair of the commission has been unanimously welcomed as having the knowledge and commitment to bring such expertise to bear.
<P>
Irrespective of what the report will say, the commission has worked well and effectively in going about its work and collating information and evidence--both verbal and written. It has done its work throughout the United Kingdom; it has not asked people to come to it, but has gone to them. We were right to argue for a social partnership arrangement when establishing the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
The second important point is that we established the commission before the Bill was passed. We wanted to take a twin-track approach. The commission has been working and will continue to work in advance of the implementation of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry tabled several amendments. The subject of amendment No. 204 is a matter of judgment. The Government have made the judgment that a nine-member commission will have the knowledge and expertise necessary for the task. Its members will be selected in an open selection process. That gives us flexibility in terms of working numbers. We could have had 20, 30, 40 or 50 people on the commission, but people would still have been disappointed that they were not members. People would still have said, ``What about this section and that section?'' We had to strike a workable balance and we believe that we have got it right. We had to have a balance between the social partners and between skills and areas of knowledge. Credibility with social partners was also important. We wanted academics, with their skills and knowledge base, to work not just in academia, but on a hands-on basis with industry. That is the balance that we sought. We all have to make judgments and that is the judgment that we made.
<P>
The Government's approach will not prevent the Low Pay Commission from securing independent advice and assistance on a range of issues, as it can now. It will not disturb the membership, its effective operation, or its capacity to seek out information sources other than Government Departments.
<P>
Amendment No. 205 requires the balance to be achieved by ensuring that there are equal numbers of each of the groups. We find that there is a dichotomy between the Opposition Front and Back Benchers. The hon. Member for Daventry wants there to be a prescription, but his hon. Friends argued against that. They spoke in favour of his amendments, but, in truth, their speeches opposed them. They spoke about the commission's flexibility and, ultimately, a change in its composition and the possibility of one social partner having more members than the other. They said that academics might not be needed in future and that they should be replaced by representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises. The amendment, however, says that the Secretary of State ``shall'' have three academics. There is something of a difference of opinion between Front and Back Benchers. In practice, what the Government have attempted to do is similar to what the amendment attempts to do--to create a balance between the social partners. That is the position now and that is what it will be in the future.
<P>
That takes us back to the issue of ownership, which I raised in a previous debate. If the balance is not right, who will buy into the process? Who will take ownership of it or responsibility for it? The dynamic of the partnership approach will secure a proper balance of representation on the Low Pay Commission. The commission could work only on that basis and on the basis of co-operation. That is why the Government have not been prescriptive. We need to get the social partners to accept some responsibility and to work with each other. They need to devise a process that allows some flexibility.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry also mentioned performance and the permanence of the commission. The Government have given an absolute commitment about the Low Pay Commission's continuing role. That is why we have clauses 5, 6, 7 and 8 and schedule 1. The fact that the Government have allocated such a proportion of the Bill's space to the Low Pay Commission makes clear the Government's intention towards it.
<P>
We want to make it clear from the outset that there must be flexibility in the process of bedding down and rolling out the minimum wage. There must be flexibility about when the commission is convened, the job that it does and the tasks that we set it. There should be a natural cycle linking the Low Pay Commission and its reporting functions. Maximum flexibility will allow the social partners and the Government to consider the impact and the rolling out of the national minimum wage. It will allow the social partners to be involved in all stages of the process. It is important that we approach the matter in that way.
<P>
I said at our previous sitting that I did not underestimate the difficulty of introducing a minimum wage in a complex, active labour market. I have never dodged the issue politically or intellectually. Given that complexity, it is important that we have maximum flexibility about the Low Pay Commission's role, activities and work. We intend to do that and to ensure not only a successful introduction of the minimum wage but its successful future operation, so that low-paid employees get out of low pay and employers utilise the legislation effectively to prevent underpayment of the national minimum wage.
<P>
I cannot answer Opposition Members' ultimate question--they do not want the Low Pay Commission, but that is not an option. I hope that they are able at least to understand the reason why the Government want flexibility and social partnership--so that the Low Pay Commission can, in the cycle following the introduction of the minimum wage, work with the Government and its social partners to ensure that the minimum wage operates effectively.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is a past master at setting up Aunt Sallies and knocking them down. I did not say that I had no confidence in the work that the Low Pay Commission was doing, nor that Mr. Dewar was unacceptable. I am sorry that the Minister gave that impression--I certainly did not intend to, and I am sorry if I did. I rested on the biblical injunction ``By their fruits, ye shall know them''. We look forward to the commission's report and we hope that it will be as authoritative as the Minister clearly thinks it will.
<P>
The amendments had a greater coherence than the Minister suggested. They are an attempt to improve the flexibility of the commission in the future. The Minister glossed over some of our concerns, but we might well want to return to them, perhaps in a slightly different context, in later stages of the Bill's consideration. Despite the Minister's somewhat synthetic assault, my advice to my hon. Friends on this occasion is that we might regard withdrawing the admendments at this stage as a retreat to Dunvoting. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> These are a series of detailed, technical amendments which fine-tune the way in which the national minimum wage enforcement procedures are linked to the Agricultural Wages Act 1948 and equivalent legislation for Scotland and Northern Ireland. We talked about that earlier on.
<P>
The amendments also clarify the role of the agricultural wages committees under the national minimum wage arrangements, in particular by ensuring that those committees do not make decisions which lead to agricultural wages falling below the level of the national minimum wage.
<P>
Broadly speaking, the amendments achieve three things. First, they sort out the arrangements for the prosecution of offences by agricultural wages inspectors using the national minimum wage enforcement provisions against possible breaches of the agricultural minimum rates. We are ensuring that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food can authorise officers to take such actions.
<P>
Secondly, they clarify the powers of the agricultural wages committees to grant permits for incapacitated agricultural workers. We are ensuring that such workers will be entitled to the national minimum wage. The approach adopted in relation to wages committees is entirely consistent with the approach adopted towards the Agricultural Wages Board.
<P>
Thirdly, they tidy up and bring into conformity those provisions dealing with the interaction between the Bill and the appropriate agricultural minimum rates.
<P>
Amendment No. 264 makes a further technical change. We are merely tidying up the Bill by deleting from this part of it references to the Employment Rights Act 1996, because they are no longer necessary. However, I assure hon. Members that new section 10A of the Employment Rights Act 1996 will still apply in relation to the national minimum wage enforcement provisions, as used by agricultural workers to enforce their rights not only to the national minimum wage but to any higher agricultural minimum rates.
<P>
An agricultural worker who is dismissed because he attempts to enforce his right to receive an agricultural minimum rate that is higher than the national minimum wage will automatically be treated as unfairly dismissed under new section 104A of the Employment Rights Act 1996. He will be treated exactly as if he has been dismissed for enforcing his right to the national minimum wage.
<P>
All the amendments are technical. They add to and clarify the Bill, and I commend them to the Committee.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I accept the Minister's assurances that these are technical amendments. I am sure that she will not mind me scoring a point slightly at her expense by saying that the fact that the Government have had to table so many technical amendments at this stage of the Committee's considerations reveals the complexity of the interaction of the two pieces of legislation. However, I will not trade on that point.
<P>
It is entirely right that the Minister should want to get the Bill right, and we also want it to be right. She knows, because I have already informally expressed it, my concern about the wording of amendment No. 279. I will not invite her to comment on that now, nor will I invite my hon. Friends to oppose the amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> The Question is, That I do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> On 15 February 1912, the then leader of the Labour party, Ramsay MacDonald, moved on the Floor of the House an amendment to the Loyal Address--the then King's Speech--calling for the introduction of a national minimum wage. It has taken 86 years to get to the end of Committee proceedings on such a Bill; it feels like we have been in Committee for 86 years.
<P>
I offer you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and Mr. Atkinson our heartfelt thanks. Like all good captains on the bridge, you have steered us through difficult days and nights with fairness, not favours. On occasion, you have had to bite our ankles. ``Who's Who'' states that Mr. Atkinson has a cocker spaniel called Gaff. When the hon. Member for Daventry and I were exchanging remarks, he whistled us to heel. Perhaps he has named the dog as part of his political career, although he also has a cat called Woolly. I am not sure whether it has been neutered. However, we will leave that subject alone.
<P>
On behalf of all hon. Members, thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody, for your professionalism and kindnesses in seeing the Committee through. I thank the Clerks, who have dealt professionally and effectively with amendments, many from the Government, which came thick and fast; the attendants and police officers, who have to sit through proceedings--they do not always get overtime, so our good humour can affect their wage packets; and the Refreshment Department, whose staff have stayed back to assit us on the long nights. I say a particular thank you to Hansard. I understand that there is now someone in post who can understand Glaswegian as well as all the other accents that are heard in the House.
<P>
I also thank my hon. Friend the Minister for Small Firms. Both of us are leading members of little Labour. Her support of the Government and of the Bill has been tremendous. She has had other difficult duties as part of our presidency of the European Union, but never once let the side down and got to the Committee Room to do her bit.
<P>
We have had four sittings a week and have considered the Bill for 68 hours. I think that we got into the ``Guinness Book of Records'' for a sitting of 26 and a half hours, including comfort breaks. There were reasons for doing that--it was a necessity--but after the second all-night sitting we got a reasonable approach. I was sweating for a bit: another night with the Bill and I may have collapsed.
<P>
I thank the hon. Member for Daventry and his hon. Friends. I called him Captain Mainwaring, because of his unruly and dishevelled forces. I have names for all of them, but we will keep the excitement on hold for our next debate. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire was the only member of the Committee who was able to sneak out for a bath during the 26 and a half hour sitting. We have that in writing, but we do not yet have the pictures. We are still looking.
<P>
I thank the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan), who is not present, and Liberal Democrat Members for their contributions. We all enjoyed the dynamics of the Committee and making Ministers defend their position, which I welcome.
<P>
Finally, I thank my hon. Friends, who have been absolutely brilliant--a brick of solidarity and support. Every one of them is committed to the concept of the minimum wage. Having achieved our historical position, we will now get on to ensuring that the national minimum wage will be quickly established, 86 years after it was first proposed in the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Committee ends on a note of consensus. I recall that at a rather less convenient hour, the sadly absent hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton) and I established a bonding relationship, which centred around one of my favourite films, ``Casablanca''. The Committee has reached the moment of departure, and the plane is taxying down the runway. It is usually at about this point that I explain in tears that they do not make them like that anymore.
<P>
Before we take our leave, I should like to join with the Minister in sincerely expressing our thanks to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and to Mr. Atkinson for your chairmanship of an immensely demanding committee stage. I know from my days as a hockey umpire that a difficult balance always has to be struck between stopping illegal and even dangerous play on the one hand, and interfering with the free play of the game on the other. It is a tribute to both chairmen that the committee has generally been good tempered, even when under conditions of some physical stress.
<P>
I readily echo the Minister's thanks to the Clerks, to the Hansard reporters, to the attendants, to the police, to the catering staff, to Ministers and their officials and to Back Benchers on both sides of the Committee. Whatever views we may have taken, two considerations have helped to get us through. One is a genuine respect for people who are in receipt of relatively low pay and incomes. Comittee members would like to help them in our different ways. The second is a genuine respect for the power of argument, of debate and of probing, which constitute the work of the Committee.
<P>
In conclusion, I give my sincere thanks to my own team--we few, we happy few, we band of brothers. The last anecdote of many that I bring to the Committee tells of a kinsman of mine by marriage who, together with a limited number of Australian special forces, held three Japanese divisions at bay in East Timor in 1942.
<P>
I shall long treasure the memory of the limpid fluency of Ashford, the youthful enthusiasm of Buckingham, the modest acuity of Runnymede and Weybridge and the nagging precision of South Cambridgeshire, together with occasional moments of meteoric brilliance from Solihull--who was also responsible for our moral guidance.
<P>
The Committee has been a classic and epic Committee. It has tested and even--I say modestly--in some cases improved the Bill. The Opposition remain unequivocally and unshakeably opposed to it. We end in consensus, with the words of the national poet:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``And gentleman in England, now a-bed<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,
<P>
And hold their manhoods cheap while any speaks
<P>
That fought with us upon St. Crispin's day.''
<P>
We would not have missed it for the world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I shall be brief. I add my congratulations and thanks to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and to Mr. Atkinson for the very fair and good-tempered way in which the Committee was chaired at many difficult times. Many different things have been discussed, including I believe Pedro and Pepe. Many other people came into the debate, including the cleaner employed by the hon. Member for Buckingham. I am anxious about her--she seemed to get a good rate of pay. I am not sure whether hon. Members pay themselves at quite the same rate. That shows me up, does it not? My thanks to the staff--I reiterate what has been said.
<P>
Finally, the debate has been very important. As a new Member, I found myself part of an extremely important Committee. It is important that the issue of fair pay is addressed. The Liberal Democrats felt it reasonable to make our points, and we shall continue to do so on Report.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Bill is very important. I am grateful to all hon. Members. I should like to pay a personal tribute to my co-Chairman, who was on his first Standing Committee, and who has found it an interesting blooding.
<P>
People sometimes underestimate the need for Her Majesty's official Opposition to have the right to use all parliamentary means, not only to probe but to check and to inquire into Bills. That power is very important, and we should not underestimate it. We should never lose it. In the long hours of the night, when we feel that hon. Members are being unreasonable, we should remember that important democratic power, which I shall always support in every way I can.
<P>
I thank those people who have serviced the Committee with their usual expertise, ability and humour. Hon. Members do not always fully appreciate that service.
<P>
I should like to return to a very old tradition. When I entered the House, it was the custom of the Chairman to have a little glass of champagne. I invite all members of the Committee to join me in my room for a little glass of champagne on Thursday between 12 noon and 1 pm, so that I may show my appreciation.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Bill, as amended, to be reported.
