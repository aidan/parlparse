<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/188/1998188.htm">Registration of Political Parties Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It may be for the Committee’s convenience if I 
state that gentleman may remove their jackets if they wish—although in view of the temperature it seems 
more likely that they will end up wearing overcoats.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Confirmation of registration</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 3, line 11, leave out ‘three’ 
and insert ‘six’.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Although it does not appear on the selection list, I have agreed that, because 
amendments Nos. 18 and 19 are related in content, with this it will be convenient to discuss amendment 
No. 19, in clause 8, page 3, line 36, leave out ‘three’ and insert ‘six’.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale, for agreeing to take amendments Nos. 18 and 19 
together. They make the same point, which is not one that I intend to labour, and it will be convenient for 
the Committee to debate them in tandem.
<P>
Clauses 7 and 8 provide a mechanism for the removal of a party’s name from the register and for the 
possibility that another party might subsequently apply to make use of that name. The Bill provides two 
time frames of three months each. Will the Minister clarify the thinking that was behind the choice of a 
three-month time limit? Six months would be a more appropriate period. Although it  is not likely to 
happen in respect of the two major parties, some of the minor parties may have disagreements in the 
future. Such a disagreement might end with another party being able to apply to use the name. Given what 
may arise as a result of disputes within parties, a six-month time limit would be more sensible.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</B> As the 
hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) has explained, parties have to notify the registrar each year if 
they wish their entry on the register to remain. If such a notification has not been received within the 
period starting one month before the anniversary of the party’s initial registration and ending three 
months after it, the registrar will remove the party’s entry from the register. The amendment seeks to 
extend that period from three months to six months.
<P>
Parties have been given three months after the anniversary to submit their confirmatory notices so as 
to allow them a reasonable period in which to do what is needed and for the registrar, if he wishes, to send 
them reminders. To extend that to six months would make a nonsense of an annual confirmation of 
registration. In practice, parties with at least one Member of Parliament are likely to be registered at the 
end of the first transitional stage, for which clause 16 provides, and most other existing parties at the end 
of the second transitional phase. The main registration anniversaries will therefore fall between November 
and January. The parties concerned should have confirmed their registration and, where appropriate, have 
amended the details, in good time for the May round of local elections, which takes place each year, and 
at intervals for elections to the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh assembly and the European Parliament. If 
the amendment were accepted, that convenient sequence, for which the Bill provides, would be seriously 
undermined. I therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
On amendment Number 19, the reason for providing a period of grace is to prevent one party from 
appearing to take over immediately from another when they are in fact very different. A break of three 
months—this is the hon. Gentleman’s concern—is long enough to establish a proper distance in voters’ 
minds. There is no need to extend the period to six months, as amendment number 19 proposes.
<P>
I understand why the hon. Gentleman has concerns, but the three–month period allows enough time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful for the Minister’s acknowledgement that he understands my concern. 
There are two points. First if we are dealing with three months and three months, a party within which 
there has been a dispute may not have sufficient time to hold a conference of members to decide who the 
responsible officers are under clause 9 who would seek to have the party’s entry re-registered. That begs a 
second question, even if we accept the three months and three months time frame. Is it intended that a 
party whose registration had lapsed would have the opportunity to have it reconfirmed during the second 
three-month transitional period and before it was open season for anyone else?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> On the hon. Gentleman’s first point, I do not profess to be an expert on other parties 
constitutions, although as an undergraduate many years ago I read Lord Blake’s authoritative book 
“History of the Conservative Party”. Unfortunately, that does not give me a detailed knowledge of the 
constitution of the hon. Gentleman’s party. I suspect, however, that, under the Labour party’s constitution, 
the power to deal with the situation that the hon. Gentleman described would rest with our party’s 
National Executive Committee. In the unlikely circumstances of a split, there would be ample opportunity 
for the National Executive Committee to resolve the problem within three-months. I do not know what the 
corresponding body is within the Conservative party, although I am sure that there is one. Equally, I am 
sure that a central body within the Liberal Democrats and other parties could take over the powers of an 
annual conference in between times. I am sure that it could make the necessary representations to sort out 
the administration adequately within a three-month period.
<P>
The Conservative party or the Liberal Democrats may feel later that they would be disadvantaged or 
that there were inadequate arrangements in their constitutions to deal with a problem. If so, there are two 
options. First, they could make representations at a later stage during the Bill’s passage although that 
need not necessarily be in a debate in the Chamber. Alternatively, it would be open to them to change 
their internal procedures to deal with the eventuality.
<P>
If there is no administrative mechanism for dealing with difficulties, a party’s position might be no 
better at the end of six months than it would be at the end of three months. It is possible that, no matter 
how long the period, parties would never be able to resolve the problem. There may be a dispute about the 
ownership of the party, as we discussed in relation to the Liberal Democrats and the Liberal party last 
week, although I am not anxious to dredge the argument up.
<P>
Nevertheless, there is provision for the registrar to seek advice from the Speaker’s Committee about 
where the history of those parties leads. So there are adequate safeguards to protect against the 
circumstance described by the hon. Member for Ryedale, although I acknowledge that the debate has been 
useful for clarification purposes.
<P>
Given those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I an grateful to the Minister, who left a hint hanging in the air about whether we will 
have to return to this important matter. As I said, I am less worried about the mainstream parties than 
about fringe parties that may emerge in the future: no doubt they will be able to read our proceedings.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 22, in page 3, line 32, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(1A) The registrar may remove a party’s entry from the register if any of the party’s registered 
officers have been convicted of an offence under section 19(1) in connection with the party’s registration 
or continued registration’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is an important point. Clause 8 empowers the registrar to remove a name from the register if it 
lapses under the arrangements set out in clause 7, or if the party applies to have its entry removed. The 
clause does not provide any other grounds for removal of a party’s name from the register.
<P>
Clause 19 creates the offence of “knowingly or recklessly” misleading the registrar, by impersonation 
or false information. I am sure that the committee will agree that that is right, but the only penalty for that 
offence appears to be a fine up to level 5.
<P>
The Neill Committee is considering election budgets, but the fine is small beer in comparison. The 
registrar needs a stronger sanction. I hope that the Minister will tell me that the Bill contains a power to 
allow the register to remove a party’s name from the register when the clause 19 offence is committed. 
That would be an important safeguard for mainstream parties if any member or fringe group offended, 
and would fill a gap in the Bill. I look forward to the Minister’s thoughts on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell </B>(Colchester): The critical phrase in the amendment is “if any . . . registered 
officers”. I cannot believe that a mainstream party should have its name disqualified because of one 
officer’s maverick actions. Recent political history in Britain shows that political parties have been 
infiltrated, with resultant manoeuverings and takeovers. It would not be impossible for a person or a group 
to infiltrate a party, attain a position of influence and then do a dastardly deed that would cause grave 
embarrassment.
<P>
The penalty proposed in the amendment is too strong. It does not take account of the mavericks out 
there. In the previous sitting, we heard about the “anoraks” in our society. I am worried about the devious, 
evil people who want to undermine the political system. The amendment would be an invitation for such 
people to join a mainstream party and try to bring it down from within.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The amendment is intended to deal with the two responsible officers specified in 
clause 9. If it is not drafted correctly, that can be changed. Clause 19 states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“knowingly or recklessly to make a statement to the registrar”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I cannot believe that an anorak would make a statement to the registrar, “knowingly or recklessly” or 
in any other way. An anorak would not know who the registrar was nor why he should be given any 
information.
<P>
The amendment deals with responsible officers registered under the terms of the Bill, not with the 
rank and file lunatics who are associated with all political parties from time to time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Russell:</B> I wish that Willy Brandt had such optimism about his staff.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The debate has been more interesting than I anticipated. My hon. Friend the 
Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy) and I are probably the House’s undisputed experts on 
the problems of infiltration of political parties, given our experience with Militant Tendency on 
Merseyside. When I was first elected to the House in 1986, my then constituency chairman, Mr. Jim 
McGinley, routinely used to invite me to give my parliamentary report to the general management 
committee with the words, “The traitor Howarth will now address you.” That item was usually 17(b) on 
the agenda, after any other business. However, I am pleased to report that Mr. McGinley is no longer a 
member of the Labour party, but I am still a Member of Parliament.
<P>
That shows that political parties have rules to protect against the difficulties described by the hon. 
Member for Colchester (Mr. Russell). I have some sympathy with the amendment, but I shall explain why 
it is not necessary. If a party official provides false information to the registrar in relation to the 
information required under clause 2 and schedule 1, it is likely that the party will not have provided the 
information required to enable registration to take place. Accordingly, any entry in the register would be 
void.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale was right to say that a level 5 fine facility is available, but I can 
reassure him that, once it was established that misleading information had been given, the register entry 
would simply be voided. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister. He has confirmed that, in the circumstances that I 
described, any registration would be rendered invalid and a fine would be imposed.
<P>
That is precisely what I wanted to discover. With that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Speaker’s committee</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I beg to move amendment no. 20, in page 4, leave out lines 12 and 13.
<P>
The amendment removes the requirement on the registrar to report his reasons in writing to the 
Speaker’s Committee if he disagrees with its advice. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary promised 
that an amendment to that effect would be tabled, as it was considered unnecessary to provide for a 
procedure to be adopted if the registrar disagreed with the committee’s advice. Having sought its views, 
the registrar would be expected to follow the advice that he was given. If he was unclear or uncertain 
about how to interpret the advice, he could seek further advice.
<P>
I think that hon. Members understand the procedures that were previously envisaged and why it was 
not appropriate to continue with them. In the light of that, I hope that they will support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> As you will see, Mr. Gale, the amendment is also in my name and those of my right 
hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Sir N. Fowler) and my hon. Friend the Member for West 
Dorset (Mr. Letwin). We agree entirely with the Minister’s comments. The amendment is a sensible way 
forward, and I do not need to detain the Committee any longer.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 4, line 13, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(3) A party whose application under sections 3, 5, 6 or 18 is refused may appeal to the committee 
against the registrar’s decision and the committee’s determination of the appeal shall be final.’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss new clause 3—
<P>
Appeals from decisions of Registrar (No. 2)—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘.—An appeal to the Court lies in respect of all decisions of the registrar under sections 3, 5, 6 or 
18.’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> We move now from amendments on which there was considerable common ground and 
about which there was no great concern on either side of the Committee to an amendment on which I fear 
that there may be disagreement—although I hope that we can persuade the Minister to reconsider now or 
later—and to an issue of some significance.
<P>
I am not certain why clause 10(1) refers to sections 2, 5, 6 and 18; it seems to us that it should have 
referred to sections 3, 5, 6 and 18. That is, however, a minor drafting point, which the Minister may 
illuminate. In any event, the amendment refers to sections 3, 5, 6 and 18, which deal with the possibility 
of the registrar refusing an application.
<P>
It is common ground between us that, although refusal does not signify a political party being cast 
into outer darkness, it is intended to be a massive inconvenience. Where circumstances are narrowly 
balanced, a refusal could affect results. It is, therefore fundamental to the operation of democracy that the 
refusal of an application is fair. I take it that, so far, we are on common ground.
<P>
Much has been thrust on the registrar in the Bill, which, appropriately, seeks to avoid cumbersome 
bureaucracy. That is a necessity because it would otherwise have been necessary to invent a cumbersome 
bureaucracy to avoid thrusting so much on the registrar. We will not argue that such a cumbersome 
bureaucracy should be invented. The reverse side of the coin is, however, that a decision that could have 
major implications for the result of an election and which is made by a single individual, albeit in 
discussion with the Committee—that is all common ground—must be open to further discussion. That 
should be possible in the event that a decision has adverse effects on a political party,which genuinely 
believes that it may suffer a reverse in an election of great national importance.
<P>
As the Bill is drafted—the Minister may correct me if I am wrong—the only recourse for a political 
party at that point would be to the courts. That is of constitutional significance. The grounds for judicial 
review are consciously limited, although they are ever-expanding in the hands of our judges. If the 
registrar had acted properly and reasonably and the result was subsequently strongly challenged by one of 
the political parties concerned, the party would be unable successfully to achieve the judicial review 
because the registrar would bring to his defence the fact that he had been reasonable, that he had properly 
considered the matter and that he had taken all due steps. The registrar could make a decision of national 
significance virtually unaided, although possibly in consultation with the Speaker’s Committee. He will be 
the sole person with responsibility for making the decision, and a judicial review would be the only 
recourse open to a political party that wished to contest it. Furthermore, the grounds on which a judicial 
review could be sought are consciously limited by the courts.
<P>
Conservative Members find that unsatisfactory in two respects. First, the necessity to involve the 
courts immediately following an adverse judgment by the registrar undercuts the Bill’s aim of limiting 
procedural complexity. As soon as one enters the courts, delay, costs and unpredictable results arise. 
Secondly, the fact that the grounds on which the court can intervene are limited, because the process 
would be one of judicial review, means that the substantive issue of whether the registrar has made an 
appropriate decision is not up for grabs at that point. That is a dangerous situation.
<P>
We hope that the registrar will be a thoroughly reasonable human being, who is well informed and 
will make decisions in line with a national consensus. However, that cannot be guaranteed in all cases. 
The burden on the registrar is therefore greater than any rational human being would wish to have thrust 
on them. The task is not a similar scale to that undertaken by, for example, a utility regulator, in which a 
firm’s profits and customer pricing are at stake. The President of the Board of Trade has frequently 
remarked that she has doubts about the propriety of a single regulator making decisions even of that kind. 
The registrar will deal with decisions that may affect the fate of the democracy—possibly almost 
irreversibly, depending on the policies of the parties that are contesting the election. For example, the 
Government’s wide-ranging constitutional reform programme means that the result of an election may 
fundamentally affect the democracy. There are, therefore, ample grounds for removing from the registrar 
the burden of making the final decision. A rational system of appeal should be installed, in line with long-
established precedent for administrative action on this scale of importance in terms of the British 
constitution.
<P>
Conservative Members have sought to incorporate a method of appeal that is in the spirit of the Bill. 
Clause 10(1) stipulates that the Speaker’s Committee should be used as the source of advice for the 
registrar. We seek a minimal change that would alter the role of that committee so as to give it the 
additional role of a court appeal. I accept that that perhaps creates a slight tension: it may be difficult for 
the registrar to consult the committee given that it is the body to which an appeal may be made against his 
decisions. That may be an uncomfortable relationship for the registrar. If that is the Minister’s view, the 
remedy would lie in appointing another body to be the consultative body, while still using the laudable 
device of the Speaker’s Committee as the appeal body. For example, the Speaker herself, or designated 
officials, could be the advisory body. The Speaker’s Committee is well constituted to act as an appeal 
body.
<P>
The amendment states that the committee’s determination of the appeal “shall be final”. We want to 
restore an element of what we imagine the Bill aims to achieve—the minimisation of complex procedures 
and proceedings. The amendment would limit recourse to the courts, after providing a formal and 
ordinary and process of fair appeal.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment is in the spirit of the Bill, and uses a mechanism established in the proposals. It 
would allow a greater sense of fair play and remove from one individual the burden of a final decision that 
could be too great for that person to make alone.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will acknowledge those non-partisan remarks, even if he is not persuaded to 
accept the amendment, and that he will reconsider the matter.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> I want to record our support for the thrust of what the hon. Member for West 
Dorset (Mr. Letwin) has said. I understood that the purpose of the Bill was to ensure that the democratic 
process was protected, and to allow common sense and natural justice to prevail in decisions about people 
who want to circumvent a party’s rules and regulations.
<P>
An unchallengeable case has been made for the Speaker’s Committee as the appeal mechanism. The 
alternative would be to take matters to the courts, but I thought that the Bill was designed to prevent that. 
I hope that the Minister will accept the arguments that have been advanced.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> This has been an interesting and useful debate. It will give people who go to 
law or interpret the law on this matter the opportunity to examine our intention. I hope to convince the 
Committee that the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
No discredit should be attached to the Home Office or our officials, but the hon. Member for West 
Dorset gets the prize for spotting the deliberate mistake in the clause. The first prize may be the 
membership of a future Standing Committee considering data protection, although goodness knows what 
the second prize would be. The hon. Gentleman is right to point out that the phrase “section 2” in clause 
10(1) is a misprint that will be corrected to “section 3” when the Bill is reprinted.
<P>
I appreciate the reasons for seeking to provide an avenue of appeal for parties against certain 
decisions of the registrar, but I cannot recommend either of the amendments to the Committee. The hon. 
Member for West Dorset set out his argument lucidly, but I am not sure that amendment No. 30 would 
achieve what he wants. I do not see the use in an appeal to the Speaker’s Committee if the registrar had 
acted on that committee’s advice when refusing an application. I am not clear about the appeal 
mechanism that would be appropriate after that.
<P>
The registrar is likely to seek advice in just those delicately balanced cases that the hon. Member for 
West Dorset described. One party might be disposed to challenge a refusal to grant an application, but 
another party might challenge a decision to grant such an application. It must be left to the registrar to 
decide what are appropriate matters for the Speaker’s Committee.
<P>
New clause 3 is not appropriate. It is not for the courts to determine issues of registration, although it 
is for them to rule where the law has been misapplied. As the hon. Member for West Dorset said, a 
remedy exists by way of judicial review, without the need for an express provision. He correctly described 
the limited availability of judicial review, but there is no obvious alternative or appellate body that could 
be brought into play in the Bill. Moreover, if the registrar failed to register one of the main parties and the 
matter went to judicial review, the decision would be seen as perverse. It would not stand an earthly 
chance of getting past the first stage of any judicial review process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Is the Minister suggesting that he can predict that a judge would take the view that a 
decision by the registrar which eliminated one of the mainstream parties was ipso facto unreasonable? I 
cannot understand why the Minister is confident of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> It is difficult to predict, and I am loathe to be drawn into a detailed debate about the 
workings of the courts for the obvious reason that each case is separate and individual and the 
circumstances have to be considered on their merits alone. My earlier point was that if the law had been 
misapplied—that is the major factor that the courts would have to take into account when determining 
whether to grant leave to bring in a judicial review—any decision concerning one of the main parties 
would be considered perverse. I will leave the hon. Gentleman and the Committee to ponder the 
implications of the very precise use that I have made of the word “perverse”.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not know what the connotations of the word “perverse” are intended to be, but the 
Minister has clearly carefully chosen not to use the term “unreasonable”. There is a distinction between 
new clause 3, under which an appeal on the substantive point lies before the court, and the mechanism for 
which the Bill implicitly provides—judicial review. On the one hand, the court can decide between the 
perversity or otherwise of the decision and its effects; on the other, it can decide only about the 
appropriateness of the procedures used to arrive at that decision. I therefore repeat my question to the 
Minister: how can he feel confident that judicial review proceedings would yield a decision on the effect 
that was in accordance with the consensus among the population?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Let me try to help the hon. Gentleman. I shall take the example of his party for no 
other reason than that it is convenient to do so. The historic links between his party and the name 
“Conservative” are well known and understood in the House and elsewhere. If the registrar refused, 
therefore, to grant the use of the name “Conservative party” to the hon. Gentleman’s party, that would be 
a perverse position. By perverse, I mean also unreasonable. The reasonability of such a refusal would be a 
factor to be weighed in the balance. In those circumstances, a judicial review would be bound to uphold 
the challenge to the refusal. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The amendment would cause two bodies to be set up. One would be the Speaker’s Committee; the 
other body would have the responsibility of trying to judge the rights and wrongs of a decision by the 
registrar that might have been upheld by the Speaker’s Committee. I do not believe that any other body 
could be better placed to make such a judgment than the Speaker’s Committee. Its constitution, terms of 
reference and access to the collective wisdom about political parties available in the House—and, with the 
possible exception of a couple of university departments, nowhere else is there as much knowledge of 
parties’ political history and backgrounds—mean that no other body could be constituted that would be so 
well suited to making those determinations.
<P>
We are not aiming to give the Speaker’s Committee a self-policing role. We want simply to draw on 
the expertise and knowledge of political parties that exists in the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I draw the Minister’s attention to the difference between what he has just said and the 
drafting of clause 10(1). The Minister almost implied that he could not envisage that, in finely balanced 
decision, the registrar would fail to follow the advice of the Speaker’s Committee. However, clause 10(1) 
is permissive, providing only that he “may seek advice” from that committee. He may choose not to seek 
that advice: even if he does, he could reject it.
<P>
We are not keen to create another body so much as to give the body that the Bill proposes a greater 
and more final say. We accept that the Speaker’s Committee will be supremely qualified, but we are not 
sure that that is relevant. The real question is whether it should be given more decisive powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That is not quite what the amendment is about. The hon. Member for West Dorset 
may care to reflect on what was said a moment ago, but if the registrar refers a decision to the Speaker’s 
Committee and is not happy with the advice that he gets from it, he will have the opportunity to go back to 
the committee. He can do so on a point of detail or of principle—by which I mean that he might disagree 
with a factual interpretation.
<P>
If that to-ing and fro-ing takes place, it is difficult to believe that any doubts or queries on the 
registrar’s part could not be accommodated, given the possibility of two bites at the Speaker’s Committee 
cherry. The Speaker’s Committee will have the most appropriate information available, so it will provide 
the best mechanism that we can achieve. To interpose between the registrar and the Speaker’s Committee 
some other body or process would create the potential for even more confusion. In contrast, the Bill is 
straightforward and workable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> With his usual courtesy, the Minister has engaged in a considerable amount of debate. I 
understand his reluctance to create unnecessarily burdensome arrangements, but he has not addressed the 
kernel of the argument.
<P>
Amendment No. 30 suggests as a first alternative the replacement of a potentially advisory role for 
the Speaker’s Committee with a mandatory appellate role in circumstances in which one of the political 
parties involved feels that it has been unjustly treated. Will the Minister explain why the committee, 
which he has rightly described as likely to contain the greatest possible wealth of information and 
knowledge on the subject, would be inappropriate as the final appellate body?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We suggested as a second alternative—they are mutually exclusive—the possibility of an appeal to 
the court. The Minister has said why he does not like that proposal. He made some comforting and helpful 
remarks about what he thinks ought to be the view of judges as to the reasonableness of a decision by the 
registrar against one of the major political parties. That perhaps removes the need for us to concentrate on 
our second alternative. However, we are then thrust back to the first alternative. We still believe that the 
Minister’s arguments are right and that the Speaker’s Committee is likely to be in a good position to make 
judgments. However, as a sole individual, the registrar is an appropriate scale of body to make such large-
scale decisions. The committee should therefore act as a final court of appeal.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale pointed out to me that there is a difference between a 
process in which a registrar consults the committee, with the relevant political parties outside that process, 
and a process in which the political parties that are affected are the prime movers and are able to make 
their own representations in their own cases. If the political parties could send memoranda to the 
Speaker’s Committee, the committee would be under no obligation to entertain such submissions or to 
review them properly. We should bear in mind that the registrar, not the committee, would be the subject 
of the judicial review or the reasonableness test. We are unclear as to the extent to which the registrar 
would have to entertain such submissions in order to qualify as reasonable. Will the Minister confirm that 
he would regard it as essential, if the reasonableness test is to be passed, that the registrar should entertain 
such submissions? Does he feel, furthermore, that it would be more appropriate for a committee, rather 
than an individual, to be the recipient of those submissions as the final court of appeal? I hope that the 
Minister will reconsider the matter and table his own amendments at a later stage so as to improve the 
situation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> For the purposes of clarity, I shall explain what the effect of the amendments would 
be. Amendment No. 30 and new clause 3 would provide an appeal against a refusal by the registrar to 
grant an application to register a party’s name or emblem or to alter its existing entry. Under amendment 
No. 30, the appeal would lie to the Speaker’s Committee and the committee’s decision would be final. 
New clause 3 would provide for an appeal to “the court” without specifying what the court is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It appears that our drafting was inadequate. The amendments are intended to be 
mutually exclusive alternatives, the acceptance of one or the other of which would satisfy us. We prefer 
amendment No. 30 to new clause 3. New clause 3 refers to the High Court: it is a matter of infelicitous 
drafting if that is not clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall finish the point to remove any misunderstanding. In certain limited 
circumstances, a party dissatisfied with the registrar’s decision might apply successfully for judicial 
review. Apart from applications based on the argument that the registrar had misapplied the law, a 
challenge would probably need to be on what is known as Wednesbury unreasonable grounds: that is, 
when a decision of the registrar is so unreasonable that no reasonably minded person, properly advised, 
could have reached it.
<P>
In the end, we must assume that the arrangements will mean that the registrar will take any proper 
advice received. Anything else cannot be contemplated. It is sometimes argued that the law should cover 
all circumstances and possibilities, but we want the Bill to be reasonable. We must assume that the 
registrar will behave reasonably and that the relationship with the Speaker’s Committee will be such as to 
render the anxieties of the hon. Member for West Dorset groundless.
<P>
As the Speaker’s Committee will have an appellate role, there must be formal procedures. For 
example, both sides will be able to use counsel to put their arguments. It is doubtful that a formal legal 
procedure other than judicial review would be appropriate for cases that depend more on feel. All the 
circumstances that may arise will not be covered by one text, nor even by the Bill. It will be a matter of 
interpretation—of history, political development and so on. Therefore, a superior court, as envisaged by 
the hon. Member for West Dorset although not spelt out in his preferred amendment, new clause 3, would 
be a rather blunt instrument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> To correct the Minister, our preferred amendment is amendment No. 30. We accept that 
new clause 3, is a blunt instrument, and acknowledge what the Minister said about the Speaker’s 
Committee. However, for the Minister to argue that we must assume that the registrar, to be reasonable, 
will always have to accept the committee’s advice undercuts the reasoning that he advanced earlier. If the 
registrar will always accept the committee’s advice, might that committee not as well be constituted as the 
formal appeal procedure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am not clear about that. I am worried that I might have misled the Committee a 
moment ago, so I shall explain that point again. I do not consider that the appellate role of the Speaker’s 
Committee will be too formal, nor entirely legalistic. For example, it probably would not involve the use 
of counsel, as I said, misleadingly, a little earlier.
<P>
However, I do not see any point in making the procedures too elaborate, which would be the effect of 
the amendment. The debate has been useful. If I have misunderstood the hon. Member for West Dorset, I 
shall read the Hansard report. I shall think about what has been said and will look at the matter again if 
there is any room for doubt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall not detain the Committee. For the Minister’s ease of reference when he 
reconsiders the matter, let me state again our view as clearly as I can and modify it in the light of what he 
said. In the first place, the registrar—a corporation soul—is not in a good position to make a final 
decision on the substance of a matter that could affect the outcome of an election. Secondly, we would 
prefer the problem to be solved by the remedy of using a Committee that the Minister believes to be well 
constituted for the purpose, subtle and flexible in the right way. That would be preferable to resolving the 
problem through an appeal to the High Court, which is only a second-best solution.
<P>
If there is a reason for removing responsibility for the final decision from the registrar and giving it 
to the committee—the Minister virtually accepted that there was a case for doing so when he said that the 
registrar ought always to follow the committee’s advice under the procedure in the Bill—we should do 
what the Bill does not do and permit a formal and open procedure. Under such a procedure, a party or 
parties could introduce statements and evidence formally and could employ counsel. There would also be 
transparency about a matter that could be of national importance.
<P>
Amendment No. 30, or an appropriately phrased version of it, would open up a process of national 
importance, which would be appropriate. It would open the process up on a matter of substance, not 
merely of procedure, as judicial review would do. It would do that in a way that removed the burden of 
making a final decision for a individual, who may be benevolent, but whose final judgment might not be 
beneficent. That is a thoroughly reasonable set of slight alterations to the Bill. The Minister’s arguments 
do not persuade me—I wonder whether they persuade him—that my line of reasoning is improper.
<P>
I hope that he will go away and consider the matter. We, too, will consider the matter and we are 
open to the suggestion of mechanisms other than that which we have proposed. If the Minister persuades 
us—or, indeed, if we persuade ourselves—that there is a better way of achieving the transparency that we 
seek, we shall be happy to suggest other propositions later, although we might not carry our colleagues 
from the Liberal Democrats with us. We have no great attachment to the particular proceeding that we 
propose; we would, however, like the problem to be resolved in some way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall be brief. The hon. Gentleman perhaps underestimates how capable I am of 
persuading myself of my own arguments. I realise, however, that I have no such power over him.
<P>
The crucial point in the hon. Gentleman’s final contribution—perhaps we should rest on this 
argument—concerned transparency. However, the Speaker’s Committee is finally constituted and whoever 
its members are, it will have to provide a justification for its decisions. That will allow some transparency 
about why it has arrived at a decision. That the is the crucial point. As we develop those practises and as 
the committee’s role develops, I hope that the hon. Gentleman’s fears, which I think he accepts as at the 
margin rather than at the core of the difficulty, will be resolved. I will, however, read the Hansard report 
of our proceedings, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will. If there is any room for doubt about the position 
that I have adopted, I will act accordingly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 33 in, page 5, line 11, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘( ) Paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 1 shall not apply to a first stage application.’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This purely technical amendment will ensure that no established political party with elected 
Members of Parliament need provide an English translation of its name, if it is already in English or 
Welsh, provided that it makes an application for registration during the first transitional stage.
<P>
Schedule 1(2) requires a party that registers its name in a language other than English or Welsh to 
provide an English translation of that name. The provision is intended to be quite straightforward and to 
ensure that, when a party registers a name in a foreign language, the registrar will know what that name 
means in English. He could then judge easily whether the proposed name was obscene or offensive or 
whether voters might confuse it with the name of an existing registered party.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said on Second Reading—col. 517 of Hansard on 4 
June 1998—the provision is intended to assist the registrar with the process of registering a party’s name, 
for example in Gujerati, Urdu, Punjabi or another minority language. It is not intended that the provision 
should require a party such as Sinn Fein, which is long established and has two elected Members of 
Parliament, to provide an English translation of its name.
<P>
Accordingly, the amendment will exempt any party making an application for registration in the 
transitional stage from the requirement to provide an English translation of its name.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 5, line 15, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘one Member of the House of Commons belongs’<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘two Members of the House of Commons belong’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall not detain the Committee, but in many ways clause 16 is the most important in the Bill. It 
establishes the de facto order of precedence, and creates the basis on which existing parties will be 
protected by establishing what might be called an entry barrier to electoral registration. As members of 
existing parties, members of the Committee are content to believe that we represent the spectrum of 
reasonable opinion in this country and therefore support the clause. However, which test should be applied 
to those who seek precedence? It is clear that the test applied could have had nothing to do with the House 
of Commons. For example, it could have been based on the level of popular vote, but the Government 
have specifically chosen a parliamentary test. Regardless of our reservations about that, the amendment is 
tabled in the same spirit.
<P>
We are therefore reduced to the following straightforward question: what is the appropriate 
parliamentary test for seeking precedence? Two notable political parties are represented in the House of 
Commons at present—or perhaps I should say that one and a half such parties are represented.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> Three parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I did not mean that there were only two major political parties—just the opposite. I was 
about to say that there are two—or perhaps one and a half—notable political parties whose party 
representation is slight. One could be called the Scotch Whisky party, or the Bell party, or the 
Independent Fairness and Anti-corruption party—it could seek to register under any such name to achieve 
precedence.
<P>
The Minister said that that party could not register as the Independent party, as that could cause 
problems, but it could represent itself as the party of Independence and Fair Play, or some such title, 
without contravening anything in the Bill.
<P>
We see no reason why that should be given precedence, although we are not saying that the hon. 
Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell) should not have the same rights as the rest of humanity to register a 
political party.
<P>
The other case is that of the party that went out of existence yesterday or the day before, having been 
in existence only briefly—the hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris) party. Who is to predict 
whether it will come back into existence? A slight stroke of the Prime Minister’s pen in regard to parts of 
the kingdom might lead to the re-establishment of that briefly fluorescent party, which was coruscating in 
its brilliance. Whatever our feelings about the matter, we would not abuse the Bill to prevent the hon. 
Member for Leominster or other hon. Members from registering a political party. We do not see, however, 
why it should be given precedence.
<P>
The choice of the figure 2 in place of the Minister’s figure 1 is not arbitrary. The intention is to 
accommodate all mainstream parties, including some with which we in the Committee have severe 
differences in respect of Ulster, but which nevertheless have two Ministers of Parliament. We have, 
therefore, been careful not to use the provision to eliminate any part of the political spectrum that is 
represented seriously in the House of Commons today. Moving from one to two would have the benefit of 
preventing precedence for eccentric parties. that is not to cast aspersions on the hon. Member for Tatton, 
who plays a valuable role in the House; it is, however, not the role of a political party, but an anti-party 
role. We do not see why it should be dignified by precedence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> I oppose the contribution that has just been made. It appears that two or more 
people must be gathered in the sight of the Lord to register as a political party. I suspected from the outset 
that this was the Temple-Morris exclusion amendment, and I am grateful to the hon. Member for West 
Dorset for confirming that.
<P>
We must remember that the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru originally arrived in the House 
with just one hon. Member. If the view that has just been expressed prevailed, another political party that 
arrived on the scene with just one Member of Parliament would not be able to register. There is also the 
case of the UK Unionist Party. I suggest, therefore, that we do not support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale, for allowing me to catch your eye briefly because I hoped 
to intervene on the hon. Gentleman. The provisions are transitional and will have a one-off effect, 
although the Minister may correct me on that. A political party would have to arise and capture a seat 
before the provisions came into effect for the situation to which the hon. Member for Colchester referred 
to occur. That is not plausible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Russell:</B> I am grateful for that clarification. There is always a possibility in the period that still 
has to run out that a person might break away from the Conservative party, for example, and form the UK 
Conservative party. From what the hon. Gentleman says, he would not be allowed to do that.
<P>
Mr. George Howarth: I do not know who the hon. Member for West Dorset thought was the one and 
who was the half in his description of those whom the provisions would affect, and I do not intend to ask 
him.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> However, he slightly miscalculated the number of people covered by the amendment, 
because there are three. The third person, whom he overlooked, was the hon. and learned Member for 
North Down (Mr. McCartney), who describes himself as a United Kingdom Unionist.
<P>
Amendment No. 21 is unnecessary. As the hon. Member for West Dorset said in his exchange with 
the hon. Member for Colchester, the amendment would change the rules in clause 16 for the first 
transitional stage of registration so as to allow only those parties with two or more members elected to the 
House of Commons to register. All the main parties represented in the House of Commons would still 
qualify to apply for registration in the first transitional stage. However, if the amendment were accepted 
the hon. and learned Member for North Down, who has established use of the United Kingdom Unionist 
party label, would not be able to register in the first stage. I see no reason why he should be prevented 
from registering a political party in the first transitional stage.
<P>
As the hon. Member for West Dorset conceded earlier, the difficulties involving the use of the name 
“Independent” by the hon. Member for Tatton will be covered by separate provisions in the Bill. I do not 
want to do anything to damage the interests of my new hon. Friend the Member for Leominster. I hope 
that the hon. Member for West Dorset recognises that the first transitional registration stage should apply 
to all parties that are currently represented in the House of Commons. It would assist his good reputation 
if he were to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Minister assure us that it is not his intention or desire that there should be a 
widespread movement towards the founding of single-member parties between now and the enactment of 
the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Indeed. My objection to the amendment  is based upon that. It is highly unlikely—
unless the hon. Gentleman knows something about the activities of his hon. Friends that he has not shared 
with us—that there will be a rash of new political parties established out of the existing membership of the 
House of Commons between now and the coming into force of the registration process. I am certainly 
confident that that will not happen within my own party.
<P>
I cannot support amendment No. 40. The first transitional phase for registration applies to parties 
that are represented in the House of Commons, as we have just established. It cannot be extended to other 
bodies covered by the Bill without affecting the time scales for registration. For example, I can see no 
reason for giving the new Northern Ireland Assembly precedence over the European Parliament or over 
local authorities in that regard. To include all those bodies would place a difficult burden on the registrar 
in the first six weeks of the registration scheme. I am sure that hon. Members would not wish that to 
happen. The process should be orderly and manageable within the context of the resources that will be 
available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> In the interests of fairness to parties that are not represented in the House of 
Commons but will be represented in the Northern Ireland Assembly, should not those parties also be able 
to register?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Yes. I was just coming to that. The hon. Gentleman’s concerns are unnecessary, as is 
the amendment. No party that is qualified for inclusion in the second stage will be at a disadvantage as, if 
it is using the name that it has historically used, it is very likely to be able to register that name and to 
continue to use it, even if it is similar to another name used by a party that is represented in the House of 
Commons. The second stage gives the party the opportunity to enter into that registration process, as is 
right and proper. We would not want to give parties any discouragement to use the process. I shall not 
enter into a debate with the hon. Member for Colchester regarding established parties that have similar 
names to that of his party: The Committee has already discussed that.
<P>
The process will enable those parties not represented in the House to register at the appropriate 
stage—the second transitional stage—in a way that will not disadvantage them. Equally important, the 
process will not overburden the registrar. The process will be orderly and will accommodate all the 
interests of all parties that wish to register.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Our previous debate was about a matter of substance, but we do not feel deeply about 
this point. The Minister’s arguments about the previous amendment did not persuade me entirely, but I 
take his serious point about the hon. and learned Member for North Down. We overlooked that matter. I 
do not know whether the hon. and learned Gentleman represents a party or a label, but the potential for 
him to achieve precedence for his label is in a different category from that of the hon. Member belonging 
to the Independence and Fairness party.

I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
We have discussed already, in connection with schedule 2, the important role of returning officers. I 
remind the Committee that the notes on clauses state that schedule 2(3)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“provides for rule 12 which deals with the validity of ballot papers to be amended to require 
returning officers to make decisions as to whether a nomination paper breaks rule 6A as soon as possible 
after the close of the period for delivery of nomination papers.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is clear that the returning officer has an important role in achieving the Bill’s intention to prevent 
candidates from standing on a ticket that impersonates another candidate or causes confusion to the 
electorate.
<P>
I should be astounded if the Minister were to reply in the negative, but we believe that the Home 
Secretary will have to issue a guidance note to returning officers. The Minister nods. I am grateful to him. 
The only question that remains is whether the Bill should create such a requirement or, as the new clause 
does, give some indication of what that guidance should cover. Proposed subsection (2) of new clause 2 
would require a clear statement of the intention to achieve consistency throughout the country.
<P>
In a nutshell, provision for the guidance that will be necessary should be included in the Bill rather 
than left to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): I support the hon. Member for Rydale (Mr. Greenway). This is an 
important new clause. In the Literal Democrat High Court case, it was established that the returning 
officer’s duty was simply to determine whether nominations met the conditions laid down. Those 
conditions were that there should be the right number of nominees, that the description had the right 
number of words and that none of those words were likely to offend.
<P>
The Bill will put the returning officer in a slightly different position, and the descriptions that should 
not be accepted must be made absolutely clear. As a result, parties could be placed in difficulties. The 
High Court case establishing the extent of the returning officer’s duties established also that English 
political parties did not exist in English law. The bill changes that, and that is why the new clause is 
necessary.
<P>
The absence of recognition in English law means that the Conservative party could not use the courts 
to establish the correct Conservative holder of title. That problem has plagued the Liberal Democrats since 
the agreement to merge the assets of the SDP and the Liberal party. Liberal Democrats can claim to be the 
successors of the SDP and the Liberal party, but they cannot prove it in law. The Bill must make it clear 
that the successors to previous parties will be recognised.
<P>
 Inconsistencies will occur unless the Secretary of State makes a clear statement in the guidance of 
what is required of those poor souls who must deal with candidates flapping pieces of paper at them at the 
last minute. There is not enough time after nominations close to allow a proper remedy in case of conflict 
or dispute.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I understand the points made by the hon. Members for Torbay (Mr Sanders) 
and for Ryedale. I can see why they feel strongly that the Bill needs to have a provision such as that 
described in new clause 2.
<P>
However, although I accept that decisions about nomination papers can sometime be difficult and 
uncomfortable for those who have to deal with them, I do not want to be too prescriptive, nor to fetter 
unduly a returning officer’s discretion in the exercise of his powers under the Representation of the People 
Act 1983. The Bill does attempt to remedy the problems described by the hon. Member for Torbay. I do 
not agree that it needs to be written into the Bill, but I accept that the Secretary of State will have to 
provide advice and guidance. I can assure both hon. Gentlemen that my right hon. Friend will discuss 
with the registrar and representatives of returning officers what information it would be appropriate to 
make available to assist returning offers in making their decisions under new rule 6(a), how they should 
collate and promulgate that information and when and how often to do so. I give an undertaking that any 
guidance that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State issues on the matter to the registrar and to 
returning officers will be placed in the House of Commons Library. We intend to follow the process, 
although it is not necessary to make provision in the Bill. We accept the necessity of making information 
available and we will put it in the House of Commons Library.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Is the Minister saying that if the society of returning officers say “No Minister, we do 
not want the discretion,” he will consider issuing clear guidance on what returning officers can and 
cannot accept?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> We intend to issue guidance and to have consultations with those concerned. The 
concerns that the hon. Member for Torbay predicts would be dealt with at an earlier stage and it would not 
be necessary for returning officers to say, so far down the line, “Sorry, we do not want the discretion.” 
They would have raised concerns during discussions with officials who represent my right hon. Friend the 
Secretary of State. Indeed, as the Minister with responsibility for such matters, I meet them regularly. 
There is no basis for the fear that they would not tell us of their concerns at an early stage and that we 
would take no notice of them. For all that those of us who stand for election and those who support us 
experience difficulties on occasion, none of us would seriously question the fair-minded and even-handed 
way in which electoral administrators conduct themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> The returning officer does not exercise discretion over descriptions; that was 
established in the High Court. The Bill will give him a discretion that he has not previously enjoyed. One 
of the defences made by the returning officer in the High Court case was that he did not want the 
discretion. He said that it was not a matter for him and that he just needed to ensure that the nomination 
paper was good and true in form.
<P>
<B>Mr . Howarth:</B> I believe that it would be unlawful to go further than we propose. Guidance must be 
precisely that—it must guide people and give them a clear idea of how to proceed in circumstances that, I 
accept, are sometimes difficult. We should leave it at that, except to say that there will be consultations on 
these matters. Where guidance is necessary, it will be provided; where it is not, it will not. We have to 
give the process a chance to work in the way that we have described. To fetter or prescribe closely the way 
in which the registrar operates would be more dangerous than the alternative that I propose in the Bill.
<P>
I recognise the fears and experiences that all hon. Members have, but we should be guided by the 
advice. I therefore seek the compliance of the hon. Member for Ryedale in withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am glad to have had the opportunity to provoke a discussion between the Minister 
and the hon. Member for Torbay. Having made that weak joke, I should say that the Committee must take 
note of the hon. Gentleman’s experience in such matters. I am grateful not to have had the same 
experience and I never want to. The point that he made is extremely important. He is right to suggest that 
returning officers will probably want the minimum of discretion. However, schedule 2 clearly intends to 
give them discretion, so guidance is crucial. The Minister has confirmed that guidance will be issued and 
that consultation will take place. Will he, from a sedentary position, reassure me that the consultation will 
involve the main registered political parties that intend to put up candidates at elections?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth indicated assent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I take that to be a nod. It is unthinkable that it should be otherwise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> To help the hon. Gentleman, who seeks to seduce me along all sorts of highways and 
byways, I should point out that I chair a working party on electoral procedures on which all the relevant 
experts and bodies are represented. The representatives of the three political parties on that committee are 
happy to use it to consider any difficulties that the hon. Gentleman believes to be still outstanding. That is 
the type of consultation that I have in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, and I am pleased to have offered him some seduction at 
such an early hour of the day. On the basis of his remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>Political Parties</center></H4>
<H4><center>New Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exception of registered political parties from the Sex Discrimination Act 1975.</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘.—(1) The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 shall be amended as follows.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) After subsection (3) of section 33 (exception for political parties) insert—
<P>
(4) Nothing in this Act shall render unlawful an act in relation to the selection of candidates for 
elections to be held under list systems which is designed to secure gender balance among the selection of 
candidates by political parties registered under the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998.”.’.—
[Mr. Bob Russell.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
All the political parties are united in the desire for a more equal balance gender balance at all levels 
of government, whether it be local councils, regional assemblies or Parliament. New clause 4 is intended  
to assist that by exempting political parties’ selection of candidates—their list systems—from sex 
discrimination legislation. The new clause would allow parties, if they wish, to use systems of selection to 
achieve gender balance. It seeks to clear up the confusion that surrounds the legality of choosing 
candidates, with the aim of achieving an equal number of male and female members of the legislature 
concerned.
<P>
All hon. Members will be aware that in 1996 an industrial tribunal decided that the Labour party’s 
single-sex shortlists were contrary to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. The case in question is listed as 
Jepson v. the Labour Party. While the decision of an industrial tribunal does not set a legal precedent, it 
contradicts the advice that was given to the Equal Opportunities Commission by leading counsel before 
and after the case. That advice stated that the the selection of parliamentary candidates did not fall within 
the scope of the Sex Discrimination Act, or within that of the European Community’s equal treatment 
directive. The Equal Opportunities Commission stated in a consultation paper in January 1998:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“What is not clear is whether the SDA (Sex Discrimination Act) has any bearing on the process of 
selecting parliamentary candidates.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, the law requires clarification. No political party should be expected to bear the costs of 
going to court to determine whether a selection system is lawful. The new clause would clarify the law and 
allow parties to use systems that create gender balance in their selection of candidates.
<P>
In November 1995, the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats in Scotland signed an electoral 
agreement. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The Scottish Labour party and the Scottish Liberal Democrats formally agree to accept the 
principle that there should be an equal number of men and women as members of the first Scottish 
Parliament. In order to achieve this aim, the parties agree and commit themselves to:
<P>
Select and field an equal number of male and female candidates for election, taking into account 
both the constituency and additional member list candidates;
<P>
Ensure that these candidates are equally distributed with a view to the winnability of seats’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats had hoped and expected that clarification of the law would have been 
included in the Scotland Bill before a gender-balanced system was undertaken. Sadly, no such 
clarification was forthcoming; the Liberal Democrats decided not to adopt a formal mechanism for the 
selection of male and female candidates, while remaining fully committed to the principles set out in the 
electoral agreement.
<P>
Amendments to the Scotland Bill were debated on 31 March, but defeated by the Government. In 
response, the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office, the hon. Member for Central 
Fife (Mr. McLeish), said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“the risks for breaching our Community obligations are too great and . . . we would be inviting a 
damaging and disruptive challenge.”—[Official Report, 31 March 1998; Vol. 309, c. 1145.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He added that selection processes would be disrupted.
<P>
Selection is well under way for the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh assembly, and any challenge 
would probably be too late to disrupt selection for the first elections. The new clause would clarify the 
position for future elections.
<P>
I am advised that the Labour party is using systems of “twinning” constituencies in Scotland and 
Wales. The Government should stand by their convictions and include new clause 4 in the Bill to prevent 
further confusion and to allow women to secure better representation in the Scottish Parliament, the 
Welsh assembly, Westminster, Northern Ireland and the European Parliament.

<P>

<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I am sure that it will surprise neither the hon. Gentleman nor the Committee if 
I say that I have every sympathy with the intention behind the new clause. Even with the improvement at 
the general election, women remain under-represented in the House. Only 15 of the 87 UK Members of 
the European Parliament are women and, as the hon. Gentleman said, all political parties want there to be 
more women in the Welsh and Scottish bodies than currently are represented in any equivalent bodies.
<P>
We want the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh assembly to start on a proper footing, with all 
sections of the community, including women, being properly represented. We welcome any efforts to 
increase the number of women selected as candidates, but the hon. Member for Colchester will not be 
surprised that the line taken by my hon. Friend the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish 
Office, has not changed. I cannot advise the Committee to accept the new clause.
<P>
I do not want to offend the hon. Member for Colchester, but my advice is not a matter of the 
Government’s commitment, but simply a question of law. The hon. Gentleman quoted from the 31 March 
debate on the Scotland Bill, when the position was set out clearly. We are not operating solely within the 
sphere of domestic law: we must also consider the international dimensions. As the hon. Gentleman 
rightly said, the UK is bound by the provisions of the European Union’s equal treatment directive. Any 
amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act enabling the parties to avoid the provisions of that legislation 
might be found to be in breach of the directive. We could not guarantee that political parties would be free 
from challenge. The challenge could arise in our domestic courts, which could then refer a case to the 
European Court of Justice. The result could severely disrupt candidates’ election procedures, to say 
nothing of the shadow that would be cast over the elections. That is a powerful point, which we would do 
well not to ignore.
<P>
I am aware that there are different legal opinions on the subject and that the Liberal Democrats have 
consulted an eminent and, dare I say it, well-connected Queen’s Counsel. I can only emphasise that the 
Government have given the subject the most careful consideration. Our view remains that if we enacted 
the provisions in the new clause, there would be a strong risk that we would be in breach of our 
Community obligations. We would be inviting a damaging and disruptive legal challenge. No. responsible 
Government could go along that road.
<P>
I cannot support the new clause. As I have made clear, however, the Government share the objective 
of ensuring that more women achieve elected office. Much can be done within the existing legal 
framework. My party will explore every avenue to find women and to promote their candidacy, and I trust 
that the Liberal Democrats will do the same. I was going to make the same point to the hon. Member for 
Ryedale, but I am sure that his party will do the same in its own distinctive way. I am however, reminded 
of the debate in the House a few weeks ago, when the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) 
made a contribution that somewhat enraged the more enlightened of us, as is his wont. I was tempted at 
the time to tell him that although he might represent the New Forest, he could not be taken to be a new 
man—but I thought better of it.
<P>
On that point, it is important that all political parties give great thought within the existing 
framework of the law to the ways in which we can promote more women candidates. Those hon. Members 
who have been in the House since before the election must have observed that, for all the flak that women 
Members of Parliament get, their presence in large numbers in what was previously a male-dominated 
institution improves it. As part of my responsibilities, I spend some time visiting prisons. I could make the 
same observation about the larger number of women in prisons as I have about the House of Commons. I 
will leave the Committee to draw its own conclusions from that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> I am grateful for the Minister’s sympathies and for the fact that he supports—as I 
am sure we all do—the spirit behind seeking to use every measure possible to achieve a fair gender 
balance in all our elected assemblies. I obviously regret that he cannot accept the new clause.
<P>
I acknowledge that we are dealing with a question of law, which the new clause attempts to address. 
The Minister advised the Committee that domestic and international law is such that the new clause could 
create more difficulties than it would resolve. I am not sure whether that is correct, but I take the 
Minister’s comments on board and, on balance, I have to accept them. I am, however, a little disappointed 
because I thought that the idea behind the Bill was to remove difficulties and to create common sense 
solutions. We are all agreed that there is a need for more women to come into Parliament and the other 
assemblies.
<P>
Although I will withdraw the motion, I hope that the Minister will consider seriously what I and 
others have said to see whether mechanism can be devised to allow political parties to present more 
women candidates in winnable seats, without the full force of law being invoked to disrupt the process.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 41, in page 8, line 13, leave out ‘or Welsh’ and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘, Welsh, Cornish, Scottish Gaelic or Irish Gaelic’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the debate on the Floor of the House, the Home Secretary referred to the difficulties of a Mebian 
Kernow candidate standing in Scunthorpe. I was assured by the chairman of Mebian Kernow that the 
party had no intention of putting up a candidate anywhere east of the Tamar, and I said that I would 
report that to Parliament this week.
<P>
However, an important point arises about indigenous and non-indigenous British languages. If Sinn 
Fein and Plaid Cymru can use those party descriptions, it should also be right for other Gaelic or Cornish 
language parties to use their preferred descriptions without an English translation.
<P>
Mebian Kernow provides a good example. What does it mean? In answer, most people would say 
that it is the Cornish nationalist party. People in Cornwall who do not speak Cornish would say that it is 
the party of Cornwall. Mebian Kernow actually means “Sons of Cornwall”: if that were used as the 
English translation, would not it fall foul of equal opportunities legislation?
<P>
If Mebian Kernow is forced to provide an English translation, it will have to use one that is not 
literal. The phrase “Sons of Cornwall” will confuse people who think of it as the Cornish national party or 
the party of Cornwall. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the role of indigenous British languages 
and the circumstances of parties using Gaelic or Cornish. I hope that he will allow those parties not to 
provide a translation: people pretty much know what they are, as the electoral record demonstrates.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, Amendment No. 41 would exclude from the 
requirement to provide an English translation the names of parties in Cornish or Scottish Gaelic or Irish 
Gaelic. However, we do not consider that the Bill should give special status to names in any language 
other than English or Welsh.
<P>
The Welsh language already has separated statutory protection under the Welsh Language Act 1993. 
Other languages simply do not have that status. We live in a multicultural society, and could be an 
argument that languages such as Turkish and Punjabi could be exempted equally justifiably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I am interested in indigenous languages.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> We are a multicultural society, and it depends how one defines “indigenous”. People 
speaking Punjabi or Turkish belong to families that have been here for generations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I agree with the Minister. Anyone who goes to Bradford will know that he is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Absolutely. I am not trying to make a clever debating point. The hon. Member for 
Ryedale is supporting a serious contention: real  problems of definition of what constitutes an indigenous 
language would arise if the amendment were accepted. The requirement in paragraph 2(2) for a 
translation of a party’s name is an entirely simple and straightforward provision.
<P>
The registrar will need to know what the party’s name means so that he can judge whether it is 
obscene or offensive or otherwise meets the tests in clause 3. If the registrar were not automatically 
provided with an English translation, he would need to obtain one, which would add delay to the 
registration process. Of course, being based in Cardiff, the registrar should have little difficulty in 
ascertaining the meaning of a party’s name in Welsh—although problems with pronunciation may 
remain.
<P>
However, just as important, the Bill provides that the register of political parties will include the 
English translation of a name not in English or Welsh. That will mean that a returning officer knows 
what the name of a party registered in a language other than English or Welsh means. This will help him 
to ensure that, when he applies the test of new rule 6A in schedule 2, he does not allow another candidate 
to use a description that might lead voters to associate that candidate with the registered party concerned. 
If he does not know what the name means, this could be a difficult test to apply, and having an English 
translation on the register will help to make sure that the party is protected against misleading candidates.
<P>
I know that the hon. Gentleman’s intentions are good. I hope that he will accept that we cannot give 
a special status to any language other than English or Welsh. To do so would open a can of worms that 
could undermine the Bill’s central provisions.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I think that I understand the Minister’s explanation, but he has not said why Sinn Fein 
does not have to give a translation. The logic of his argument surely means that it should.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Sinn Fein does not have to supply a translation for the common sense reason that it 
has been established for a long time. People know the meaning of those words, whether they speak 
English or Irish Gaelic. In those circumstances, a translation is not necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> The citizens of Penzance would probably think differently: they would say that Mebian 
Kernow is a long-established party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The citizens of Penzance may feel differently, but I doubt that Sinn Fein is likely to 
have candidates there. By the same token, none of the named Cornish parties will stand in Northern 
Ireland.

perhaps return to it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 43, in page 9, line 17, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(1A) A nomination paper may not refer to a candidate by a name which has been adopted by that 
candidate in substitution for a name previously used by him and which is likely to lead voters to confuse 
the candidate with a candidate representing a registered political party.’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I said on the Floor of the House, there is only one Andrew Mackinlay but people often stand for 
election with names on the ballot paper that look remarkably like Roy Jenkins or Margaret Thatcher. 
Similar attempts were also made at the general election. The amendment would prevent candidates from 
changing their names to ones that may cause confusion. It would prevent candidates from registered 
political parties from using their new names on the ballot paper.
<P>
The Bill is designed to ensure that the electorate is not misled. The spirit of the amendment should 
be taken on board and returned to at a later stage.
<P>
The amendment would stop people changing their names so as deliberately to confuse the electorate. 
Several hon. Members have been on the receiving end of the practice by which a person changes their 
name to that of the sitting Member of Parliament or another candidate. As it stands, the Bill will not 
prevent that. We have already discussed the confusion that can arise from the names of political parties. 
The Bill should equally take into account misleading or confusing candidate names. The amendment 
would remove a major risk of confusion on the ballot paper. It is a simple proposal, and I hope that the 
Minister will take it on board. If the wording does not meet with his approval, perhaps he could propose 
an alternative version.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The amendment aims to prevent a person from adopting a name that is 
identical or similar to that of a candidate of a registered party. However, it is unnecessary because in 
recent cases courts have been willing to prevent such practices. For example, in the 1997 general election 
a candidate was prevented from standing in North-East Bedfordshire against Sir Nicholas Lyell, the 
Conservative party candidate, under the assumed name of Nicholas Lyell.
<P>
Whatever view the courts may take of future cases, the Bill’s other provisions make it unlikely that 
such tactics, even if they survived a court challenge, would be successful in misleading the electorate. The 
genuine candidate would be able to use the party name and emblem, which would not be available to the 
bogus candidate. The Bill already provides protections that obviate the need for an amendment of this 
nature. The hon. Gentleman’s motives are fine, but he should give the new procedures a fair run. I am 
sure that he will be satisfied by them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> The Minister has responded vigorously. I hope that after the Bill is enacted there 
will be no occurrences—particularly in his own constituency—that give him cause to regret his rejection 
of the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 44 in page 9, line 33, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(3A) After rule 18 (Poll to be taken by ballot) insert—
<P>
“Election publications
<P>
18A. A person shall not—
<P>
(a) print or publish, or cause to be printed or published, any bill, placard or poster having reference 
to an election or any document distributed for the purpose of promoting or procuring the election of a 
candidate, or
<P>
(b) post or cause to be posted any such bill, placard or poster as mentioned above, or
<P>
(c) distribute or cause to be distributed any printed document for that purpose, if the bill, placard, 
poster or document bears upon its face the description of a candidate (including the name of any registered 
political party) which the returning officer has declined to allow to be included in a nomination paper 
under rule 6A.”.’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I trust that I shall have better luck this time.
<P>
The amendment deals with what happens beyond the scope of the ballot paper. It is intended to 
prevent candidates from using a description on their election literature that the returning officer has 
refused to allow as a description on the ballot paper. The Bill allows a returning officer to refuse a 
candidate permission to use a description that may cause confusion on a ballot paper with a registered 
party. However, it does not prevent such a candidate from using the rejected description on his or her 
election literature.
<P>
All members of the Committee are experienced enough to know that people use many devious tricks 
with the aim of deceiving the electorate. A candidate would not be allowed to use the words “Literal 
Democrat” on the ballot paper, but could advertise himself or herself as such on the election literature to 
the extent that voters would associate his or her name with those words. That could cause confusion. One 
could have the Conservatory candidate in the shape of the double-glazing salesman; the problem is not 
restricted to the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
The amendment would improve the Bill’s quality by reducing the options that were available to those 
who wanted to confuse and mislead the electorate. I welcome the bill, which will improve matters and be a 
challenge for those who want to abuse the system. I hope, however, that the Minister can give some 
reassurances if he cannot accept the totality of my proposal.
<P>
<H5>12.30pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I shall not detain the Committee long. The hon. Member for Colchester 
anticipated that I would not agree with him. the problem that he seeks to tackle is that of misleading 
candidates and descriptions on the ballot paper. In practice, most spoiler candidates would avoid drawing 
attention to themselves by means of a great deal of election literature and publicity. That would have the 
opposite effect from that which the hon. Gentleman suggested. Such candidates need to say as little as 
possible about themselves so that they are confused in the electorate’s mind with the genuine candidate. 
The hon. Member for Torbay is in his place, and I should be interested to hear whether he can confirm my 
understanding that the Literal Democrat candidate in the 1994 European parliamentary elections did not 
put out any literature. That would confirm my point.
<P>
In most cases, there is every opportunity during an election for the real identity of the political 
parties—certainly under the new arrangements—to be established. Although the hon. Gentleman’s 
argument is interesting, the problem that he describes is unlikely to arise other than in the case, to which 
he alluded, of a bogus candidate using literature to advertise a product or service. That is, however, a 
separate problem, which is not likely to mislead the electorate; rather, the intention is to do something 
entirely different.
<P>
The argument is interesting, but we should not detain ourselves on it. The amendment is not 
necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister’s analysis is correct. It seems pointless to advertise a name or political 
identity that will not appear on the ballot paper. I want to impress one other thing on the Minister, should 
he and the Secretary of State consider further changes in legislation. Amendment Number 44 seeks to 
amend existing election regulations, rather than formally amend the Bill. In respect of impersonation or 
misleading literature, the Minister should have regard to the growing practice among political parties of 
putting out leaflets that appear to have been published by another party or organisation. That has 
happened to me on three occasions; more to the point, it happened quite markedly to the Labour candidate 
for Ryedale at the general election. There may be abuses that need to be tackled, and I hope that the 
Minister and the Secretary of State will consider them. If we are going to change poll regulations as they 
effect elections, all impersonations and attempts to mislead ought to be ruled out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The practice described by the hon. Member for Ryedale is to be deplored. I can see 
that it would be a problem if people sought to misrepresent the views of a candidate by putting out bogus 
literature that could be taken as being issued on that candidate’s behalf. Perhaps people are more honest in 
my part of the world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> They know that you will win.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Possibly, but I have no direct personal experience of what the hon. Gentleman has 
described. However, I shall give thought to it and bring it to the attention of the working party that I chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> I suggest that, at local decision-making level, all established political parties can 
stand accused in the way suggested by the hon. Member for Rydale. Heaven forbid that any national party 
would dream of putting out literature as happened on the eve of the 1992 poll. That literature purported to 
show that Liberal Democrats wanted Labour to win. I am sure that Conservative central office did not 
intend that literature to deceive. Even so, the hon. Gentleman’s point is valid and needs to be tackled.
<P>
Before I withdraw the amendment, I point out that the political control of Essex county council 
changed after the 1997 county council elections. A Conservative candidate stood against the official party 
candidate. His literature prominently displayed him as a Conservative, and the Conservative vote was 
split. The seat was won by a Liberal Democrat, and the council’s political complexion was altered.

Question proposed, That this schedule be the Third schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee, but I said when we debated the sittings 
motion that I was worried about the real meaning of paragraph 2, and especially about the proposed 
change to the nomination of candidates introduced by new rule 6(A). The Minister has written to me, for 
which I am grateful. People who read our proceedings must understand that the intention of the Bill is 
that no one shall be permitted to stand as a candidate for any registered party in any of the elections 
covered by the Bill without a certificate that authorises his candidature and accompanies the nomination 
papers.  They must also understand that the returning officer should reject the nomination of a person who 
does not have such a certificate. I think that I have got the meaning absolutely right—the Minister is 
nodding in agreement. It is an extremely important matter and a huge departure from usual practice. We 
are concerned to ensure that that is precisely what the provision means because is has to be a belt and 
braces job. For the reasons that I have set out, however, the Minister is right to be so confident that the 
abuses that we have discussed in regard to impersonations will not arise.
<P>
The other question that I wanted to ask was whether any thought had been given to the continuing 
practice of including candidates’ home addresses on the nomination paper. In the past, long before a 
candidate stood or even put the name of the party for which he stood on the ballot paper, his home address 
served as identification; it is now common practice to use the parties for that purpose. In the Bill, we are 
saying that the candidate will stand for a registered political party. Emblems and logos might even be 
added. Should we, therefore, continue with the practice of using candidates’ home addresses, which, as we 
are all aware, has created difficulties for individual candidates from time to time? It is not a matter with 
which we want the Minister to deal now or which we want to press, but the debate provided a good 
opportunity to mention it. Consideration might be given to it by the working party to which the Minister 
rightly referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> It might be for the benefit of the record if I say that I copied the letter to which the 
hon. Member for Ryedale referred to you, Mr Gale. It might be as well if I quoted a particular paragraph 
from it. I wrote the letter to the hon. Gentleman on 17 June 1998. It said:
<P>
The Bill therefore provides for certificates to be issued by or on behalf of the nominating officer. But 
returning officers will clearly want some evidence that the person signing the certificate is acting on 
behalf of the registered nominating officer. I imagine that parties operating on a country-wide basis may 
well want to issue certificates at, say, a regional or sub-regional level. When a certificate so issued is sent 
forward with a candidate’s nomination paper it may well make sense for it to be accompanied by a note 
from the registered nominating officer making it clear that the regional or sub-regional party official has 
issued the certificate with his (the nominating officer’s) authority. But I think we can leave the details to 
the parties themselves—our aim in this Bill has been to leave registered parties as free as possible to 
organise and administer themselves, within the terms of the legislation.
<P>
For the purposes of those who might want to examine the reasoning behind some of the arguments, I 
should say that that is a considered paragraph. I would be happy for it to be used to interpret our 
intentions. I know that the hon. Member for Ryedale concurs with that.
<P>

<P>
I will consider the hon. Gentleman’s point about using candidates’ addresses on nomination papers. 
It is not a matter for the Committee and is probably without the scope of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman 
has, however, raised the point and if there is any scope for change the working party will no doubt 
consider it.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 3 agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do now report the Bill, as amended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I should like to thank you and your officials, Mr. Gale, for the way in which you have 
conducted our proceedings. I am glad that the Committee has been able to examine the Bill thoroughly 
and that we have raised the issues that I believe that other hon. Members would have wished us to raise. 
We have done so in a constructive, sometimes light-hearted, but unfailingly careful, way. Under your 
chairmanship, Mr. Gale, that has been an enjoyable process. That enjoyment has been increased by the 
relative brevity of the proceedings in comparison with those of other Standing Committees on which hon. 
Members have had to serve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> We have had an enjoyable couple of sessions in which we have fully examined the 
details of the Bill. I should like to thank you for your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. and the hon. Member for 
Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) for his minor spell of chairmanship in your absence, which was equally 
superb. I look forward to returning to the Bill’s proposals on the Floor of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I should like to associate the Government with the remarks that have been 
made. I particularly thank you, Mr. Gale, for the tolerant, but not too tolerant, way in which you handled 
the proceedings. You have enabled us to stay in order, but at the same time to have some interesting 
debates that have brought in all manner of political history, including the fate of Liverpool—its politics, 
that is, not its football club. I also congratulate Committee members for their knowledge of political 
history, the breadth and length of which has informed our debates.
<P>
I thank the Officials from the Home Office, who have sat there silently, occasionally passing me 
notes—some of which I have been able to read—when I have been unclear in my exposition of a 
particular point. That is not a reflection on their handwriting, but my responsibility.
<P>
Last, but by no means least, I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree for the 
excellent way in which she arranged matters so that the Committee proceeded in an orderly manner. She 
brings to mind the famous words of my most distinguished predecessor, Harold Wilson, who once said, “It 
is taking democracy too far, not to know the result before the votes are cast.” My hon. Friend has 
embodied that tradition admirably.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank hon. Members for their kind comments, and commend them for the 
exemplary courtesy and good humour with which they have conducted the Committee’s business. I also 
thank the police, the officers of the House, the Clerk and the Hansard reporters for the services that they 
have performed, without which our proceedings would have been a great deal more difficult.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
