<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed: That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking Government amendments Nos. 46, 206, 204, 205 and Government new schedule 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): It is an enormous pleasure to welcome you to the Chair again, Mr. Atkinson. Your absence this morning meant that you missed an enthralling debate about the important question of the future of community pharmacies. I hope that it will not be considered inapposite if I extend my sympathy to you for not being with us this morning.
<P>
We learnt something new earlier about Government members of the Committee. I was addressing my remarks specifically to the group that, for ease of reference, is best known as the early-day seven. That is not because of any tendency to rise early--
<P>
<B>Mr. John Redwood </B>(Wokingham): They may do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> They may do, as my right hon. Friend helpfully notes. However, that designation is warranted because they all signed the early-day motion expressing support for the community pharmacies. I emphasise for the benefit of the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) that we are talking about urban as well as rural community pharmacies.
<P>
All seven of those hon. Members were worried that the removal of resale price maintenance would damage community pharmacies gravely. They urged the retention of resale price maintenance, and it would not be uncharitable to suggest that the seven hon. Members probably issued press releases to their local media making known their support for community pharmacies. Indeed, if they did not do so they were being insufficiently assiduous. However, I am sure that that is not the case and that they briefed their local media that they were robust defenders of the interests of community pharmacies.
<P>
This morning, however, we discovered that the early-day seven had splintered. There is a split in the ranks. The group has not split into two, but into three. I am sure that I observe beads of sweat upon your brow, Mr. Atkinson, as you await with bated breath the revelation of how that split into three is constituted.
<P>
The answer is simple. The clear majority of the early-day seven judged it wise this morning to intervene on me and my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) to defend their position. They seemed painfully unconscious of the fact that thereby they were digging themselves deeper.
<P>
That was the first and largest category. I shall not be unfair and leave out any hon. Member who belongs to it. The hon. Members involved in that category were those for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard), for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow), for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster), for South Thanet and for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey). Sadly, a couple of those hon. Members are not in the Room at present, but I am sure that they will return shortly.
<P>
The second group consisted of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs. Gilroy), who took the view that it was better to hang her head in shame. She lowered her eyes and appeared to be reading something of the most momentous significance that prevented her from attending to the debate about the future of community pharmacies. I do not wish to be uncharitable. The hon. Lady is a perfectly reasonable person, who was unfortunate enough to have been roughed up on Second Reading by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham. However, in burying her head in her notes and refusing to rise and explain her extraordinary silence about the future of community pharmacies, the hon. Lady was probably working on the principle that it is better to remain silent and look a fool than to speak and remove any lingering doubt.
<P>
The third category of Labour Members--[Interruption.] I am being extremely charming.
<P>
I am delighted at this point to welcome among our number my near neighbour the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, who, as hon. Members will recall, fell into the largest of the three categories--namely, those who sought to defend their position and thereby dug themselves in deeper. I say that to inform the hon. Lady of the kind remarks that I have just been making.
<P>
The third category, which consisted of one hon. Member on the Government's Back Benches, thought that it was perhaps better not to be present in Committee at all. It is a matter of considerable regret to me that the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East (Dr. Kumar) was unable to favour us with his presence this morning. No doubt he had a pressing engagement: I shall not attack him for his absence, because I do not know the reason for it. Suffice it to say that on Second Reading, the hon. Gentleman made a first-class speech in which he dwelt in considerable detail on the subject of community pharmacies, on the strength of his local experience. He emphasised the importance of resale price maintenance to their successful continuation. I am sure that in doing that he had at heart the interests of pharmacies in his own constituency. I think that I am right in saying that he has some professional expertise, which would lend even greater weight to his comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Will my hon. Friend warn Committee members in advance if he is ever going to be unkind to any of us, as we shall need good notice of it?
<P>
I suggest that the absent hon. Member is at this very moment drafting a press release to his local newspaper that apologises for the previous mistaken speech and press release and states that he has now taken the king's shilling from the Labour Whip and fallen into line. Perhaps other Labour Members should also issue an apologetic press release that explains why they now wish to see the closure of their local pharmacies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I feel sure that my right hon. Friend is correct in his diagnosis. It would be the logical course of action for the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East to absent himself so as to prepare such a press release. In referring to the logic of his actions, I am taking into account the sage observation of Mr. Enoch Powell, the former right hon. Member for South Down and, for 24 years prior to that, for Wolverhampton, South-West. He famously said that a man must be assumed to intend the natural consequences of his actions. If the hon. Gentleman is in the process of preparing that press release, I am sure that his next recourse will be to the photocopier to make the requisite number of copies for his six hon. Friends among the early-day seven, to whom he will pass those copies at some time during the afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): My hon. Friend will know that I was not present in Committee this morning. I therefore had the misfortune to miss the beginning of his speech. I am not normally a man to revisit my earlier speeches, but I have noted that on Second Reading my speech directly followed that of the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East. On the basis of what I then said about him--that he had made an eloquent speech in defence of his constituents--I entirely endorse the strong recommendation and evaluation that my hon. Friend has given.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend, who is characteristically gracious. I well remember the debate on 11 May, and his contribution to it. I also now recall his making those kind remarks about the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East. I am sorry that that hon. Gentleman is not with us. I hope that he will return in order to continue his valiant and articulate defence of the interests of the community pharmacies that he has hitherto represented so well in various places, including, most spectacularly, on the Floor of the House. I shall conclude with the observation that it is Conservative Members who are the stout defenders of the interests of the community pharmacies. Labour Members--
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Gentleman has cut me off in my prime, but I happily give way to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> The gist of this one-man pantomime has been that Conservative Members are the stout defenders of resale price maintenance. The truth is that there is nothing to choose between us. The only difference is how we go about preserving the present position and securing the interests of those involved.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has made great play of the early-day motion, which expressed an honest opinion. I am not sure how the people who are the subject of it will react when they know that the cause on which their livelihood depends is being made a farce of. They will react forcefully when they realise that the case that is being espoused jeopardises their future by putting matters in the hands of the European Commission, not because Conservative Members have a great urge of compassion for community pharmacists but because they are Europhobic and want to make a stunt out of the issue. Once rural pharmacists understand that they have been duped, there will be a major reaction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am sorry that hon. Gentleman made that point for the simple reason that he is mistaken. We are complaining about the fact that the Government are playing for time and not stating a clear position--they are not arguing the case.
<P>
I referred to the split within the early-day seven and its splintering into three. I am more than happy to accept that there is a distinction between the views of several Labour Back Benchers and Labour Front Benchers. Although I have criticised them for failing to rise to their feet to make the case forcefully in Committee, several Labour Back Benchers strongly identify with the community pharmacies.
<P>
The Government's attitude of indulging in mere hand-wringing and professions of impotence is unsatisfactory. If the Under-Secretary is as supportive of the interests of community pharmacies and the retention of resale price maintenance on Government as he was in opposition, why are Ministers not prepared unequivocally to state their view and to express their determination that the existing system be retained? The Government's attitude will not do.
<P>
I respect the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford and I have listened to many of his contributions in the House and elsewhere. It will, however, not do for him to dismiss the matter as a political stunt by the Conservatives. Unless Labour Back Benchers match the rhetoric of the early-day motion that they signed with equally vehement protestations of support for resale price maintenance and the retention of community pharmacies, people in the Committee and outside will naturally deduce that it was Labour Members who engaged in a stunt for the purposes of short-term publicity. People will then presumably conclude, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham said, that they were subsequently advised that their position was unacceptable and potentially embarrassing to Front Benchers and that, as a consequence, they chose to water it down. That is not acceptable. The truth is that we have proved how strongly committed we are to community pharmacies.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Having listened to the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford, does my hon. Friend agree that if Labour Members have exactly the same objective as we do--to retain the present situation in relation to resale price maintenance on medicine--they should acknowledge that we have offered at least two additional options in the course of the debate which would strengthen the Government's ability to do exactly that? I refer to paragraph 36 and extending the transitional period and to using the powers under schedule 3 to provide for a specific exclusion. Labour Members, have, however, not taken up those points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> It is precisely because Labour Members have not taken up Conservative suggestions for ensuring that resale price maintenance survives long into the future that we are suspicious that they have another agenda or believe that the practice is on its way out. They do not want to pursue what they judge to be a lost cause, so they think it better to remain silent or to criticise the legitimate efforts of Conservatives to retain the existing system. Either way, the position is unsatisfactory.
<P>
The truth is that we have been consistent on the matter. We stated our position well in advance of Second Reading. We reiterated it on Second Reading and have argued the case consistently and, I hope, with credit in Committee. Labour Members have yet to do so. I hope that even at the 59th minute of the 11th hour, Labour Members will rise, not to make self-seeking interventions to protect themselves, but to say how we should proceed, whether they stick by the early-day motion that they signed and why they have not risen to argue the merits of the case. The truth is, as the Chinese say, that we live in interesting times. I hope that Labour Back Benchers will stir themselves regardless of any messages that they receive on their pagers from Millbank tower. I hope that they will join forces with us on a cross-party basis in defence of a vital interest, which is represented by the community pharmacy action group. We wait with bated breath to see whether they respond to the challenge.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Stephen Ladyman </B>(South Thanet): I would not like the Committee to think that I am rising to take up the challenge that was put down by the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow).
<P>
One of my talents has come to me over several years. On a Saturday evening, to unwind after a busy week, I like to watch videos. I like wild, wacky videos. I do not care whether it is James Bond saving the world or the Terminator destroying it; I like fantasies. The reason I like them is that I have a talent for suspending disbelief and completely turning off my critical faculties. It is because of that talent that I have so enjoyed the hon. Gentleman's contribution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Conservative Members were well aware that that talent was a necessary qualification for belonging to the new Labour project.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> In this Committee, we at least have to put people's speeches and contributions up against a quality threshold to see whether they reach any measure of objectivity. On that basis, the contribution by the hon. Member for Buckingham fell short of the mark. It has been well trailed that one of his previous employments was as a special adviser to Jonathan Aitken. I often wonder whether he ever gives a thought to the possibility that it was the quality of the advice that he gave him that is responsible for me and not Mr. Aitken being the hon. Member for South Thanet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I fear that your patience, which is legendary, Mr. Atkinson, would be tried in the hypothetical event that we were to dilate at length on that subject, so we shall not. Suffice it for me to tell the hon. Member for South Thanet, whose contributions we always enjoy, that I was pleased to advise Mr. Aitken on Treasury matters and that I never advised him on the conduct of constituency business.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Member for South Thanet replies, I should say that my patience is beginning to wear a little thin. We should be talking about the merits of Government amendment No. 203.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I quite agree. It is time that we moved on and talked about community pharmacies. Members of the Committee will no doubt have read the book ``1066 and All That'' and will know that everything in history is either a good thing or a bad thing. Everyone on both sides of the Committee and of the House agrees that community pharmacies are a good thing and need to be preserved. It follows, therefore, that resale price maintenance, which, over the past 20 years, has preserved many community pharmacies, must also be judged in historical terms as a good thing. The question to which the Committee must turn its mind is whether it will be a good thing in the future. Again, all of us on both sides of the House and in all parties agree that we must find a mechansim for keeping community pharmacies open.
<P>
I signed the early-day motion calling for the retention of resale price maintenance. At that time, it was the only mechanism that had been put to me as a possible way of maintaining the viability of community pharmacies. I have to tell the Committee that it will have to be considered well into the future as one of the options for continuing to preserve those businesses. The difference now is that, having talked to community pharmacists in my constituency, I realise that it may be an imperfect mechanism for doing that. I acknowledge that the restrictive practices court may decide that it is not the best way of continuing to preserve community pharmacies. That is why I suggested on Second Reading that other alternatives should be considered, as the hon. Member for Buckingham pointed out. One way or another, resale price maintenance may come to an end, through the restrictive practices court, the European Commission or the Asda cronies of the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Norman). If hon. Members want community pharmacies to continue to exist in our constituencies, we had better have an answer for them if and when resale price maintenance ends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for explaining his position in more detail. I now posit a scenario--the ghastly scenario of the abolition of resale price maintenance and the consequent need for some effective substitute protection for small pharmacies. The hon. Gentleman may then join his hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble in calling for a dramatic expansion of the essential small pharmacies scheme in order to protect the community pharmacies in his constituency of South Thanet. Can he make a categorical pledge that if the Government failed to provide the necessary sum, with the result that his local small pharmacies were threatened with closure, he would then vote for his constituents by voting against his Government?
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> The hon. Gentleman puts a hypothetical situation to me. If it were to come about in the way that he suggests, I would have to give the option that he proposes serious consideration, as I have done in regard to other matters. He often implies that Labour Members answer to our pagers, or that people are always having a little word with us to tell us to change our position. I only wish that I was important enough for that to happen. I constantly criticise the things that go on, but the Whips never come near me. I am starting to develop an inferiority complex about it. Only last Friday I spoke against the Government about amusement machine taxes that would have an effect in my constituency. I was sure that I had done enough to ensure that the Whips came to tell me off, but they still have not done so, and still my pager fails to give me directions on how to vote. The mind control that Conservative Members seem to think is imposed upon Labour Members is just another of their little fantasies--or perhaps it is an extrapolation from their own position. Perhaps they experience that sort of control, and therefore assume that we do too. In reality, Labour Members have freedom. The reason why we support the Government's position on so many matters is that we agree with them. The Government are moving the country forward at a pace of which we are all immensely proud.
<P>
I shall now return to community pharmacies, and to the amendment, Mr. Atkinson, before your patience is exhausted. The key issue is the best way of preserving those pharmacies. Resale price maintenance is one obvious mechanism. The Government have taken a practical look at the position. That position is that if the competition authorities in this country are not allowed to consider whether resale price maintenance continues to be in the public interest and to serve the purpose for which it was intended, then the European Commission will almost certainly do so--and the European Commission will not be nearly as sympathetic to community pharmacies as we are. The Government are right to allow the matter to be considered by the restrictive practices court. I do not know what their decision will be, but I hope that they bear the public interest in mind and decide that resale price maintenance is worth keeping. Having said that, it is possible to make a case that resale price maintenance is no longer in the public interest.
<P>
I have been given three figures for the additional cost to the consumer that arises from resale price maintenance. The first figure, of about &#163;250 million a year, is put out by supermarkets such as Asda--that is, the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells in his other capacity. The second figure is the Government's estimate of &#163;180 million a year. The third is the community pharmacy action group's estimate of only &#163;34 million a year.
<P>
Those three estimates are very different. Before any objective decision is made on the matter, someone has to work out which is right. I am glad that I do not have to make that decision. Thanks to the previous Government, we have inherited a perfectly good way to do it; the restrictive practices court was left behind for that specific purpose. We know that because the court has no other function. Apart from the resale price maintenance of over-the-counter medicines, no other agreement remains for it to consider.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making another interesting and good contribution. However, if, as we hope, the retail pharmacies win their case in the restrictive practices court, would not it be fair for the Government to give them the necessary legislative and other reassurance so that they can enjoy their victory? They should not be subject to double jeopardy from Brussels or from changes of legislation by the Government.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is right. The Government have given those reassurances. The new schedule contains a commitment that the restrictive practices court will not examine the matter again for five years. My hon. Friend the Minister has made it clear that he will use whatever influence he has to ensure that Brussels takes account of that. The European Commissioner has said already that he will take account of the fact that British authorities have considered the matter. There is no reason to believe, once a decision has been reached, that the matter will be revisited inside five years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> If the hon. Gentleman were to feel, at some point in the transitional period, that five years was not long enough, and if the Government had not legislated to extend it, would he conclude that the Government had made a mistake? If so, should not that possibility be allowed for now?
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> The Government do not need to allow for that possibility. All that will happen if a complaint is made at the end of the five years, is that the restrictive practices court will examine the matter again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman is just plain wrong about that. At the end of the transitional period, the matter will be considered under the chapter I prohibition terms. The hon. Gentleman completely misses the point. The Government are legislating to abolish the public interest gateway under section 14 of the Resale Prices Act 1976 and to replace it with an article 85-style prohibition, for which the exemptions do not include the broader public interest criterion that is used at present to establish resale price maintenance.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to correct my slip of the tongue. I meant to say that the matter would be looked at again in five years' time by the director general. Who knows what that decision will be? He will look at the situation and decide whether circumstances have changed and whether they fall within the terms of the prohibition that we are discussing.
<P>
We have inherited a good mechanism for dealing with the decision--the restrictive practices court. It was left by the previous Government to consider the matter. I do not understand why Conservative Members are not prepared to say that they are happy with that mechanism, which they regarded as appropriate for 18 years. They should support the Government in ensuring that the restrictive practices court looks at the matter now so that, for the next five years, it is not examined by Brussels. That support would create some consensus in the Committee and allow us to move forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> As I remarked in my intervention in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham--and as may have been noticed--I was not present this morning. I do not expect undue curiosity as to my welfare, but I report that I was chairing the quarterly meeting of the Building Societies Ombudsman Council and I then helped to launch its annual report. I needed to be excused from the Committee by my Whip, but the Under-Secretary would no doubt have approved of where I was and the fact that, if I could not be here, I was acting on behalf of consumers.
<P>
I do not propose to speak on the substance of the amendment, because I believe that an hon. Member who wishes to speak in a debate should be present for the whole debate. I acknowledge that that is a somewhat idiosyncratic view in this modernised House of Commons.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was glad to read the valuable and eloquent contribution made to last week's debate on community pharmacies by Dr. Thomas Stuttaford, lately--I use that word with some breadth--the Conservative Member of Parliament for Norwich and now the medical correspondent of The Times. It has no doubt been widely quoted by all those who have taken part in the debate.
<P>
I infer from the limited evidence available from the speeches of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham and the hon. Member for South Thanet that much of the debate has been on the subject of early-day motions. I have to say that I never sign them--except those of a memorial nature. At the risk of being accused of lese-majesty and being locked up in the Tower or Big Ben, I regard them as a form of constitutional graffiti. From my venerable age, I can say that early-day motions are words that can be taken down and used in evidence against one. I commend my discretion to those who have arrived in the House more recently. Incidentally, trees are also saved.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Nigel Griffiths):</B> It is always a great pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke), especially as, in his speech on Second Reading, he was not able to devote any substance to the matter of community pharmacies. He did mention them, however, in the same breath as the Association of Solicitor Notaries in Greater London and the Worshipful Company of Scriveners, so he is entitled to get in his tuppence-worth.
<P>
Before I tackle the substance of criticisms of the Government's approach to over-the-counter medicines, I shall deal with some of the pertinent questions raised about the Government amendments. We have made no secret of the need to overhaul the schedule dealing with transitional arrangements. My right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade spoke about that on Second Reading. The right hon. Member for Wokingham suggested that the new schedule keeps elements of the old regime alongside the new prohibitions. I regret to say that he misunderstands the way in which the new schedule works.
<P>
The new transitional schedule deals with the way in which the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 is to be dismantled. Transitional provisions are about the transition from the old regime to the new regime, but the right hon. Gentleman seems to have entirely overlooked the fact that we have taken pains to ensure that businesses are not burdened by an ineffective and bureaucratic RTPA for any longer than necessary. Hence, almost all registrable agreements made betweeen the Bill's receiving Royal Assent and the coming into force of the chapter I prohibitions will be non-notifiable under the RTPA.
<P>
When the prohibition comes into force, businesses will be fully free from their obligations under the RTPA. They will no longer slavishly have to furnish particulars of agreements; restrictive practices court orders will fall, and undertakings will cease to have effect. Instead, we shall have a modern efficient prohibition against anti-competitive agreements that is aligned with the European prohibitions.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham suggested that the new schedule introduces fundamental changes to the Bill. That is simply not the case. The changes are detailed and technical. The new schedule carefully and efficiently dismantles the existing regime, and ensures that businesses are able to make a smooth transition to the prohibition.
<P>
We are not keeping the Restrictive Trade Practices Act alive. Parties to most registrable agreements made after the Bill receives Royal Assent will not have to register them, and from the coming into force of the chapter I prohibition no particulars will have to be furnished under the RTPA. Where third parties would have had rights under the old regime, the Bill preserves them; they will continue to be able to take action for breaches of statutory duty under the RTPA and the Resale Prices Act 1976, but only in relation to the period when those Acts had effect.
<P>
The Bill also preserves the RTPA register. That is because the information on the register may be useful for some years after the new regime comes into force. Third parties may need information in order to consider whether to bring actions for the period when the old legislation still applied. The register also records which agreements are in receipt of directions under section 21(2) of the RTPA. As those agreements are excluded from the chapter I prohibition under schedule 3 of the Bill, the information on the register will be essential to determine the status of an agreement.
<P>
Some time after the new regime comes into force, the need to access information on the register will decrease. Hence, paragraph 10 of the schedule gives the Secretary of State the power to modify the requirements about the register.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham asked whether the new schedule alters the Bill's approach to concurrent powers. It does not. Nothing in the schedule affects concurrent powers under clause 54 and schedule 10. I assume that the right hon. Gentleman was referring to paragraph 35 of the new schedule, which provides for the sectoral regulators to be able to exercise concurrent functions in respect of those aspects of transitional arrangements that relate to the new regime. Where the schedule refers to the Director General of Fair Trading's functions under the existing regime, it makes no sense for sectoral regulators to enjoy concurrent powers.
<P>
The other amendments in the group perform an important technical function. Amendment No. 46 removes the words added to the clause by the Opposition amendment in the other place, and the subsequent amendments also perform technical functions.
<P>
The issue that has rightly caused members of the Committee--particularly Labour members--most concern is the future of the restrictive practices court and the future of RPM for over-the-counter medicines. Before turning to the detail of that matter, I draw the Committee's attention to at least one absent friend.
<P>
The power of the Whips has been mentioned and we should perhaps consider the mote in the Opposition Whips' eye. They have removed from the Committee the one witness who could have been useful in telling us about his attitude towards medicines in the national health service--the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin). On the 10th anniversary of the publication of his Centre for Policy Studies report, ``Radical Reform of the NHS'', he has been banned from the Committee. That report espoused a pill tax. It calls for a charge for every service. It states that

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> That is a nice try by the cheekie chappie of the Government, and I congratulate him on the attempt. But how many previous offences, dating back 10 years or more in his political career, would the Under-Secretary like the Committee to take into account?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman appeals to my generosity; he says, ``Forgive and forget.'' He says that the hon. Member for West Dorset is guilty of wanting the pill tax, but that we should just forgive him. We would, were he the report's sole author, but the right hon. Member for Wokingham wrote it as well; they co-authored the report. Their background is one of wanting to charge even more for medicines. They wanted to ensure that the very prescriptions which are the lifeblood of so many chemists were operated, if not at a profit, at least by charging enough to ensure that demand matched supply.
<P>
The hon. Member for Buckingham gave us a lecture on which hon. Members have signed early-day motion expressing their concern about the future of community pharmacies--they were right to do so. I note that he did not sign it, and that it is not Labour Members who have consistently opposed resale price maintenance on over-the-counter medicines, but Conservative Members--and not only the vice-chairman of the Conservative party. I read in Hansard of 30th November 1995 that one Conservative Member asked the then Minister to support the abolition of resale price maintenance on medicine. The Minister replied that it was a matter for the restrictive practices court. We shall take no lectures from Conservative Members about being Johnnies-come-lately on the matter.
<P>
To come directly to what is a serious point, the hon. Gentleman asked about two possible options--first, the extension of the transitional period and, secondly, exclusion under clause 3. The two options are not especially prevalent on the amendment paper, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that we have considered them carefully. Either option would allow Asda to press its case to the Commission and to argue that the British Government and competition authorities had acted unreasonably and outwith the spirit of article 85. Moreover, Asda or any other aggrieved party could act under article 85 and press its case accordingly.
<P>
Although hon. Members did not seem to need convincing, I spent some time this morning giving previous examples of how quickly action can be taken by the Commission. Even when action has not been taken, as with the net book agreements to which my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet referred, matters unravel quickly--in that case, in about 18 months. That is what Labour Members fear--an unravelling of a scheme, without any transitional protection, that has served the public and communities well.
<P>
I thought that the right hon. Member for Wokingham was at his weakest in this debate, perhaps because he has shown no previous interest in the matter and has had to swot up. He showed no interest in 1995 and 1996, and shows none now. He had time in May to write a rather misleading press release, but at no time did he have time to write to the director general expressing the official Opposition's point of view in support of community pharmacies. The right hon. Gentleman has time to talk tough, but no time to write to the European Commission to express the strong views that he presented this morning.
<P>
I understand that no Conservative Members have written to the Commission to raise this serious issue. That contrasts with the meeting that I had with the Commissioner's representative to discuss the matter. That left me in no doubt about the Commissioner's views on this area of competition and the need for the complaint that he had received to be tackled by the home competition authorities, which is what we are offering to do in the amendment, of which Conservative Members want to deprive us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am pondering what the Under-Secretary was just saying. Let us suppose that the Government were to conclude that there were
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``exceptional and compelling reasons of public policy''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
associated with public health for treating resale price maintenance on medicines as an agreement that is excluded under paragraph 7 of schedule 3. Is the Under-Secretary saying that that provision is susceptible to challenge and to being over-ridden by the Commission? If so, under what circumstances can the Government apply the so-called high test and have it sustained against Commission action?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> It is fairly obvious that our application of such a test would not only have to be robust in its own right, but would have to measure up to any submission that the Commission had viewed from the Office of Fair Trading, collected since 1995--it has collected a substantial dossier--and to the general principles of public health interest that can apply under article 85 in order to gain that exclusion. The fact that we put words in the Bill does not exempt or exclude an agreement from the scrutiny of the Commission. Nor does it in this case, which is why I suspect the Opposition have not moved such an amendment, and why it would not provide the protection that the Opposition claim. It is a spurious argument.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
What concerns me is that Conservative Members have not made those arguments forcibly to the Commission. They have made time to liaise with Conservative central office, and to make sure that their fund raiser can write to community pharmacists, misleading them about the purposes of the Bill, but they have not had time to put their case for the community pharmacy to the Commission. They have not had time to follow that important issue in detail.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham said this morning that it would be preferable for the Government to come up with something better, but, after three years, Conservative Members have come up with nothing. At least, the Liberal Democrats made the effort to understand it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Why cannot the Under-Secretary see that the problem is caused by the Bill? We have said, ``Don't legislate.'' That would avoid the difficulty, created by the Government, of the pharmacists winning their case in court and then falling foul of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> No, the right hon. Gentleman is quite wrong. I shall tell him why. If we had no Bill and the matter went before the restrictive practices court, if the court found in favour of resale price maintenance it would be open to the Commission, prompted by the Asda case and having been given no indication that Asda and the others who support the abolition of RPM were backing off, to consider the case under article 85.
<P>
If we revisit the earlier debate, the right hon. Gentleman rightly said that, in the 22-odd years leading up to 1995, the Commission had not acted. That was because it had not received a complaint. Even without the Bill, we are dealing with a complaint that has gone to the restrictive practices court via the director general--but one that the complainant submitted in parallel to the Commission. The Commission has told the director general that it is following that case. That is the clear reason.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> In his valuable discussions with the Commission, what conclusions did the Under-Secretary reach about the balance that the Commission would strike between the article 85 prohibition and the article 36 provisions relating to the public health policies in member states?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I reached the conclusion, shared by the community pharmacy action group, that the Commission is looking to the restrictive practices court to examine the evidence and to make a ruling. The community pharmacy action group believes, as I do, that the Commission does not appear to be generally sympathetic to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> On that basis, therefore, why has the Under-Secretary arrived at the conclusion that if resale price maintenance is held not to be against the public interest by the court, the Commission would intervene if the Government sought to protect RPM by one of the routes suggested--in particular, the one relating to a longer transitional period?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The Commission will have to look at the outcome of the restrictive practices court. If, having weighed up the evidence, it rules that RPM should continue, there must be some period of time when that ruling would be open to challenge. Under article 85, it would be open to challenge immediately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Why not longer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> We have set what we believe to be a realistic timetable. The hon. Gentleman used the phrase ``in perpetuity''. I was not going to throw that back in his face, because it was ludicrous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I certainly did not use that phrase today. I simply make the point that no particular period beyond five years needs to be set now, but that the Government ought to make legislative provisions under paragraph 36 of the new schedule to extend the transitional period beyond five years if need arises.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The new schedule replaces a schedule that would doubtless do considerable damage. The Library has a report that we commissioned from Professor Whish on the exemption criteria. It showed that the Commission had taken account of the public health benefits of agreements when assessing them under article 85.
<P>
The same jurisprudence as that which applies under article 85 will be applied under the chapter I prohibition. That clearly reinforces my earlier statement on how we expect the Commission to treat any decision of the restrictive practices court. However, it is open to those who seek to have RPM abolished to continue to pursue that under article 85, and to continue to do so whenever they want. It is important to ensure that the Commission does not seek to try that issue twice. If we accept what the Opposition said in another place, which Opposition Members intend to press today, we shall remove any such protection. I am determined to resist that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I will give way for the last time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I do not know whether the Under-Secretary has any independent community pharmacies in his constituency, but I am anxious to gauge the strength and consistency of his support for them. I therefore posit an alternative scenario to that suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire.
<P>
Let us suppose that the restrictive practices court unfortunately concludes that resale price maintenance is against the public interest. Presumably the Under-Secretary will not suddenly abandon his long-held belief that it is good practice. In such circumstances, what scale of public support for such pharmacies would he envisage? What would be the minimum support acceptable to the Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> If the restrictive practices court finds that the exemption of resale price maintenance on over-the-counter medicines is no longer in the public interest and it withdraws that exemption, the Government would have to consider the position of smaller pharmacies in the light of that judgement. I made clear earlier the attitude taken by the Secretary of State for Health.
<P>
We are now faced with a stark choice. We are faced with the Liberal Democrat point of view, which I am sorry to say has an Alice-in-Wonderland quality; the Official Opposition view, which is rather like Custer's last stand against Europe; or the Government's constructive and informed approach, which has benefited from Labour Members taking an interest in their community pharmacies for many years. We have the welfare of pharmacies at heart. I urge my hon. Friends to support the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> What a fine mess the Under-Secretary has got us into on this new schedule. I shall deal first with the other amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Before my right hon. Friend gets under way with what I imagine will be a rigorous dissection of the inadequacies of the Government's position, may I ask whether he thinks it noteworthy that, despite the entreaties that I offered her, the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton has preserved her silence during this debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> For once, silence is certainly informative, but not golden. I am sure that the readers of the record will draw their own conclusions from it.
<P>
The Government are in the extraordinary position of wanting to strike out a crucial schedule to the Bill that they drafted a few months ago, and to substitute a new and much longer schedule that changes fundamentally the transitional arrangements and the way in which the Bill operates generally for the foreseeable future. The Opposition's case at the beginning of the legislative process was that the Government would find that they could not create an entirely new law with an entirely new procedure and a new authority; that they would need to persevere with a lot of the old system; and that they would discover that if they did not do so, they would put business to enormous cost and trouble as it sought to find out whether things that were reasonable under the existing regime were or were not reasonable under the new regime.
<P>
Ministers told us that was wrong; that the new system would be much clearer and easier; that they could get rid of that awful old register and the need to register agreements; that everyone would immediately see whether or not an agreement would be prohibited; and that there was no need for the procedures of the old regime. Now, by virtue of the amendments, the Government are seeking to introduce a new schedule that recreates many of the provisions of the old Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976. In clause 1, the Bill starts by repealing legislation. It repeals the Restrictive Trade Practices Acts 1976 and 1977. That implies that the Government felt that they could simply get rid of all the old arrangements and replace them with something new and--they would say--better.
<P>
In the cluster of amendments before us, the Government also want to tidy up clause 1 through amendment No. 46 by deleting lines 15 to 17, so that it would simply abolish the crucial four Acts mentioned in the clause. Now that the Government have studied the matter more carefully, they see that, for the foreseeable future, they will still need considerable chunks of that legislation. The Under-Secretary himself used the term ``several years'' to describe what he disarmingly tries to call transitional arrangements. We are left in considerable doubt about for how long the abolished RTPA would in practice remain in force; for how long the register would remain in force; for how long the President of the Board of Trade and the competition authorities would have to acquiesce in that register remaining in force and maintain it; and how many new agreements may be added under the transitional provisions to all the agreements that have already been placed on that register.
<P>
The new schedule is unusual legislation. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This paragraph applies even though the relevant provisions of the RTPA are repealed by this Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The director is to continue on and after the starting date to be under the duty imposed by section 1(2)(a) of the RTPA to maintain a register in respect of agreements'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which it then specifies. Why on earth did not the Government amend it to leave the essential clauses of the RTPA in place, and then return to the House at a later date when they felt that they could dispense with them? Whey did they not include a date for the termination of the arrangements in the Bill, so that everyone knew where they were?
<P>
We now have the extraordinary position in which the Government intend to abolish an Act of Parliament by clause 1, but reintroduce several of its clauses through new schedule 1. They are saying, ``Don't think that the Act has gone away everybody--it will still apply. We cannot tell you for how long, but we can give you some idea of what it might apply to. Although the provision is said to be transitional, it will affect the bulk of agreements for the foreseeable future because they are covered by the existing register and are now rightly getting some leeway under the Bill by virtue of being on it.'' that is exactly the point that we made at the beginning. We said that the Government would need to do something like that, but they have come up with a particularly clumsy way of drafting the necessary changes.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In new schedule 1, we are told that section 1(2)(a) of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act has to remain in place although it is to be abolished. We are told that sections 23 and 27 of the RTPA are to apply after the stated date even though they are being abolished. We are told that section 3 of the RTPA is repealed by the Bill, but that its provisions will continue to apply. The new schedule goes on in paragraph 11 to say that the whole Act might have to continue to apply, not just section 3. In paragraph 12, we are told that section 26 has to continue to apply. In paragraph 13, we are told that section 35 has to continue to apply. In paragraph 13(2), we are told that section 25 of the Resale Prices Act 1976 has to continue to apply. We have a magnificent muddle, with a schedule reintroducing many of the clauses from various bits of legislation that clause 1 had already abolished. That is a most unusual way of proceeding.
<P>
The Opposition do not disagree with the result of that in so far as it tells business that there is some comfort. If people have been through the difficult process under existing legislation and have qualified, they will get some comfort under the Bill. We asked for that, although we could think of many neater and easier ways of achieving it. We are simply querying with the Under-Secretary why the Government are going about the issue in the bizarre way of first repealing legislation, then reintroducing it without cancelling the repeal and at no point stating a terminal date.
<P>
A more normal way of handling a transaction would be to ask the existing system to decelerate the number of cases being considered and to work to a timetable so that cases were no longer being considered when a transitional date was specified for the new regime. Equally, one might ask it to pass the files over to the new regime with whatever preparatory work had been done so that they could be considered under the Bill. It is most unusual to keep two different laws and jurisdictions running in parallel, although there is some linkage between them and some people qualify for exemption under the new legislation because they qualified under the old.
<P>
Listening to Labour Members defending their position on retail pharmacies made me wonder why they support the abolition of the restrictive trade practices court. They seemed to be saying, and I agree, that it was a good regime and that matters would be best settled there. Why do Labour Members not say to the Government, ``Would it not be better not to waste time with the Bill? We can carry on with the old regime.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that, having raised the spectre of the European Commission leaping in to abolish resale price maintenance, the Minister then confessed that the Commission appears likely to rest on the decision of the restrictive trade practices court as well?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Indeed, and that is what we hope it will do. Part of our case is to tell the Government that they should be aiming to achieve that outcome in Brussels. If the Bill's purpose is to make it less likely that Brussels and London come to different answers on issues, it is surely possible for the Under-Secretary, to get the Commissioner during their interesting and private tete-a-tetes, to agree that the restrictive trade practices court is the legitimate and correct body in this case and that any decision to which it comes should be final for a reasonable length of time, although we have queries about the transitional period. In that way, people would feel that it was worth fighting the case and that they would get some benefit if they won.
<P>
Fighting such a case in court is an expensive, demanding and time-consuming process. It is not fair to put a cluster of small businesses through that ordeal and then to tell them, ``Should you win, the Government have passed legislation to make sure that you do not get full and permanent benefit, nor even a reasonable length of time benefit. By the way, we can't even persuade the Commission to guarantee that it won't jump in immediately and try the case again.''

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that the Government's preferred method of avoiding conflicting judgments between domestic competition authorities and the European Commission is simply to pass more of the decisions to the Commission? That is an ingenious but unsatisfactory way to avoid conflict. Would not it be better to have conflict but retain a British voice, than to have no conflict because the Government prefer to roll over before the Commission?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Again, I do not favour conflict. I hope that the Government will be influential enough to do a deal with the Brussels authorities so that our business community can have clarity. A limited number of cases raise clear issues of inter-state trading. We have ceded them to Brussels and, under the commitments and the treaty, it would be wrong to take back or second guess those decisions, as Brussels clearly has the power.
<P>
However, our consistent case has been that we have never surrendered those powers on intra-state trading, and I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham that it is a dangerous cop-out for the Government to pretent that the powers on intra-state trading--which involve issues that are properly considered British--had gone to Brussels.
<P>
The Government will discover one of two things. They will find either that, even after a long time, Brussels does not come to an answer and remits the matter back, with the sole result that a lot of time and trouble has been wasted, or that Brussels has arrived at a decision that the Government should not, or would not, have taken themselves.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham implies, the Government have created an artificial conflict. If they had simply used their jurisdictional powers in the first place, Brussels would not have intervened, tried to second guess, or come to a different conclusion.
<P>
If the Government believe in subsidiarity at all--they say that they do, and I trust that they do--the bulk of competition cases should be settled under British jurisdiction. The system could be the old one left by the Conservative Government or the new one being created by the Minister. The collective task of Ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry should be to ensure that Brussels is so persuaded of their competence and fairness in handling the range of cases that it does not try to extend its powers by second guessing on what are properly British matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): How does that sit with the single market in Europe? If each individual state determines competition issues inside its own borders, how will that help the competitive yet fair single market?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> It is the way that it has been designed, and it is the most sensible option. Either the Community will decide that all competition issues are settled in Brussels--which will entail a massive expansion of the Brussels machine and the abolition of the British, French or German national systems--or we will stick to the system that I have just outlined, in which the big cases with inter-state problems that involve the European-wide single market will be decided in Brussels. In that alterntive, matters affecting national markets without involving inter-state trading issues will be decided by national authorities.
<P>
However, there exists an additional check and balance such as the hon. Gentleman favours. The Brussels competition authority is of course superior to any British, French or German authority. So if Brussels decided that such an authority was not conducting itself properly, it would be able to deal with the problem, either by negotiation or, in some cases, by court action. I am sure that officials in Brussels would be sufficiently ingenious to find inter-state issues that gave them the locus that they sought.
<P>
I believe that the Government should head off such problems by running such a successful competition policy--with this Bill or with existing legislation--that Brussels sees that they are doing a good job and that it need only take an interest in the big, inter-state issues that are its proper province.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): Surely that is what clause 60, which we have debated, would do. It would harmonise the Brussels regime with the regime in the British courts, and ensure that both legal institutions operate on the same principles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The hon. Gentleman will remember that we did not see eye to eye on the drafting of clause 60. Conservative Members still believe that the clause is too vague and general to achieve the happy result that he would like and that would make sense in the context of the new regime.
<P>
However, I am now addressing a different issue--the attitude not of the courts but of the Government. The Government need to have good relations with the competition commissioner. They must be capable of negotiating a sensible settlement over where the vires of one end and the vires of the other begin and over which types of cases fall to British jurisdiction and which types to European jurisdiction--there will be grey areas, hesitations and indecisions over these matters, which are not always clear-cut.
<P>
Above all, the Government should have enough influence in Brussels to be able to say that if the issue is settled in Britain in the way that the retail pharmacies would like, that settlement will apply in Brussels as well as in the United Kingdom. That would be a good test of whether the policy carries conviction in bringing the two regimes into harmony. Conservative Members regard the retail pharmacies issue as a domestic matter subject to domestic law rather than as a Europe-wide matter under European law, because it does not pose substantial issues of inter-state trading. It is an ultra-state issue between different active participants in the British pharmaceutical over-the-counter market.
<P>
I now return to the points that I have been making about the way in which the proposed changes will operate under the Bill. The Under-Secretary tried to defend and explain the amendments, and claimed that the provisions were only transitional. However, he did not explain how long the transition period would last or why there could not be a more orderly transition and a speedier running down of the old regime. He said that the register from the old regime will last for several years after the provisions of the Bill have come into effect. While it is true that after the Bill has come into effect many new agreements will not have to register, the fact remains that there will be a huge stock of agreements on the register and there will be transitional agreements going on to the register. Furthermore, the register is apparently to be kept going for a long time, partly because of the exemptions under the new legislation.
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that directions under section 22(2) are excluded from the Bill. That is exactly the point that we are making, and why we said that there would need to be more complex enmeshing of the old and new regimes than had originally been suggested. The Under-Secretary also said that he could not see how I thought that the schedule would affect concurrent powers. He then conceded that paragraph 35 is related to the issue of concurrent powers, and he clearly addresses that in the drafting that is before the Committee. I was not complaining about the wording in this case, although if he tempts me I might do so. I was asking him to explain how this provision, and the others that relate to concurrent powers that we have considered in connection with another schedule, will operate, because it is a further layer of complexity. All the organisations that are under the Director General of Gas Supply, the Director General of Electricity Supply, the Director General of Water Services, the Rail Regulator and the Director Generals of Gas Supply and Electricity Supply for Northern Ireland need to know, in this specific case as well as in the more general cases under the earlier schedule, how the concurrency is going to work and how they can be assured that there will not be duplication or double jeopardy.
<P>
That is an important issue that the Under-Secretary has not addressed. Will he provide the regulated businesses with a definitive statement that double jeopardy cannot occur and that he will take action to ensure, through director's rules and any other subsidiary legislation that may be necessary, that a business can be investigated only once for the same offence and, moreover, that there will be an early and clear decision about which of the regulators will be handling the case? Businesses need to know to whom they should turn to present their case and they need to be protected from having to make the case to all and sundry, which is the danger of too many concurrent powers.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I come now to the issue that has dominated today's debate--resale price maintenance for pharmacies. The Under-Secretary entered into some silly politics rather than answering the fundamental question that we and some of his hon. Friends have asked: what is he going to do to save a system that he and his ministerial colleagues seem to favour as the best way of keeping open more retail pharmacies in rural and suburban areas? Specifically, he said that I had shown no previous interest in the issue. If he looks at the record, he will see that I was an active Minister with responsibility for competition, who encouraged the launching of several investigations and competition inquiries. I never asked for the present matter to be investigated because I was entirely happy with the conclusions of the 1970 case. I never once made speeches or wrote articles suggesting that the arrangement should be disturbed because I thought that it was the exception that proved the rule--a market restriction that made certain sense.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Under-Secretary says from a sedentary position that I left it to my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells, but that is not true. I had no contact with him on the issue and had I done so when he was chairman of Asda and not a Member of the House, I am sure that we would have disagreed. I would have understood the commercial interest of the company that he chaired in an executive capacity, and I am sure that he would have understood my concerns as a politician who represents constituents who value the services of the pharmacies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does not the Under-Secretary's limp sedentary intervention confirm his acceptance of the fact that my right hon. Friend at no stage sought to abolish resale price maintenance? He has, albeit rather ungraciously, given the game way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Indeed. When I had responsibility for competition, I could have used my influence to get the issue on the agenda, but I did not do so because I did not think it right to do so. Nor have I written anything subsequently, asked questions or said anything in private conversations to suggest that RPM should go because that has never been my view. The absence of any evidence to the contrary from the Under-Secretary, who has obviously spent more time researching my views than the Bill's imperfections, illustrates that I have made no such statement. I have been completely consistent on the issue. I have always regarded it as a rare exception to my general rule that I do not like anti-competitive practices of any kind. One would have to produce an awful lot of evidence to persuade me that they are in the public interest and not against it.
<P>
The Under-Secretary then said that I should have put the case to the director general direct. Surely, my main way of putting the case on behalf of pharmacies is to put it in Parliament. That is exactly what I have been doing. A second way of putting my case is to put it in the press, which, I confess, I have also been doing. It is part of the job of a democratic Opposition to instigate a public debate that mirrors the public and private debate that goes on in the Palace of Westminster. I have done what an Opposition spokesman should do and have put the case forcefully, clearly and, I hope, sensibly in the House and in the press.
<P>
It is primarily the Government's responsibility to make sure that the branches of the Government and the Commission are properly apprised of the public interest as the Government see it. It is my job in opposition to persuade the Government of where the public interest lies; it is the Government's job to use its executive power to deliver that public interest if they agree with me or to win the argument and the vote if they disagree.
<P>
Today, we are in the extraordinary position of hearing the Under-Secretary imply that I have come for once to the right conclusion about where the public interest lies. He is not prepared to argue that RPM should go and that retail pharmacies should take their place in the market place with no such price protection. At least, Members of the Committee seem to agree that it is the exception that proves the rule and that we want to keep it.
<P>
It is incumbent on the Under-Secretary and his ministerial colleagues to tell us how they will deliver that public interest. It is no good him saying that the Government are the creature of the restrictive trade practices court, the European Commission and the changes of law that they happen to be bringing in and that the situation is not their fault and that it is nothing to do with them. We have a British Government to define the public interest and to make sure that quangos, legislation and relations with Brussels uphold that public interest against all comers--lobbyists, incorrect legislation, wrong-headed quango decisions or whatever. The Government seem to be saying, ``Yes, we accept that we are changing the law; yes, there's a court proceeding going on; and yes, we have lots of very friendly discussions in Brussels--but sorry chaps, we can't guarantee anything. We don't know what's going to happen. It's probably the end of the world for retail pharmacies, but we're going to sit and watch it happen because we're only the Government and nothing else.''
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire has offered two routes that would strengthen the position of the retail pharmacists. We may well produce another proposal on Report, if the House authorities agree that that would be in order. We feel that the matter should be taken further and tested more. However, we should prefer the Government to come up with a workable proposal. They have failed to do so in the new schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> We talked about the transitional provisions, but the Under-Secretary dismissed the suggestion that the Government should amend schedule 3 to provide an exclusion for RPM on OTC medicines on the ground that the Commission would intervene and examine such a provision anyway. However, he went on to say that if the restrictive practices court found that that was not against the public interest, the Commission would be willing to rest on that. Why should not that also satisfy the criterion in clause 3(4)(a), which specifies agreements that do not have a general adverse effect on competition and are not against the public interest? The Government could then make an exclusion and the Commission would not take it further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I agree again; my hon. Friend is being very positive and helpful. However, I dare say that there will be no sensible answer to that either.
<P>
Above all, it is very odd for the Government to believe that the Opposition should be able to influence the Commission in the right direction. The implication is that the Government are unable or unwilling to do so. It is much easier for the Under-Secretary to secure a meeting with the competition Commissioner than it is for me. The Under-Secretary has an entirely appropriate business relationship to preserve and develop with that Commissioner. In contrast, a Commissioner has to serve a Community of 15 countries and has to be more careful with his time when it comes to 15 Opposition spokesmen--or even 30 or 40, if we count senior and junior spokesmen together--who might wish to pay homage and express views to him in a meeting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I wonder whether my right hon. Friend has noticed that the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West has developed a new and ingenious way of representing the interests of small pharmacists in her constituency. She is reading a magazine about the middle east.--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I had noticed that, Mr. Atkinson, and I see that you do not want me to be drawn down that path. Worry not: I have a few points to make that are definitely in order.
<P>
The Commission is the body that the Under-Secretary needs to influence on Britain's behalf. He is our representative, elected--if indirectly--by the public to the office. I urge him to take our joint case to the Commissioner and say, ``This matter will be determined by the restrictive practices court. Will the Commissioner confirm that Brussels will not investigate while the matter is going through the court? Will the Commissioner say that the Commission is likely to live with that court's decision, whether it is yes or no? Will the Commissioner confirm that the Commission would dismiss any further complaint based on similar evidence--and, ineed, would dismiss the current complaint--after it had been properly investigated by that court?''
<P>
It is not too much to want the Under-Secretary to ask those questions. It would be reassuring to the retail pharmacists, who are battling this case through the restrictive practices court and are in need of such reassurance.
<P>
The Opposition feel that the Government need to do better in convincing us that they have taken the case to Brussels and received the appropriate reassurances. They need to do better in saying what they will do if the pharmacists win their case in our court, and they need to do better in offering them continuing protection for longer than they are currently proposing under the new regime. The new regime is additionally disruptive. I have met several retail pharmacists' representatives who have told me that although the restrictive practices court is a hassle that they would prefer to have done without, they could nevertheless take their case there, put it in the way that they did in 1970, win it and then be free for a reasonable period of time from further intervention. This meddlesome new legislation has brought the matter to a head and made it more difficult for them.
<P>
In conclusion, I urge hon. Members to vote against the new schedule. Conservative Members think that it is a very cumbersome way of beating a fairly sensible retreat on the structure of the legislation. Above all, it does not go nearly far enough in helping the retail pharmacies that stand at the eye of the storm.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I shall respond only briefly. One of the great benefits of having had a Conservative Member speaking for 45 minutes, followed by three and a half hours break from the Committee, is that one is able to craft one's comments in anticipation of the questions. That is exactly what I did when I spoke at the beginning of the sitting. I note that the right hon. Gentleman now wants to revisit some of those issues, including that of concurrency in the utilities, that were covered fully during the Committee's fourteenth sitting on 18 June. I have no desire to repeat what was said then and what I said earlier today.
<P>
I have only one slightly caustic comment to make about the right hon. Gentleman and his tough talking. He thought that he could apologise to the Committee for not taking any action before now. However, we know that he has taken no interest in the matter and that he could not even be bothered to write a letter to the Commission, still less seek a meeting. We have done all that. We have many years' experience of working with the community pharmacy action group and its members, and it is not good enough for the right hon. Gentleman to come along now with too little far too late.

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> As the Under-Secretary has been boasting about his good relations, has he yet obtained the promises that I am asking him to seek from the Commissioner?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I have outlined exactly the discussions that we have had with the Commission. The right hon. Gentleman was a member of a Government who boasted that they would get the beef ban lifted by talking tough to the Commission. The beef ban is still with us. [Interruption.] The right hon. Gentleman disavows the fact that he was a member of that Government. However, I am sure that he supported them very loyally in the Lobbies. That record contrasts with the great achievements of my right hon. Friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. I have no hesitation in urging hon. Members to accept the amendments.

Amendment made: No. 46, in page 1, leave out lines 15 to 17.--[Mr. Nigel Griffiths.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> What are we discussing, Mr. Atkinson?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I apologise for again being caught on the hop. I thought that the Liberal Democrats--in particular, the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed)--were going to allude to the amendments suggested by the Association of Solicitors and Notaries of London, which were ruled out of order. I hope that my intervention has been enough for the hon. Gentleman to collect his thoughts.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not think that anything that the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall says in that respect will be in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall listen with interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> On clause 1, I understand that the Government are considering some of the issues that have been raised several times concerning notaries and scriveners.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That has nothing to do with the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I thought that my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster and the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall were asking whether it would be possible to protect the position of the bodies in which they are interested without going into the wholesale repeal outlined in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I was trying to make that point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am looking at clause 1 and the point does not appear to be in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The problem is that clause 1 is a wide-ranging repeal clause. Some members of the Committee are worried that those bodies which are thought to be reasonable under existing legislation might find themselves unwittingly in default of the new legislation. I hope that you will agree, Mr. Atkinson, to us taking a few minutes to discuss whether it is right to initiate extensive repeals, given that not everything may be protected under the new legislation.
<P>
I should like the Under-Secretary to answer a query that I raised in the previous debate because it is relevant--why does the Bill abolish legislation--as it does in clause 1--that it has to recreate in a subsequent schedule, while not repealing the repeal? Will the Under-Secretary explain why it is done in that hamfisted way, rather than limiting the repeals in clause 1--or time limiting the position--so that we know where we stand under the old law and the new law? It would be helpful to business if we were told, in clause 1 or in a schedule, how long the elements that have been repealed--which have not been repealed--will stay in that unhappy state before they are buried once and for all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Clause 1 repeals the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, the Resale Prices Act 1976 and the Restrictive Practices Court Act 1976. We have been discussing the transitional provisions under amendment No. 203, and outlining how we intend the arrangements for the transfer from the old to the new regime to work. That is fairly straightforward--[Interruption.] Everyone else finds it straightforward. It would be a ridiculous notion to set a date and time--to the nearest second--when agreements still have to play their way out and the new regime has to come in. The provisions are clear and workable and represent a normal--not abnormal, as the right hon. Member for Wokingham hints--way of doing things.
<P>
I pause to crave your indulgence, Mr. Atkinson. I recognise the concern of Opposition Members for the position of scriveners and notaries. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster raised that issue on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but we have already had a debate on this matter under schedule 4. An amendment was tabled--as I recall--to insert those people into the schedule. If it helps the Committee, the Minister should be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> You have almost taken the words out of my mouth, Mr. Atkinson. I did not want Opposition Members to go away unsatisfied that they had raised the issue at the right point and received a response. Clause 1(a) is vital to the Bill--the existing regime has many deficiencies, which hon. Members have highlighted. I have no hesitation in commending the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am still unhappy about the intercision of various Acts that the clause ostensibly repeals--although the legislation turns out not to have been repealed in the circumstances described in the new schedule, which we recently examined. I urge the Under-Secretary again to consider this question. It would be much easier for people if the Bill did one of two things. The first would be to get rid of the old legislation completely and enact the necessary elements of the new legislation for the transitional period. The Bill would therefore be free-standing and everyone would be able to see that there were transitional arrangements based on clear words in the new legislation. The second would be to have a cut-off date, at which point the full repeal would come into effect.
<P>
If the Under-Secretary responds, I suspect that he will tell me that he does not yet know when it might be possible to repeal all the legislation that is repealed by clause 1 and recreated by the schedule. Surely it would be possible for the legislation to give an indication of such a date. It could say, ``not more recent than two years from the passage of the Bill and not longer than four years after it has become law, at a date to be determined by the President of the Boad of Trade, bringing forward the necessary proposals before Parliament.'' We would then at least know roughly where we were, and people would know to look out for a final decision by the Government to allow a complete repeal. However, as it stands at the moment, it is a dog's breakfast of a measure. From reading clause 1, one would think that all that legislation had gone. Then, when one reaches the end of the legislation, as amended, one discovers that it has not. People need greater certainty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be brief. In his speech at the last election, the Under-Secretary referred to the Opposition as practising Custer's last stand. I did my best to help the Liberal Democrats on to the field of battle, but I fear that I was not successful. With the utmost affection--four of my family were Liberal Democrat Members of Parliament over a period of 150 years--I remind Liberal Democrat Members of Sam Goldwyn's remark after the production of the film ``Custer's Last Stand''--that if General Custer had been alive today, he would have been proud to see the way he died.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> It might help the right hon. Gentleman if I say that the Lord Chancellor is currently consulting on the position of scriveners and the consultation period ends at the end of the month. I hope that will satisfy the right hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> That is the one thing that will not satisfy me, because the Lord Chancellor is consulting against a background of the possibility that the Liberal Democrat amendment would have been declared intra vires of the Bill, and the consultation has been geared to Report stage. I hope that if there is to be consultation, it will take much longer than that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That point is out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I believe that I satisfied the Committee in our earlier exchanges about the proprieties of the time scales. We want to ensure that there is an orderly transition, so that businesses that operate under these regimes are not disadvantaged, and so that the information in the Bill is adequate to ensure the smoothest possible transition between the existing regime, preserving the relevant elements of it--I think we all accept that there are good elements that are worth preserving--while, at the same time, introducing articles 85 and 86 into the UK law.
<P>
With that in mind, for the benefit of those businesses that want to ensure fair competition after a regime that everyone admits was out of date and inadequate to tackle the terrible grievances suffered by businesses at the hands of anti-competitors, we have set down a time scale that I think will prove workable and benefit businesses. The Government and I are happy to stand by it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 47, in page 96, line 4, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) Omit section 22 (which amends the Fair Trading Act 1973).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 48, 49 and Government new clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> These amendments deal with concerns about the risk of leaks of market sensitive information. They would reduce any such leaks to protect the interests of companies and their investors. They repeal section 83(1)(a) of the Fair Trading Act 1973, which requires that copies of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report must be sent to every person named in the report as a person in whose favour a monopoly situation exists at least 24 hours in advance of the report being laid before the House and published.
<P>
Experience has shown that confidentiality requirements are not always respected. This provision of the Fair Trading Act therefore represents a real risk of damage to companies and their investors from leaks of price sensitive information. In future we intend that the practice for monopoly reports will be in line with that for merger reports. Named monopolists should be told the date and time of publication on the day before.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> On this occasion, I sympathise with the Government's intention. Leaks of such price sensitive information can be very damaging to those parties concerned. The problem would be worsened if those shareholders or traders in the marketplace who were party to such information tried to exploit it for their own gain. Rules exist that are designed to stop them.
<P>
However, before we approve the Government amendments, I should like the Under-Secretary to answer one or two queries. I assume that it would remain the case that matters of fact that are germane to the inquiry and to the findings would be circulated to the affected parties in advance, so that they could satisfy themselves that no great errors had been made in arriving at those conclusions.
<P>
As the Under-Secretary knows, there is something of an iterative process where those matters are considered. It is important to the competition authorities that some of those matters are tested with the parties concerned before the final report is published and the final judgment is there for all to see. I should therefore like his reassurance that that process will not be obstructed, although we accept that the giving of such an assurance would to some extent undermine his understandable wish to avoid leaks or the release of early information.
<P>
It would also be helpful if the Under-Secretary could tell us what procedures will be put in place within the new competition authorities themselves, and within his Department. What is true for companies could also be true, through inadvertent lapses, for the competition authorities and for the Department itself. I trust that he will ensure that his procedures are tight and, most notably, that few people will see the material before it is published. Such material should be disclosed strictly on a need-to-know basis. I trust also that a proper audit trail will be made of those in the competition authority and in his own Department who have seen the documents, so that businesses can feel that both sides of the operation are trying to avoid unfortunate leaks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I shall respond directly. Given that the right hon. Gentleman occupied this post, he will know that the merger reports regime does not allow 24 hours' notice. However, proper checks are made to ensure that the information considered by the authorities is accurate, and does not contain transposed figures and other similar typing errors. He will also know that merger reports are numbered copies. The Department of Trade and Industry, and its reporting bodies--in particular, the director general--have a creditable record. In my experience of the past 14 months, no leak of information on any merger report has occured, despite the widespread press speculation that was prompted by one board disclosing that it had made a bid.
<P>
The amendment deals with monopoly reports, which are treated differently in one crucial respect. All parties who may have submitted evidence to a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry are entitled to see the report 24 hours beforehand. In a number of cases where not just a few but dozens of parties receive the report--for example, those concerning fine fragrances, newspaper distribution, and foreign package holidays--the procedure is neither leak proof nor watertight. The only way to avoid that problem is to bring the monopoly reporting regime into line with the merger reporting regime. That is the purpose of the amendment, and I hope that explanation satisfied all hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That was a helpful answer, but I want to add two coda to that exchange. I am delighted that he implied that there would be numbered copies. I presume that that means that the Government will be careful about the number of copies in circulation, and that they will try to maintain the record of having no or very few leaks. I hope that the Under-Secretary will stress that to the new competition authority, which will be different and which will need to set its tone early on. It would be good if the President of the Board of Trade or one of her deputies made it clear at ministerial level that this matter was very important.
<P>
It is important to ensure that the way in which the information is circulated meets the highest possible standards. There could be difficulties if the highest standards were not observed. As a general rule, it would be wise to limit the number of areas in which both Brussels and London were interested in the same problem at the same time. In my experience, there is a much greater danger of a leak from the authorities when information that is already in the London system crosses the channel and gets into the Brussels system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I assure the Committee that such leaks have not been helpful and that we expect the new regime to uphold the high standards that have been set by the merger inquiries. I shall draw my remarks to the attention of the chairman of the MMC and to the new Competition Commission.
