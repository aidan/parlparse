</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith </B>(Wealdon): Good morning, Mr. Benton.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Under-Secretary of State for Health said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>One of the key elements of any complaints process must be that it is fair to all parties. The proposals in the Bill would potentially leave the practitioners and providers involved susceptible to investigation by the commissioner indefinitely.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She went on to say that that would be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as unfair to those individuals, as the current system-as perceived by those who object to it-is unfair to complainants.-[Official Report, 3 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 697.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
She suggested that there should be a limitation on the time taken to deal with those problems. That was supported by members of this Committee, and by the right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams), who asked the Under-Secretary to

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>consider the Government's tabling an amendment in Committee to deal with the problem and so perhaps make the Bill acceptable.-[Official Report, 3 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 698.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Under-Secretary gave that undertaking. Although no such amendment has yet been tabled, I understand that she is still of a mind to do so, and look forward to hearing her confirm that this morning.

<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith) on piloting this narrow but useful Bill through the House of Commons.

<P>
On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend argued eloquently that the Bill would deal with a perceived injustice, which, although it is suffered by only a small number of people, is very strongly felt by those people. There was consensus on both sides of the House as to the appropriateness of the Bill and the necessity for the amendment to which the Under-Secretary referred.

<P>
I had hoped that the Government amendment would be before us today so that we could consider its implications, because, while its principle is undisputed, we shall want to consider specific aspects of its phrasing. The Under-Secretary did not make it clear on Second Reading whether the time limitation should apply to a reference to the Health Service Commissioner or to the initiation of proceedings at the first stage of the official national health service complaints procedure. That would be the logical point at which to place the time limitation, so that the retirement of an individual would not hamper an investigation that had begun while he or she was in service.

<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will explain why the Government have not found it possible to table the amendment so that we could debate it today. That means that it will be necessary to take up some of the precious allocation of private Member's time available on the Floor of the House to debate the detail of the amendment on Report.

<P>
Will the Under-Secretary clarify the Government's thinking on the phrasing of the amendment? In what consultations is she currently engaged, and what preliminary views are consultees expressing? When does she expect the process to be completed, so that the scope and phrasing of the Government's amendment can be made known to Committee members, particularly my right hon. Friend the Member for Wealden, at the earliest opportunity?

<P>
<B>Ms Julia Drown </B>(South Swindon): I cannot find section 2A, to which the amendment refers, in my copy of the Health Service Commissioners Act 1993. I should be grateful for clarification on that point.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Ms Gisela Stuart):</B> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton, in my first Standing Committee as a Minister. I shall rely on your experience and guidance to ensure the safe passage of the Bill.

<P>
As the right hon. Member for Wealden explained, the clause has two purposes. First, subsection (2) amends section 2A of the Health Service Commissioners Act 1993. The effect will be to bring within the commissioner's remit family health service practitioners-general practitioners, family dentists, pharmacists and opticians-who have ceased to provide NHS services since the events that are subject to complaint occurred. The proposed amendments will affect the commissioner's jurisdiction in England and Wales. I have been advised that the sections being amended were added to the 1993 Act by the Health Service Commissioners (Amendment) Act 1996. I hope that that clarifies matters for my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Ms Drown).

<P>
As I said on Second Reading, the Government sympathise wiht the motivation behind the Bill. We accept that the 1993 Act contains a loophole, which must be closed to provide an avenue of redress to the small but important minority of people who might otherwise be left with no effective mechanism for pursuing their concerns.

<P>
The Government are committed to professional accountability in the NHS, and we are already taking steps, in a number of areas, to improve and strengthen the mechanisms by which clinicians can be held to account for their actions. Complaints constitute an effective mechanism for doing so.

<P>
Secondly, clause 1(3) amends section 2B of the 1993 Act. The effect will be to bring within the commissioner's remit independent providers-private hospitals, nursing homes and so on-that were providing services to NHS-funded patients at the time of the events that are subject to complaint, but have ceased to do so since. The clause will affect the commissioner's jurisdiction in England and Wales.

<P>
For years, the NHS has been able to fund treatment in private facilities where it was satisfied that that would provide good quality service and good value for money. Even where the NHS is responsible for the continuing care of a patient, there are occasions when the patient's needs can best be met outside the traditional hospital setting. Nevertheless, such people remain NHS patients, and it is right and proper that they should have access to the same mechanisms of redress as other NHS patients.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Is the Minister not tempted by the argument that if it is right and proper for NHS patients treated in the private sector to have access to that method of redress, it would also be right and proper for private patients treated in the private sector to have access to a similar method of redress? She might consider yesterday's House of Lords decision in that respect.

<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> That may be one of life's temptations that I am able to resist, although I shall not say that we will not consider the matter, especially in the light of the House of Lords decision. Regulations in the private sector, including complaints procedures within the framework, are being dealt with in another Bill.
<P>
The Government believe that the private sector should be included in the Health Service Commissioner's remit, which is the purpose of section 2B of the Health Service Commissioners Act 1993. However, it has been pointed out that the Act's wording creates the same loophole for independent providers as it does for family health providers. Subsection (3) will close that loophole.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wealden and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) asked about Government amendments that have not yet been produced. I made it clear on Second Reading that we should be fair to all parties, but giving the Health Service Commissioner indefinite powers to investigate ex-practitioners did not seem to be fair. I gave notice that the Government would table an amendment to the Bill to introduce a time limit on how long after, for example, a GP had retired, the commissioner should be able to investigate a complaint about him or her. We had hoped that it would be possible to have the amendment ready in time for today's sitting, but several issues require careful consideration and the Committee's efficiency in disposing of a previous private Member's Bill left us rather less time than we had expected.
<P>
Developing a time limit proposal is not as straightforward as it might seem at first. As I said on Second Reading, we must agree on its length, and we have discussed that point with the commissioner himself. Whatever period we decide on, we must work through the question of when we start the clock. How will we deal with someone who has been out of NHS practice for more than the agreed period, but who decides to rejoin? How will we make sure that we catch all types of independent provider, from the sole proprietor of a small nursing home to the big company with a string of private hospitals?
<P>
Our lawyers are currently working through all those matters with us. I confirm that we still intend to table an amendment on the matter in due course. However, even if it is adopted at a later stage, the amendment will not affect the main thrust of clause 1, and the Government have no objection to its standing part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith:</B> I am obliged to the hon. Lady for her comments. I appreciate that there are problems with the exact drafting of the provisions, which should secure fairness for all concerned, including those who are parties to a dispute, inquiry or complaint.
<P>
We have to look ahead and ensure that the Bill returns to the House at a time at which it is likely to be agreed to-there is competition between Bills for parliamentary time for Report and Third Reading debates. Although it will cause considerable inconvenience to me, Friday 19 May would be an appropriate date. The Bill would be the first Bill for consideration on the Order Paper on that date, and the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Bill would follow it. Having the top slot would be convenient for all hon. Members and would afford a degree of certainty to those of us, including myself, who have to make constituency plans and who have other duties outside the House.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister, to the hon. Member for South Swindon for her intervention, and to everyone else who came here this morning to support the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
