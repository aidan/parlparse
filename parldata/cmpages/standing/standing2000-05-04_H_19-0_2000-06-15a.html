Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): The clause is another anti-avoidance measure. It came into effect on 21 March 2000, which, apart from being my birthday, was Budget day. The clause is enacting a measure that will have a retrospective effect. The Chartered Institute of Taxation said that the measure was not announced in the Budget speech or by way of press release at the time. It would be objectionable if we were engaging in retrospective legislation and I should like to know whether the provision was announced by way of press release on 21 March. If not, might it not be preferable to enforce such a change from the date of Royal Assent of the Bill?

<P>
<B>The Paymaster General </B>(Dawn Primarolo): I am sorry if the Budget spoiled the right hon. Gentleman's birthday. May I take this opportunity belatedly to wish him many happy returns. If only I had known! I shall make a note in my diary about it and perhaps we can arrange a surprise for him next year.

<P>
We are ensuring that the existing anti-avoidance provisions are effective. I do not think that it will happen in reality, I have little sympathy for anyone engaged in such transactions between Budget day and the date on which the Finance Bill was published, thus the provision will take effect as the clause suggests.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I thank the hon. Lady for her retrospective good wishes for my birthday. I can confirm that the Budget spoiled it comprehensively. However, she did not say whether the measure was announced on Budget day. It might be that the activity that the clause is designed to prevent is objectionable, but that does not excuse retrospective legislation. An activity that has been legal for decades suddenly being made illegal retrospectively is a bad move in principle. Unless I missed something, will she confirm that no announcement was made on the day and that the clause could catch some objectionable, but also some innocent, transactions retrospectively? What efforts were made on 21 March, or before that date, to warn people that such transactions would be outlawed in the Finance Bill?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The clause is a technical aspect of the changes in the preceding clauses, which, as in the case of clause 89, for instance, were announced in the pre-Budget report. The provision ensures that the special rules to impose a charge on UK beneficiaries of a trust when companies that they control receive payment from the trustees cannot be circumvented by including non-resident persons in the group of people that controls the company. It reinforces all the other clauses. As far as I recollect, it was not covered in a Budget press release or specifically announced individually on Budget day. It is a minor measure that covers a technical aspect. It refers back to all the other clauses that were announced, and, as was made clear, became effective, on Budget day. My response to the right hon. Gentleman's point about the clause being retrospective is that it does not stand in its own right but is a consequence of preceding clauses.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I shall not make too much of the matter, as the clause is comparatively short, but in this country we do not have legislation by declaration or intent. We proceed on the basis of an action's being either legal or illegal by Act of Parliament, and examine the statute involved. It is not a defence to say that this Government or the previous one intended to prevent such payments.

<P>
We have found an example of sloppy procedure, whereby a proposal should have been announced on Budget day but was not. I simply put down a marker that it should not happen again. I do not expect the hon. Lady to admit it publicly, but she should have a quiet word with her officials to ensure that, for future Finance Bills, all provisions that are subsequently enacted or make an activity unlawful and refer back to a Budget day or beyond should be announced at the time. Specialist practitioners are interested in what will be lawful and unlawful as a result of the Finance Bill. It is for good order and smooth relations with the taxpaying public and their advisers that those established rules should be observed.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not agree with the right hon. Gentleman's point about clause 95, but I listened carefully to his general point, and I note it. As I said, clause 95 is a consequence of preceding clauses, which were announced. I listened carefully to his comments on the matter.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 95 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): On a point of order, Dr. Clark. I request your guidance before we move on to clause 96. I should like to debate schedule 27 in some detail. I have no intention of provoking debate on the Government's amendments, which are all to the good. However, I would not like the fact that they were moved formally to remove the possibility of a stand part debate on schedule 27. Would you like me to ask to debate clause 96, or schedule 27?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> When we reach schedule 27, which I hope will be in a moment or two, we shall debate the Government amendments if that is necessary. If it is not, when I rise to say that schedule 27 should stand part of the Bill, if you rise, you may have your debate.

<P>
Clause 96 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Amendments made: No. 337, in page 482, leave out lines 10 to 22.

No. 338, in page 482, line 42, leave out from beginning to 'provisions' in line 43 and insert

<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Twenty-seventh schedule to the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am rather annoyed, Dr. Clark, because I was intending to wax eloquent on the deficiencies of lines 11 to 22 on page 482 of the Bill, until I came to the Committee this morning.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Letwin, is it an option? Are you able to wax uneloquent?

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin rose--</B><P>

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> On a point of order, Dr. Clark. I cannot comment on that, but I am sure that the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) will put his views in his own distinctive way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I sure that I can find witnesses to the truth of the statement that I can wax ineloquent on many occasions. However, on this occasion I was going to wax eloquent. My subject would have been the egregious problems of lines 11 to 22 on page 482. I then discovered that the Government had managed to spot the problem before I had anything to say about it, and had cured it with amendment No. 337. I shall therefore desist from pursuing that tack.

<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): All that for nothing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I know; it is tragic.

<P>
I want to discuss some other points about the schedule. I shall preface that by saying that the basic thrust of schedule 27, as indicated by our not seeking to debate the underlying clause, is welcome. In fact, it is necessary. As a result of ICI v. Colmer some generalisation was required, and it is to the tremendous credit of the Government that it has been done on a global basis rather than merely on a European one. Such an adoption could be more widely applied by the Government in many other domains. It is an approach to which the Conservative party is wedded. We have nothing but a welcome for schedule 27 in general. Group companies should be able to claim group relief across global holding structures.

<P>
However, one lacuna remains. We have not tabled an amendment on the matter, because I do not know the best solution. I am sure that the Treasury's ingenuity and skill in drafting such an amendment would be greater than ours. I hope that I can gain some consensus on the need to address the matter, and perhaps the Government will do so on Report. The matter to which I refer is the problem of the link company, especially the problem of the EU-based link company. I doubt that you spend your time investigating group relief before you go to bed at night, Dr. Clark. If you did so on a regular basis, which, conceivably, you might do simply to amuse yourself, you would note--

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Letwin, would you care to rephrase what you said about my habits of group relief before I go to bed at night?

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I think that by far the safer course of action would be to desist from talking about your propensities, Dr. Clark, and instead reflect on the fact that other members of the Committee may be so acquainted with group relief that they frequently reflect on the problem of the link company. In case the Government Whip is not chuntering too much to hear--and as I know that he will not be acquainted with group relief--it might be an advantage if I mention that the link company lies between the holding company and the companies that are trying to benefit from group relief by swapping losses between them. As I understand it, schedule 27 makes it perfectly clear that if the link company is a United Kingdom resident company, no problem ensues. If it is a non-UK resident company, however, there is a problem.

<P>
Unfortunately, it is not possible to draw diagrams in the Committee. However, I shall give an example in which section 406 relief cannot be claimed. It involves a UK-resident parent, which owns an EU--or extra-EU--subsidiary, which, in turn, owns a 100 per cent. subsidiary that is a UK-resident company. Let us suppose that another UK parent holds 50 per cent. of its own UK subsidiary, but also buys 50 per cent. of the UK sub of the EU or extra-EU company. We would end up with a UK parent down to an EU subsidiary that holds 50 per cent. of the UK subsidiary at the third level and another UK parent holding another 50 per cent. of that subsidiary and holding another UK subsidiary. Will section 406 relief apply to the two level three companies--the two UK subsidiaries? It should apply. For the purposes of ICI v. Colmer, it needs to apply because it cannot be the case that having an EU parent or parent outside the EU, even if it were an intermediate parent, becomes the cause of group relief not applying to two UK subs.

<P>
I may be mistaken, however, because such waters are dangerous for amateurs, and Inland Revenue officials understand them much better than I do. People who have talked to the Revenue say that it is currently the view that relief would not apply in such a case. If that were the true interpretation, there is an error in the Bill that needs amending. I do not intend to suggest how it should be cured. That is something that the Treasury must attend to on Report.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I now come to a serious matter. It could turn into a quibble, but the provisions that we shall discuss later under schedule 30 lead me to worry about it slightly. I refer to line 24 on page 476. Under paragraph 4 of the schedule, the prohibition on pertaining relief applies not to tax that has been deducted, but to tax that is deductible. In other words, it applies not to tax that was shielded, but 749 750 to tax that might have been shielded. The implication is that, if the Inland Revenue is cleverer than the particular company that is being taxed about what could have been deducted in a foreign jurisdiction, it will disallow the relief. That is a wrong principle and I am not sure whether that is the Govemment's intention. I hope that it is not, and that an amendment is tabled on Report so that the provision refers to the actual deduction rather than a potential deduction.

<P>
Finally, I come to a much more important matter. If we can resolve it, we will assist taxpaying companies for a long time. I do not mean to be unkind to the parliamentary draftsmen, because the drafting of a Finance Bill is an incredibly arduous task, which I certainly would not like to undertake. However, on page 477 of the Bill, under subsection (6) of the proposed new section 403D of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, is a masterpiece of ambiguity. I am sure that it can be cleared up by a clear reference to Pepper v. Hart by the Paymaster General. That alone would justify our entire proceedings. It might be said to constitute the only justification for our proceedings to date, as I do not think that we have changed ministerial minds yet.

<P>
I shall read out the sentence in question and explain its ambiguity. It is:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>So much of the law of any territory outside the United Kingdom as for the purposes of any foreign tax makes the deductibility of any amount dependent on whether or not it is deductible for tax purposes in the United Kingdom shall be disregarded for the purposes of this section.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That is not what I would regard as the most pellucid English. More important is the systematic ambiguity. In case the Committee believes that I am imagining it, I should say that the Law Society agrees with me, or rather, I agree with it.

<P>
There are two interpretations. One is that if another country's deductibility clause makes deductions dependent on a UK non-deductibility, the whole of it should be ignored. The second possibility is that one should simply disregard the fact that an overseas country's deductibility clause makes deduction dependent on the UK's non-deductibility. Those are crucially different interpretations.

<P>
I find it extraordinarily difficult to put the matter clearly. I kept trying to, and have written it down in the form that I hope will be most pellucid. I apologise; I shall read it out. If the sentence has the first meaning, I think that things are okay, as the UK company would receive group relief in the UK if the other country allowed the same deduction but restricted it to cases for which the UK had no deductibility. All would then be well, and I think that that is the intention.

<P>
If one takes the second interpretation, which is at least equally plausible as an interpretation of the words, there is an infinite regress. A UK company cannot receive group relief here because, in the absence of any reference to deductibility in the UK, it could be deductible overseas, but the UK company cannot receive deductibility overseas because the other country has a parallel clause referring back to here and so forth. The UK company would end up without a deduction anywhere, which I cannot imagine is the intention.

<P>
It so happens that the case of Pepper v. Hart, to which we constantly refer as illustrating the importance of ministerial dictums, is a case of a tax inspector versus a teacher, if I remember correctly. It is especially relevant that we should appeal to its doctrine and ask the Paymaster General to confirm that the first interpretation is correct and that the law will be applied in the right and rational way. That would clarify the matter. I think that the Financial Secretary has prohibited me from ever using the term rational.

<P>
Apart from the problem in lines 11 to 22 of page 482, which has been magnificently amended, I have no further problems with the schedule.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman is raising two points. One is about link companies, and the second is about deductibility with the interposing of the EU sub and the two parent resident companies in the UK.

<P>
I appreciate that the point is complicated and that the hon. Gentleman has tried to make it clear. If it is not settled to his satisfaction today, I suggest that the proper way forward would be for him to write to me and for me to respond in the normal manner, with a letter to all members of the Committee. That would cover the point about clear statements.

<P>
The first point that the hon. Gentleman makes is about the failure to change the legislation on link companies, which, he said, reduced the value of the new rules. The position of link companies under the new rules is entirely logical. The principle underlying the current rules on link companies is that other companies in the same group as a consortium member can claim the relief to which the consortium member itself would be entitled. That principle is preserved in the way in which the new group rules interact with the link company provisions.

<P>
Under the new rules, a non-resident company will be able to act as a link company, provided it has a United Kingdom branch that can make a consortium claim to group relief or whose losses are available for surrender to the companies owned by the consortium. The rules can be defended against any charge of discrimination; that answers the point made by the hon. Gentleman about unfair treatment.

<P>
I will comment on the EU position because, as the hon. Gentleman said, part of the debate arises from the European Court of Justice ruling on the ICI v. Colmer case. However, the Revenue does not accept that that decision requires changes to the link company provisions. Therefore, we do not believe that it is an issue that we need to consider at this point.

<P>
However, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the area is complex because of the way that group reliefs are provided. I undertake to write to him on the point, when I have discussed it again with my officials, but I have stated our present position.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It may be easier to curtail the discussion with an intervention, if you will tolerate a slightly longer one than usual, Dr. Clark.

<P>
I understand what the Paymaster General is saying. If the answer is true, it is a complete answer. I accept that there is no major problem, if ICI v. Colmer does not have the implication that the EU link company is discriminated against. However, I am told by people who are jolly highly paid to learn the truth of these matters--on whom I am reliant because, although I have read the judgment, I am not sufficiently well versed in its meaning--that the ruling does imply that the link company was discriminated against. I do not demand that the Paymaster General writes to me about the matter; I would prefer her to go back and, if she has not done so already, take counsel's opinion on the matter. Although it would not be the end of the world, it would be a pity if another such case arose and there was another such European Court of Justice ruling, after which it emerged that the issue had to be addressed. I am happy to leave the matter as it is, as long as we have the reassurance that some further thought will be given and that counsel's opinion will be sought.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's comments. Several representative bodies have made the point to us and discussion has taken place between the Revenue and those bodies. The Revenue has advanced its case for believing that the European Court of Justice ruling requires no changes on the link company provisions.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that he had read the ruling, so he must know that it is highly complex. It has taken some time to unravel and tease out from that ruling the necessary changes.

<P>
We believe that we have got the provision right, and we have been careful. Equally, the officials in the Inland Revenue may not necessarily be as highly paid, but their skills and abilities are equal, and that is their current advice. As I said earlier, no Minister can ever put hand on heart and say never, but that is the current position as we understand it.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Gentleman's other point related to deductions. I shall do my best to deal with it, but it is complex. I hope that I get it right. The hon. Gentleman referred to the provision for UK branches of overseas companies contained in a tie-breaker rule that ignores the rules of overseas regimes, and asked about the circumstances in which tax will be deductible. The rule is in line with the internationally recognised principle that the country of residence has principal responsibility for relieving losses when the overseas country of residence has rules that make relief dependent on whether a loss is relievable in the UK. Those rules should not be used to place the burden of relieving the loss on the UK rather than the country of residence. We believe that the rule is fair and does not contravene any of the precedents or treaties with which we are expected to comply. Naturally, we want to ensure that losses are not relieved twice.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about an interpretation on page 477 relating to deductibility. I believe that I have covered that point, but I am more than happy to undertake to write to him. I should like to consider the matter further and give him a fuller reply. He said that the proposals should be welcomed. It is difficult to interpret the rulings, and we have done our best to get the provision right. However, we do not have closed minds, as the amendments show. When others have suggested that the provision should be amended, we have amended it. However, we do not believe that in this case that is necessary, as the provision is sufficiently clear.

<P>
I apologise for the style of drafting; it is always difficult, but parliamentary counsel must work within tight rules, and it is for us to struggle with them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I believe that the gist of what the Paymaster General is saying would lead to her to make a clarification such as I was looking for in lines 3 to 7 on page 477. I accept that she would like to consider the matter and write to me about it, and I shall certainly put in writing the two interpretations that I believe could be made and ask for clarification. However, I have been wondering how to ensure that the letter that she writes to me with, I hope, the right answer will carry the force of law under Pepper v. Hart, as it will not have been said from the ministerial position in Hansard. Will she confirm that whatever she says in that letter is to be understood as what she would have said in Committee if she happened to be ready to do so? I hope that that and my own words will persuade the courts to regard that letter as the answer that the Paymaster General intended.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> This is the first sitting that I have attended without my note on Pepper v. Hart, as is typical. However, I believe that I am correct in saying--you may be able to help me, Dr. Clark--that a properly circulated letter to all members of the Committee to clarify a particular part of the Bill would form part of our considerations. I am not sidestepping any connection with Pepper v. Hart; the area is complex and I do not want to give the wrong information. Will the hon. Gentleman clarify his requests? That may need some negotiation, and I shall then answer him.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Ms Primarolo, I shall answer your question. You are making the best attempt to answer such a complex and difficult question. If a copy of the letter that you are proposing to write to the hon. Member for West Dorset is placed in the Library as well as circulated to members of the Committee, it will meet the hon. Gentleman's point. It is up to him, not me, to say whether he is satisfied. I am trying to guide you and the Committee on the procedure. It is now up to the hon. Member for West Dorset to say whether he is content with my advice.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful for your advice, Dr. Clark. I guess that it is the best that can be done. I understand why the Paymaster General wants to proceed in such a way and I accept that she is not trying to sidestep the issue. I would do the same if I were in her position. It probably would have been constructive if I had given her advance notice of my question, and she could have given me the information now. I shall remember that for next time. Will she also write to me about "deductible" in line 24 on page 476?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It would have been beneficial to our discussions if the hon. Gentleman had given us notice of the matter, although I appreciate why he did not 753 754 do so. However, there are ways to place matters on the record. If it proves necessary, I hope that whoever is in the Chair at the time may let me raise a point of order.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Ms Primarolo, when I spoke a few moments ago I had intended to say that the Chair would look generously at any request that you made in a later sitting to explain the situation further. If I am in the Chair, I shall certainly do that and I have no doubt that my co-Chairman will do the same. I shall make sure that he is aware of our discussions.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Schedule 27, as amended, agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we discuss clause 97, I wish to refer the Committee back to Tuesday afternoon when, on a point of order in relation to the dreaded schedules 30 and 31, Mr. Letwin asked about copies of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. I promised to look into the matter and ensure that copies were available in the Room as soon as may be. They are available in the Room now. Not only are they dreaded in content, but they are dreaded in price, so that is why only six copies of each Act are available. I hope that members of the Committee will manage by sharing copies. If not, this Finance Bill will be remembered for its profligacy of Committee papers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> There is a tenuous connection of ideas between schedules 27 and 28. If group relief is to be global, I dimly gesture towards the Inland Revenue's logic in supposing that it should chase up any member of the group for tax unpaid by another member of the group. I think that that is what schedule 28 is getting at. We do not object to trying to collect unpaid UK tax. It is a proper activity for the Inland Revenue to undertake. However, there are problems with the way in which the schedule approaches that task.

<P>
I do not know how those problems can be solved, but something needs to be done.

<P>
I draw the attention of the Paymaster General and the Committee to paragraph 2(3)(a) and (b) on page 483--as I am conscious of my reputation for mumbling, I shall raise my voice--which widens the definitions of associated company. It is notable that, for group relief purposes, 75 per cent. is the definitional limit, whereas 51 per cent. is adopted here. That means that the Inland Revenue may collect from UK companies that are associated with the defaulting company, even if they are only thinly associated and have an interest of only 51 per cent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): That is quite wrong.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend said from a sedentary position that it was wrong and, emotionally, I am on his side. However, I could understand the logic of the measure if it were not for certain matters, on which I have been advised and which I hope that I have understood correctly. The Revenue could attack a company for unpaid tax if it was, for up to 12 months previously, part of the same group as a defaulting company according to the wide definition of association in the schedule. That recalls a point similar in character to the problem addressed by Government amendment No. 337 to schedule 27.

<P>
The problem is a practical one for investment bankers, lawyers and solicitors when doing due diligence in acquisition, for example. I suppose that I should declare an interest here. It is important for the working of the capital market that due diligence can be done, but it is difficult if a company can be penalised after buying in good faith another company that, 12 months before, had been loosely associated with dozens of companies, one of which had not paid UK tax. Let us imagine that a major British company buys a minor one and sends in teams of lawyers and accountants, who do all the due diligence. Six months later, officials from the Inland Revenue arrive at the door of the large, rich UK company and say, "We would like £100 million because, unbeknownst to you at the time that you bought it, a company with which it was loosely associated 12 months previously, which had no commercial impact on it and of which you have never heard, failed to pay some UK tax."

<P>
The problem is not that the entire resources of the City of London could not be mustered to discover the answer to the question, "Is there any such company owing such a sum of tax?" Those resources can be mustered but, as a result of the measure, there will be a considerable increase in the costs of due diligence, the professional indemnity required by lawyers and so on. It will jam up the works in an unpleasant way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> May I ask my hon. Friend whether what can be collected from the subsidiaries is pro rata to the ownership or 100 per cent. of the tax liability?

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I have tried to grapple with that question, and I think that the answer is 100 per cent. I say that tentatively because I might bewrong. I wish that my hon. Friend had not asked me that because, as I was preparing this morning, I realised that all the worthy auditors who helped me had not told me the answer. As far as I can see from the text, the answer is 100 per cent. I am sure that the Paymaster General can give a definitive answer. Unfortunately, the people whom I tried to telephone for an answer were not available. Part of the problem is that one might unfairly suffer a large--in some cases, heroically large--tax bill.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I may be wrong about that, but I am clear in my mind about the consortium problem, whereby proportionate claims apply. However, those proportionate claims might relate to a very small holding. For the Paymaster General's edification, I refer to paragraph 2(4), lines 34 to 40. Were I to own 95 per cent. of a consortium for, say, a power station, I might be forced to pay 5 per cent. of the unpaid tax of a company with which it entered the consortium as a joint venturer. Were I Shell, and were I to enter a consortium for a new power station with a fly-by-night operator who happens to be good at setting up power stations but who has skipped properly owed tax--which is a lousy thing to do, for which he should be pursued, but that might be difficult, as he might not have the money--the effect of paragraph 2(4) would be that the Inland Revenue would approach Shell, knowing that it has zillions and will be able to pay up. Before my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) asks me, I admit that the claim will be for only 5 per cent. Nevertheless, I will be asked for 5 per cent. of the tax bill of a company for which I have no responsibility; I simply made the grave error of entering a joint venture with it.

<P>
I do not suppose that that, in itself, will cause devastation to British industry. It seems manifestly unfair--which is part of my objection--but the practical effects will not be disastrous once the money has been asked for. The major inconvenience is that Shell will not enter consortiums or joint ventures with minor entities, whose tax affairs will have to be examined with due diligence, which will be burdensome to them, even supposing that they are completely honest. It will jam up the works and make it more difficult to form consortiums. Lawyers and accountants will have to be hired to discover whether the entity in question has a tax problem.

<P>
The problem is even worse because of interaction, which might lead to complex daisy chains whereby the entity with which one had considered entering a consortium is somehow associated with other entities. The daisy chains will have to be traced to find out whether, somewhere down some ghastly line, there is some kind of unpaid tax, for which, honest to goodness, one had no responsibility. That will tend to impede joint venturing. I hope that the Paymaster General will believe me when I say, after 10 to 15 years of practice in these affairs, that joint venturing between major, rich companies and minor, small companies is crucial to the development of projects in a wide range of fields, especially in high technology and the power and energy sector.

<P>
My final point is on paragraph 4(1), which stipulates a long time limit--three years after the date on which the liability of the taxpayer is finally determined, and I understand from experts that there are six years in which to determine it. The date at which the Inland Revenue can still pursue the matter is an awfully long time after the liability arose. By that time, a UK company could have been outside the taxpayer's group for many years. By contrast, once the Inland Revenue arrives on the scene and asks for the money, there is notice of 30 days in which to pay up.

<P>
There is something wrong here. I understand and applaud the huge enthusiasm of the Inland Revenue and the Paymaster General for pursuing unpaid tax. We all need to be conscious of the need to collect the tax due. However, to give the unlucky associates, owners, partial owners and joint venture partners 30 days to pay up when they were in no way responsible for the unpaid tax of many years earlier is all wrong.

<P>
Therefore, I hope that the Paymaster General will reconsider the looseness, or perhaps I should say the tightness, of the proposals. They are loose in that they hugely extend, but they are tight because they try to grip anything that might find itself in a different place and that was originally associated with someone who might not have paid some tax. I hope that the hon. Lady will try to rebalance the issue, so that she does not strangle too many babies in dealing with the bathwater.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman's final points about the proposal being too loose and too tight reflect the fact that the extension of group relief being provided has been welcomed, but the counterbalance protecting the revenue under circumstances in which it is needed has not. We have discussed several times the balance between fairness and restrictions on companies and their commercial activities that are not undue.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised four points, which were about the 12-month period, the figure of 51 per cent., the consortium and the three-year period. Representations have been made to the Revenue on all those points. Our response on the 12 months before the beginning of the period to which the tax relates is that there is a clear need for protection against arrangements designed to ensure that the non-paying company can leave the company while remaining under the same economic control. For example, a foreign parent could de-merge the non-payer. Alternatively, a UK-resident company with the resources to pay the tax could leave the group while remaining under the same economic control. The 12-month period represents a reasonable response, and is similar to that in existing legislation of a similar nature, such as the company migration collection powers and the company gains recovery powers.

<P>
The second point was about an inhibition on the sale of companies and partnerships. It is already common for indemnities to be taken out when companies are sold because of the existing provisions that allow tax to be recovered from another group of companies. Again, the company migration collection powers and capital gains recovery powers are relevant.

<P>
The recovery power in the clause and the schedule should not add significantly to the current need for indemnities. As we have said in response to representations from organisations and professional bodies, that is a fair balance in terms of what is being given by the extension of the relief, the protection of the revenue, and the opportunities that could be available.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin rose--</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight rose--</B><P>

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Which hon. Gentleman shall I choose, Dr. Clark? I shall give way to the hon. Member for West Dorset, as he rose first.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sorry. I did not realise that my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs wanted to intervene, too.

<P>
I ask the Paymaster General to abandon talking about fair balance, because we are dealing with an advantage that relates to one group, whereas the problem or disadvantage relates to something different--the 757 758 purchaser. Naturally, I accept that there is a need for the Inland Revenue to recapture lost revenue, but have the Paymaster General's officials investigated the effect on what are generally one-off premiums of the indemnity insurance? If those premiums are non-exotic following the change, that would be a good answer. If they are to be exotic premiums, that would not be a good answer. It would help insurance companies to know where she stands.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> At this precise time, I cannot answer that question. It is a fair point to make, although the advantage of the new arrangements for those companies will be substantial. I am not sure whether it is legitimate for the Inland Revenue to carry out such work, but I shall try to obtain an answer for the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I may not have fully understood the general issue, but the Revenue is empowered to go to a 51 per cent. subsidiary when the parent company has not paid the tax and it has not been able to obtain the money from it. First, will the Minister clarify whether the Revenue can go pro rata for the tax owing or 100 per cent? Secondly, the power is strange given the existence of minority shareholders and creditors of the subsidiary. Surely the Revenue cannot be permitted, thus, to act in a way that is to its detriment. That would be contrary to all the principles of equity and tax law.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I was coming to the point about 51 per cent. as well as the matter on which the hon. Gentleman intervened on his hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset to ask him to ask me about tax liability.

<P>
If the test of group membership were the same as for the group relief of 75 per cent., it would be possible for the shareholdings to be manipulated to avoid liability. For example, it would be possible for group relief to be claimed on the shareholdings that had been subsequently reduced. The Revenue decided that the 51 per cent. test provides a simple and straightforward measure of a shareholding, which would be likely to give control of the company concerned.

<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset was correct when he referred to 100 per cent. tax liability, unless it was a consortium as the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs pointed out to him. We would go to one company for the 100 per cent. tax in line with current powers on company gains. We would not do that on a pro rata basis.

<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset referred to a consortium member. The provisions need to extend to consortiums because the group relief rules do. Otherwise, it would be possible to arrange for tax liabilities to be concentrated in non-resident consortium companies, from which tax would be more difficult to collect. Provision must be made to collect tax from companies in the same group as the consortium member because it is easy to transfer a consortium holding from one company to another in a group without triggering a tax charge.

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Gentleman's final point relates to the three-year limit. The answer is simple: tax would have to have been unpaid for that period for us to use the three-year period. The arrangements in the schedule for collecting tax and giving notices are compatible with the Revenue's existing powers.

<P>
As the hon. Members for West Dorset and for Arundel and South Downs said, it was not the Revenue's intention to create further problems as a result of the schedule. Its intention was to take account of an ECJ ruling and respond to the changing nature of business. Although the hon. Gentlemen may not be entirely satisfied with my replies, they acknowledged that their points were complex. I undertake to the Committee to ensure that I am entirely satisfied that their points have been covered and that additional problems will not be created. I invite both hon. Gentlemen to write to me about those points for further clarification.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Broadly, no is my answer. I do not believe that we are dealing with a matter of clarification. I accept that the Inland Revenue was acting in good faith in trying to extend the scope of its collection to match the scope of the reliefs that have been forced on it and us by the ECJ ruling. However, it should be noted in passing that, because the Government have decided to extend the relief beyond the EU, they have gone further than necessary, suggesting an element of voluntariness. We might, therefore, expect some care to be taken not to match that with a set of provisions for catching unpaid tax that cause more problems than the voluntary nature of the globalisation warrants.

<P>
I understand that there may be decent reasons for supposing that manoeuvres are possible that are unknown to us, but without doubt known to the Paymaster General's officials and to professionals in the field, involving 75 per cent. subs, that would justify moving to a 51 per cent. rule. Presumably, manoeuvres would also be possible under the 51 per cent. rule, but I assume that the gist of the Paymaster General's implication is that that would not generally be desirable because of the loss of control that would follow. I accept that the 51 per cent. rule has some logic.

<P>
An extremely strong case can be made for adjusting the provision if the indemnity insurance is not available at a non-exotic cost. The Paymaster General has already offered to investigate that matter, which may help resolve the problem.

<P>
I am afraid that the Paymaster General is wrong about the consortium problem. I am not saying that it is not possible to engage in a dodge vis-ã-vis consortiums--no doubt it is--but the right way to handle that would be to distinguish between bona fide trading consortiums and dodges involving consortiums, which the provision simply will not do. The hon. Lady has not contradicted me, and I believe that what I have pointed out is absolutely clear. The provision will clobber a completely bona fide consortium member who goes into a consortium for a cable system or a power project with someone who is tenuously associated with a tax dodger. That is not fair or reasonable, and there will certainly not be indemnity insurance for it. I say certainly; one never fails to be amazed by the astonishing ingenuity of the insurance companies.

<P>
If the Paymaster General can show me that I am wrong and that the proposal will have a non-exotic cost, I shall back down on the issue. However, I bet my bottom dollar that insurance companies will not give us a non-exotically priced insurance indemnity against the possibility that someone who holds 5 per cent. in a power project of which we own 95 per cent. may be associated, via an extraordinarily long chain of 51 per cent. subs and the like, with someone who has failed to pay UK tax through a UK subsidiary or branch somewhere in the world. The result will be that people simply will not do business in such consortiums, except with copper-bottomed partners.

<P>
When Shell seeks to form a consortium with Eastern Electricity, there will be no problem. Both will rely on the fact that neither will dupe the tax man. However, the provision will mean that entrepreneurs will be removed, which is rotten. It will have a much bigger effect on the UK economic performance, and hence on Treasury revenues, than any minor dodges that are involved.

<P>
I beg the Paymaster General to reconsider. I believe that, instead of pressing the issue to a vote, it would be best for us to wait for Report and hope that she will return with some sort of clarification or redrafting to amend the provisions, so that they catch dodgers, not general trading consortiums. We could support that, but we shall want to vote against the proposal by tabling an amendment of our own on Report if she does not.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Actually, we see these measures as helping business. We intend only to have reasonable protection to do that. I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's final point. Without saying that I shall definitely do anything--I am sure that he would not expect that--I shall carefully consider what he said. If he is not happy--if the Government still view the proposal as correct--he has the ability to do something about it on Report. I hope that we can agree on the matter, and I would like to ensure with my officials that his point is covered.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not mean to detain the Committee for any length of time, although I have to say that the clause detained me for a long time before I understood it. I want to point out what I think is an omission. On page 67, line 29, we come to the proposed new section 403C(1) of the Taxes Act 1988, which states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the case of a consortium claim the amount that may be set off against the total profits of the claimant company is limited by this section.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I think that that was intended to relate to the overlapping period. I did not want to table an amendment in case there was some better way to correct it, but the natural way to do so in ordinary language would be to insert "for the overlapping period" at the end of the sentence.

<P>
If the Paymaster General can confirm that she has the overlapping period in mind, I shall be satisfied because, under our old friend Pepper v. Hart, that may solve the problem. If she does intend the provision to relate to the overlapping period, she may want to table an amendment on Report to cover that.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I did not raise an objection to amendment No. 329. I hope that I correctly understood it; if I have, it causes me no trouble.

<P>
I want to check with the Paymaster General whether I am right about the Government's basic intention, which I think is to let company A offset its capital loss in asset Q against the capital gain of one of its subsidiaries, company B, in asset R. They are in the same group; one is the holding company, which has an asset that has a capital loss. The subsidiary has an asset that has a capital gain. What would have happened is that, before those assets were sold to a body outside the group, company C, it would have been necessary to go through the business of selling Q down from A to B. The clause will allow that to have been deemed to have occurred without having to go through the bore of making it occur.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> indicated assent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Lady agrees, in which case we have no objection to the basic thrust of the clause. It is a fine provision.

<P>
I should like the Paymaster General to clarify one or two other matters. For the avoidance of doubt, Dr. Clark, I declare an interest. I cannot exactly relate it to what we are discussing, but I might have an interest. One has to go through such things.

<P>
First, what counts as an asset? Will a beneficial interest, for example, count as an asset for such purposes? Will it be included? If that is how the provision will interact with the rest of the law, we shall be content. Will part-assets count as assets?

<P>
Secondly, I refer to a matter that is a little more complicated. I apologise, but it is of some importance. Will the provisions apply to the losses of a UK branch of a non-resident company? Under section 171(1) of the dreadful Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, an asset is allowed as a chargeable gain only if it is not used as an asset of the UK branch. Under my example, if the transfer from holding company A to the subsidiary B has not taken place--which, if it were deemed to take place, it will not have done--how can it be proved that section 171(1) was satisfied? I apologise if I am not as clear as I should be. I can only just about clarify the issue in my mind, let alone express it to others. However, I shall return to the original question about which the Paymaster General may have a clear account and forget my pathetically amateurish attempts to explain it. When a loss is in a UK branch of a non-resident company, will the same apply--will the dealings still work?

<P>
My third question may be slightly mischievous, but I should like to know the answer to it. More important, people in the business would benefit from knowing it, too. If two subsidiaries both have losses, can a double election be made and treat them both as being deemed to have been transferred--for which read three, four, five, six and so on. That is of some practical importance because often when there are fire cells, there are several loss-making assets to be sold simultaneously.

<P>
I repeat my three questions for the Paymaster General. Will she tell us what counts as an asset, whether it will work in the context of dealing with a loss in a UK branch of a non-resident company, and whether the election can be double or triple?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman had four questions, which I will answer succinctly. Beneficial interest--yes. Part-asset--yes. UK branch of non-resident company--yes. As for the election, the answer is yes, provided--wait for it--the respective interests do not add up to more than 100 per cent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> If only all our proceedings were as crisply and satisfactorily answered, I would rest a happy man.

Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Twenty-ninth schedule to the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B>  confess to a double annoyance because I was planning to wax ineloquent about the egregious problem of paragraph 9, which is a dreadful paragraph. I was going to say all sorts of nasty things about it, but it is hardly worth doing so because Government amendment No. 355 more or less cracks the problem. It would be utterly churlish to look that gift horse in the mouth.

<P>
That means that I cannot really justify detaining the Committee on schedule 29 for the next half hour, hour or two hours.

<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Vice-Chamberlain to Her Majesty's Household): Go on.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> If the Government Whip tempts me, I am quite capable of it. However, I would like briefly to mention paragraph 4(6). 1 hope that I can do better than I have done previously in describing the problem, which is connected with a lack of transitional provisions. Let us imagine a UK company with a large gain that sells the asset with the gain to a subsidiary in return for shares. That seems to be an attempt to avoid tax. Instead of having to sell the asset on and crystallise the capital gain, the UK company that engages in the manoeuvre ends up with shares in the subsidiary, and sells them without crystallising the capital gain, hence avoiding the capital gains tax. That is the mischief that the schedule tries to address. We have no problem with that; it is perfectly right. Again, I declare an interest, as I am sure that I have been involved in such transactions, which were perfectly legal previously and would have been a jolly good wheeze. It is appropriate that the Inland Revenue should catch up with them. I have never been able to understand why people were able to engage in the activity in the past.

<P>
The issue is timing, although I am not sure whether it is a problem, which is why I describe it as a query. I draw the Paymaster General's attention to lines 36 and 37 on page 487, which state that the method for clobbering such avoidance will have effect in relation to assets acquired on or after 1 April 2000.

<P>
What would happen if the asset were acquired before 1 April 2000--and transferred into the newly formed sub in consideration for shares before 1 April 2000--but the sale of the company or shares, the purpose of which is to avoid the crystallisation of the gain, occurred after 1 April 2000? If the sale were caught under the new rules, notwithstanding that the transfer occurred before 1 April 2000, the Inland Revenue would catch somebody who had, perfectly legitimately, intended the dodge but now could not do it. That would be a good effect of designing the provision so that it applied when the transfer was before April but the sale of the shares came later. If that were the interpretation, however, it might also catch perfectly bona fide transactions. Some people might transfer assets into companies in a perfectly bona fide trading way, thinking that the tax consequence would not be to crystallise a gain, but discovering to their horror that, after I April, a gain had been crystallised, thereby invalidating a transaction. That would be unfortunate. It is therefore important to know whether, in relation to the timing application for assets acquired on or after 1 April 2000, the new provision is intended to apply when assets are transferred before 1 April 2000 and shares in the subsidiary are sold after.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman has finally asked a question that I cannot answer this afternoon. In relation to lines 36 and 37, the advice that I have been given is that the provision must be read in conjunction with paragraph 4(6). If the asset is transferred before 1 April 2000 but sold after, section 179 still applies to impose the charge if disposal is outside the worldwide group. Circumstances therefore exist in which the old rules apply on transfer and raising the charge. It is a consequence of linking those measures together.

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I think that the Paymaster General said something extremely helpful, but I did not catch all of it. Will she repeat it? I am sorry to ask her to do that, but I think that it may clear up the matter.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am going to say something that I am not supposed to. I hope that I can repeat the words correctly on the basis that I can read what is on the paper. I said that if an asset is transferred before April 2000 but sold after, section 179 still applies and will impose a charge if disposal is outside the worldwide group. I hope that that response provides an answer. If I am incorrect, I shall be required to correct the record in the proper way. Lines 36 and 37, in conjunction with section 179 and paragraph 4(6), are the consequential steps that need to be taken in terms of interpretation.

<P>
I should say how much I admire the splendid job that the hon. Gentleman has done in spending so much time reading the schedules and cross-referencing them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I understood the Paymaster General, and her explanation clarified the matter. However, I ask her to consider whether the provision will have the effect, as I think that it will, of catching some transfers within groups that have legitimately occurred before April 2000. That would be an unfortunate consequence, and would repay consideration. I do not mean to portray the subject as the most important one in the world. Most of what the proposal will catch will be from tax dodges, which is what it is intended to catch, but some may not be. Perhaps she could propose something on Report, if feasible, that would differentiate the cases.
