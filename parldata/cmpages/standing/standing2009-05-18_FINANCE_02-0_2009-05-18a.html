<a name="090519113000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000371"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> Welcome back to the Chair, Mr.
Atkinson. May I mention in passing the letter that I have just written
to members of the Committee? It encloses regulations for schedule 3 and
some explanations regarding order-making powers, and I hope hon.
Members will have the opportunity to look at
it.</div><a name="090519113000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the points made by the hon. Member for Hammersmith and
Fulham before the break, in relation to clause 5 and schedule 1, I hope
to reassure him on some of the perfectly understandable concerns that
he raised. First, he asked why we are taking the action now&#151;or
how had the matter arisen. During the drafting of the Income
Tax Act 2007, lawyers made the point that granting personal allowances
solely on the fact that somebody is a Commonwealth citizen
would be discrimination on the basis of nationality and therefore
should not be continued. They advised that the law needed to be changed
as soon as was practical and we have been looking at various options,
taking a bit of time. This is the first opportunity that we have had
since then to put the decision
right.</div><a name="090519113000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090519113000372"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): That is rather
what I expected. Have the Government considered the knock-on effects?
What impact might that ruling have on other aspects that are defined
purely on the basis of nationality, such as the eligibility to vote in
this
country?</div><a name="090519113000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000373"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I will discuss the implications of the measure and
the changes that we are making here later. For now, I will say that if
other problems of that kind were raised, they would need to be
addressed in the same way. I do not think that that is the case in the
example cited by the hon. Gentleman, but there may well be other
circumstances in which steps would need to be
taken.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div><a name="090519113000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000374"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Are there any implications for EU nationals? Will
they be affected by the same consideration?</div>
<a name="090519113000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000375"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> No, there is no implication for EU nationals. The
matter is purely about people who are not resident in the UK but, up
until now, have been entitled to personal allowances in UK tax on the
sole basis of being Commonwealth citizens. Hence, it is rather unusual.
The hon. Gentleman expressed a concern on behalf of his constituents,
and, of course, if they are his constituents, by definition they are
resident in the UK and will therefore continue to benefit from
allowances in the normal
way.</div><a name="090519113000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
Commonwealth citizens with income liable to tax in the UK will still be
able to claim UK personal allowance. That is either, as I have said,
because they live here or because they qualify under other provisions.
I will run through what some of those provisions
are.</div><a name="090519113000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
be affected by the change, a person must be non-resident in the UK. If
they are resident here, they are qualified in the normal way, but even
if they were non-resident, there would be other provisions, under which
most will probably be eligible for personal allowances and
reliefs.</div><a name="090519113000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
provisions were set out in the Income Tax Act 2007, and they
include, for example, anyone
who</div><a name="090519113000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
is resident in the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands,</div>
<a name="090519113000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) has
previously resided in the United Kingdom and is resident abroad for the
sake of the health
of&#151;</div><a name="090519113000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">(i)
the individual,
or</div><a name="090519113000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">(ii)
a member of the individual&#146;s family who is resident with the
individual,</div>
<a name="090519113000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) is a
person who is or has been employed in the service of the
Crown,&#148;&#151;</div><a name="090519113000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think the hon. Gentleman referred to nurses working with the Ministry
of Defence as an example, and their position should be safeguarded by
that particular
provision&#151;</div><a name="090519113000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(d)
is employed in the service of any territory under Her Majesty&#146;s
protection,</div>
<a name="090519113000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">(e) is
employed in the service of a missionary society, or</div>
<a name="090519113000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">(f) is a
person whose late spouse or late civil partner was employed in the
service of the
Crown.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
wide range of people who are non-resident and are Commonwealth citizens
could still benefit from the allowances on the basis of those
provisions.</div><a name="090519113000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000376"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The right hon. Gentleman mentioned employees of the
Crown and various other categories. Will other public sector employees
be included? For example, I mentioned the SS Windrush generation who
came over and were employed predominantly by London Transport. Will
employees who have since gone back to their home country be
covered?</div><a name="090519113000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000377"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I do not think that a London Transport employee
would count as an employee of the Crown, but they might qualify under
the other provisions that I have set out; it would depend on their
circumstances. The hon. Gentleman made the point about the
14 territories where double taxation agreements are not in
place. They are all quite small in relative terms. I have no doubt that
we could find people who would lose personal allowances as a result of
the measure, but the question is whether they should be advantaged
relative to somebody from a non-Commonwealth country who is in the same
position. The legal advice is clear that they should not be. The
measure simply enacts that decision.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div><a name="090519113000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000378"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The right hon. Gentleman says that the numbers who
would be affected are very small, but he has not answered my question
about what those numbers might be and what kind of study the Treasury
has done on the numbers involved, which could be rather a
lot.</div><a name="090519113000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
2001 census gives one an idea of the number of people involved who are
resident in the UK or have not returned to their home
country&#151;8,265 from St. Lucia and 7,091 from St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, not to mention Tanzania and Cameroon. Substantial
populations have returned to their home country. If the numbers are
small, the right hon. Gentleman must have some idea what they
are.</div><a name="090519113000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000379"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> No, I do not. The numbers that the hon. Gentleman
just read out refer to people who are resident in the UK and receive
tax allowances on that basis. My point is that the group we are talking
about are people who were in that position in the past but have since
gone back to their home country and are still benefiting from personal
tax allowances. I put it to him that that is quite a small
group.</div>
<a name="0905205000001"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000380"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I shall tell the right hon. Gentleman why I quoted
those numbers. I am perfectly well aware that those are people who in
2001 were in the UK and are not affected by the clause. I merely point
out that they form quite substantial parts of some of our populations
in this country&#151;for example, about 3 per cent. of the
black Caribbean population of this country. In all likelihood, the
numbers who have returned to their home country, or indeed gone to a
third Commonwealth country that is on the list, could be considerable.
I am rather disturbed that the Minister does not seem to have any
firmer numbers on the people we are dealing with
here.</div>
<a name="090519113000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000381"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> In an attempt to be helpful, let me give the hon.
Gentleman some data in the case of Tanzania, which is the country on
his list with the highest number of citizens coming to the UK. In 2007,
75 individuals came to the UK with work permits; 890 came for full-time
study; 1,255 were given extended right to remain, including 900
students; and 360 became British citizens. Very few students or those
in the UK for short visits will have any UK source income when they
return to Tanzania. That is the basis on which I say that the majority
will not be affected. They would have to be people who, for some
reason, were getting income from the UK but were not in the UK any
longer. Pensioners are covered elsewhere, as I have
said.</div><a name="090519113000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we were able to identify a few people who had lost out, an alternative
method of computation that may limit their liabilities is set out in
sections 811 to 814 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003.
That computation disregards certain types of income, including some
pensions such as the statutory retirement pension or a pension provided
under a registered pension scheme; some savings and investment income;
and some social security
payments.</div><a name="090519113000323"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="090519113000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the hon. Gentleman feels that those who have served the
country&#151;those who have worked for London Transport, for
example&#151;are unlikely to be affected and could take advantage of
the provisions under 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>the 2003 legislation. That is over and above the protection provided by
the fact that income, such as bank account interest and foreign
dividends, can be paid gross to non-residents so there would be no tax
liability.</div><a name="090519113000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000382"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Will the right hon. Gentleman say more about what
discussions he has had with the high commissions of the 14 countries
concerned? Have the Government attempted to publicise in the local
media the changes of those 14 countries, for example? Have they
contacted any of the individuals in the 14
countries?</div><a name="090519113000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000383"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making a valiant effort, so I
shall give him one more reassuring piece of information. As we set out
in the Red Book, the measure has been scored as raising negligible
yield. I am not saying that no one will be affected, but the measure
will not bring in significant additional tax revenue to the Exchequer.
We are aligning the position for Commonwealth citizens with that for
all other non-European economic area citizens who receive United
Kingdom-source income. There have not been discussions with the
individual Governments concerned, but the measure will not come into
effect until April next year so there will be the opportunity to
rewrite guidance and advise those who are
affected.</div><a name="090519113000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is perfectly right to draw attention to potential
concerns, and I hope that I have reassured him that the measure is
quite minor. The matter was identified a couple of years ago as needing
to be put right, which the clause and schedule are
doing.</div><a name="090519113000035"></a>

also be happy to have a separate conversation about the schedule when
we reach that stage.</div>
<a name="090519113000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 6
introduces schedule 2, which provides for the additional rate of tax
from 2010-11. The rate will be set at 50 per cent. in 2010-11 and apply
to those with taxable incomes above &#163;150,000 a year. As you will
recall, it was announced in the pre-Budget report in November that we
would be introducing a 45 per cent. rate in April 2011. However, the
global downturn has been worse than predicted and, as a result, more
consolidation is required. That is why the additional rate has been
brought forward and raised by five percentage points to 50 per
cent.</div><a name="090519113000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090519113000390"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): In
view of the Budget&#146;s optimistic projections for growth in the
next few years, on what basis did the Treasury feel it necessary to
change its proposal for a 45p tax rate? After all, if Government
figures are to be believed, we shall have growth racing away at 3.5 per
cent. within the next year or so. On the basis of that figure very
little obvious change has been made in relation to public expenditure,
so why the radical change on
taxation?</div><a name="090519113000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000391"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Because, as I said, expectations for the world
economy have gone backwards&#151;in an adverse direction&#151;to a
significant extent since November of last year. The International
Monetary Fund has revised its forecasts two or three times in that
period&#151;downwards in all cases&#151;so what we needed to do was
what we put in place in the Budget: a trajectory that we could deliver
on, getting us back to balance by a later point than we said in
November, by 2017 rather 2015. The measure is an important contribution
to
that.</div><a name="090519113000048"></a>

The position has deteriorated appallingly since last
November&#151;or so he would tell us. Is he now entirely clear that
the figures are final, and we shall have no further downward
projections in the months and years to
come?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000395"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> All I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that the
projection at the time of the Budget was the best available, given the
data at that point. I wish I could tell the Committee with absolute
confidence what will be happening in the next one, two or three years,
but in reality we are not in that happy
position.</div><a name="090519113000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090519113000396"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): The logic of the
Financial Secretary&#146;s argument is that he cannot confirm the
figure for the top rate. If the growth forecasts are worse than
predicted, the logic is that he will come back and say, &#147;Well,
it is 60 or 70 per cent.&#148; Perhaps we shall go back to the days
of 98 per cent., or even the negative of 101 per cent., which we had
under a Labour
Government.</div><a name="090519113000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000397"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The question before the Committee is whether it is
right to raise the level to 50 per cent., as in the clause and
schedule. My case to the Committee is that it most certainly is right.
I am conscious that, and pleased that, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
party has not dissented from that view, and I want to set out the basis
for that being the right
decision.</div><a name="090519113000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000398"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The Financial Secretary is being most generous in
giving way. One of the most important things is surely the stability
and predictability of the UK tax system. In that regard, what kind of
message does he think it shows that the 45p tax rate has been abolished
before it has even been
introduced?</div><a name="090519113000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000399"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman will, I think, have noticed that
there has been unprecedented turbulence in the world economy over the
past few months. I hope that that has not passed him by. Policy needs
to change in the light of circumstances. We have moved swiftly and
boldly&#151;that is absolutely the right thing to do&#151;to
maintain the stability of the British economy and to put the public
finances on the right trajectory for
balance.</div><a name="090519113000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090519113000400"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): The point that many of us are
struggling to understand here&#151;we all understand that the global
economic situation, and particularly the situation in the UK, worsened
between the pre-Budget report and the Budget&#151;is that there is a
world of difference between those sweeping, global pictures that the
Financial Secretary has painted and the specifics of the difference
between the pre-Budget report and the Budget. What we would like to
understand is how he has got from one to the
other.</div><a name="090519113000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000401"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> That is the very stuff of politics&#151;to take
the grand sweep, to see what is going on in the world and to decide
what one will do in response. I shall set out the basis of what I want
to put to the Committee. As I said, I am pleased that the Conservative
party has not dissented from the view that this is an important
measure, contributing to the consolidation that is now required. We
have certainly looked carefully at the likely impact, on both
individuals and the economy, as a consequence of the 50 per cent.
rate.</div>
<a name="090519113000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I can
say to the Committee is that the UK will remain a competitive place for
business&#151;that, of course, is absolutely essential&#151;with a
tax burden that compares well internationally. The UK tax to gross
domestic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>product ratio, 37.1 per cent., continues to rank below the EU15 average.
UK top rates, taking into account social security contributions as
well, will continue to fall into the range of that of other G7
countries. Overall, the UK tax regime remains very competitive, with,
of course, the lowest corporation tax rate in the G7 and a capital
gains tax rate below that in the US and Germany, for example. I welcome
the international surveys consistently showing that the UK has a
business-friendly environment and a competitive tax system. The World
Bank&#146;s study of 181 countries, &#147;Doing Business
2009&#148;, placed the UK sixth in the world and second in the EU for
ease of doing business.</div>
<a name="090519113000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090519113000402"></a><b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): The Financial Secretary is
talking about the competitive tax rate. May I bring him back to the
clause for a moment? Subsection (4)(b) states:
&#147;&#145;for 32.5% substitute 42.5%&#146;&#148;. If I have
read the Red Book correctly, table A3, annotation 2,
states:</div><a name="090519113000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
rates applicable to dividends are 10 per cent for dividend income up to
the basic rate limit and 32.5 per cent above that.&#148;</div>
<a name="090519113000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I understand it,
that figure is now going from 32.5 to 42.5 per cent.&#151;a rise of
more than 30 per cent. Does the Financial Secretary think it right that
basic rate taxpayers who have dividend income above the basic rate
threshold should be&#151;if I have understood this
correctly&#151;subject to an increase from 32.5 to 42.5 per
cent.?</div><a name="090519113000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000403"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I shall come to the implications for some of the
other rates in a moment. The point I am making is about the 50 per
cent. rate on income above &#163;150,000, but there are some knock-on
consequences, which I will spell out in a moment.</div>
<a name="090519113000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question, yes, this measure is consistent
with the competitiveness of the UK as a place for investment in
business, consistent with fairness, and consistent with the
consolidation that is needed over the next few years. The measure will
raise more than &#163;6 billion in its first three years. That
estimate takes into account, as all our estimates do, behavioural
consequences of the change, about which we had some discussion this
morning. As I also mentioned this morning, the assumptions that
underpin our view of the yield coming from this measure were confirmed
by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in its post-Budget briefing as
&#147;not unreasonable&#148;.</div>
<a name="090519113000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some have
suggested that the behaviour impacts are such that we should not make
that change. I do not agree with that, because without this measure,
focused on those with the very highest incomes, funding would need to
be found elsewhere. Our choice has been to look, in this clause, to
those who are in the best position, who are most able to afford to pay,
and whose incomes have risen a good deal faster than the average over
the last
decade.</div><a name="090519113000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090519113000404"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): I am a little
surprised that the Financial Secretary mentioned the Institute for
Fiscal Studies, because it also predicted that the tax would generate
almost nothing. I am wondering whether the definition of &#147;almost
nothing&#148; and agreement with the Financial Secretary coincide.
This causes me concern, and I am also concerned that the Chancellor
said that there was no science to choosing the 50 per cent. tax rate. I
want to be absolutely sure that this is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>revenue-raising measure. Will the Financial Secretary give me a total
assurance that that is the case and that it will not in fact diminish
revenues, which is a
possibility?</div><a name="090519113000324"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="090519113000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000405"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I simply refer the hon. Gentleman to the
post-Budget presentation by the IFS, which I have in front of me. The
IFS says on one of its
slides:</div><a name="090519113000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;How
much will the 50% rate raise? HM Treasury says &#163;2.4
bn.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
little further down, it
says:</div><a name="090519113000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Government&#146;s
assumptions not
unreasonable.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was my point, and it is certainly my view that the measure will raise a
substantial amount for the Exchequer and make an important contribution
to the consolidation that is required.</div>
<a name="090519113000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me move
on to the question put by the hon. Member for Dundee, East about some
of the consequences or knock-on effects of the change. The rate of tax
due on dividends over the same income threshold is raised, as he said,
to 42.5 per cent. The clause also raises the trust rate to 50 per cent.
and the dividend trust rate to 42.5 per cent., to ensure that there is
no incentive for somebody to put money into a trust simply to reduce
tax liability.</div>
<a name="090519113000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">On dividend
income, let me be clear: dividend income over &#163;150,000 will be
subject to the 42.5 per cent. rate; a rate of 32.5 per cent. will
continue to apply up to that amount. In other words, basic rate
taxpayers, about whom the hon. Gentleman is particularly concerned, in
receipt of dividends will not be affected.</div>
<a name="090519113000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
consequence of the 50 per cent. tax rate is the impact on special rates
of tax in the pensions tax rules. Those rules operate on the basis that
individuals receive tax relief at their top tax rate on pension savings
up to prescribed limits. If those saving limits are exceeded, tax
charges are applied to recover tax relief on contributions. The clause
puts in place powers to vary the rates for those special pensions tax
charges in regulations, a point that is mentioned in the letter that
has been circulated this afternoon.</div>
<a name="090519113000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
thought very carefully about how the further money required for fiscal
consolidation should be raised. We are clear that it is right to
require those who benefited most in the last decade and who are in the
best position to pay to contribute more. That is the basis for the
clause. I will now give way to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="090519113000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000406"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The Financial Secretary really is being very
generous in giving way. Can he just tell us how he thinks he will
present to the electors of East Ham at some point within the next 13
months the fact that he has broken his own general election manifesto
pledge from 2005? Perhaps he thinks otherwise, but the manifesto said
clearly:</div><a name="090519113000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
will not raise the basic or top rates of income tax in the next
Parliament.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000407"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The measure is rather popular among my constituents
in East Ham. They look to the Government to take the right decisions
for the future of our country. In extraordinary circumstances, of the
sort that we have seen in the world economy in the past few months, it
is right of the Government to put in place the measures that are needed
to safeguard the economy, families and businesses, and to secure the
consolidation that will be needed in the next few years. The measure is
an important step towards doing that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div><a name="090519113000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000408"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that response.
I think that he is saying that the measure will be popular in East Ham
and that he will campaign on that basis. Is he also saying that he will
campaign nationwide on the basis that the measure will be
popular?</div>
<a name="090519113000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000409"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I believe that it is a popular measure
nationwide.</div>
<a name="090519113000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000410"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> We have got to the heart of the matter. I am now
going to talk at some length about the 50p tax rate and ancillary
matters. I hope to cover quite a wide range of topics, including,
first, the reactions to the proposed 50p rate and, secondly, a question
that we have not really covered yet, which is whether the proposed 50p
rate will be a temporary measure or permanent. Thirdly, I will examine
whether the measure will raise the amount that it is claimed it will
raise, and whether it might not be beyond the point of revenue
maximisation. Fourthly, I will look at the UK&#146;s overall economic
competitiveness. Fifthly, I will look at the political background and
reasons for introducing the 50p tax rate and some of the other
measures. I will also look at the complexity that the abolition of the
45p tax rate&#151;before it was even introduced&#151;will add to
the unpredictability of the UK tax code. Furthermore, I will discuss
some of the more technical provisions relating to trust dividends and
pensions before drawing some
conclusions.</div><a name="090519113000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is the first rise in the top rate of tax since 1974, after 35 years of
it either being stable or reduced. It is worth reiterating that the
Government estimate that the new 50p rate on earnings above
&#163;150,000 will raise &#163;1.13 billion in 2010-11, rising to
&#163;2.52 billion in 2011-12. However, the new tax rate&#146;s
implementation is largely the result of political posturing. The change
sends the wrong signal to entrepreneurs who are in the UK and to those
who might be attracted to come here, and it will lead many to question
the UK&#146;s economic competitiveness, especially in relation to its
tax code. The proposal also adds to massive uncertainty about the UK
tax system and is a reminder of the importance of predictability in
that system. Moreover, it adds significantly to UK tax complexity,
which, as we heard this morning, is already a developing theme in our
deliberations on the Bill. The 11 different marginal tax rates that
have been created in recent years are incredibly
complex.</div><a name="090519113000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Questions
remain about whether the proposal will raise anything like the amount
that has been suggested, and I am disturbed by the earlier evidence
that, in the Treasury&#146;s assessment of what the measures will
yield, it did not separate the phasing out of allowances on the one
hand, and the introduction of the 50p tax rate on the other. There
seems to be an assumption that those two factors will prompt the same
behavioural reaction, but people&#146;s reactions may well be very
different. For example, somebody who currently earns &#163;95,000 but
may expect to earn &#163;105,000 might go about not earning that
extra &#163;10,000, but doing something else; on the other hand,
somebody who earns &#163;250,000 might decide to relocate. It is
fundamentally flawed to throw two kinds of consideration into the same
estimate of
revenue.</div><a name="090519113000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ancillary changes to pension and dividend rates act as a severe
disincentive to save and they send the wrong message on
saving&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire
spoke earlier about the importance of our savings culture. Also, the
change to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>the trust rates might have a perverse impact on many who are not well
off and are about to suffer undue hardship as a result of the
Government&#146;s
measures.</div><a name="090519113000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reactions
to the 50p tax rate announcement were very interesting. We will turn to
focus groups in due
course.</div><a name="090519113000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090519113000411"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Hands:</b> Our pledge is clear: we do not think that it is the
right thing to do, but we are not pledged to reverse it. It will have
to take its place in the queue of other tax measures that we will look
at. Our priority will be to lower the tax burden on those on a medium
income, so reversing the 0.5 per cent. rise in national insurance
contributions for those earning more than &#163;19,000 will be our
priority. But that does not prevent anybody from raising a number of
questions about the 50p tax
rate.</div><a name="090519113000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000413"></a>Mr.

promises and mislead people that we do not know what mess this
Government will get us in to? Is not that the truth of the
matter?</div><a name="090519113000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000414"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Public finances
are in an appalling and worsening state. The Financial Secretary has
already spoken about why he had to scrap his own 45p tax rate, which he
launched only a few months ago. To then have the nerve to say that we
should state what our first Budget might look like, a full year in
advance of when we might be elected, shows real cheek.</div>
<a name="090519113000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was
large-scale condemnation of the move to a 50p tax rate. I mentioned
focus groups, which, interestingly, cropped up in Second Reading when
the right hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers)
referred to them. I will come back to examine some points that he
made.</div>
<a name="090519113000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even those
who one might expect to be natural supporters of the 50p rate tempered
their praise. For example, an editorial in <i class="I">The Guardian</i>, which
one might have expected to support it&#151;I think that, broadly, it
did&#151;commented that the measure
was</div><a name="090519113000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
commendable attempt to share the
pain&#148;,</div><a name="090519113000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
sounds fair enough from the Government&#146;s point of
view,</div><a name="090519113000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#151;but
it will not do much to plug the yawning gap in the public finances,
seeing as it was not combined with measures on property or
capital.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
even <i class="I">The Guardian </i>was not was not particularly supportive of the

aside the breaking of the New Labour covenant on tax rates, it is plain
stupid to make a change that brings in less revenue, not more. If you
need more revenue you have to be honest and acknowledge that it must
come from higher basic rate income tax and higher
VAT.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
<i class="I">The Economist</i> observed that the
changes</div><a name="090519113000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
irritate the 1-2% of taxpayers affected; but it will hardly solve the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000415"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> My hon. Friend is giving some excellent examples of
the folly of the Government&#146;s policy. The Financial Secretary
let it out of the bag; there is no financial reason; it is being done
because it is popular in his constituency. This is a dog whistling
campaign to get the Labour party core vote out, so it is not decimated
at the next
election.</div><a name="090519113000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000416"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> My hon. Friend gets to the heart of the matter,
which is why I asked whether the Financial Secretary was going to
campaign on this issue nationwide believing that higher taxes will be
popular and will make people more likely to vote Labour. The history of
the Labour party in the past 15 years suggests that the opposite is the
case.</div>
<a name="090519113000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000417"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman anticipate that
Tony Blair will join the Financial Secretary on the campaign trail? By
all accounts he regards this as a betrayal of his legacy as leader and
originator of new
Labour&#151;</div><a name="090519113000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000418"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am anxious to keep the debate to clause
6.</div>
<a name="090519113000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000419"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Thank you for that guidance, Mr.
Atkinson. I was going to mention Tony Blair because it is important to
reference manifesto pledges. I have signed up to receive the e-mails
and funny bulletins from the Tony Blair Faith Foundation and about his
middle east activities. I have not seen anything in those e-mails about
the 50p tax rate, but I am led to believe that he has condemned it
quite strongly in private conversations with leading people in the
Labour party. I think he said that it would be &#147;a terrible
mistake&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div><a name="090519113000325"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="090519113000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall also talk a little about how in the last Parliament one political
party was pledged to introduce a 50p top rate of tax&#151;the Liberal
Democrats. I was going to mention some of what the then Prime Minister,
Mr. Blair, said to attack the 50p top rate of tax. It will
make uncomfortable listening for some Labour Members.</div>
<a name="090519113000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am still
looking at the reactions to the 50p top rate of tax. Richard Lambert,
the director general of the CBI, said that he had spoken to some
business people who were considering relocating as a result of the new
measures, which he described as highly unwelcome.</div>
<a name="090519113000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
most interesting reaction was from a gentleman who was until quite
recently a member of the Government. Lord Jones of Birmingham, the
former Business Minister, was one of the Prime Minister&#146;s
personal appointments. He resigned earlier this year&#151;perhaps he
had more foresight than some and could see what was coming down the
road. Referring to the new 50p higher rate of tax he
said:</div><a name="090519113000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
thought New Labour was about empowering people, not a command economy
mentality and the politics of
revenge.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
also said:</div>
<a name="090519113000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
greatest criticism was that there was no vision. The overriding thing
was a feeling of disappointment. I was hoping to see
leadership&#148;.</div><a name="090519113000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that Ministers were led astray by the focus
groups.</div>
<a name="090519113000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090519113000420"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): I want to ask the hon.
Gentleman about the imprint of the fence on his bottom on this subject.
He is making a powerful speech attacking this measure, but I have yet
to hear him say either that he will oppose the clause or that he would
seek to reverse the measure at a future date. I would welcome an
explanation of his posture, uncomfortable as it
seems.</div><a name="090519113000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000421"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I repeat what I said earlier, although I thought I
had made it absolutely clear. We do not believe that this is the right
thing to do, but we cannot pledge to reverse it. It will be difficult
to say what the public finances will look like in 12 or 13
months&#146; time, or hopefully less. The Exchequer Secretary
chuckles, but I was interested to read her reaction in a debate on a
statutory instrument in January. When my predecessor, my hon. Friend
the Member for Putney (Justine Greening), asked her what was coming up
in the Budget, the hon. Lady replied that it would be irresponsible of
the Government to say what might be in the Budget three months in
advance. It is a bit rich for Labour Members to ask us to set policy a
year or perhaps longer in
advance.</div><a name="090519113000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000422"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I certainly look forward to receiving a leaflet
through my door explaining that particular position. Can I suggest to
the hon. Gentleman that there are two issues to confront here? The
first is revenue raising, and I largely agree with the thrust of the
argument about the relatively small sum the measure will raise. My
right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary made that point himself.
However, there is also the message of equity in a state and country at
large that is facing an economic crisis and the need to share the
burdens. There is an argument for saying that those who are best off
should pay more in those circumstances.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000423"></a>Mr.

First, on revenue raising, I shall talk about whether the measure will

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000425"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. If
there is a statement by Mr. Speaker early this evening, will
the Committee be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000426"></a>The
Chairman:</b> In normal circumstances, the Committee would
adjourn only for Divisions, but in view of the importance of what such
a statement might contain, I shall seek further
advice.</div><a name="090519113000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090519113000427"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Atkinson. Should not the Government be providing the
quorum for a Committee such as this? Only two Government Members are
present; it is the Opposition Members who are making the Committee
quorate and able to continue its
proceedings.</div><a name="090519113000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000428"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That is a point of observation, rather than a
point of
order.</div><a name="090519113000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000429"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Before the multiple Divisions, I was in the middle
of responding to an intervention from the hon. Member for South
Derbyshire, who is obviously still involved in one of those
Divisions&#151;no, he is returning as I speak. The first point that
he raised was about how much revenue the 50p tax rate would raise. His
second point was about equity and whether it is fair. Equity is a
tempting argument, but the problem is that it is predicated on those
higher rate taxpayers staying exactly where they are. There is not much
point in having a more equitable tax arrangement if the people at whom
it is directed change their behaviour, move out of the country, start
putting more of their cash into something else, work less or get more
involved in charitable
activities.</div><a name="090519113000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the 50p tax rate is so equitable, why did the Government not introduce
it earlier? If it is equitable from the Government&#146;s perspective
now, surely that was also the case in 1997. The reality is that the
Government are scrabbling around, trying to find a way to fill the gap,
and soaking the rich is too politically tempting, at least for the
Government under the current Prime Minister.</div>
<a name="090519113000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any case,
the world has changed a great deal since 1997. We have become more
globalised and the tax code has become more complex, which will
generally make it easier to avoid paying tax. It is also much easier
for people to locate elsewhere. With modern communications and the
ability to travel very quickly, it is much easier to do business
outside the UK. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about equity, but
we have to ask ourselves why, if the 50p tax rate is equitable now, it
was not equitable in 1997.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div><a name="090519113000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall now explore whether the measure, at least in the
Government&#146;s eyes, is to be temporary or permanent. The
interview with the Chancellor in the <i class="I">Daily Mail </i>on 23 April was
fascinating. He said that he would have to ask people on higher
earnings</div><a name="090519113000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
contribute a bit more while we resolve this
situation&#148;.</div><a name="090519113000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suddenly,
that introduced huge uncertainty about the timing. I think that we were
led to believe that the measure might be permanent, but suddenly the
Chancellor was saying that it applied only</div>
<a name="090519113000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;while we
resolve this
situation.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090519113000430"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Jeremy </b><b class="B">Browne:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman think
that the Chancellor had in mind the period until the economy returns to
growth, which he predicts will be at the turn of the year, or the
period until 2031, when public borrowing will be back to the 40 per
cent. that the Prime Minister previously set as the maximum
level?</div><a name="090519113000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000431"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a very interesting
question: quite what is meant by &#147;this situation&#148;? That
might have referred to the banking crisis and the ongoing immediate
financial crisis. Perhaps the Chancellor was not referring to the
economy; perhaps he was not referring to budget deficits and overall
levels of indebtedness. However, his comment introduced enormous
uncertainty into the equation, not least because the Leader of the
House, I think on the same day, implied that the change was to be made
permanent. What will define this new term of resolving the situation?
How long does the Financial Secretary expect the measure to be in
place? If it is abolished, will tax allowances be reintroduced for
higher rate taxpayers? Are the two things inextricably linked in his
mind, or might some separation come about in the Government&#146;s
thinking?</div><a name="090519113000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
may be a hypothetical element to those questions, but they are
important. For example, the behavioural response of higher rate
taxpayers to a temporary surcharge on higher earners could be rather
different from their response to a permanent system of higher taxes,
which would mark a clear break with the established consensus on top
marginal rates of tax. Tax predictability is important, and we need the
Financial Secretary to shed some light on it.</div>
<a name="090519113000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The area of
greatest controversy, which was mentioned in earlier interventions, is
whether the 50p tax rate will raise all that the Treasury says it will.
It is worth taking a quick look at the 45p tax rate&#151;a rate that
was abolished before it was introduced. In the pre-Budget report, we
saw the reality that it is taxes on the many rather than on the rich
that will fill the hole. The PBR estimated that introducing the 45 per
cent. rate and raising the tax rate on trusts to 45 per cent. would
raise &#163;670 million in 2011-12, but that restricting the personal
allowance for individuals with incomes of more than &#163;100,000
would raise &#163;1.32 billion in the same year.</div>
<a name="090519113000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">By contrast,
the PBR said that increasing the rates of national insurance by half a
percentage point on employees, employers and the self-employed would
have raised an estimated &#163;5.4 billion in 2011-12. That increase
in national insurance contributions would have raised eight times the
revenue that would have been raised by the 45p tax rate, and five times
the amount that was going to be raised by phasing out the allowances.
With the 50p tax rate, that ratio is obviously tighter, but a much
larger 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>amount of tax is still being raised from the many than from the few. The
real losers under this Budget and the Government&#146;s approach in
general are those being paid more than &#163;19,000, who will have to
cough up more on their national insurances contributions.</div>
<a name="090519113000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The words of
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales were
instructive. It
says:</div><a name="090519113000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whilst
higher taxes for higher earners may be politically popular, the actual
amounts they raise are relatively small and will make hardly a dent in
the UK&#146;s
overdraft&#148;.</div><a name="090519113000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090519113000432"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Jeremy </b><b class="B">Browne:</b> If that is true, there is
surely no barrier to the Conservatives repealing this proposed item of
legislation at the earliest
opportunity.</div><a name="090519113000128"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000433"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an important question. It
has been posed before. As I shall say later, the jury is still out on
whether the 50p tax rate will raise significant tax revenues; and, if
so, how much it will raise. I shall also say a little about the
modelling done by the Treasury and by the Institute for Fiscal Studies,
to which the Financial Secretary referred
earlier.</div><a name="090519113000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
I return to the comments of the ICAEW. It
said:</div><a name="090519113000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Red Book anticipates that these measures will bring in only about
&#163;3bn, not a huge sum when compared to overall government
spending of &#163;671bn forecast for 2009/10 and receipts of
&#163;496bn.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
means a Budget deficit of &#163;175 billion, but the 50p tax rate
will raise only &#163;3 billion of that&#151;it will plug only a
small part of that
hole.</div>
<a name="090519113000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the IFS
post-Budget briefing&#151;I think that the Financial Secretary is
flicking through a copy as I speak&#151;Robert Chote, its director,
put the changes to income tax on the wealthy into context. I am not
sure whether the Financial Secretary and I will end up quoting the same
paragraphs, but this is what Mr. Chote said in his
post-Budget
briefing:</div><a name="090519113000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Much
attention has focused on the income tax increases on the rich, which
the Treasury hopes will raise &#163;7 billion a year. Even if this
estimate is correct, the gain will partly be offset by losses of VAT
and other indirect tax revenues buried in other Budget forecasting
changes.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
continued:</div><a name="090519113000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
should also bear in mind that increases in fuel duty and National
Insurance will raise a roughly similar amount&#151;and from a much
broader range of
families.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went
on:</div><a name="090519113000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;And
all the tax increases announced to date will in total raise only about
10 per cent. of the money the Treasury is looking for by 2017-18. So
the main burden of the looming tightening&#151;at least over the next
few years&#151;is likely to fall on the users of public
services.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a slightly different flavour from that given earlier by the
Financial Secretary.</div>
<a name="090519113000328"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="090519113000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,
in a presentation on the Budget changes to direct taxes and benefits,
another officer of the IFS, Stuart Adam,
noted:</div><a name="090519113000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Huge
uncertainty about how much people will reduce their taxable income in
response&#148;,</div><a name="090519113000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">observing
that they
might</div><a name="090519113000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;work
less, retire earlier, emigrate, contribute more to pension or charity,
convert income to capital gains, incorporate, invest in tax
avoidance&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div><a name="090519113000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a huge menu of
available options, many of which will immediately look quite
attractive. Moreover, the Treasury&#146;s estimate that the 50p tax
rate would raise &#163;2.4 billion ignored any effect on consumer
spending and the consequent fall in indirect tax revenue. Not just the
IFS, but one of the Government&#146;s favourite commentators, the
Centre for Economics and Business Research, was perhaps even more
condemnatory than the IFS in its press
release:</div><a name="090519113000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Government
will lose &#163;800 million from tax hikes on the rich. Budget tax
increases on those earning over &#163;100,000 will reduce government
revenues by &#163;800 million and hit the City of London; 25,000 to
go into tax
exile.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prior
to the pre-Budget report in November, the CEBR estimated in its
document, entitled &#147;Would a 45 per cent. tax rate
raise any revenue at all?&#148;, that the likely 45 per cent. tax
rate on income over &#163;150,000 a year would cost the economy
35,000 jobs and, over a 10-year period, cost the country &#163;2
billion in revenues. That was the word from the CEBR, which is normally
quite favourable to the
Government.</div><a name="090519113000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Treasury Committee was also rather doubtful about some of the claims
made for the amount that might be raised. It said, admittedly more
neutrally:</div><a name="090519113000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that there are considerable uncertainties over the yield to be
raised by the 50 per cent. top rate of income
tax.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Treasury, I note, did not deny a report in <i class="I">The</i> <i class="I">Sunday
Telegraph</i> on 26 April about its internal modelling, which I will
come to in more detail in due course. The internal modelling suggested
that 69 per cent. of those affected would dodge some of the new tax.
The report states that the Budget
made</div><a name="090519113000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;cautious
assumptions about any impact on tax revenue through behavioural
changes.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Treasury really does have private estimates that more than half the
new top-rate taxpayers will seek to avoid the tax, we call on it to
publish them so that we can all see what impact this may
have.</div><a name="090519113000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
leads me to my next area, which is whether we have reached the revenue
maximisation point with the top rate of tax. It is worth, therefore,
looking at some of the history of top tax rates in the UK. Back in the
1980s, just before the 1988 Budget, the top 1 per cent. of earners paid
14 per cent. of all the income tax paid in this country. By
1997&#151;it took some time to work through fully&#151;that had
risen from 14 to 21 per cent. A major reason for that was that the top
rate was cut from 60 to 40 per cent.</div>
<a name="090519113000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
our friend the IFS, it has produced a sophisticated version of this
sort of modelling, which some might call the Laffer curve, perhaps
using too simplistic a view of the IFS model. The IFS has done some
study on &#147;taxable income elasticity&#148;. It put this
proposition to us,
saying</div><a name="090519113000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;suppose
the marginal tax rate was originally 50 per cent. and increased to 50.5
per cent. Then the net-of-tax rate would have fallen from 50 per cent.
to 49.5 per cent., or a fall of 1 per
cent.&#148;.</div><a name="090519113000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the elasticity were 0.46&#151;this is the figure the IFS has used,
based on the last time the top rate of tax came down in the late
1980s&#151;it says that gross income would fall by 0.46 per cent. I
am sorry: this is a slightly complicated argument, but it is important
in trying to answer the question raised by the hon. Member for Taunton
as to whether this measure will yield more tax intake.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div><a name="090519113000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
IFS is using its own model, which is admittedly based on some
assumptions that are a little dated. However, they are still probably
the most recent assumptions that anybody can make in assessing
people&#146;s behavioural change when they face different tax rates.
The IFS then calculates that increasing the tax rate above 40 per cent.
would result in the Government collecting less tax from the
rich.</div><a name="090519113000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs apparently uses in its own
modelling a figure of 0.35 instead of the figure of 0.46 that the IFS
uses. Nobody can say with any certainty which figure is right, but at
least the IFS figure is based on an historical example. As I will
explain in a moment, the Treasury&#146;s figure of 0.35 is based on
far more questionable
evidence.</div><a name="090519113000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
the Treasury uses the figure of 0.35. Using that figure and putting it
back into the IFS model produces an optimum revenue-raising rate of
57.3 per cent. My understanding of the Treasury model, which I think is
the same as the IFS&#146;s understanding of the Treasury model, is
that the tax maximisation point is not a 50p top rate of tax, but a
57.3p top rate of tax. I would be grateful for a ministerial
explanation of that. Perhaps he will agree to publish some of the
findings of the Treasury
model.</div><a name="090519113000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
IFS drew out of the Treasury the assumptions that it used when it was
deciding what the 45 per cent. tax rate would draw from the very rich.
It turns out that the Treasury had its own version of the Laffer curve,
but the elasticity ratio&#151;in other words, the lengths to which
the rich would go to avoid paying this tax&#151;was put down as low
as 0.35, as I have said. A rate of 1.0 means that
the rich will avoid everything, whereas a rate of zero means
that there will be no change in behaviour.</div>
<a name="090519113000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, as I
say, the Treasury figure was as low as 0.35, whereas the IFS figure was
0.46. That is where the crux of the argument lies&#151;in trying to
predict likely behaviour. So far, the Treasury has either not come
clean about its methodology or is perhaps deliberately obscuring some
of its results with its
assumption.</div><a name="090519113000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, the Government think that there is far less proclivity to
avoid tax by higher earners than the IFS does. However, I must stress
that the IFS has conducted the study. It is the organisation that
looked at historical rates and used some figures that might have some
reasonable basis.</div>
<a name="090519113000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Treasury&#146;s figure of 0.36 suggested that the tax maximisation
point is around 55 per cent., or 57.3 per cent. for earnings over
&#163;150,000. I would be interested to hear from the Financial
Secretary how the Treasury arrived at that figure of 0.36; it does not
seem that the Treasury itself is willing to say. However, it does seem
that the figure of 0.36 per cent. is just a tiny bit lower
than the figure that one would get for the country as a
whole.</div><a name="090519113000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
there seems to be significant evidence that the Treasury&#146;s
modelling is that a high earner is just as likely as somebody who is
perhaps earning an average wage of &#163;25,000 to try to avoid tax,
yet all the experience and all the observation of the issue suggest to
us that the opposite is true, and that a higher-rate earner is far more
likely to try to avoid tax and will probably be more able to do so.
They are likely to be in a profession that will be more easily
transposed. Of course, they are also more likely to be able to afford
better accountants, better tax advice and so on.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div><a name="090519113000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to me that the Treasury has deployed the elasticity ratio for the
average British worker and simply applied it at the same rate of 0.36
to those on &#163;150,000 a year. The Treasury tries to justify that
by saying that the rich would normally have an elasticity ratio of 0.4,
but it has downgraded that figure to 0.35 because it has abolished the
personal allowance, conveniently getting close to the rate for the
general population.</div>
<a name="090519113000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
IFS curve suggests that the peak-yielding tax rate is about 42.5 per
cent. It is fair to say that the IFS does not like to say things with
any degree of absolute certainty under its model. All the time, it
stresses how much uncertainty there is, and obviously there is a lot of
uncertainty in these models. Within them, one is predicting the
behaviour of a set of people, given various hypothetical changes that
have not even happened
yet.</div><a name="090519113000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">According
to the IFS model, if its figure of 0.46 is correct, the 50p tax rate
will lose rather a lot of money, as anything over 42.5 per cent. starts
to yield less for the Exchequer. Is the IFS being realistic? To be
fair, it is saying, as I have already mentioned, that there are a large
number of assumptions behind the model. Its assumptions are compiled
thus:</div><a name="090519113000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Using
information on how the income share of the richest 1 per
cent. of adults changed during the 1980s, the last time marginal tax
rates for the very rich were
altered.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are
we in a situation similar to that of the 1980s? That is a relevant
question. It is difficult to judge, but I think that there is evidence
that avoidance is likely to be higher now than it was then, for the
reasons that I have talked about, such as labour mobility, the ability
to move where one is working and the ability to carry out one&#146;s
work in the UK even though the work is based abroad. We have to be
extremely careful due to the greater globalisation that we have seen
over the past 20
years.</div><a name="090519113000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000434"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> My hon. Friend is making a powerful and interesting
argument, which has much merit. If a business person in this country
was on a fairly high income and the top rate was 40 per cent., they
might say, &#147;I do not care. I will pay that.&#148; But the more
that goes up, the more they will think about the whole issue. That is
the reality of the situation. It was recognised by Tony Blair, and that
was part of the success of new Labour, but it has been abandoned here
today.</div>
<a name="090519113000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000435"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It would be too
simplistic to suggest that there is a specific point at which higher
earners or entrepreneurs will say, &#147;I will remain in the UK or I
will leave.&#148; There are all kinds of different stages, one of
which might be to pay for better tax planning and better accounting,
and for more similar services, as a way to avoid that higher tax rate.
Therefore, great doubts exist as to whether the Treasury has got its
guesstimates right. It is betting a lot, it seems, that the revenue
maximisation point is a tax rate on top earners of around 56 per cent.
The IFS suggests that it is 42.5 per cent.&#151;an enormous
difference, which shows the great leap into the dark being taken by the
Government.</div><a name="090519113000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the same subject, the Institute of Chartered Accountants has argued
that a detailed economic analysis should be made of the proposed change
before any final decision is taken to proceed with the increase. I know
that many others feel the same&#151;that it would be better to have a
proper study first.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div><a name="090519113000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000436"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend on his speech. His
point about the Government&#146;s analysis when introducing the
measure adds great concern when one understands that the Chancellor has
admitted that there was no science behind the Government&#146;s
decision. Are they not an irresponsible Government, grasping for
political purposes without knowing the impact, the effect or, indeed,
the overall revenue
return?</div><a name="090519113000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000437"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> My hon. Friend is right. That has been
characteristic of tax-making policy over the past two years. It has
been based on a series of political whims and machinations, rather than
proper study and assessment of the changes in tax
rates.</div><a name="090519113000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must bear it in mind that the Government have gained some merit in
keeping various tax rates stable over some years before 2007, but now
they are throwing away all those years of stability based on a series
of whims, which, as my hon. Friend points out, are not based on any
science. I have been looking at some of the so-called science involved
in the modelling, and I think a lot of it is at best
questionable.</div><a name="090519113000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the question whether the measure will raise what the Government say it
will raise, I doubt the Treasury modelling, relative to what the IFS is
saying. Neither is likely to have exactly the right answer, as a huge
number of assumptions are being used, but I feel that the IFS has a
slightly more reputable basis for its modelling than the Treasury,
although, of course, the Minister may tell us a little more about the
Treasury&#146;s modelling in due course. The Treasury seems to use
average human behaviour&#151;that of the whole population&#151;to
predict the behaviour of the top 2 per cent. of top earners.</div>
<a name="090519113000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the Treasury underestimates modern mobility and the ability of people
today to avoid paying tax, compared with that 20 years ago. I am
disturbed by the fact that in the Red Book figures and the assessment
of the revenue raised, the Treasury has drawn no difference between the
consideration of the 50p tax rate and the phasing out of the personal
allowances. We need to model the two separately. In many cases,
different people are involved and we are looking at different types of
behaviour.</div><a name="090519113000329"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="090519113000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will move on to the question of UK economic competitiveness. The impact
of the measures on the UK&#146;s competitive position should not be
underestimated. For a moment I will return to our old favourite the
CEBR, which used to be the Government&#146;s favourite. On the
changes it
said:</div><a name="090519113000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
provisional calculations suggest that if these were implemented, over 3
years there would be a loss in UK jobs building up to 140,000; a loss
in GDP in the City of London of 3% and a loss in tax revenues for the
government of &#163;800 million a year. About 25,000 high end
taxpayers would be likely to shift tax regimes, with the low tax
cantons in Switzerland like Zug the likely largest
gainers.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have never been to Zug, so I do not have any first-hand experience of
its attractions. However, it is perfectly possible that we might be
jeopardising the UK&#146;s overall economic competitiveness by
increasing temptation beyond a certain point for people to make that
move. The CEBR goes
further:</div><a name="090519113000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
can understand the tough choices that governments might have to make
when they have to trade off the prospect of raising revenues against
the potential damage that higher taxes might do 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>to the economy. But the evidence here seems to be that the damage to the
economy is so great that there is no trade off. The economy is worse
and revenues are
lower.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is very important.</div>
<a name="090519113000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ICAEW
has similarly expressed concern about the combined impact of the
various proposed changes to the income tax rules&#151;the 50p tax
rate, the removal of personal allowances for those with income
exceeding &#163;100,000 and the pensions changes&#151;on the UK as
a place to live, work and invest. As I have mentioned, a further effect
could be that some existing high earners are driven to move abroad, and
the changes could also drive away aspirational young people who want to
find a better and more rewarding life elsewhere.</div>
<a name="090519113000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
constituency currently has a lot of French nationals who are
essentially here because in their view, France charges too high a top
rate of tax. It also has a large number of Polish citizens who are not
here primarily for tax reasons, but if the tax regime becomes a lot
tougher, especially with the increase in national insurance for those
earning above &#163;19,000, they may be tempted to go
back.</div>

Browne:</b> On that topic, has the hon. Gentleman given any
consideration to Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal football club
manager&#146;s thoughts that this measure may drive away footballers
who are able to ply their trade in many markets? Those players give
great pleasure to people who watch premiership
football.</div><a name="090519113000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000439"></a>Mr.

think that I am the only Conservative MP who has a premiership football
club in their constituency. In fact, I represent two&#151;Fulham and
Chelsea. It would be remiss of me to comment on what arrangements
Arsenal may have made, but the impact of the 50p tax rate on Chelsea
football club could be significant. However, I do not want to stray
down that road, as there will be different views about the desirability
of all those highly paid footballers&#146; being in the
country.</div>

have a bad impact on tax

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000444"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> As my hon. Friend says, it was a Treasury-sponsored
report. According to the <i class="I">Daily Mail</i>, the report said
that</div><a name="090519113000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;confusion
over Whitehall tax policy had put Britain&#146;s reputation as a
destination for financial high fliers at risk last
year.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was before this year&#146;s proposed rises. The article
continued:</div><a name="090519113000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Questions
about the &#145;clarity and continuity&#146; of tax policies became

report
stated:</div><a name="090519113000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This

for international financial services and indeed other

questioned.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000445"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> My hon. Friend is making an interesting and
persuasive case. Does he share my concern that the making of tax
policy, whether here or abroad, focuses too much on overseas nationals?
Perhaps we should focus more on ensuring that those who benefit from
setting up businesses, employing people and making large
profits here have a long-term commitment to this
country.</div><a name="090519113000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000446"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. In the
last couple of minutes, our discussion has perhaps been sidelined into
the subject of foreigners who are resident here, such as footballers.
His point is important and powerful. The question is not just one of
foreign nationals, as one can see from the City. To return
to the Bischoff report, huge numbers of people working in the City are
not foreign nationals but UK
subjects.</div><a name="090519113000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
my information is correct, the Chancellor co-chaired the group with the
former Citigroup chairman, Sir Win Bischoff. Doubtless, the Chancellor
was a little perturbed by the results of the report. Sir Win said that
the question of tax was &#147;important&#148;. He
added:</div><a name="090519113000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
relation to developed countries, we want a competitive tax system and
one that is predictable and
stable.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
relates to my earlier point about the importance of the UK tax code
being predictable and stable. That has been blown out of the water by
the events of the last two
years.</div><a name="090519113000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000447"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> My hon. Friend touches on the City. That area of
our economy seemed to receive great favour under the premierships of
Mr. Blair and his successor. How does my hon. Friend think
this Government intend to promote the City as an international centre,
while increasing taxes in this way? Does that not defeat the
object?</div><a name="090519113000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000448"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point, which
would be best answered by the Minister. Obviously, business cannot
return to how it was prior to 2007-08, but London must continue to be
an important and powerful financial services centre, not least because
we need to generate tax revenues. We need something to plug the
&#163;175 billion deficit that I referred to earlier. Getting the
City back into a productive mode in which it produces those tax
revenues should be an important Government
policy.</div><a name="090519113000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the UK&#146;s competitiveness, the Financial Secretary mentioned
briefly how the higher rates of tax in the UK stack up against those of
other G20 economies. A PricewaterhouseCoopers press release after the
Budget
stated:</div><a name="090519113000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;From
next April, a year earlier than expected, the UK will rank 18th among
the G20 economies in terms of income tax and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>social security rates for senior executives, based on current rates. The
change applies to both domestic and overseas high-earners working in
the
UK.</div><a name="090519113000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">This
increased tax take could accelerate the movement of high earners and
top performers in industries like finance and technology to other
established and growing economic hubs. Countries like Switzerland will
look increasingly attractive to some of the people in the key
industries needed to lead the UK out of the
recession.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have to worry about the competitive position of London as a City, too.
We have talked a little about that, but it is worth examining in more
detail. The position is vital to restoring overall tax revenues in
the country. London needs to remain a premier&#151;if not
the premier&#151;international financial centre. I am not making a
call to go back to business as usual as it was prior to 2007; that is a
matter for a separate debate, but I am calling for the City of London
to be restored to being a tax-generating part of our
economy.</div><a name="090519113000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000449"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I hope to address one or two of those issues later,
but it should be stressed first and foremost that the City of London is
still a pretty substantial tax generator in several areas that have not
been badly affected by recent events, such as insurance. Will my hon.
Friend give some thought to whether, with a bit of 20:20 hindsight, we
have become a little over-reliant on financial services not only in the
City of London, but throughout the United Kingdom in recent years?
Given that it will take some time to adapt to other industries that
will be of importance, such as creative industries in all their facets,
perhaps we should focus on that, too, and not return to the situation
that has been so prevalent over the past 12 years when the Government
have prostrated themselves before global financial services with
non-domiciles and the like, to what might be the detriment of a
balanced
economy.</div><a name="090519113000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000450"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Experience
shows that, during the nine years of this decade, as an economy we have
become too dependent on financial services. If I am not mistaken, four
fifths of all new jobs in the economy since 2000 have been created in
financial services. However, it is not exclusive to say that we need to
diversify and rebuild the City of London as a generator of tax
revenues. I appreciate my hon. Friend&#146;s point about the
insurance sector, but we are not talking about the whole of the City of
London having suddenly stopped being in business. A huge tax generation
is already going on. It is possible to do both, and diversify and
rebuild the tax
base.</div><a name="090519113000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Mayor of London made some interesting comments about the 50p tax rate,
but his comments that should have been given more attention were those
about the threat that the high rates of tax and regulation make to the
role of London. I was interested to read a piece written by Anthony
Browne, the head of policy in the Mayor&#146;s office. He warned
that, after the Budget, the extra taxes could push higher earners to
other countries without bringing in revenue to the Treasury, which is
the matter before us here today. He
said:</div><a name="090519113000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Far
more than the rest of the UK, London has an internationally mobile
workforce, and its success depends on being a global magnet for talent
and business. Having a competitive tax regime is a key part of that,
but we will now have the highest income tax rate of any major economy
in Europe, or any global commercial centre. This new barrage of taxes
on high earners comes on top of the government&#146;s assaults on
non-doms, which is also a largely London phenomenon. It sends out a
message that high earners 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>are not welcome, when they are not only welcome in London, but an
essential ingredient in London&#146;s success. This isn&#146;t
about defending the rich, but defending the economy. If high earners
either stop coming here, start leaving, or simply work less, it would
be a real setback for the London economy. The government will have
achieved a real double-whammy&#151;it will have failed to raise much

generates 17 per cent. of UK GDP; there are four times as many high
earners in London as in the rest of the country, and 145,000 Londoners
will be hit by the changes. It is not only the Mayor&#146;s office,
but respected commentators such as Tony Travers who have been talking
about the importance of London to the economy and how the Government
should not kill off London by putting on too high a rate of tax. In the
<i class="I">Evening Standard</i> of 23 April&#151;the day after the
Budget&#151;he
said:</div><a name="090519113000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Now
the bad news: that continued economic strength means that Londoners
will pay for yesterday&#146;s Budget. The Chancellor&#146;s dash
for indebtedness will in time lead to higher taxes...First,
because the capital and its region are home to many of the
country&#146;s highest earners. A 50p top tax rate...will raise
far more from the London area than elsewhere. Some people will see this
result as fair, others not. But whatever the equity of the change, it
will fall disproportionately on London&#146;s
taxpayers...Second, the vast growth of government debt will lead
to higher taxes for many years to come. Research has shown that London
and the South-East &#145;export&#146; tax to the rest of the UK.
That is, taxes raised in and around the capital exceed the amount spent
by government within the area&#151;by up to &#163;20 billion a
year. For many years, this pattern has allowed public services to be
provided in other regions to a higher standard than their own taxpayers
could otherwise
afford.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000455"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> May I bring the hon. Gentleman back to the
financial sector generally, rather than just the City of London,
although he is doing a stoic job of defending it? For a moment, I
thought that he was the Member for London First. This is about receipts
from the financial sector and revenue yield. We know that the five-year
forecast for the revenue yield from financial services and housing is
down, but even in five years&#146; time it will not be back to its
2007 position, so what 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>does he think needs to happen with the tax rates to stimulate growth and
return to the yields we had before the recession
started?</div><a name="090519113000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000456"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point,
which comes to the nub of the matter. I do not know whether his
five-year figure about housing and finance yields returning is right,
although I do not disbelieve it, but that is part of the problem. It is
important that our tax revenues are increased as quickly as they
reasonably can be, so I hope that the five-year figure is wrong. On his
general point about where we will raise the taxes, we are going to have
to see what happens to public finances over the next year, unless the
Government wish to call a general election before
then.</div><a name="090519113000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
financial centres and which had the highest tax rates, I cannot
remember exactly what the Financial Secretary said about that, but I
was interested to read an article in the <i class="I">Financial Times </i>of
Thursday 7 May, entitled, &#147;City of London will be the most
highly-taxed financial centre in the world.&#148; The article
considered the different percentages of their own income that people
are able to keep. Dubai, unsurprisingly&#151;I do not think we could
ever compete with Dubai&#151;allows people who work there to keep 95
per cent. of their income. That amount falls to 85 per cent. in Hong
Kong, 82 per cent. in Singapore, 80 per cent. in Guernsey, 68 per cent.
in Zurich and 62 per cent. in Tokyo. Crucially, the current amount in
London is 61 per cent., which is higher than New York, Frankfurt or
Paris, but the effect of the change will be that higher rate earners in
London will keep only 50 per cent. of their taxable pay. Having been
more competitive than New York, Frankfurt and Paris, it is now less
competitive than all three of those important financial centres. It is
worth remembering that someone who earns &#163;250,000&#151;some on
the Government Benches decry people earning such levels&#151;pays
&#163;125,000 per annum in tax, which, according to
www.mysalary.co.uk, pays the salaries of about six nurses. It is
important to retain these higher rate taxpayers as far as we reasonably
can.</div><a name="090519113000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to talk about the political reasons behind the 50p tax rate. As we
know, the Prime Minister loves creating his beloved dividing lines.
Exploring the negative impact that the new rate might have on our
future tax revenues, our economic competitiveness and so on leads one
to conclude that it was a political gesture. Labour has reversed into a
core-vote strategy. I was very interested to be in the Chamber when the
right hon. Member for North Tyneside made his speech.
Unusually, I do not have to qualify which speech, because he has
made only one in the past year&#151;according
to his www.theyworkforyou.com entry. However, he obviously saved his
first speech in 13 months for a big occasion. He
said:</div><a name="090519113000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
am told that when the
proposal&#151;</div><a name="090519113000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">the

received broad support as a popular

also said
that</div><a name="090519113000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;focus
groups are not always right...It has to be right that when we need
to raise revenue, we should focus on those with more money, rather than
less, but to raise significant amounts of money, which is what we need
to do given the present financial circumstances, we need a broad tax
base. The 50p rate for those earning more than &#163;150,000 will
apply to some 350,000 taxpayers in this country. They simply do not
provide the broad base to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>raise the revenue that will be needed in our present
circumstances...That leads one to consider why the 50p rate was
introduced in the first place. When one looks at the fact that it is
being brought forward to April 2010, probably just a few weeks away
from a general election, and when one considers that it targets a very
small number of taxpayers, the only sensible conclusion to draw is that
the 50p-rate proposal has more to do with political positioning and
tactical manoeuvring than a principled, strategic approach to taxation
and the raising of
revenue.</div><a name="090519113000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">He

also raised the important question of whether the changes are intended
to be permanent or
temporary.</div><a name="090519113000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ten
years ago, the Prime Minister, as Chancellor, set out his three
principles for the UK tax system. The three words were incredibly
revealing&#151;simplicity, fairness and competitiveness. In the past
two years, he has busted all three of those principles. As we discussed
this morning, &#147;simplicity&#148; has been completely broken by
the 11 marginal tax rates. &#147;Fairness&#148; was destroyed by
last year&#146;s 10p fiasco, and the 50p tax rate has put UK
&#147;competitiveness&#148; in severe danger. That is not to
mention the breaking of the Labour manifesto pledge mentioned earlier.
It is worth remembering exactly what Labour said in
2005:</div><a name="090519113000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
economic record has finally laid to rest the view that Labour could not
be trusted with the economy. We are winning the argument that economic
dynamism and social justice must go hand in hand...Labour believes
tax policy should continue to be governed by the health of the public
finances, the requirement for public investment and the needs of
families, business and the environment...We will not raise the
basic or top rates of income tax in the next
Parliament.&#148;</div><a name="090519113000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

package of tough choices on spending, and fairer taxes, means that most
people will be better off. There is only one proposed net

taxpayers)&#148;.</div><a name="090519113000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">They

One of Tony Blair&#146;s favourite things to do during the 2001 to
2005 Parliament was attack Liberal Democrat questioners on their
commitment to the 50p tax rate. In fact, I found 13 separate
sessions of Prime Minister&#146;s questions in which the then Prime
Minister did so. For example, in the last Prime Minister&#146;s
questions before the general election, in answer to a question by the
then leader of the Liberal Democrats, the right hon. Member for Ross,
Skye and Lochaber (Mr. Kennedy), he
said:</div><a name="090519113000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
do not think that his proposal to take that money out of general
taxation by a 50 per cent. top rate of tax is something that will

was going into the election committed to not having a 50p tax rate and
not raising the highest rate of income
tax.</div><a name="090519113000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the question of UK tax predictability, or rather unpredictability, a
more subtle message is being taken by many out there that the
UK&#146;s tax system is no longer as stable as it was. For example,
the planned 45p rate is being altered five months after its
announcement, before it has even been introduced. It would have been
tempting to believe that the early announcements of new tax rates in
the pre-Budget review were meant to help people plan and predict, but
the reality is that they were put there for pure political advantage.
An early announcement by this Government does not mean greater
certainty. As I said, last November, the top tax rate was to be 45p
from 2011, but by this April it had become 50p from 2010.</div>
<a name="090519113000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
country&#146;s tax system is losing credibility, and the process by
which tax changes are made&#151;not in response to long-term economic
challenges but in pursuit of short-term tactical political
gain&#151;is causing immense damage to our international reputation
and competitiveness. It all started with the pre-announcement of the
abolition of the 10p rate and the reduction of the basic rate in the
Prime Minister&#146;s last Budget as Chancellor in 2007. It
accelerated with the disastrous pre-Budget report of October 2007, as
we saw the first example of the now-familiar phenomenon of the Prime
Minister trying to head off a catastrophic loss of confidence in him on
his own Benches. It continued with the 2008 Budget, with last
year&#146;s pre-Budget report and now with the 2009
Budget.</div><a name="090519113000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must ask ourselves whether the &#163;150,000 tax point at which the
higher rate is charged will remain constant. My reading is that the
Treasury has no plans to increase or index the &#163;150,000 level at
which the new 50p rate will apply, which will mean that hundreds of
thousands more people will be caught as wages rise. Other income taxes,
of course, rise in line with inflation.</div>
<a name="090519113000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Chancellor has estimated that about 300,000 people will face the new
50p rate when it is introduced next year. However, accountants
calculate that over the next decade, about 750,000 people&#151;that
is more than twice as many as in the current situation&#151;will end
up paying the 50p tax rate unless the &#163;150,000 limit is raised.
Anyone currently earning about &#163;100,000 will pay the new 50p
rate by 2020 if they enjoy average wage increases. They will also lose
valuable tax breaks on their
pensions.</div><a name="090519113000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">John

complexity of UK taxes, the measures introduced will increase the
differential between capital gains tax at 18 per cent. and income tax
at 50 per cent., fuelling interest in structuring investments to fall
within the CGT legislation rather than the income tax legislation. The
reasons given for CGT unification in 2007 were, as the argument went,
that the differential between the top rate of income tax, which was
then at 40 per cent., and the 10 per cent. CGT rate was causing all
sorts of people&#151;mainly private equity&#151;to dress up income
as capital gains. The Government argued that they needed to unite the
CGT rate as a way of preventing people from moving what was essentially
income into capital gains. The differential then was 30 per cent. and
under the proposals it will now be 32 per cent., so it remains to be
seen what on earth is the basis for the Government&#146;s 50p rate,

think that I will end there. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;Shame.&#148;] All right, in that case I will talk about trust
dividends and pensions, because there seems to be some level of popular
demand. On trusts, I was interested to read the briefings provided by
the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group and the Disability Benefits
Consortium. This is an area of immense complexity, but I will try to do
justice to the serious concerns of those organisations about the trust
and dividend tax
rates.</div><a name="090519113000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
6 increases the trust rate and the dividend trust rate for
discretionary and accumulation trusts from 40 per cent. to 50 per cent.
and from 32.5 per cent. to 42.5 per cent. respectively. That point was
also raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. The 32.5 per cent. to
42.5 per cent. rates were originally prescribed in the Finance Act 2004
to counter the use of trusts for tax avoidance
purposes.</div><a name="090519113000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Finance Act 2005, provisions were introduced with the intention of
protecting vulnerable beneficiaries of trusts from the effects of those
high rates. The focus of that legislation was mainly disabled persons
and children with a deceased parent. So clause 6 has an important
impact on Britain&#146;s tax code. Those provisions work currently by
allowing the trustees of trusts with a vulnerable beneficiary to deduct
from their tax liabilities at the appropriate trust rate, which we have
just discussed, the difference between it and what the tax would be if
computed at the rate that would be chargeable on the vulnerable
beneficiary as an individual. So it is designed to help vulnerable
individuals, but I have been told that the mechanism for computing
relief is too complicated and, from my brief examination of the
relevant parts of the clause and the schedule, I believe that that is
so. Also, the statutory definition of a disabled person for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>those purposes is too narrow. Consequently, from April 2010
some small trusts for vulnerable individuals will be charged income tax
at 50 per cent. on trust
income.</div><a name="090519113000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot imagine that that will be popular on the Government Benches. We
are talking about vulnerable individuals and disabled people being
charged income tax at 50 per cent. on the income of their trust, which
was set up specifically for them. None of that can be reclaimed on
behalf of the beneficiary. Under the Mental Health Act 1983, a disabled
person is defined as someone who is in receipt of attendance
allowance&#151;the highest or middle care component of disability
living allowance&#151;or someone who has a mental disorder that
prevents them from looking after their affairs. That definition is too
narrow, which means that a trust for people who are disabled, but whose
disability is of the wrong sort will be liable for the 50 per cent.
trust rate. Is the Minister satisfied with that result of his proposed
changes?</div><a name="090519113000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who
loses out? According to the Disability Benefits Consortium, the
beneficiaries who are likely to suffer from that unintended side effect
of clause 6 include the following: first, those with conditions such as
Down&#146;s, bipolar disorder or severe autism; secondly, vulnerable
beneficiaries who do not come within the definition; thirdly, those
without the right combination of benefits; and, fourthly, those who are
entitled to the prescribed benefits, but who do not claim them. That
raises many issues for the Minister to deal with. It seems that the law
of unintended consequences has struck many times
over.</div><a name="090519113000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
may talk more about trusts and pensions when we debate the schedule in
due course, but I want to draw some conclusions purely in relation to
the 50p tax rate. First, like the right hon. Member for North Tyneside,
we think that the 50p tax rate is a crass political move, rather than a
considered and well thought through change to the UK tax code.
Secondly, its significance is big and could be monumental in sending
out signals about doing business in the UK&#151;this is first
increase in the highest rate of income tax since 1974.</div>
<a name="090519113000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, we
doubt whether the Treasury has properly modelled the
impact&#151;indeed, in terms of modelling the impact, there is no
differentiation between 50p and the phasing out of the allowances, as
we heard earlier. Also, the Treasury is using behavioural assumptions
about average taxpayers to suggest the behaviour of 300,000 highest
earners, which is clearly nonsense. Fourthly, there is a complete lack
of clarity on whether the change is permanent, which is what the Leader
of the House said, or temporary, as the Chancellor, the right hon.
Member for Airdrie and Shotts and other old stalwarts of Labour said on
Second Reading. It is vital for us to get clarification on the
matter.</div>
<a name="090519113000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fifthly, the
changes are likely to have a perverse impact on pensions, dividends and
trusts. Disincentivising people to put money away in pensions will
retard the savings culture that we need to encourage and, after
12 years of a truly dreadful UK stock market performance, it
is perverse to make it less attractive to invest in UK equity&#151;I
will talk about that when we debate the schedule. On trusts, the
biggest impact is, shockingly, likely to be on disabled people,
recipients of compensation from accidents and other vulnerable
persons.</div>
<a name="090519113000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
50p tax rate has broken a clear Labour manifesto pledge, which I
believe was made by every single Labour Member who is a member of this

Committee, for example, the right hon. Member for Wokingham
(Mr. Redwood)&#151;say that this is an elaborate trap that
has been placed by the Government to lure the Conservatives into being
typecast as defenders of the rich and privileged. All Government
policies and taxes are a trap in the sense that they provide an
opportunity for differentiation between the governing party and those
parties not in Government. To refuse to engage with Government policy
merely because there is a risk that it will be contrasted unfavourably
with one&#146;s own policy is to abandon all democratic politics and
give the electorate a diminished choice. The Conservative party, as the
largest Opposition party, have some duty to try to articulate choices
with regard to not only how they contribute to debate, but how they
frame votes and manifestos at the general
election.</div><a name="090519113000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
briefly to the proposal before us, I echo the point that it is a
betrayal of Labour&#146;s 2005 general election manifesto
commitment&#151;the quote has been given and I will not repeat it.
The manifesto on which the Labour party stood and won an unprecedented
third general election in 2005 emphatically did not state that they
would leave income tax rates the same unless economic circumstances
make it attractive for them to do otherwise. It was perfectly possible
for the Labour party to have put that caveat in their manifesto and to
have said that it was an aspiration to leave the top rate of tax as it
was at 40 per cent. but that they could not make a firm commitment or
an absolute promise to do so because they were not in a position in
2005 to know how the economy would be in 2009-10. It would have been
entirely honourable for the Labour party to put forward that position
at the general election, but it did not do so.</div>
<a name="090519113000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Hammersmith and Fulham has said, the then leader of the
Labour party, apart from promising to serve as leader for the entire
duration of this Parliament if Labour won, also spoke disparagingly
about the concept of a 50p tax rate for people on higher earnings. He
made that case, which Labour Members at the time cheered with great
gusto and then made to the electorate in their constituencies. Who
knows, quite a few Labour Members here today might not be Members had
they, when speaking to the electorate in their constituencies, squared
with them and said, &#147;We cannot give you a commitment to keep the
top rate at 40p.&#148;</div>
<a name="090519113000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps many
of the exceedingly wealthy donors who have bankrolled the Labour party
over the years might not have been so generous with their
contributions, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>which, after all, funded election addresses and propaganda put through
doors by Labour party candidates, had they known that what the Labour
party meant when it said that it would not raise the top rate of income
tax was that it would not be raised unless the Labour Government were
given an excuse to do so, which is a rather different
commitment.</div><a name="090519113000237"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090519113000460"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Russell Brown</b> (Dumfries and Galloway) (Lab): May I ask the
hon. Gentleman a simple question? How many letters or items of
correspondence has he had from any of his constituents complaining
about the increase from the 40p rate to the 50p rate, because I have
not had
one?</div><a name="090519113000238"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090519113000461"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Jeremy </b><b class="B">Browne:</b> I have had very few. Indeed,
I am not sure that I have had any, but my point is about the ability to
break the promises made in a party manifesto on which a candidate stood
at the general election. The honour or otherwise of holding to
one&#146;s commitments to the electorate cannot be measured by the
number of letters one receives. Had the hon. Gentleman received 50
letters, would he feel a degree of guilt about not abiding by the
Labour party commitment? Had he received 100 letters, would he feel
totally ashamed? Had he received 150, would he resign as a member of
the Committee, and had he received 200, would he resign as a Member of
Parliament? The idea that the number of letters one receives is the
measure by which one can judge whether it is appropriate to break
one&#146;s promises seems to me to be an entirely new concept, and
one I suspect the electorate are less enthusiastic about than
he
is.</div><a name="090519113000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000462"></a>Mr.
Russell Brown:</b> Surely the hon. Gentleman, along with the
rest of the Committee and all Members of the House, recognises that the
current economic climate, which we are dealing with here, is vastly
different from what we went into in
2005&#151;unprecedented.</div><a name="090519113000332"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="090519113000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000463"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> The situation is indeed different from that
in 2005, which is why the Labour party would have been well advised to
say, &#147;Our commitment as a party is not to increase the top rate
of income tax if the current benign economic circumstances continue for
the duration of the forthcoming Parliament&#148;&#151;but that is
not what it said. The Labour party, under the leadership of Tony Blair,
said that it would not increase the top rate of income tax during this
Parliament. The Labour party has broken that promise&#151;unless an
election is called before the policy can be implemented. One could
then, technically, argue that the policy was not reneged
upon.</div><a name="090519113000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000464"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Surely the hon. Gentleman must accept that the
current economic circumstances are unique within probably three or four
generations. No reasonable person could have predicted the outcome back
in 2005. To maintain a commitment in the defiance of the facts surely
does not make
sense.</div><a name="090519113000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000465"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> I have gone over the ground and heard the
excuses. We have come to the conclusion that all Labour party promises
in future ought to be seen with an invisible asterisk next to them:
&#147;This is what we promise you at the election&#148;, but with
an invisible 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>asterisk leading down to some more invisible type at the bottom of the
page, stating, &#147;Unless we can see a change of circumstances
sufficiently great to justify doing the precise opposite of what we
promised when we put ourselves before you and asked for your
vote.&#148; That is what has
happened.</div><a name="090519113000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South Derbyshire may well think that the national
interest is best served by the Labour party reneging on its manifesto
promise. I think the national interest would be served by the Labour
party reneging on a huge number of its promises&#151;I can think of
few of its promises that do serve the national interest. However, if
that is what the hon. Gentleman thinks, that is what he should say,
explicitly. At the moment the Labour party has hidden behind the claim
that it has not broken the promise at all. I would argue that it has,
although it may make the point that it was desirable to do
so.</div><a name="090519113000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090519113000466"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): The hon.
Gentleman may be being a little unfair on this point. I did a radio
interview with the Financial Secretary on LBC on the night of the
Budget, and he confirmed that the measure was a breach of the manifesto
pledge.</div><a name="090519113000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000467"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> In that case I apologise if I have not
given full credit to the Government for admitting their own failings.
It is right for us to recognise that
point.</div><a name="090519113000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first point that we can reasonably dwell upon, which I have done, is
the broken promise from the 2005 election manifesto. The second point,
also touched upon by the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham, was
the chaotic manner in which the Government sought to bring in what they
now call not a higher rate but an additional rate of taxation. There is
a lower rate and a higher rate, and one could be forgiven for thinking
that the higher rate was as high as it got, but then there is an
additional rate on top of that. Some people pay a marginal rate
significantly higher than not just the higher rate, but the additional
rate.</div><a name="090519113000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
has been so strikingly chaotic about the Government&#146;s approach?
They made a promise that the 40p rate would be stuck to for
the lifetime of the Parliament. They came up with a whole new tax
rate&#151;45p&#151;but made sure that the manifesto commitment was
not breached by only putting that 45p rate into effect after the last
possible date for a general election. However, before the 45p had been
put into effect, the Government came up with a new 50p rate, to be put
into effect before the possible end of this Parliament. It is entirely
reasonable, when looking at the Government, to find it hard to conclude
what they are going to do next. That is damaging for confidence and for
anyone planning to set up a business or create wealth in some other way
in this
country.</div><a name="090519113000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other point, examined in detail by the hon. Member for Hammersmith and
Fulham, is that it is dubious whether the measure will raise the
revenue that has been claimed for it. Many people estimate that the
yield will be about one third of what it would be if there was no
behavioural change, so the total revenue that the Government are going
to raise as a consequence of the 50p tax rate pales almost into
insignificance compared with the &#163;175 billion of public
borrowing&#151;almost &#163;0.5 billion every
day&#151;that we are currently suffering.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div><a name="090519113000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
&#163;173 billion of public borrowing next year and &#163;140
billion the year after, assuming the rather heroic growth rates
forecast for the economy as a whole, a forecast which seems not to be
shared by many commentators. The Chancellor is unlikely to be in place
to see whether his predictions come true, but I fear&#151;it is not
in the national interest for this to be the case&#151;that he may be
shown to be rather optimistic. The Government are borrowing more money
this year and next year than the total Budget in the first year that
the Prime Minister was Chancellor&#151;total public spending then was
less than two years&#146; borrowing today. Against that backdrop, the
amount of revenue raised by a 50p tax rate, even if there were no
behavioural change, would be fairly modest. However, if two thirds of
the revenue drains away as a result of behavioural change, the central
argument for the 50p rate, which is that the extra revenue is necessary
and justified because of the scale of the Budget deficit, would seem to
be unjustified.</div>
<a name="090519113000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Hammersmith and Fulham also said, tax avoidance will be
further incentivised by the greater differential between the rate of
capital gains tax and the top rate of income tax. Of course, there was
a big incentive when the top rate of income tax was more than double
the CGT rate, but now that the top rate is 10 per cent. higher, I
assume that large numbers of people will avoid paying it not by
relocating to another country&#151;although that may happen with some
star footballers and others whose labour is demanded internationally,
and who can travel easily from one employer to another&#151;but by
choosing to receive their pay in forms that attract lower rates of
taxation. Morally, that may not be particularly impressive, but people
are given a greater incentive to do it, entirely legally. The
Government are to some extent colluding in that process by further
incentivising those people.</div>
<a name="090519113000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two
final points. The Financial Secretary said in his opening remarks that
it was only right that the people who benefited from economic growth
should pay more now that the economy is shrinking. That is not the
economic case for the extra, 50p rate, which, I maintain, is far from
attractive or compelling, but what Labour MPs regard as the moral
case&#151;I think it was called the &#147;ethical&#148;
case&#151;for the 50p tax rate. The case is that when times are good,
some people make a lot of money and therefore, when times are bad, they
should be asked to contribute more. I have two things to say to that.
First, those who are earning the most money already contribute a much
bigger percentage of the total national income tax take than their
numbers would otherwise indicate. One could argue that they should
contribute more or that they should contribute less, but it is
misleading to suggest that the top 1 or 2 per cent. of earners are not
contributing in a substantial and meaningful way to the public
finances; they most certainly
are.</div><a name="090519113000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
one should not necessarily assume that people who will be earning in
excess of &#163;150,000 from next year onwards benefited during the
period of economic growth. Someone could set up a company, having spent
the last 10 years in low-paid employment, and the company could be so
successful at capturing the mood of the country and attracting lots of
customers that they were able to create lots of jobs and expand. If by
about this time next year they managed to be on a salary that was in
excess of &#163;150,000, they would be hit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>by that 50 per cent. rate, despite never having benefited at a higher
level of income during the time when the economy was growing.</div>
<a name="090519113000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Others may
have been earning huge amounts of money, by my modest standards, for
years and years but have now stopped working. They may have retired.
They may have spent their money on an enormous house, or perhaps a
series of enormous houses and all kinds of other rewards because of
their years of success in the benign economic circumstances and have
now decided to stop working. They will not be taxed on the basis that
they were able to buy a very expensive house because they made so much
money when the economy was growing for the last 10 or 15 years. They
may be taxed in other forms, but not on their income. Those people will
have paid a 40p tax rate when the economy was thriving and they will
not pay the 50p rate because they will not be paying income tax, or not
necessarily at that level when the proposal is introduced. So I do not
accept that the ethical point automatically applies in this case as
Labour Members appear to
suggest.</div><a name="090519113000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
it is reasonable to ask what the rationale is for 50 as opposed to any
other figure. The Chancellor himself admitted&#151;I think it was in
the Treasury Committee&#151;that there was no rationale and that the
figure was plucked out of the air. That is a surprise because a lot of
economic modelling and forecasting seeks to work out the point at which
the revenue to the Exchequer is maximised. One would have thought that
those considerations would have come into play when the Chancellor and
other Treasury Ministers were deciding what was an appropriate rate at
which to set this higher level of taxation.</div>
<a name="090519113000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">My suspicion
is that 50p was picked for the obvious reason that it is half and that
there is a sense, probably in the Government and maybe in other
political quarters too, that a line is crossed at the point where the
Government take more of a person&#146;s income than they are left to
spend for themselves. Therefore the 50p is a sort of self-imposed moral
line in the sand which MPs and other politicians, probably of all
parties but perhaps in the Labour party as much as any, feel is as far
as it is acceptable to go before it becomes unreasonable for the state
to take that much private
income.</div><a name="090519113000256"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000468"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> How does the hon. Gentleman feel, as a Liberal
Democrat, about the fact that the 50p tax rate is the rate on which he
was elected in 2005 and which his party pledged to
introduce?</div>
<a name="090519113000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090519113000469"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> I was extremely pleased to win my seat in
2005, but I do not know whether that was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>one of the reasons for it. I will allow other members of the Committee
to speculate on how that came to pass. I am afraid to say that the
Liberal Democrats did not win the last general election. We are the
only party to have increased our number of seats at all of the last
three elections, but we did not win the last general election and were
therefore not in a position to implement our proposals. To be fair, the
Conservative party had manifesto commitments that it could not
implement and which it has since abandoned during the course of this
Parliament. It is rather different for the governing party because it
is required to honour its manifesto because it won the election on the
basis of that manifesto.</div>
<a name="090519113000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I saw merit
in what Tony Blair said about the Liberal Democrat proposals. He was
critical of the 50p tax rate. He said that it would be unfair in that
it would penalise successful, high-earning people. Tony Blair is a
politician whom I admire in some ways. I thought that he had a point. I
do not want the Liberal Democrats to be a party that punishes people
who are entrepreneurial and successful and wealth creating. Perhaps
Tony Blair and the Labour party have a point. Perhaps it is a problem
if the Liberal Democrats appear to be spiteful towards people who have
earned large amounts of money and contribute to our economy.</div>
<a name="090519113000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can let
you in on private conversations held within my party, Mr.
Atkinson. I was an enthusiast for the Liberal Democrats&#146;
dropping the 50p tax rate policy, because I regarded it as neither
economically nor politically compelling. I am delighted that my party
came to that decision. It was assisted by Tony Blair and others who
made extremely persuasive arguments, which Labour party members thought
were good at the time, although they have now changed their
minds.</div><a name="090519113000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">That,
then, is my position on such matters. It is a watershed moment and I
know that a lot of Labour MPs feel uncomfortable that the project,
which Tony Blair embarked on in 1994, has come to an end in this way.
It will be an interesting period for historians to look back on. They
will be able to put their finger on precisely when new Labour broke its
covenant with the middle England electorate, which it set such store by
wooing in the 1990s, and when it went back to being the Labour party of
the 1970s and early 1980s, which I can just about remember. That will
create all kinds of changes in our political system, but that is a
debate for another
