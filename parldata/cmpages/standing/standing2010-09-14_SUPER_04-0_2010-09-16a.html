warmly welcome you to the Chair, Mr Gale. I have served under your
chairmanship on a number of occasions and you are always a very fair
and helpful Chairman, so I look forward to this afternoon’s
sitting. It may interest the Committee to know that, during the recess,
an A380—one of the new so-called super-jumbos—landed at
Manchester airport, in my constituency, for the first time, and the
pilot of that aircraft could not have had more skill than my right hon.

raises a number of very significant issues, both in relation to the

for legislation. As per your guidance earlier, I shall make some

right hon. Friend described the terms of the Bill as brutal and the
Minister described them as austere, so none of us is in any doubt about
the difficulties that staff will face if the terms of the Bill are in
the end what is delivered. I am the first to acknowledge that
Ministers—both the hon. Gentleman and the Secretary of
State—have been very clear with the House and the Committee that
they hope that this is not the final position and that, in a sense,
this is a blunt instrument, to quote that expression again; it is a
negotiating
device.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
clause 2 gives the Minister an incredible set of accelerator and brake
pedals to use in relation to the legislation. Those measures are of
concern here and perhaps more broadly. Subsection (3) enables the whole
Bill to fall after 12 months, but in subsection (4) we see a variety of
devices to bring forward the date of the end of the Bill, to extend it
beyond the 12-month period and, intriguingly, to reawaken the Bill at
some future point should Ministers judge that necessary. I shall deal
with that in more detail
later.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Whether
this set of powers is an appropriate use of legislation is highly
questionable. The message from the Committee is very clear and, I hope,
increasingly shared on both sides of the Committee that the way to
resolve the problem is not this miserable Bill, but sensible
negotiation with the trade unions. That is entirely the right thing to
do in a society such as ours. In a democracy, that is the way things
should work. Indeed, I think that the general consensus now, from the
evidence session the other day and the various remarks made by
Committee members today, is that all six of the trade unions would now
regard the principles of the February 2010 offer as a positive starting
point for further
negotiations.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
pay tribute to my right hon. Friend, as the Minister did earlier, for
her efforts over a long period of negotiation, leading to the February
2010 offer. Clearly, in the end that was not a complete success, but a
huge amount of groundwork was done, which the Minister and his
officials could build on and capitalise on if they approached
negotiations now in the generous spirit in which I suspect the Minister
personally would like to pursue
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
right thing to do is to enter the negotiations, rather than leaving the
powers in clause 2 as the backstop measure by which to impose the
miserable conditions set out in clause 1. That is what every member of
the Committee has expressed as a wish, as a desire. We have put it in
different ways, but in the end we all want a negotiated settlement.
Relying on the powers in clause 2 gives the wrong message.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important to negotiate rather than rely on such powers. We are
constantly coming up against a difficulty, which we saw both on Second
Reading and today. Negotiations are going on in parallel with the
passage of the Bill. Inevitably, on Tuesday trade union officials were
unable to comment further on particular questions. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 95<a class="bkMark" name="Column95">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Indeed this morning the Minister was unable to comment further on
certain detailed information. We understand that because we know that
the negotiations must, to some extent, remain confidential. None the
less, it is a very unpleasant experience for this Committee and for
Parliament to be providing such wide powers to Ministers, trusting that
somehow a negotiated settlement will emerge. There must be much
stronger emphasis from this Committee that we expect a settlement to
emerge.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In urging the
Minister to push for negotiation rather than the powers in clause 2, I
should like to make the point that, if this turns out to be the final
word, dreadful conditions will be imposed on those who are made
redundant, but what will be the impact on those who remain? I am
talking about the work force who feel that they have not been treated
seriously and not been given proper respect. Yet this is also a work
force who are crucial both to Government and to the delivery of public
services.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For all those
reasons, I urge the Minister to get into the negotiations and not to
rely on the powers in the clause. Many of us feel uncomfortable about
this Bill and the way in which it has been pitched. From everything
that the Minister has said, it is clear that he genuinely wants to find
a solution. I noted on Second Reading that he felt quite affronted when
some Members of the House treated his remarks about wanting to protect
the low-paid rather discourteously. He was affronted, I think, at the
thought that he would not want to protect those who are the
lowest-paid. Nonetheless, as we discussed this morning in respect of
clause 1, there is no specific additional provision for the low-paid.
What we as a Committee should try to do is strengthen the
Minister’s hand by ensuring that sensible negotiations are in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In amendment
4, my right hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and West and I propose a
mechanism that will help to bring greater transparency to the
negotiation process and, I hope, strengthen the Minister’s hand
at crucial points in the discussions that he may need to have with some
of his right hon. and hon. Friends. As we know from our time in
government, such discussions can sometimes be quite lively.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 4
proposes that the Minister brings back to the House a report that sets
out clearly what negotiations have been carried out and how the terms
of those negotiations have progressed. Parliament will then consider
and make some judgment about whether those negotiations were conducted
seriously. If it decides that the negotiations have not worked, it will
consider where the blame lies. If the Minister and his colleagues in
government know that a report has to be produced, that will ensure that
the negotiations are more transparent and that there is a greater
accountability to Parliament. Under the terms of our amendment, there
then has to be an affirmative resolution, which means that there is
another procedure to be gone through, thus giving this Committee or
another Committee of the House the opportunity to consider the quality
of the
negotiations.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
has to be a proper process of consultation. The negotiations did not
get off to a good start; in fact they got off to a miserable start.
Although this Bill has been described as a Bill to break through the
deadlock, there were no prior discussions about its terms with any of
the trade unions. It was merely published, introduced in Parliament and
then the discussions started. It would have been rather better if there
had been some constructive discussion before the Bill was
published.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000040">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Now we are
being told that the negotiations are fully under way and moving
forward, and we certainly hope that they are. I have to say that I was
greatly encouraged by the tone and content of the Minister’s
questions at the evidence session on Tuesday, especially in relation to
the questioning in the latter part of our proceedings about whether all
the trade unions would be content to use February 2010 as a starting
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, there is a mixture of factors. It would be wrong to use the
devices in clause 2 to enforce the miserable conditions in clause 1.
However, I believe that the Minister wants to do his best to protect
the lowest-paid and wants the negotiations to work well. Given the poor
way in which the negotiations started, we are left with the dilemma of
whether we can simply leave the situation as it is. My right hon. and
hon. Friends and I want the Minister to reassure us in relation to the
negotiations. Why does he believe that it is not necessary to be
accountable to Parliament through a further report and the affirmative
resolution
procedure?<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000042">&#160;</a>

have some consistency from the Opposition. When they were in government

they put through a statutory instrument to change the civil service

                           </span> I offer my
understanding of the amendment and some words of advice. The previous
Government stated their negotiating position at the start of the
negotiations and then negotiated for eight months. They thought that
they had reached a deal and I believe that they were close to doing so.
With a little honing of the offer, there may well have been a
settlement that all the unions would have signed up to. The time scale
of the general election intervened—I do not expect a Front-Bench
response to this point—and put pressure on the previous
Government to seal the deal. Given a few more weeks, I think that there
would have been a settlement on a similar basis to that proposed by the
previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">From
what I understand of the current Government’s proposals, they
have an old-fashioned negotiating strategy, whereby they take an
extremely hard line, expect resistance and want to meet somewhere in
the middle. The irony is that somewhere in the middle is the previous
Government’s settlement. With a little flexibility, there can be
a negotiated
settlement.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is important because the Government and Parliament need a
longstop in the negotiations. There may come a time when the Government
want to come to Parliament with a report that states what was said and
what was put down so that the whole of the Commons can understand the
rationale for their final position. That is what the amendment asks
for. That would be good governance and good parliamentary governance
because we would all understand, and therefore be implicated in, the
final decision. That would push us back from the current
brink.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
problem with all such negotiations is that, when one side wins, if all
sides do not understand that they have got the best deal that they
could possibly get, there 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 97<a class="bkMark" name="Column97">&#160;</a>
                           </div>will be collateral damage. A settlement that is begrudged on one side
will not stick for long. For the period that it does stick, it
undermines the morale of the staff concerned. The problem then comes
back in another
form.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
form of industrial relations is the spitting in the soup negotiations.
Although the employers might well win, the staff who serve the
managers’ soup will spit in it beforehand. We do not want to
generate that sort of attitude in the civil service as a result of an
imposed or begrudged settlement. The amendment is perfectly reasonable.
It enables the Government to come back with a report to explain their
final position before implementation. It enables Parliament to take a
view, to have a serious discussion if necessary about whether the
settlement is accepted or imposed and to realise, if imposed, that we
are going over the
brink.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000048">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
the settlement is imposed, there will be consequences for industrial
relations, not just in the civil service, where I think there will be
industrial action, but across the public sector and elsewhere. The
lesson of history is that one spark, from one industrial dispute, can
set off a whole, bitter range of destruction in an industrial relations
climate, which damages the country as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000049">&#160;</a>

trying my best not to fall into the sort of language used by the hon.
Gentleman. It is not constructive in our discussions to argue whether
one union has disrupted negotiations or whatever. The Public and
Commercial Services Union took a position based on the interests of its
members—it could do nothing else. It is now trying to ensure
that there are proper negotiations in a fruitful atmosphere. Are we not
doing the same? Going over the past and isolating one union from the
others is not constructive, and is almost trivial when considering what
we face. I am giving some importance to the negotiation in its own
right—of course—but also to its consequences for the
industrial relations climate of this
country.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000052">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Of course. The hon. Gentleman is completely
right. I am desperately trying to see the issues from all sides at the
moment. I can understand the Government’s position even though I
do not agree with it. I do not agree with their whole economic
scenario—we had that debate in the Chamber, when I set out my
Marxist analysis of the argument, but never mind. I do not agree with
the Government’s position but I understand where they are coming
from.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000054">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
use the expression, “We are where we are”, and where we
are at the moment is understanding what will let us arrive at a
reasonable settlement or solution. That means looking at individual
union perspectives. In the last negotiations, the PCS clearly felt that
it could not carry its members with it on the settlement, because so
many of them were losing out. We had the potential for a little honing
of the agreement in order to reach a solution. That is where we are at
the moment in the
negotiations.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment, therefore, would given openness to the debates, because the
Minister could say, “At the end of these negotiations, I will
report them to Parliament and Parliament will decide.” Doing
that strengthens the Government’s hand, enabling them
to set out the reasonableness of their argument and to expose the other
side, if it has been unreasonable, or vice
versa.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would give us that one, final moment. I do not want to
exaggerate, but it could be a moment in history for the
Government—either to agree or to go over the brink. The
amendment enables the Government to step back from the brink; it
enables the whole House to step back from the brink, if the settlement
is that problematic, or, if necessary, to unite on an agreed solution
that may eventually have to be
imposed.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is democracy. I do not understand why there is any opposition to the
amendment, as I think it gives a way of involving all of us in the
process, which will be good—from my position—for the
country overall, but from the Government’s position, certainly
good for their standing.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000058">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, I
think affirmative processes are quite proper for issues such as this.
It is important to involve the whole House in significant decisions in
the history of this country and the decision-making process of any
Government. That is a basic democratic right for individual Back-Bench

light of the state of the negotiations as

an interest in the matter and we expect a proper and formal report on

want to talk about productivity. It was mentioned this morning that the
most important thing is to prevent job losses, which I think is
absolutely right. However, we have to consider the productivity of the
workers involved. We have already had, in the past 10 days, the
difficulties at Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, which led to
a statement to the House. Only yesterday, the Governor of the Bank of
England suggested that the case for cracking down on tax avoidance is
irresistible. Underpinning what Labour Members have said in the
Committee is the sense that, without a negotiation at this stage, the
morale of the work force will be so depressed that they are unlikely to
respond positively to innovations that the Government will rightly want
to introduce in how they work. We have to think closely about that. The
Government will be sending a message about how they wish to conduct
their industrial relations, which is important for a new
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000068">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There is something to the hon.
Gentleman’s point, but in this case the Government are not
necessarily the same kind of employer as a private sector employer. On
Tuesday, one of our human resources witnesses mentioned the importance
of brand. Alongside other reasons why people decide to work for the
civil service is the notion that the Government will treat them fairly,
perhaps more fairly than if they were in the private sector. From that
point of view, the message the Government send out early in their term
is important for the entire public sector. I know from his comments
that the Minister is concerned about that message, so it is worth our
ruminating on
morale.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000070">&#160;</a>

am grateful to the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East for
making it clear, in moving his amendment, that the way forward is by
sensible negotiation. I am grateful to him for that, given the noise
around this emotive Bill. The amendment would change clause 2, which is
an emotive clause. It provides for the Bill to be time-limited. I
stress and place on the record that the Government have no desire to
see the legislation continue any longer than is absolutely
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000071">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister for the Cabinet Office has stated on the record, and I join
him in stating, that he would be pleased if the Bill never reached the
statute book because it was not required, having been replaced by a
negotiated settlement. I would be happy to join a short list of
Ministers who have failed to take a Bill through Parliament, in this
case because it was superseded by events and was no longer necessary.
The inclusion of a sunset clause prevents the legislation from
continuing ever onwards. Instead, if the Government wished to renew it,
we would be obliged to return to it.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My reading of
the amendment is that its purpose is to delay implementation of the
Bill until the House is satisfied about consultation with the work
force. The idea behind that is to ensure that the Government have
sought and taken into account the views of the work force and their
representatives on any changes to the compensation scheme, but the
potential consequence would be to delay the Bill until a new scheme had
been agreed. That is my understanding. The Government completely
understand the concern about consultation, the need to engage
and—as the old Hackney class warrior put it—the need to
take people with us through the extremely delicate and difficult
process on which we are about to
embark.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Superannuation Act 1972 requires that where a scheme is made under
section 1 of the Act, or that scheme is amended by way of another
scheme, there must be consultation with affected employees or their
representatives. In case the point is not clear, that requirement does
not apply when a scheme is altered by primary legislation, rather than
by amending the scheme. I make that point for the record, but I will
not dwell on it or build on it. The main point was made by the right
hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East, which is that the end game
must be a negotiated settlement. That

                           </strong> With a great deal of respect, the hon. Gentleman has
over-interpreted my position and my interest. I was giving the
gentleman speaking for the PCS an opportunity to place on record the
view of the union towards the February package by asking him
specifically whether it would recommend it. The hon. Gentleman should
not read into that an interpretation of the Government’s
position in relation to the February package, which we discussed
exhaustively this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000077">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To
return to the amendment, I was referring to the urgent priority to
reach a negotiated settlement. As for meeting the concern of hon.
Members about adequate consultation with union members and civil
servants, it will of course be the case that, when we reach an
agreement, which is the expected outcome, there will be a proper
consultation process not only because that is a statutory requirement,
but because it is the right thing to do for reasons that the hon.
Member for Hayes and Harlington
explained.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the meantime, the priority is to reach a negotiated settlement that
will, by definition, contain an element of consultation. I assure the
right hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood that those negotiations
are being conducted very much in line with the principles that she
established in her own negotiations. In that context, as and when we
reach a deal, the Bill is dead and there is no need to consult on the
terms. The main reason why we will oppose the amendment is that it
would effectively undermine the purpose of the Bill in delaying
implementation. As I think I made clear this morning, the purpose of
the Bill is to break a deadlock and make it more possible that a deal
is done quickly. It is about breaking the deadlock and changing the
dynamic of the negotiation. Delaying the Bill’s implementation,
as the amendment proposes, would undermine that rationale and
logic.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000079">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
my hon. Friend the Member for West Worcestershire said, such a delay
could have negative and complicated consequences for staff in the sense
that, until the Bill is implemented, the old terms apply. As was
debated extensively on Second Reading, there is a feeling certainly on
the Government side that the current terms carry a risk of distortions
in respect of decisions because the current terms favour so clearly
certain groups of people and thus contain a risk that decisions will be
taken not

                           </strong> All the amendment does is enable the Government
to secure their Bill, and give them just that bit more flexibility on
the final timing of the end of the negotiations. If the Minister thinks
that the unions or others will get the incorrect message that there is
a lack of urgency, let us place it on the record that everyone agrees
that there is a sense of urgency about concluding the negotiations. Let
us not allow false messages to come out.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000081">&#160;</a>

not—the Government go over the top. That is all the amendment
does. It gives the Government additional

makes, although it is appropriate to say that I cannot recall the
contents of the previous negotiating process being reported to
Parliament. I am happy to be corrected on that. I come back to the
point that I stressed this morning, which is that there is a
fundamental principle that the discussions are confidential on both
sides at this point, and therefore it is not desirable to set out the
Government’s position in a report. Neither side will be keen on
revealing the contents of discussions before a final position is
reached. We are prepared to consider presenting something to Parliament
once the position has been finalised, but not
before.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000083">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
point that I am trying to stress and why we oppose the amendment is
that it would ensure that the current scheme continues until the report
is approved. As I stressed before, we are seeking to achieve a
negotiated settlement. Once discussions with the unions are
complete—we are determined they remain confidential until they
are complete—we will consult
staff.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000084">&#160;</a>

the point made about the role of the House of Commons—every
Member will have a view—I am not sure that it would be
appropriate for the House of Commons to be involved at such a detailed
level in the internal functions of the civil service, as suggested by
the amendment. Parliament has an important role in legislating and
holding the Executive to account. It would not be appropriate or right
for the House to be involved in the minutiae of the management process.
As I said, it was not so involved in the negotiations conducted by the
previous
Administration.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000085">&#160;</a>

Parliament is being asked to take an enormous step—to sanction a
set of conditions for redundancy, which the Minister himself says he
does not wish to impose on the work force. He wants something that will
be better, particularly for the lower-paid. The amendment addresses the
very unusual circumstances. He is asking the Committee to approve a set
of conditions that he himself hopes will not be necessary. The least we
ask is that he comes back at an appropriate point to report on the
negotiations that have taken place. What could possibly be wrong with

clause and the other provisions in clause 2, which I want to come to in
a little more detail when we discuss amendment 5. I assure him that I
heard what he said and I welcome the offer he made, whether or not our
amendment is accepted this afternoon by the Committee. His offer to

know that the Minister must return to Parliament and give a genuine,
open and transparent report on the negotiations, it strengthens his
hand to make sure that those negotiations achieve his aim of a
reasonable, negotiated settlement that protects the lowest-paid staff.
It is a genuine attempt to strengthen his hand. Now that Parliament has
been drawn into this in a way that it did not ask for—this
Government Bill is quite unusual in its terms—it has an
interest. It is important that a formal mechanism is in place for
reporting so that before the potential dreadful conditions could be
imposed, which the Minister himself tells us that he does not want to
impose, Parliament would have a chance to consider the quality of the
negotiations and to see that everything possible had been
done.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000090">&#160;</a>

could not tell us whether he had been offering a new starting point for
negotiation in the exchange that he had in Committee on Tuesday. In a
sense, we do not know whether that is now a new point for negotiation.
We have to trust the Minister to go away and negotiate. The required

going to make in response to the hon. Gentleman’s comments
earlier. He talked about the Government rushing into this earlier in
the year. I remind him—he knows this, but it is worth
restating—that my right hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and
West Norwood and her team entered into extensive, painstaking
negotiations over a period of eight months. They put out a consultation
document, “Fairness for All”, to which 18,000 people
responded. My right hon. Friend could not have been more painstaking,
and five of the six unions accepted the terms that were offered in
February 2010. One did not, and we all know the story there.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Government is
a responsible position, however, and Ministers have responsibilities.
We were approaching a general election and people needed to know where
they stood. We knew, crucially, that had we won that general election
we would have needed to deal with the deficit. The package that my
right hon. Friend put forward in February would have saved £500
million over three years. It was not rushed government, it was
responsible government that she was
conducting.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000100">&#160;</a>

expenditure are going to be meted out on the public
services—those who work in public services also have an interest
in certainty. That is why I think that negotiations—if those

                        <p class="tabbed">I referred
earlier to the various accelerator and brake pedals that the Minister
seeks to give himself through the legislation. Although I have made it
clear that we do not accept the terms of the Bill—it is not the
way we wish to proceed—if we take the terms on which the
Minister is presenting the measure, it is understandable that he wants
negotiations to carry on and to be completed. Therefore, having a
sunset clause, 12 months after the Bill is enacted would make sense in
his terms. It would mean that the Bill, which was no longer needed,
would come to an end. It is also perfectly understandable, in his
terms, that he may want a provision that enables him to bring forward
the date at which the Bill will no longer be required. If negotiations
are successful, he has admitted that the Bill will not be
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Opposition have serious difficulties with the Bill in relation to two
further provisions. Those concerns are applicable not only to this
matter, but in a wider sense to Parliament. The first is the provision
to extend the period beyond the 12-month sunset clause to a further
date, during which time the conditions in clause 1 could be
applied. That implies that the Minister is half expecting that the
negotiations may not be concluded even by the earlier part of 2012,
which is at variance with the messages that we hear from Ministers. I
am keen to hear why the Minister needs the power to extend further the
date of the sunset clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">More
intriguingly, he wants to give himself a power to bring the legislation
back if it is needed some time in the future. I am trying to understand
how that process would work. For the sake of argument, let us say that
despite our best endeavours the Bill is enacted, but before or after
that happens, there is a negotiated agreement with the trade unions for
something better than the provisions in clause 1. However, although
that is agreed by negotiation, at some point in the future the Minister

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 106<a class="bkMark" name="Column106">&#160;</a>
                           </div>may suddenly want to revive the conditions in clause 1. That does not
seem to make sense. Both in relation to the Bill and in general, the
Minister should explain why he needs that power of extension and the
power to revive the conditions—the “sunrise
power”, as it has been called.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The sunset
provisions are not merited by this kind of issue. I have referred to my
time as a Minister in Northern Ireland, and in some of the legislation
for which I was responsible, I made use of sunset clauses, but in
rather different circumstances. For example, in the Justice and
Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007, we had a difficult judgment to
make about whether we still needed provisions for judge-only trials,
which is a highly contentious issue. As Ministers, we judged that we
still needed such powers, but we made a provision in the Bill that they
would end after two years unless there was a further resolution of both
Houses to keep them in place. We thought that there was a controversial
situation that might change, so Parliament would want to keep a close
eye on developments before it decided to reinstate the provisions. When
there is controversy, there may be a reason for a sunset clause and an
opportunity to renew powers, but not when negotiations are going on
outside this place between trade unions and management. That does not
make sense.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I also recall
a situation when a sunset clause was put in place because the parties
in Northern Ireland could not agree when we were trying to set out a
new model for a justice Ministry, following the devolution of policing
and justice. It was hard to find agreement, so the Government held the
ring as an honest broker and introduced a further model, which is now
working. That is sunsetted until 2012, when it will be important for
the parties to reconsider the arrangements and make fresh
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government can set a sunset clause as an honest broker, which means
that the other parties must get on with it and come up with a solution
of their own. I do not understand, however, why sunset clauses of that
type are warranted in this context. Why, in particular, is it necessary
to have a provision to extend beyond the sunset of 12 months? Why on
earth is it necessary to have a provision to bring the powers back into
force long after a negotiated settlement may have been
agreed?<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000113">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Amendment 5, in effect, will remove a
Minister’s ability to postpone the sunset clause or to revive
clause 1 once it has lapsed. The apparent intent of the amendment is to
ensure that the measure has a definite end date to prevent the
Minister’s being able to extend it beyond 12 months.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000114">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In reply, I
return to our starting point: we want and expect to reach an agreement
quickly, which is the purpose of the Bill. It is a catalyst to try to
break the deadlock and make that happen. Clause 2 provides for the
effects of the Bill to be time-limited and we have no desire to see the
legislation continue any longer than is absolutely necessary. The
clause includes the option to bring forward the termination date, which
signals the Government’s position.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The powers
under clause 2 are necessary, particularly if we cannot reach a quick
agreement. We must avoid finding ourselves back in the current
situation. The House and the Committee have reached a common 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 107<a class="bkMark" name="Column107">&#160;</a>
                           </div>view that the current scheme is unaffordable and inappropriate. If,
however, changes were quashed in ways that we cannot predict, and we
were forced to revert to the current scheme, the ability to extend the
sunset clause, which was the focus of the right hon. Gentleman’s
inquiry, increases the incentive to reach an early agreement. That is
the fundamental point and that is what we want to deliver. The
Government’s ability to revive the measure, if necessary, may
mean that the legislation can be repealed sooner than it otherwise
might have been. Without that power, it is possible to argue that the
Government could be minded to allow the Bill’s effects to
continue until there is no risk at all that any future scheme would be
quashed.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000116">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> May I ask the Minister two questions arising from
what he has said? First, does the suggestion that the clause is
necessary in the event of the provisions of the Bill being quashed
suggest uncertainty on his part as to what might happen in the event of
a legal challenge? Secondly, are there any circumstances in which, once
an agreement is reached, the provisions of the Bill might be used on a
second occasion to change for the worse the terms and conditions of
employment for civil
servants?<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000117">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> No, that is certainly not the intention. The Bill
only allows the Minister to improve the terms; there is no capacity to
reduce them. We want to try to maximise flexibility to achieve what I
think we all want, which is a negotiated settlement as quickly as
possible. In that context, I have two specific answers. On the need to
maintain the ability to revive the Bill, Mr Dusty Amroliwala, in his
evidence to the Committee, addressed that well when he talked about
arguably remote but real risks in the future when, for example, a
change to the scheme might actually be approved by union members in a
ballot, but be subsequently challenged in a court, perhaps by an
individual. The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington signalled that as
a possibility. We want to protect ourselves against a return to the
situation we are in now, where by default the current terms are in
place. The ability to extend the Bill or extend the sunset provision
sends a strong signal and an incentive to the negotiators to get the
deal done quickly, because it is not something that can wait for 12
months.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
final point is one I should have made earlier. The ability to revive or
prolong is clearly set out as requiring the approval of the House. That
is important and I should have stated it much earlier. It is
self-evident why that is necessary, because these are unusual
arrangements. However, we assure the Committee and the House that any
changes to revive or prolong would require the approval of the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000119">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is positive that there is provision for the
affirmative procedure, but that is still a power by ministerial order.
The argument that the power to revive the terms of the Bill is on the
basis that the terms of the Bill will be challenged, and that the
challenge will be successful in court, defies logic. That would simply
revert us to the original Bill, so we will go around the same circle
continuously. That is like groundhog day, so I do not think that can be
the argument. It needs to be clarified, perhaps in a note, because I am
not completely sure about the logic of the recommendations from civil
servants on the drafting of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000120">&#160;</a>

really helpful are other examples when the award to a Minister of a
futuristic power has been made in this way, because I cannot think of
any, apart from emergency legislation. I now understand why the
Government are seeking to have the measure classified as a money Bill,
because I cannot see this power going through the House of Lords. We
are all opposed to retrospective legislation, but we are even more
opposed to giving powers to Ministers in perpetuity to bring back a
scheme of this sort, even by affirmative
order.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000121">&#160;</a>

of Erskine May. However, I know a man who understands those things very
well and he is called the Speaker, which is just as well as it is his
decision. We will have to wait for that. He does not have to make the
decision now, but it is his to make and all of us who know him will
know that he will make it on the basis of a great deal of knowledge of
process.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000122">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To clarify a
point on which the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington was confused,
we are concerned about the risk—a remote but real risk—of
a challenge to a revised scheme, not to the Bill. The central argument
is about why the Government require the powers that amendment 5
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000123">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I conclude by
repeating the central argument that the Government’s ability to
extend or revive the Bill is necessary. Without such powers, we could
find ourselves in 12 months’ time in exactly the same position
as we are in now. We desperately need to avoid that, because the
overriding aim and the whole driver of this controversial Bill is to
break the deadlock and act as a catalyst for serious negotiation,
because it is in everyone’s interests that the situation is
resolved as quickly and fairly as

involvement in the negotiations, so I should clarify that I am not
directly involved day to day in the negotiations, which are being
conducted at official level with officials reporting to my right hon.
Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office. My understanding is that
negotiations are being conducted in a serious, progressive and sensible
way and that they are moving along. We want to protect ourselves and
avoid returning to the present situation in 12 months’ time.
That is why the powers are necessary and that is why we propose to
reject the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000126">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister has confirmed that he is not
directly involved in the negotiations, which is perfectly
understandable. I hope, however, that he will take away with him some
of the firm and clear messages that have come out of today’s
proceedings, including that the whole House wants to see a negotiation,
rather than the imposition of the conditions set out in clause
1.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000127">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I remain
concerned about some of the arguments that the Minister has made. I
take him at his word when 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 109<a class="bkMark" name="Column109">&#160;</a>
                           </div>he says that he wants a negotiated settlement and that he wants it
quickly. It makes perfect sense, from his point of view, to include a
sunset clause—12 months is reasonable—and reinforce it
with the power to come back to the House and bring that date forward if
negotiations are successful. However, he proposes to give himself
further powers to extend the point at which the sunset clause will kick
in, with sunrise powers to bring back the Bill’s provisions in
case there is further disagreement later. He ought to be more
straightforward and not have a sunset clause at all; he can always come
back to the House and rescind the legislation in future.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Either the
Minister really means it when he says that the settlement must be short
and quick and negotiated soon, or he needs to be clear that the process
could go on for a very long time, in which case he should be honest and
tell the Committee that he wants the powers for as long as they are
needed. To include a sunset clause that allows him to bring the date
forward, or knock it back and bring the powers back, is to give himself
unprecedented and far-reaching powers that are unwarranted. I am afraid
that he has convinced neither me, nor, I suspect, my hon. Friends. I
urge them to vote in favour of the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10091635000129">&#160;</a>
