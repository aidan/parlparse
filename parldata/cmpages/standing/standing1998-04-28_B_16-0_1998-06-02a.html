<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I welcome the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office to our proceedings for the first time.
<H4><center>Clause 70</center></H4>
<H4><center>Duties and powers of court</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 443, in page 56, line 35, leave out "an aggregate" and insert "a".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 444, 426, 429, 430 and 445.
<P>
Government new clause 25 Early release: two or more sentences.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 433, 440 and 442.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Before I discuss the amendments, may I make a short digression to help the Committee? Before the short recess, we discussed drug treatment and training orders and I have reflected on that debate as I promised to do. I have become convinced that unnecessary court hearings might arise from the drafting of clause 58(2), which specifies that treatment under a drug treatment and testing order would either be residential or non-residential.
<P>
In practice, as was pointed out in the debate, the sequence of events may be less orderly in some cases. An additional hearing might have to be arranged, especially to amend the order to mark the transition from residential treatment to treatment in the community. The drug treatment and testing order can be amended at review hearings, at least one of which will take place in every case, or on application by the supervising probation officer. It would be preferable, however, for the court to be able to make an order expressly at the point of sentence in a way that allows for a combination of residential and non-residential treatment. That would reduce the risk of unnecessary hearings and, hence, unnecessary expense and delay. We shall therefore table an amendment on Report to that effect. I believe that it will address the concerns raised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) and other hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I welcome the Minister's announcement. We are in favour of flexibility. It will enable people to receive the treatment that they need without technical provisions standing in their way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that comment. Opposition Members have made serious points in a number of debates and we have tried to respond to them.
<P>
The amendments are designed to provide greater clarity on how multiple sentences imposed on a prisoner relate to one another. They respond to calls from the courts for a clear statutory framework. They amend section 51(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. It provides that sentences that are consecutive or wholly or partly concurrent are to be treated as a single term for the purposes of part II of that Act, which deals with the early release of prisoners.
<P>
New clause 25 will provide that a sentence imposed by a court after a prisoner has been released but while he is still within the overall term of the original sentence should not be aggregated with that sentence. At present, sentences are aggregated when a prisoner has been released and is then returned to custody. That can produce anomalies. An offender may have to be released almost immediately despite the imposition of a lengthy new sentence. We are removing that anomaly to ensure that the effect of any sentence is clear to the court, the offender, the victim and to the public.
<P>
For sentences that are not to be aggregated, a prisoner cannot be released if he is serving more than one term until he has completed the custodial part of the longest term that he is serving. The same principle applies in respect of consideration for release on parole, the length of licence period following release and the length of the period for which the released prisoner is liable to return to prison under section 40 of the 1991 Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): Could the Minister explain what he has just said in layman's terms?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall make every effort to do so, although when invited by a distinguished lawyer to explain something in layman's terms, I suspect that I am not being offered a gift.
<P>
At present, there is aggregation if a sentence has been imposed after someone has been sentenced for an offence and released; the new sentence has to be aggregated with the original one. That has produced anomalies. In a number of cases, a person has had to be released immediately because of aggregation, even though that was clearly not the intention of the court at the time of sentencing for the second offence.
<P>
The Government are introducing the amendments to address the anomalies that have arisen because of decisions in the courts. We want to ensure that such anomalies do not occur. I hope that my response to the hon. Member for Woking was reasonably "lay". I shall await his comments with interest.
<P>
There are about 300 prisoners a year who are currently recalled for breach of licence, having been released from the custodial part of an earlier sentence, and who then receive a new custodial sentence. The new clause means that their new sentence will no longer be aggregated with the earlier one. In an estimated 80 per cent. of such cases sentenced in future, the offenders will serve a longer period in custody than under the current procedures.
<P>
The new clause also confirms an existing Prison Service practice. That is that a new sentence imposed on a person in the community following release from[Mr. Michael]
the custodial portion of an earlier sentence should not be aggregated with the earlier sentence. The other amendments in the group also relate to the new clause.
<P>
New clause 25 will bring clarity to the system and I commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We are entering rather technical territory, as my hon. Friend the Member for Woking has observed. There is always a danger that we might create anomalies through insufficient attention to technical detail, especially in the sort of legislation that we are discussing. Opposition Members welcome any attempt to address perceived anomalies, but it is important to avoid creating new ones.
<P>
I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a serious anomaly in the Bill through the interaction of clauses 69 and 70, relating to the time spent on remand. As members of the Committee will know, under the existing rules, the time spent on remand by an offender awaiting sentence is reflected in the length of time he spends in custody after sentence.
<P>
The distinguished reader in criminal justice and the editor of "Current Sentencing Practice", David Thomas, with whom members of the Committee are already familiar, has written to me on the subject. He is worried that, under the Government's proposals for detention and training orders, time spent by young offenders on remand will be treated differently from time spent on remand by other offenders. He thinks that that might create anomalies.
<P>
David Thomas wrote that he had
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"spotted another problem which arises from the interaction of the treatment of time spent in custody on remand and the main provision governing the determination of the term of the Order ... Clause 69(5) requires the term of the Order to be chosen from the periods specified in the clause. Clause 70(6) provides that `in determining the term of the Detention and Training Order for an offence, the court shall take account of any period for which the offender has been remanded in custody in connection with the offence, or any other offence'. This clearly means that in determining the term of the Detention and Training Order, the court must deduct from the term of the Order a period equivalent to the period which the offender has spent in custody on remand. Bearing in mind that under Clause 71(2) the normal period of detention will be one half of the term of the Order the court in order to comply with Clause 70(6) must deduct from its initial determination of the term of the Order a period equal to twice the period spent in custody on remand.
<P>
This is a mandatory obligation. The court will have great difficulty in complying with it as a result of Clause 69(5). Suppose the court has decided that the appropriate term of an order in the case of a 17-year-old, having regard to the nature of the offence and any other mitigation that may apply, would be 18 months. The defendant has spent seven weeks in custody on remand and the court must therefore make an appropriate allowance (in principle 14 weeks) for that period. The appropriate sentence will therefore be fourteen and a half months or thereabouts; but this is not a lawful sentence, and the court must therefore reduce the sentence to 12 months, thereby giving the defendant exaggerated credit for the time spent in custody. It is possible to envisage any number of anomalies of this kind."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Professor Thomas goes on to say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it seems wholly unnecessary to introduce a rule for treating remand time in connection with a Detention and Training Order which is different from the rules which apply to all other custodial sentences."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I would like to put a revolutionary thought to my hon. Friend. The complexity of practice on current and consecutive sentences causes enormous confusion to the public. Perhaps we should consider cutting this Gordian knot and allow judges to aggregate sentences, so that they give convicted offenders a sentence of a certain period. Parliament adds new sentencing provisions every year, and the public do not have a clue about what is going on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point. He hit the nail on the head in saying that sometimes the public do not have a clue about what is going on. We think that the public should understand sentencing and that sentences should mean what they say.
<P>
We shall return to that point when we debate the Government's disastrous ideas for releasing prisoners early by imposing a curfew through electronic tagging. That runs against the grain of honesty in sentencing.
<P>
My hon. Friend is right about the technicalities of sentencing. Professor Thomas clearly makes the point that provisions on the sentencing of adult offenders take account of time spent on remand. He asks why the Government are introducing a new system for detention and training orders for young offenders who spend time on remand.
<P>
Why is time on remand treated differently for adult and young offenders? Does not that heap an additional layer of complexity on an already complex area of sentencing? That runs counter to the Government's efforts in clause 69(5), which will compartmentalise young offenders' sentence time, and will create a host of new anomalies. Will the Minister consider our legitimate anxieties? We wish to hear the Government's justification for taking such a complicated approach.

<P>

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister. Many intelligent hon. Members sit on the Government Benches and also on our own. However, there would be no takers if I were to ask Committee members to explain the meaning of new clause 25. If I am wrong about that, I will give way. I see that the Minister is encouraging one of his colleagues to respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I have told the hon. Gentleman in the past that the court-room ploy of making a dramatic pause for an intervention will not necessarily receive a response in Committee. Nothing should be read into an acceptance or otherwise of any of his invitations.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I do not mean my point critically; to be blunt, I have no idea what is meant by the new clause.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) was right to allude to the fact that we are in danger of building, brick by brick, a kind of pyramid of the wording that must be used by those who pass sentence and of the problems connected with release on licence, time served on remand and consecutive and concurrent sentences. A danger is developing that the increase of such considerations will make matters, in the long run, less intelligible. There is a real argument I do not blame the Government for taking a cool, hard look at those matters and asking whether it is all becoming too much for the sentencers.
<P>
Clause 70 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it shall be the duty of the court ... to state in open court that it is of the opinion mentioned in paragraph (a) or, as the case may be, paragraphs (a) and (b)".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is another example of what has happened several times in the past the setting of a requirement for sentencers to provide lengthy explanations in open court to the person who is to be sentenced. That has not been a success. I query the necessity for the explanation required in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> This is an important point, and I want the advice of my hon. Friend, who alone of those in this Room, I think has sentenced people in this way and grappled with the problem that he has described. In the most recent case in which I was involved, there were two defendants and three counts. One defendant was found guilty on counts one, two and three, and the other was found guilty on counts one and two, but not count three. The judge had to go through the rigmarole that my hon. Friend explained, about sentences being served concurrently and so on. Would not it have been easier perhaps I am making a daft point but, as my hon. Friend sentences frequently, I want his advice for the judge to tell defendant A, "You have been found guilty of these offences and will go to prison for so long", and to tell defendant B "You will go to prison for so long"? Why must the procedure be made so complex?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My hon. Friend has hit upon a point that is of concern day after day in the courts. I press this matter in a neutral way; it is of concern to judges, magistrates and prisoners. Frequently, a prisoner who has heard sentence passed on him turns round in court and says, "What the hell does that mean?" or sends word up from the cells that he does not understand what has happened.
<P>
We have now moved on from the requirement introduced some years ago for an explanation that a given offence is so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified. Now, whenever a prison sentence is passed, the sentencer must go through an absurdly long rigmarole about the proportion of the sentence that will be served, the proportion for which the defendant will be on licence, and what will follow if something happens during the licence period.
<P>
Another recent example of unnecessary wording being introduced concerns the new moves on deciding plea before venue. Defendants in magistrates courts are now entitled to enter their plea before venue is decided. Mr. O'Hara, if you were there to listen to the wording that must now be spoken by the clerk of the court to the defendant in relation to plea before venue, you would scratch your head in disbelief. I do not know where the wording has come from. Was it issued by the Lord Chancellor's Department, or the Home Office? It is eventually presented through the Judicial Studies Board, but those who sentence, and the clerks of the courts are finding it impossible to interpret. Worst of all, defendants do not understand it.
<P>
A famous stipendiary magistrate in London said at a conference some months ago that, in sentencing nowadays, he uses the words: "Stand up, Smith. People who punch policemen go to prison, and you are going for six months. Good morning." He said that he would do that until the Court of Appeal told him that he was doing something wrong.
<P>
We are in danger of overcomplication, especially for the defendant. It is increasingly obvious that defendants fail to understand what is said to them. The provision further complicates matters for the clerks of the court, who have to read to defendants forms of words that are confusing at best for sentencers, who find it difficult to get the wording right, and for the public.
<P>
When my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough intervened in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, and asked whether it was time to start again, he made a good point. The inability of members of the Committee to understand new clause 25 nails the point home. We must be careful. Next year, another Criminal Justice Bill may be introduced, and heap yet more complexities on complexities. Ultimately, criminal justice will become such a minefield that it will be impossible for anyone, save parliamentary draftsmen, to find a way through it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to those who contributed to the debate, but they strayed wide of the amendments. I see that the hon. Member for Woking agrees with me I am glad that we agree on something.
<P>
I sympathise with several points that hon. Members made. The language that has to be used in court to explain decisions that have been made through a complex series of calculations causes problems. It is common for youngsters who appear in court not to understand what has happened to them. It is important to ensure that defendants, especially young people, do understand that. Adults who have been involved with the courts for some time, but may not have legal training, often know more about the calculations and esoteric details than lawyers, let alone those who have to deal with such matters officially or advise the court.
<P>
Complexities exist and whenever possible, matters should be kept simple so that everyone understands what is happening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister makes an interesting point. I presume that a Criminal Justice Bill will be introduced next year. Will the Minister, has officials and the Home Secretary undertake to examine the matters that we have been discussing and perhaps institute a wide-ranging review to ascertain whether we can achieve greater simplicity so that the stipendiary my hon. Friend the Member for Woking mentioned can pass simple sentences that defendants understand?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman, in the luxury of opposition, can make assumptions about the Government's legislative programme for next year. I do not intend to make any announcements in Committee. I can guarantee that next year, like this year, the Government will push forward their agenda to tackle crime and disorder and to improve the quality of decisions made by the criminal justice system, but that is far as my promises go. I take seriously the point made by the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members about examining ways of simplifying matters, especially the explanations of outcomes. Despite comments based on their experience in the courts, I am sure that Opposition Members will accept that sentences must deal with a[Mr. Michael]
wide variety of orders imposed for a variety of purposes in many differing circumstances. The proposals will provide clarity in sentencing for defendants as well as for the courts.
<P>
On the wider issue that the debate raises, the points raised by the hon. Members for Hertsmere and for Woking will arise in debates on later amendments. The hon. Member for Hertsmere was right to say that we should avoid creating further anomalies while dealing with a specific anomaly. I shall look at what he said. I agree with him that where possible we ought to avoid a complicated approach. However, sometimes complicated calculations are required in the interests of fairness. Hon. Members who have heard prisoners comment on the nature and length of their incarceration know, first, that there appear to be few innocent people in prisons and, secondly, that detailed specificity about individual days and the effect of bank holidays occupies prisoners' minds. It is therefore important to aim, where possible, to be precise in setting out regulations. This may, of necessity, entail complicated calculations. When that happens, we must try to summarise conclusions in a way that allows calculations of any conclusion to be made sense of when examined, and a headline to make sense to all involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's courteous comments. I do not wish to put him on the spot on a technical matter. Given his remarks about avoiding anomalies, if I send him a copy of the letter from David Thomas, will he undertake to respond in writing, and answer the broad point about why the Government are attempting to tackle the question of time spent on remand by young offenders differently from that relating to adults?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Yes, certainly, because the more we bring the arguments into the open, the better. I accept what the hon. Gentleman said, implicit in which was an admission that these are complex matters to deal with on the hoof.
<P>
The hon. Member for Working spoke about prisoners not understanding what has happened to them in court. If the hon. Gentleman, who sits as a judge, does not know where the clerk's words come from, I am sure that I do not. I will think about what he said, to see whether some aspects require a response.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough made what seemed like a simple, straightforward suggestion. Sometimes what appears blindingly simple is just what it seems good common sense while at other times unexpected complexities arise, with results different from those intended. I am not sure whether the whole system could be simplified in the way he suggests, but I agree that it is intriguing and it is worth looking at ways of thinking laterally about how decisions are communicated in court.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The major part of the debate has gone quite wide of the specific issues as the individual complexity leads us straight into looking at the wider picture. Hon. Members made quite legitimate points. The amendments address an anomaly and confirm an approach that is adopted by the Prison Service in a way that introduces clarity into this small part of the overall picture. We are dealing with a comparatively small number of cases, but it is important to get them right and to give the certainty that the courts have requested. That is the purpose of these amendments and I hope that they will be accepted in that spirit.
<P>
Finally, the hon. Member for Hertsmere made a point concerning the difference in treatment of adult and young offenders. I will certainly look at the letter to which he referred. We must be clear about this. We are deliberately seeking to treat young offenders differently from adults. Our proposal is that the exact time spent on remand shall not necessarily be deducted, but that that time shall be taken into account by the courts when sentencing. The point of the sentence is that the period in custody and the period after release should be used constructively.
<P>
The regime in a secure training centre is meant to be constructive and intensive and that is why we are seeking to improve the regime for young offenders in young offender institutions and why we take so seriously the way young offenders are dealt with both while they are held securely and after release. The purpose of the youth justice system is to cut crime. It is to reduce reoffending and to facilitate the rehabilitation of the young offender.
<P>
I accept that there is a difference in the treatment of young and adult offenders. I regard that not as an anomaly but as a sensible aspect of policy because there are differences between young and adult offenders and they should be dealt with in a variety of ways appropriate to their age. I hope that I have persuaded the Committee that the amendments should be accepted and that they are a constructive contribution for what I accept is a complex area, which needs greater clarity.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I put the question I should point out that because of the danger and difficulty that the hon. Member for Hertsmere described of getting trapped in the detail of amendments such as these, hon. Members tended to address the principles. Therefore, I hope that when we come to clause stand part there will be less need for extended debate.

"(1B) An offender over the age of 15 at the time of conviction shall serve the period of detention and training under a detention and training order in secure accommodation as defined under subsection 7(b), (c), (d) or (e) below.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now move from the technical subject of calculating aggregate sentences and taking time spent on remand into account to the more straightforward question of where young offenders will spend their sentences the form of their detention.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 234 and 235 would deal with the age range of children and young persons held in detention. It may assist the Committee if I referred back briefly to clause 69, which introduced a new custodial order for children and young persons the detention and training order. At first, it will cover the age range from 12 to 17 years, but it could be extended in future to include 10 and 11-year-olds an important matter because they will then fall within the framework that we are creating.
<P>
The present arrangements for 12 to 17-year-olds are an important part of the background to the amendments. Currently, 12, 13 and 14-year-olds could be made subject to secure training orders for up to two years, while 15, 16 and 17-year-olds are sent to detention in a young offender institution. The new order will replace those arrangements with a single new sentence of detention and training.
<P>
We regard the form of sentence and the regime in which it is served as important matters. We are talking about young people who have gone off the rails while they are still growing up and we must do all that we can to put them back on the rails. It is a serious step for young people to be sent into custody at an age at which they might otherwise have remained living at home with their family or still have been attending school. It may be in the public interest for such young people to be held in secure accommodation. However, there is also a public interest in doing our best to rehabilitate them. In that light, we were surprised that the Home Secretary made no mention of the new sentence when he introduced the Bill on Second Reading. I shall not make too much of that point, but we noticed it.
<P>
We have substantive concerns about the Government's intentions. The new sentence was formally announced in the White Paper, "No More Excuses", last November. As I mentioned earlier, the key issue is where exactly young offenders sentenced to detention and training will be detained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister may want me to read out the specific passage of the White Paper, but I will give way to him now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I just wanted to clarify the background. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that we have said for a long time that there were complexities and difficulties regarding the orders and the secure estate. We spent much time listening to what practitioners in the field had to say before we set out our proposals in the White Paper. We wanted to introduce some coherence to an inchoate mess. The proposals did not emerge out of the blue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That may be the case, but it is strange that before the unveiling of "No More Excuses" in November last year, the Government announced in July in a written answer that they were going to introduce the secure training order as a sentence for 12 to 15-year-olds. That was effectively abolished by the White Paper, which proposed that that sentence would be subsumed within the new sentence of detention and training.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman needs to understand the sequence of events. He is referring to the introduction of the orders that were allowed for in the 1994 Act and he must be aware of the complexities of the contractual and legislative arrangements and of the fact that a general review of the inchoate state of orders for young offenders and the secure estate was necessary. The history makes sense if the hon. Gentleman understands the problems that the Government are tackling.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am speaking from memory, but I think that I got the history right. I said that the Government announced in a written answer in July that they intended to introduce secure training orders, but that those orders were subsumed in the new sentence outlined in the "No More Excuses" White Paper. Let the history of the Government's approach speak for itself. It is strange.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I would rather that we described the history, because we would do so accurately. We said that we were not happy with the way in which the previous Government had intoduced secure training orders, but that implementation was the best way forward given the contractual and other arrangements that we had inherited and given the need to deal with young offenders in the relevant age groups. However, when implementing the orders, we made it clear that we would consult widely on the state of the secure estate and on the disposals available for young offenders. We kept that promise in the White Paper. The hon. Gentleman attempts to weave a tapestry of inconsistency that does not reflect what happened last year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> If I had wanted to do that, I could have delved further back and reminded the Government of their criticisms of secure training orders in the 1994 debates. I do not think that that would assist us very much, but I could point to an inconsistent pattern should I wish to do so. Let the facts speak for themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are delving too far back into history. Let us return to the present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was going to do that by referring to our substantive concerns. The "No More Excuses" White Paper outlined where young offenders sentenced to detention and training orders would be detained. Paragraph 6.18 on page 22 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The order will be served in any accommodation deemed to be suitable by the Home Secretary. This could mean a Young Offender Institution, a secure training centre, Youth Treatment Centre or local authority secure unit. How this works in practice will need to take account of the outcome of the review of the secure estate (see paragraph 6.3). The Youth Justice Board will set and monitor standards to ensure high quality and consistent regimes."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Elsewhere in "No More Excuses" we are told that the review of the secure estate will be completed shortly. The Minister has told us how the Government would consult everyone, but the White Paper was published in November last year. More than six months later, we are still waiting for publication of the review. When do the Government propose to unveil it? In the meantime, the Committee has to debate the subject without knowing what the contents of the review will be. I shall not go over old history again, but I know that the Minister has strong views. In debates on previous Bills, he argued that Committees should be aware of all the details before they are invited to debate a subject. We shall have to do the best we can in this debate on these appropriate amendments.
<P>
The important point emerging out of paragraph 6.18 of "No More Excuses" is that no one can say for sure which age ranges within the wide bracket of 12 or perhaps even 10 to 17-year-olds will serve their sentences in which institutions. We imagine and hope that the Government will in principle wish to see offenders in different age ranges held in separate institutions, but we do not draw too much comfort from what was said in another place. We believe that 12 to 15-year-olds should be held separately from 15 to 17-year-olds, and that that should be a firm statutory provision. It cannot be right to have a 12-year-old perhaps even a 10-year-old sharing accommodation with a 16 or 17-year-old.
<P>
It is common sense to argue that 12, 13 and 14-year-olds are still adolescents. As they have been taken into custody, they will presumably have been involved in serious offending and they need a fresh start. The last thing that they need is to be near people from an older age group who will set them a bad example. People aged 15, 16 and 17 are also still young, but they belong in a different age category. That group might contain relatively experienced offenders who, unlike most of the 12 to 15-year-olds, could have been in custody before.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As the law stands, 12, 13 and 14-year-olds must be held separately from 15, 16 and 17-year-olds. That would have been the case if the Government had stuck to their original proposals of July 1997. There would have been no question of the ages being mixed, and the different groups would have to serve their sentences in separate accommodation. A secure training order for 12, 13 and 14-year-olds is separate from detention in a young offender institution.
<P>
The Government might intend to manage the secure estate for children and young persons to ensure that there is a separation of ages. However, Opposition Members will not be satisfied unless there is an explicit statutory provision to prevent the mixing of ages. We are aware of the pressures that sometimes arise in the management of the secure estate, even with the best intentions. Such pressures can lead to younger and older offenders being mixed up together. The Bill should include a provision to ensure that the age groups are not mixed together as that would be a backward step.
<P>
I should like to give an example of the type of pressures to which I have referred. Members of the Committee will know that young men aged 15 or 16 are sometimes held in prison accommodation while they are on remand. They are supposed to be held in separate accommodation and, in general, that is the case. However, they are sometimes mixed with 17-year-old offenders, or with offenders who are even older.
<P>
On 30 March, the Government admitted in a written answer that two young men in the age range that I have described were held in adult prison accommodation and not separated from adult prisoners. I raised that matter in a written question on 8 April. I received a reply on 21 May from the Minister with responsbility for prisons, the hon. Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Ms Quin). She told me that she would write to me and I look forward to receiving her letter.
<P>
The example that I have given shows the difficulties that can arise from the pressures of prison management. I repeat that Opposition Members will not be satisfied unless the Bill includes an explicit provision to prevent the mixing of ages.

<P>

<B>Sir Robert Smith </B>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine): I support the principle behind the amendment. Legislation should make the Government's duties clear. We cannot rely on good will and good wishes, because when budgets are tight there will be a temptation to let things slip through the net.
<P>
The arguments for the separation of different age groups are clear. Will the Minister tell the Committee what is envisaged under subsection (7)(e)? What sort of accommodation might the Secretary of State direct should be provided? That might reassure hon. Members that the provision is not a back-door way of preventing the goals of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The debate provides a useful opportunity to try to find out what will happen under subsection (7). The subsection states that young people will be sent to "secure accommodation". That is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a secure training centre; a young offender institution; accommodation provided by a local authoroty for the purpose of restricting the liberty of children"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"accommodation provided for that purpose under subsection (5) of section 82 of the 1989 Act."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is all very interesting, but the debate is meaningless unless we know the state of the Government estate of secure accommodation. I hope that the Minister will enlighten us about that.
<P>
I had certain hopes when I read the notes on clauses. However, they do not say a great deal they never have done; perhaps when the Conservatives were in power they said even less, but I do not know about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I confirm that when the hon. Gentleman's party was in government they said even less, and sometimes were even more obscure than the clauses that they were supposed to explain. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing attention to the fact that in preparing the Bill, with the officials in my department, I at least tried to produce clear notes on clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I was hoping for a great deal from the Government. I thought that we would have a new, enlightened period of open government. I do not know if anyone has read the relevant notes; they simply repeat the contents of the Bill. They do not explain the thinking behind it. All hon. Members are laymen with respect to some aspects of the Bill and it would be helpful to be provided with more detail. I give credit to the Minister for wanting to explain what is happening. The serious argument that I am advancing is that there is no point in passing the relevant measure unless we know whether places exist for the young people concerned to be sent to. How many are there? Where are they? Well, we need not go into geographical detail.
<P>
The problem with the criminal justice system for young people in recent years has not been insufficient powers for judges in dealing with young people, but lack of places to send them to. I know from experience that the places available for offenders in Lincolnshire can be counted on the fingers of one heand. Let us therefore not get too excited about "No More Excuses" and the smack of firm government in dealing with young people. If there are not places to which judges can send them, we are wasting our time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I commend to the hon. Gentleman our critique of the secure training centres during the debate on what became the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. If he reads that, he will discover that we were critical of the then Government's intentions for creating several remote resources instead of providing locally-based secure places. I am grateful that in opposion the hon. Gentleman has been won over to our arguments of that time. However, we have to deal with the estate as it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am prepared to be broadminded. I will not defend everything that the previous Government did; I did not do that while they were in government, so I do not see why I should now.
<P>
Fair enough. Let us base secure places locally. However, they are extremely expensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Ask how many there will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Exactly; my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere would like to know how many are to come on stream. We know that there is always enormous local opposition to any proposals for such places   quite understandably. Although we all criticise such NIMBY opposition from afar, when something such as secure places is proposed in our area, we usually join the NIMBY brigade. Local opposition is relevant, and so are resources. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere provided me with a copy of his written question of 11 March 1998. He asked
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Dr. Jones) of 2 March 1998, Official Report, column 466, on secure accommodation for juveniles, how many of the 460 places in local authority secure accommodation which he expects to be available by the end of 1998 were initially planned for after 1 May 1997."
<P>
The Minister replied:
<P>
"The 460 total includes six places which have been planned for since 1 May 1997." [Official Report, 11 March 1998; Vol. 307, c. 203.]
<P>
So we have been engaged in all the debate about "No More Excuses"; we have heard how the Government mean to lock people up, and heard what they have to say about useless conservatism. Now is seems there are to be six more places. Perhaps the Minister can comment.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman is obviously a very good advocate and if I am ever guilty of something I shall ask him to defend me, He is clearly capable of making bricks without straw. The fact is that while maintaining the previous Government's spending limits we have added six extra places by providing the money for those places which the previous Government were not going to do. We have expanded the provision within their budget totals. They had some seven years to provide the places that were identified as being needed in 1991 but did not do so. The hon. Gentleman is leading with his chin.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am sorry that the Whip is not here because he could pass a very good report back about my managing to make bricks out of straw defending the Government's case. He might well be promoted in the forthcoming Government reshuffle which we all await on tender-hooks. It is not good enough to say that the present Government have inherited our spending plans. They are the Government and can do what they like. I thought that when people voted for change last year, they wanted a change; yet the Minister says that because he has inherited the Tory spending plans, he can provide only six more places for what is supposed to be the key part of the Government's case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman must be accurate. They are six places in addition to those allowed for by the previous Government.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Once again we are straying beyond the strict terms of the amendment into a clause stand part debate. I remind the Committee of that and of my previous judgements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I apologise, Mr. O'Hara, but there is a temptation to get these debates in early so that we can press the Minister to answer us. If one waits until clause stand part, he might shuffle sideways. Just at the crucial moment he looks down at his papers and talks to the silent hon. Members behind him, although we must be fair to them as they are parliamentary private secretaries. That is why we try to tie the Minister down.
<P>
We know now that the Government's great new initiative will provide six new places across the nation. How pathetic can they get? Finally, the truth will out. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere will go on questioning the Government to see how many more places there will be. One thing will become clear from the debate: whatever is included in the Bill, it will make practically no difference on the ground.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman will recall what I said about clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. The Committee will be interested to hear that the Minister has appeared at least once before the Select Committee on Home Affairs. He is thought by some, myself included, to be enlightened. He is also thought to have a strong view about divrsion as an important aspect of policy when it comes to young people. The whole Committee would agree that diverting youngsters from crime is a critical job for any Government.
<P>
When I first read the clause I was astonished. It says that youngsters as young as 10 may be subject to a detention and training order. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere was right to say that 10 to14-year-olds should be kept in entirely different accommodation from older offenders. I should like to ask the Minister a few specific questions and I hope that when he comes to reply he will do so at great length to help the Committee understand the sorts of facilities that are available for the detention of young people.
<P>
What is meant by a secure training centre? Where are they? How many are there? What sort of youngsters do they currently accept? What does it cost to put someone through a secure training centre? Can the Minister answer the same questions about young offender institutions and explain how they differ from secure training centres? What sort of regimes exist in secure training centres and young offender institutions? Do they provide adequately for young girls as well as young boys?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am intrigued by the phrase, "detention and training". Can the Minister explain exactly the sort of training that is envisaged for young people? We are considering people who are much younger than those whom I usually sentence to custody. I deal with those who are 15 and older when sentencing to young offender institutions, but we are discussing 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14-year-olds. Will they go to secure training centres or young offender institutions? If so, will they be subject to the same regime as those who are older? They should be treated entirely differently. They should not be mixed with people of much more mature years. I do not like the idea of 10, 11 or 12-year-olds being thrown together with 15 or 16-year-olds.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Does my hon. Friend realise that that has to happen because there are not enough places?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My hon. Friend is right, as he was when he urged my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere to call the Government to account monthly at Question Time, and ask how many extra places they are providing. But it does not make sense to mix 11, 12 and 13-year-olds with 15 and 16-year-olds it simply turns the younger children into hardened criminals.
<P>
I appreciate that the courts cannot issue a detention and training order unless they believe that the defendant is a persistent offender. Is there a definition of "persistent offender" in the Bill or will it be drawn from elsewhere? Is a persistent offender one who offends for the second or third time? Does the offender have to commit the same crimes or a variety of crimes to be deemed a persistent offender? The courts will have to rely on a definition of "persistent offender".
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> We covered that point in earlier debates. The hon. Gentleman may have been unable to be present because of his judicial duties or other complications, but we discussed the point in detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I had a feeling that we had touched on the point. I acknowledge that there is a restriction on placing a detention and training order on someone who is aged between 12 and 15. I hope that not more than three or four orders a year will be placed on 10 to 15-year-olds. Custody for those under 15 should be a last resort. The Minister knows my views on that.
<P>
I should be grateful for a careful and lengthy explanation of the differences between the various venues, their regimes, cost and number 
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> And what extra resources will be provided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Indeed. Given that there have been so many cuts in the police service and the probation service, the Government must be able to channel the money into tackling youth crime.
<P>
What is the difference between detention in a young offenders institution and a detention and training order?
<P>
Another intriguing aspect of the clause is its provisions for release. I should like to draw the Committee's attention to clause 71(2), under which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the period of detention and training under a detention and training order shall be one-half of the term of the order."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Following subsection (3) on compassionate grounds for release, which I understand and accept, the Secretary of State's powers to release are set out in subsection (4).
<P>
An arbitrary figure is specified. The Secretary of State is allowed to release an offender
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in the case of an order for a term of 8 months or more but less than 18 months, one month before the half-way point of the term."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that not likely to lead to anomalies? An eight month sentence will allow three months for release fair enough, so far. A 16-month term will allow seven months for release. Oddly enough, if I were in court, I would opt for an 18-month term, the longer sentence.
<P>
The message seems to be, "Go to a centre for 17 months and serve seven and a half months: go to the centre for 18 months and be a good boy, and you will be out sooner nine months minus two equals seven months". That is a strange quirk. It is worth pointing out that it is preferable to receive the longer sentence because the longer sentence of 18 months is the shorter in practice.
<P>
I am drawing my remarks to a conclusion and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response. Several members of the Committee may not be as aware as they should be of the full range of custodial options for young people. Moreover, it is important that when we invent new titles such as a detention and training order we ensure that the status quo regarding the fabric of buildings and what happens within them does not remain exactly the same. Never let us pretend that simply inventing a new title it could have been a detention, training and education order or even a betterment order as far as I am concerned is of itself a good thing. On the ground, not much changes month to month. I hope that the Minister will respond to that point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Minister to respond, I advise the Committee that it will be convenient to include our clause stand part debate with this group of amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to respond to an outbreak of massive cheek on the part of Opposition Members, though I add that they have made their points with courtesy and good humour and that I shall endeavour to respond in like manner. However, it remains an outstanding piece of cheek for Opposition Members, who were in office for some 18 years and failed to deal with the problems of youth crime, and who created the shambles of secure accommodation, sentencing requirements and current regimes, suddenly to suggest that the Government are failing.
<P>
In little more than 12 months, we have been accurate in our targeting of youth justice and have attempted to tackle the whole range of offending. We have provided swift action to nip things in the bud; provided various regimes to allow young offenders to be dealt with in the community; and also addressed the mess of pottage the orders and secure estate that we inherited from the previous Government. Now in opposition, Conservative Members are denying their own record. They must face that record and they must confront the wickedness of the previous Administration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I was not here then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Member for Woking says that he was not in the House of Commons for all of that period, so I suppose he gets remission for good behaviour. The Conservatives must examine their record and recognise how appalling it is. They must learn from it if they are to make a contribution that is more constructive than that which they have made this morning.
<P>
I recognise that the hon. Member for Hertsmere has been dealt a duff hand by his predecessor. I admire the courage that he has shown in attempting to defend his party's position, but I warn him that he is engaged in a hopeless task.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking expressed his distaste for custody, especially in relation to young people. It is a fact of life that some young people like some adults need to be locked up for a period. Custody may be a decision dictated by despair when one cannot think of anything else to do. However, it should be a constructive response to the need to protect the public and to tackle a young person's offending behaviour. Action should be undertaken that will enable the youngster to return to the community and to lead a useful life.
<P>
In the past, the negative view of custody was often pursued. The change that we are introducing is based on a constructive interpretation that emphasises making use of time spent in custody. That is a crucial element of the order. It allows for the period in custody to be matched by the period out of custody so that the period in secure accommodation will lead to preparation and continuity on release.
<P>
That will be done in a structured way. We will establish a youth justice board for England and Wales to ensure that the process is not merely a matter of convenience for the Prison Service, as the hon. Member for Gainsborough suggested. Proper supervision will ensure that the periods served in and out of custody are coherent and effective.
<P>
Regimes are important. Juveniles subject to detention and training orders will receive a sentence plan which will be tailored to address their offending behaviour. Their progress will be monitored against that plan. The new orders and other measures in the Bill are aimed at the effective prevention of further offending, which damages young people and potential victims, along with the wider community.
<P>
Some of the questions raised by Opposition Members were slightly ingenuous. The hon. Member for Gainsborough seemed to ask us to legislate to fit existing places rather than to examine what is needed. He displayed endearing innocence in saying that we can do what we like because we are the Government. I take it that that was his experience up until May 1997, although he went on to contradict that impression.
<P>
I shall respond to the hon. Member for Woking by saying that I take a strong view of the way that we deal with these matters. As the hon. Gentleman says, sentencing is a critical job for the Government. Regrettably, the previous Government did not regard it as such. They failed to nip offending behaviour in the bud and to deal with the growing seriousness and frequency of juvenile offences. They failed to deal with the unfortunate fact that an increasing number of young offenders continued to offend into their 20s rather than grow out of a pattern of offending behaviour. That had serious consequences for the wider community.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking asked what is meant by a secure training centre. He followed that with a series of questions, offered with his characteristic speed of an express train. The technical answer is that a secure training centre is a place provided under the Prison Act 1952 for persons sentenced to a detention and training order or, on a transitional basis, to a secure training order. The 1952 Act was amended by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which established in legislation the previous Government's intentions for secure training orders.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am surprised that I need to point out that only one secure training centre has been opened to date the centre at Medway. It is close to Cookham Wood prison, but was named Medway to give it a separate identity. I have visited the centre and spoken to its staff. The regime there is designed to provide training, counselling, support and a challenge to offending behaviour; offenders are not just held there.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking is right to say that the word "education" could have been accurately added to the title of the orders. Dealing with young people's educational needs is crucial. If the hon. Gentleman[Mr. Michael]
visits the centre at Medway, I am sure that he will be impressed by the way in which the difficult task of education is approached.
<P>
Young offender institutions are part of the Prison Service and we are concerned about their regimes. That is why the Minister of State, Home Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West, who is responsible for prisons, takes a great deal of interest in improving regimes for young offenders. That is a major priority in her work.
<P>
The title detention and training order suggests the need for loss of liberty a person is detained often for his own good as well as that of the public for the period of detention to be used constructively. The order is not used merely for containment.
<P>
Some under 15-year-olds need to be held securely for their own good as well as that of others. In my experience, which was mainly in juvenile rather than adult courts, I saw many cases in which early action to take a grip to stabilise a youngster's position would have enabled him to grow up healthily in the community. Rather than doing him any favours, failure to take such early action prevents the creation of the secure framework that helps youngsters to grow into mature adults. I ask the hon. Member for Woking to consider not merely the detention and punitive element, but the need to create a constructive environment for youngsters whose lives are often chaotic and close to disastrous.
<P>
The youth justice board for England and Wales will examine the regimes in place. We announced in the House that the establishment of the board has been brought forward to this October, providing the Bill completes its passage through the House in due time. That will enable us to deal with the issues. I take it that Opposition Members want to encourage the development of such oversight of regimes.
<P>
The youth justice task force was established quickly after the general election. We gave it the role of looking into the way in which our overall policies could be implemented and into the secure estate. Its views on the provision and operation of juvenile secure accommodation were contained in its second report to the Home Secretary in October 1997, and a copy of that report was placed in the Library of the House. The White Paper built on those findings.
<P>
I emphasise that under the detention and training orders, the Government have included flexibility in the arrangements for young offenders sentenced to custody. We have introduced flexibility regarding the placing of young offenders in secure accommodation according to their maturity and their individual needs. We shall continue to do that in the long term as the provision of secure accommodation for young offenders evolves.
<P>
The provisions are not merely for the convenience of the Prison Service. The management and oversight of the youth justice boaord will ensure that regimes and placements are appropriate. The Government have also made allowance elsewhere for vulnerable young people. The requirements relating to 15 and 16-year-olds under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 were inflexible and could be introduced only with an all-or-nothing approach. We have introduced flexibility in dealing with such young people.
<P>
The point of the detention and training order is to get away from the narrow tramlines of the existing framework of orders. The order will allow a young offender to be held in any of the following: a young offender institution, a secure training centre, local authority secure accommodation, a youth treatment centre, or other accommodation provided for the purpose of restricting liberty as directed by the Secretary of State.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Gainsborough, the provisions are partly intended to create possibilities for the use of other approaches. There are some youngsters who not only need education and supervision, but who also have mental health problems or who need specialist treatment as young sex offenders.
<P>
There might also be new methods of providing more flexible regimes. For example, the development of electronic tagging might open up the possibility of placements that are less physically secure and constraining, but could offer a more constructive regime. That will not happen in the immediate future, but such developments are possible and the legislation should take that into account. The establishment of flexible orders and a youth justice board to oversee the use of appropriate disposals and regimes will achieve the fullest benefits.
<P>
The amendments would restrict the options for the placement of young offenders, subject to the detention and training order, in different types of secure accommodation according to their age. That would remove the very flexibility that the Government want to build into the Bill. Of course, younger offenders will normally be dealt with discretely and differently from older offenders, but not always. Different children mature at different rates. Chronological age is not necessarily an indicator of either maturity or vulnerability.
<P>
The amendents are contrary to the expressed intention of the hon. Member for Hertsmere when he introduced them. If they were accepted, it would not be possible to place a vulnerable offender who had just turned 15 and was subject to a four-month detention and training order in a secure training centre. On the other hand, a less vulnerable 14-year-old, only a few weeks younger, but subject to a full two-year detention and training order, could be placed in a secure training centre until his release, possibly after his 16th birthday, but could not be placed in a young offender institution. That example demonstrates that there is no benefit in arbitrarily limiting the discretion to place young offenders in the secure accommodation most appropriate for their needs.
<P>
The Government are introducing flexible legislation to ensure that the needs and the vulnerability of individuals can be properly assessed. We have recently reviewed the range of secure accommodation for holding young people who are remanded or sentenced to custody to ascertain how we might make the best use of such accommodation. It would be premature to limit the future options for placing young offenders before the results of the review have been properly considered. Furthermore, it would not be helpful to include such provisions in the Bill. The early establishment of the youth justice board will help in the appropriate placement of young offenders.
<P>
I understnd the concerns that have been expressed about the inappropriate mixing of vulnerable prisoners with other prisoners who might have a negative impact on them. The amendments would not help to allay such concerns. They would reduce the flexibility to place young prisoners in the most appropriate accommodation according to their needs and taking account of the risk that they pose to themselves and to others.

<P>

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My earlier question does not relate exactly to the Minister's remarks, although he might be about to deal with it. I asked him whether it was not rather odd that a person who behaves impeccably serves longer with a 17-month sentence than with an 18-month sentence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a point on which I need to respond to him separately. There is a need for consistency but there is also a need for the appropriate arrangements to be made for particular youngsters. I am not sure whether that quite answers his point but the early and late release arrangements set out in the clause are subject to the discrete sentence period set out in clause 69(5). There cannot be a single sentence of 17 months.
<P>
The aim of our approach is to avoid the anomalies that have been described. That does not take into account release on compassionate grounds but it creates discrete periods which enable proper planning, both for the period in secure accommodation and outside. That considered approach is the essence of our proposals. As has become clear, there are some misapprehensions about the way that the system would work, but I hope that I have addressed them. The amendment does not represent the best way to meet the needs of vulnerable young prisoners, and I hope that in the light of my comments the hon. Gentleman withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister's response. I enjoyed the earlier part which was a charming vignette of new Labour rhetoric but had little to do with the amendments. We will have an interesting debate later when we come to the question of the Government's record of providing secure accommodation. As the Minister will recall, back in those wicked years of the previous Conservative Government the then enlightened and benign Opposition argued that there should not be any secure training centres and that the real priority was to expand secure accommodation. I do not have chapter and verse now, but if the Minister wants it I can provide it later
<P>
There was no need, we were told, for orders for 12 to 15-year-olds: the problem could be solved if we built upon existing secure accommodation. Local authority secure accommodation serves a wider variety of purposes than the secure training orders on which we should focus our attention. Secure training orders were the discrete sentences for 12 to 15-year-olds. Under the old scheme of things, 12 to 15-year-olds were held in discrete accommodation. The amendment seeks to ensure that that age group is held in accommodation that is restricted: only 12 to 15-year-olds can go into it.
<P>
Notwithstanding all the rhetoric that we have just heard, that is an important point. That is the law as it stands, and to move from that to detention and training orders where it will be possible for the ages to be mixed from 12 to 17 or even 10 to 17 is a backward step. The Minister said that the amendments would prevent a mature person at one end of the age range from being put into the accommodation of more mature people and a less mature person at the other end of the age range from being kept with 12, 13 or 14-year-olds. The Minister must accept that there comes a point where a line has to be drawn to separate different age groups.
<P>
I am not convinced by the Minister's approach because the Government are not taking that approach when it comes to older offenders. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the Government are drawing a firm line between 17 and 18-year-olds. The same argument will not be able to apply to 17 and 18-year-olds. A less mature 18-year-old cannot be put with 15, 16 and 17-year-olds and a more mature 17-year-old cannot be put with offenders of 18, 19 or 20. The same argument would apply to adult offenders who have always been kept completely separate from young offenders in terms of sentencing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The more lines that are drawn, the more complex matters become and the less flexibility there is to ensure that the most appropriate disposal is decided in each case. Flexibility is particularly important for younger age groups and it is also important, in principle, to keep the dividing lines to a minimum.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The dividing lines are already there: it is a question of what dividing lines are appropriate. We believe that it is sensible to put the dividing line where the previous Government put it between 12, 13 and 14-year-olds and 15, 16 and 17-year-olds. The Minister made it clear in his intervention that the Government put the dividing line between 15, 16 and 17-year-olds and 18, 19 and 20-year-olds and then between offenders over 21 who have always been dealt with separately in adult accommodation. Children reach different stages of development at different ages.
<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister's reply. I had hoped that he would tell me that the Government would make every effort to keep the age ranges separate but they seem to be putting flexibility ahead of that consideration. The Government have received advice from the task force. There are undoubtedly learned people on that task force, but I would be surprised if any of them could honestly say that it was good for children aged 12 to be kept in the same accommodation as 17-year-olds. The Minister may induce one of them to do so but I doubt it, and my hon. Friends share my view that it is a backward step to allow such age mixing to take place irrespective of the quality of the regimes.
<P>
It will be interesting to see how different the secure training order regime will be from the one envisaged by the previous Government, and what the magic new Labour ingredients will be. Opposition Members[Mr. Clappison]
believe that it is not sensible for less mature offenders in the 12, 13 and 14-year age group to be mixed in any circumstances with older offenders. It cannot be right and I am unhappy with the Minister's response even more unhappy than at the beginning of the debate.
<P>
The Government's response was less satisfactory than I expected. I had hoped that the Government would say that they had not thought through all the details, that they were still waiting for the secure estate review to report and that they would make every effort to deal with criticisms. However, they are saying that flexibility should come before the other issues. I remain unhappy. We have no idea what the secure estate review will say, so we are debating in a bit of a void. The Government have kept us in the dark. I am so unhappy that I am going to press for a Division.

Clause 71 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 72</center></H4>
<H4><center>The period of supervision</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 286, in page 58, line 21, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
The amendment is designed to explore supervision for children and young persons on their release from detention and training. Subsection (1) states that supervision will begin when the offender is released, and continue until the end of the term of the order. However, subsection (2) gives the Secretary of State an order-making power to provide that supervision can end before the end of the terms of the order. Under clause 72(1), a child or young person who is sentenced to 12 months' detention will serve six months in custody and spend another six months under supervision. However, under subsection (2), the Secretary of State could order supervision to end after three quarters of the sentence had been completed. In that case, a child or young person who is sentenced to 12 months will serve six months in custody and spend three months under supervision.
<P>
Why do the Government want to introduce an order-making power to shorten the supervision period? Will the Minister explain more about arrangements for release from the custodial part of the term? Subsection (1) refers to the offender's release,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"whether at the half-way point of the term of the order or otherwise".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What does "otherwise" mean?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The purpose of the detention and training order is to allow a clear focus on preventing further offending. It is a more constructive and flexible sentence, which is intended to tackle the nature of offending behaviour. Half the length of the new order will be spent in custody, and half under community supervision. Clause 72 sets out the provisions for the period of supervision after release from custody.
<P>
Subsection (1) provides that, under the detention and training order, the period of supervision will run from the end of the period of custody until the end of the order, subject to subsection (2).
<P>
Subsection (2), which is the subject of the amendment, provides that the Secretary of State can, by order, adjust the period of supervision so that it will end at a specified point during the term of the order. The provision allows the amount of post-release supervision to be modified, if appropriate.
<P>
The provision also allows the Government to learn from experience how much post-release supervision is needed under the new order. The Government will be able only to reduce the amount of such supervision; we will not be able to extend the length of the order under this mechanism. As such, the provision offers a safeguard.
<P>
The Government will require convincing arguments to show that shorter periods of post-release supervision are appropriate before making use of this provision. But the Government believe that, in constructing a new custodial sentence for juveniles, we should build into the provisions as much flexibility as would be useful.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I understand the sentiment that the Minister just expressed, but how will the order-making power operate? Will it apply to all offenders' period of supervision, or will it allow the authorities to pick and choose between offenders?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. The authorities will not be allowed to pick and choose. The hon. Gentleman may not appreciate that clause 101 provides that an order under clause 72(2) will have to be made by statutory instrument, which is subject to affirmative resolution procedure. That is a safeguard. Such an order would have to be presented to the House, and any change would have to be justified.
<P>
I am not convinced that we will use the order-making power. The balance in the clause is probably right. However, subsection (2) constitutes a safeguard, so that if expereince shows that resources are better used on a shorter period of supervision, the House not administrative fiat can make a change by agreeing to an affirmative order. Deleting subsection (2) would take away that option, and remove flexibility. It is sensible to leave the provision in the Bill, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that we do not intend to use it in the short term.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that response, from which I draw some reassurance. I was pleased that he acknowledged that the order-making power was unlikely to be used. I rather agree with his sentiments on the matter.
<P>
I think that it is strange that th order-making power should be sought at all. I wonder how the Minister can say that it would provide more flexibility, when it would just shorten supervision across the board for all offenders. I suppose that that ability to shorten the period is a kind of flexibility. We have at least explored the provision and though I find it a little strange, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 72 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 73</center></H4>
<H4><center>Breaches of supervision requirements</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I note that the supervision of an offender is to be carried out by a probation officer, social worker or member of the youth offending team. The probation service and social services require certain qualifications of their staff. However, under clause 36, while a youth offending team would have to include a certain number of specific types of person, it could also include anyone who was nominated or chosen. I am not sure who such persons might be, or whether they would be qualified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It may be helpful to the hon. Gentleman if I say that we have stated that we would normally envisage direct supervision of the kind to which the clause relates being undertaken by a social worker or probation officer. However, what would be appropriate would depend on the circumstances. An example might involve a youth offending team that included a representative of a voluntary organisation concerned with drug rehabilitation and an offender whose problems were of that nature. The development of consistency and the professionalism about which the hon. Gentleman is concerned would certainly be part of the role of the youth justice board for England and Wales. We want flexibility in the law, but professionalism in supervision is at the heart of our proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My questions are exploratory. I want to clarify in my mind what would happen under the provision. A young man would be released after half his term and would be under supervision, with requirements. Under a probation order, the requirements are generally pretty standard, such as being of good behaviour, leading an industrious life, receiving visits from a probation officer and making them when required. Who would decide the requirements applying to the young person on licence? Would it be the custodial centre, whatever it might be, the probation service or social services? What kinds of requirements might be imposed?
<P>
I am also concerned about the reference in clause 73 to failure "to comply with requirements" two of them. I am not trying to make a silly point. The liberty of the individual concerned would be at stake. We need to know that the provision is carefully worded and that there is no room for abuse. I want to ensure that people who are very professional are involved in organising requirements. Could there be half a dozen requirements? I do not know. They would not be onerous, would they?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Again, I am seeking to help the hon. Gentleman as he is asking sensible questions. The requirements will be set by the Secretary of State so they would be carefully thought out and subject to the normal criteria of decision making. Of course we want to have the flexibility to meet various needs and to supervise the problems that lead to offending by a particular young person. That is why we build in as a balance the oversight of the youth justice board to provide training and guidance on the way in which professionals, as members of these teams, exercise their responsibilities following the order-making powers of the Secretary of State.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Malin:</B> I am grateful for that. I want to be clear about the sorts of requirements that might be laid down by the Secretary of State. Would they be few or many? Must there be a failure to comply with more than one requirement as the clause refers to "requirements"? It is a narrow point but it is worth raising. The information is presumably laid by the probation service. I am concerned about the young man who finds himself back in court, and I want to make sure that the procedure leading up to that is fairly professional and rigorously dealt with.
<P>
What can the court then do with him? It looks as though they can send him back for a maximum of three months. If he gets an 18-month sentence, he could come out after seven months if he had behaved well. All the court could do is given him another three months or fine him. Fines are getting slightly irrelevant for youngsters who are always on benefits anyway, so that is a bit of a waste of time. The only remedy is to return him for another three months maximum.
<P>
Is there an argument for introducing any other form of punishment and keeping the court open to a probation order or a community order? Will there be any more flexibility? I have rambled a little here. The Minister will know by now that I ramble. [Interruption.] It is kind of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough to say from a sedentary position that I do not but rather unkind of the Minister, also from a sedentary position, to say that I do. I am just concerned to make sure that everything is all right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I should make it clear that normal requirements would include reporting to a supervising officer and attending counselling. Such requirements, which are tailored to the needs of the individual, continue along the plan that will have been devised before he comes out of the custodial part of his sentence. [Interruption.] Perhaps I should at this point welcome the Opposition Whip, the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Cran), back to our debates and any future votes.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking is right to say that for a breach the court can send an offender back for three months or up to the end of the sentence. He should take[Mr. Michael]
some comfort from the fact that those sorts of requirements are already familiar. They will be established by the Secretary of State. They would genuinely be recognisable by the courts. The courts would have to be satisfied that someone was brought back as a result of a genuine breach of the requirements set down by the Secretary of State. Even if the supervision was not by a social worker or a probation officer, an offender could not be brought back on a whim.
<P>
Youth offending teams should work as teams. The hon. Gentleman's fears are unfounded. It is likely that supervision will be carried out by a social worker or a probation officer, with other members of the team making appropriate contributions. If a youngster's needs lay in one particular area, one member of the team may play a greater role. For example, if a youngster needs remedial education, the education member of the youth offending team might take the lead. That would be entirely appropriate. However, that lead could not be taken without the professional back-up of the trained social workers or probation officers in the team.
<P>
Action on a breach will depend on age. The hon. Member for Woking said that a fine is often ineffective because youngsters are always on benefit. That is not necessarily true, and we intend it not to be true in future. One of this Government's major innovations is the new deal for young people, and that includes fast access to new deal opportunities for young offenders. A pilot project, which is subject to evaluation, is being carried out in prisons and young offender institutions.
<P>
Although I am going a little wide of the hon. Gentleman's questions, I am tackling something that was implicit in his remarks. We need to introduce not only 16 to 18-year-olds but those up to the age of 25 into the world of work. The point of transition as they come out of a custodial sentence into community supervision provides a window of opportunity that is often recognised by young offenders.
<P>
My conversations with young prisoners show that they know that that window exists even though they sometimes come out of prison and return to old habits before one can say Mary Poppins. However, the more we can build on that opportunity by making a link between time in custody and supervision in the community, the better. That point applies to all age groups, but it applies especially to youngsters under the school leaving age. When they end their custodial sentence, they can take up educational opportunities and become involved in constructive activities.
<P>
I hope that I have said enough to satisfy the hon. Gentleman about the clause's intentions and that I have reassured him about how supervision will be organised. The fact that youth offending teams must produce youth justice plans to the youth justice board for England and Wales will provide an assurance of quality. The board will encourage good practice, and we shall shortly announce which areas will take part in the pilot projects to develop good practice. We will report to the House on the outcome of the pilots, and will encourage those authorities that are not part of the pilots to prepare their work constructively. The Bill and its implementation should provide reassurance to the hon. Gentleman.

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I am bound to say that I thought that I would have to vote against clause stand part and that I would have to ask my hon. Friends to join me. I was going to argue the point, but I have heard the Minister and he has been as persuasive as ever. Having heard his most helpful reassurances, I shall not vote against the clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 73 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 74 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 75</center></H4>
<H4><center>Sentencing guidelines</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 215, in page 60, line 35, leave out from "the" to "in" and insert "relative effectiveness of sentences".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 305, in Clause 76, page 61, line 36, after "above", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"save for information relating to the cost of different sentences which the Panel may only furnish to the Court of Appeal if it considers it necessary to do so".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now come to sentencing guidelines, which are already laid down by the Court of Appeal for a number of different offences. For example, there are well-known sentencing guidelines for rape or drug offences. Clause 75 provides legislative encouragement to sentencing guidelines being laid down by the Court of Appeal for lower courts, including the Crown court.
<P>
The clause also puts in place a mechanism whereby the Court of Appeal will receive proposals from a new body, the sentencing advisory panel, regarding sentencing guidelines. Subsection (3) sets out the matters to which the Court of Appeal should have regard in framing or revising such guidelines for the lower courts. Amendment No. 215 relates to one of those matters. Under subsection (3)(c), the Court of Appeal must have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the cost of different sentences".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We cannot let that pass without some exploration because we feel that there might be something new in asking the courts to consider the cost of different sentences.
<P>
We want reassurance from the Government that the overriding priority will be the protection of the public. We must also consider how cost should be taken into account in different circumstances. How do we measure the cost of one sentence against another? What if I am sorry to pose a "what if?" question again one sentence costs more than an alternative sentence in strict accountancy terms but turns out to have a much better record in preventing reoffending? What of the cost of future victims and the cost to the public of further court appearances and further sentences? Are they all to be considered as part of the cost equation?
<P>
It may assist the Committee if I provided one example to illustrate the point. It was adverted to in an earlier debate when mention was made of an experimental young offender institution at Colchester. The Committee will know that it was established at the military correctional facility at Colchester better known to the world as the boot camp. It was administered by the Army and run as a regime for young offenders. The Government ended the experiment on the grounds that it was more expensive than other young offender institutions. However, the decision on grounds of cost was taken before the full picture of the success or failure of the regime in preventing reoffending had emerged.
<P>
The Minister will know of independent research carried out at Cambridge university by Dr. Kate Painter, a criminologist, which showed that the experimental regime at Colchester had some positive aspects for young offenders. The decision was taken too early and we hope that that cost-based decision does not turn out to be premature and shortsighted. It will be interesting to compare the reoffending rates of young people who passed through the Colchester institution with those of youngsters who passed through ordinary young offender institutions.
<P>
Amendment No. 215 is intended to explore the issue of cost and I hope that my example was helpful. Amendment No. 305 raises the same issue regarding the sentencing advisory panel. We need more information from the Government about those matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan (Sheffield, Hallam:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere made some important points about the effects of costs on sentencing practice. Liberal Democrat Members are concerned about the costs of all disposals, especially at present when the Home Office needs to feed the prison budget because more and more people are being given custodial sentences. That has a knock-on effect throughout the criminal justice system. In a cash-limited situation, costs are relevant. If money is being fed into the prison budget, that will reduce the money available for the probation service and the other preventive measures introduced by the Bill.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Does the Minister envisage more expensive solutions, such as community sentences? At present, too little is spent on such sentences, especially when compared with the custodial alternatives. If there was serious consideration of the costs of sentences, it might be possible to introduce a more comprehensive package of community sentences. That would include probation, with courses, offered by the probation services, to enable offenders to confront their behaviour, and other forms of training to deal with the criminogenic factors that have been identified for a particular offender.
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members hope that the new approach of considering sentencing costs will not lead to cost-cutting measures, but that the Government will consider value for money. That could result in much more effective sentencing, rather than simply choosing the custodial option, which is often expensive and not always as effective as people believe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I support the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. Under the clause, the court has to take the cost of different sentences into account when considering guidelines. That is a fundamentally bad point. A sentence is a sentence, on merit. If the clause is the first step towards a situation in which courts are constrained to give certain sentences because they are cheaper, that is a rotten situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It seems odd to suggest that we should consider cost-effectiveness within the criminal justice system without considering costs. I understand what the hon. Member for Woking said, bt it is rather an odd way of looking at things.
<P>
Individual courts will hear the facts of the case, will decide about guilt and will consider the appropriate sentence, given the seriousness of the offence and the circumstances that only the court will have heard. Nothing in the Bill will interfere with that. However, there is massive inconsistency in the way in which similar cases are dealt with by different courts and even, sometimes, by the same court or the same level of court. That cannot be sensible.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) offered a wise counter to the remarks of the hon. Members for Woking and for Hertsmere. A great deal of money might be spent on a particular disposal, especally a custodial one, because it is the view of the court that nothing else works. However, if something else works and if a community-based sentence would be more likely to protect the public by reducing reoffending, that should be considered.
<P>
We should ask what form of sentence works best in a variety of different circumstances and we should consider costs when making judgments about sentencing. I agree that it would be wrong to make cost the only touchstone, or to suggest that courts should make it an overriding consideration. We should make the best use of available resources, which will always be limited, to ensure that the court's decisions are well informed. If flies in the face of that basic priority to suggest that the Court of Appeal and the advisory panel should ignore the cost of sentences in giving advice.
<P>
The amendments would remove the requirement that the Court of Appeal should have regard to the cost of sentences and that the panel should provide information on that cost. It is surely wrong to say that those bodies should take no notice of the cost.
<P>
If amendment No. 215 were to be accepted, the Court of Appeal would be required to have regard only to the relative effectiveness of different sentences in preventing reoffending. That is inconsistent with the requirements of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 which was passed under the previous Government. I shall return to that point in a moment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked whether we were introducing something new. I shall respond by saying that we are using a familiar principle of cost. The reference in the clause to cost and effectiveness is intended to ensure that the Court of Appeal will take those factors into account when considering the merits of a particular sentence in dealing with a certain type of offence and offender.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am listening to the Minister with interest. He suggested that the Bill is on a similar basis[Mr. Clappison]
to the 1991 Act. Where does the word "cost" appear in the Act?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall return to that point in a moment, when I hope to give a specific reference to the hon. Gentleman. Under section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, the Home Secretary has a duty to inform the courts about the financial implications of their decisions. In many ways, the principle that the Court of Appeal and the panel should consider that information complements that duty.
<P>
The Court of Appeal will need to take several principles into account when framing or revising a guideline. Concentrating on cost distorts what is required in the Bill. Those principles include the need to promote consistency, a comparative study of sentences imposed by English and Welsh courts for similar offences, the need to promote public confidence in the criminal justice system, the cost of different sentences and their relative effectiveness in preventing reoffending. Sometimes a more expensive sentence is less effective than a cheaper one. The question of cost therefore comes into play when considering the effectiveness of sentences in preventing reoffending. Indeed, that matter has sparked our debate.
<P>
The provision is not intended to undermine the fundamental independence of the judiciary in determining the appropriate sentence for individual offenders within the framework set by Parliament. It is not intended to promote alternative sentences for those for whom a prison sentence must be the only option. There is no question of those who have committed serious offences and who pose a danger to the public, such as violent, sexual or persistent offenders, being given a community penalty because it is a cheaper option.
<P>
The provision builds into the judiciary's considerative processes an awareness of the financial implications of its decisions. There may be occasions when a range of community penalties may be equally appropriate and equally effective in preventing reoffending. The Court of Appeal should then take into account the relative cost-effectiveness of the range of sentences which may be imposed. That will be only one of a range of complex considerations.
<P>
Amendment No. 305 would remove the requirement that the panel must provide the Court of Appeal with information on the costs of different sentences. If it were to be accepted, the panel would need to provide that information only if it considered it necessary to do so. The Government believe that the Court of Appeal should be provided with information about the cost and relative effectiveness of different sentences. Those are only two factors to which it must have regard.
<P>
Amendment No. 305 cannot be accepted without amendment No. 215. It would be difficult for the Court of Appeal to take account of the cost of sentences as required in clause 75 if the panel were not required to provide that information.
<P>
I agree that this matter requires careful handling to ensure that the true intention of the provision is reflected in guidance to the Court of Appeal. I hope that my response to the debate will have helped to clarify what the provisions are meant to do. I stress that under section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, the Home Secretary has the duty to inform the courts about the financial implications of their decisions. It is right for the judiciary to be aware of the costs of the disposals that it uses. The principle that we are considering complements that duty.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister was wise to read out those comments. He knows that he is on dangerous territory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Not at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> He is, because he must hedge around his intention very carefully. That is because it is one of the fundamentals of our constitution that judges are independent of the legislature and the Administration. Although the Minister tried, with the words that he carefully read out, to reassure us, what is being done is part of a worrying trend to try to view judges increasingly as civil servants involved in the administration of justice. They are not. Their role is quite different from that of civil servants working for the Minister and from his and hon. Members' rules. Of course, judges are men of the world. At the back of their minds, judges of the Court of Appeal and lower courts consider cost, but that is not, fundamentally, their function.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman has just contradicted himself. He said that judges consider cost. How can they do that if they do not know about it? Why does the hon. Gentleman want to deny the Court of Appeal information about cost? I ask him to treat his own words more seriously. He is introducing unnecessary confusion. It is clearly for the courts to make a decision as to sentence, but the Court of Appeal, deciding on sentencing guidelines, should know about cost so as to weigh all factors together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> These things always start in a small way, with honied words. Of course the Minister must say, "Of course, no pressure will be put on judges of the Court of Appeal. This is just an information exercise." However, I see the move as the thin end of the wedge. To begin with, it is said that judges must be aware of the cost of different sentences. Then pressure is applied. That is the start of a dangerous trend.
<P>
Judges are men and women of the world. They know that prison is an expensive option. They do not need to be told that. Traditionally, they have sentenced people according to the needs of society and the way the defendant needs to be dealt with. They do so, to that extent, irrespective of cost. Whatever the details of the Minister's explanation, the Committee should be aware of a dangerous trend. Some hon. Members should keep an eye on it, and, if necessary, call a halt. I can envisage ways in which the ratchet could be turned a tiny bit tighter on judges in the next criminal justice Bill or the one after. It has been turned tighter in recent years.
<P>
The Minister says that the Government simply want to ensure the best treatment of the relevant matters. We have heard all that before. Let us be careful. Let us draw breath and go no further down the route I have described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's response and still have a lurking doubt at the back of my mind. The amendment is well justified as a way of exploring some of the matters that may be at stake.
<P>
I said that I thought there was something new in the measure. I cannot say that I searched the entire span of criminal justice legislation to discover whether anything of the kind had appeared before. However, I have been helpfully told by the Minister that a provision that he believes to be somewhat similar appears in section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Of course, sections 1 and 2 of that Act set out the framework for custodial sentences.
<P>
I shall make a confession. I had not been aware of the existence of section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 I shall get that off my chest now. However, I have now had the chance to study it and it still seems more than a little different from the proposal here. It requires the Secretary of State to publish information
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"enabling persons engaged in the administration of criminal justice to become aware of the financial implications of their decisions".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, he is giving them information about the financial implications of the sentences that are passed.
<P>
The clause takes the matter many stages further. It deals with the framing of guidelines by the Court of Appeal which will govern how long, generally speaking, sentences should be for different types of offences. The Court of Appeal will lay down guidelines, as it already has done for other types of offences such as rape and drug and driving offences, stating what the aggravating and mitigating features would be and how long would be appropriate for certain types of cases.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In framing those guidelines, the Court of Appeal is being required to have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the cost of different sentences",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
alongside other considerations such as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the need to promote consistency in sentencing".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a fundamental purpose of guidelines.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> When he intervened on me, the Minister tried to maintain that this is simply a question of information. I am worried about the phrase "shall have regard to". This is not simply about judges being aware of the different costs it goes further. Whatever the Minister says, he should be pressed on this.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend has hit the nail on the head. It does go further. We have been told all along that the Government want to see more consistency in sentencing. That is one of the factors to be considered, but the cost of sentences is set out alongside that as a factor of equal importance, together with those other factors listed in subsections 3(a) to (e). There is a step change there. Although I had not been aware of section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, I remain convinced that there is something new here. My lurking doubt is growing all the time and is being confirmed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman is scraping around for a point to make. If individual judges have to be provided with information about costs and have to be aware of those costs in making their judicial decisions, which is set out in the 1991 Act, why is it not appropriate for the panel to make information about costs available to the Court of Appeal in making recommendations about the sort of guidelines and consideration that should be taken into account by those judges when they reach their decisions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Because it is more than simply making information available to people: it requires them to have regard to it. The clause states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the court shall have regard to",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and the court in this case is the Court of Appeal when it is framing guidelines.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall ask the hon. Gentleman to revert to the 1991 Act and to look at the implications of what was decided there by his Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> But it did not require the courts to "have regard to"; it merely involved the publication of information for the assistance of the courts. These guidelines will bind all the lower courts. If someone has received a sentence that is manifestly contrary to the guidelines, that will be a ground for appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> This is an important point. The Minister was thoroughly disingenuous in his earlier intervention. He was trying to persuade the Committee that it was simply that judges should be provided with information. He must explain why, under the clause, judges will have to have regard to the costs of different sentences in framing such guidelines. As my hon. Friend has made clear, this is a new and important departure. The Minister was not being entirely I am aware, Mr. O'Hara, that I cannot accuse the Minister of being dishonest. Let us say that he was not being as full to the Committee earlier as he should have been.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> There are lurking doubts here. My hon. Friend is right to explore these matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> There are lurking doubts only because the hon. Gentleman is trying to create them. Two factors are linked in the clause. It does not mention cost alone. Subsection (3)(c) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the cost of different sentences and their relative effectiveness in preventing re-offending".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Cost effectiveness follows other considerations, such as consistency in sentencing, and sentencing practice in England and Wales. Subsection (3) also refers to public confidence and the views of the sentencing advisory panel.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendment would be a vast improvement on that, because it would require the court simply to take account of relative effectiveness in preventing reoffending. The Court of Appeal would not have to balance cost against effectiveness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The courts should have regard to that in determining sentences. It would be odd, in the light of section 95 of the 1991 Act, if the courts did not take account of the cost of sentences. The 1991 Act clearly provides that courts should be aware of that. Nothing in clause 75 contradicts the basic sentencing framework that part I of the 1991 Act sets out. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman disagrees with section 95 of the 1991 Act, but clause 75 is consistent with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It puts the courts in a difficult position. The courts have to take account of the considerations that we have mentioned in framing sentences under the 1991 Act.
<P>
Earlier, I mentioned the Colchester young offender institution. Other experimental regimes exist. Will courts have to decide that such schemes are too expensive despite their effectiveness in preventing reoffending? The Government have already made that mistake by making a premature decision about the Colchester young offender institution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, for any defendant, there is a right sentence, based on the crime and any mitigation? A departure, based on cost, from the right sentence can result in the wrong sentence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend has drawn on his judicial experience and explained the matter in a nutshell. We want to ensure that the right sentence is not undermined by cost. The Colchester young offenders institution was closed on grounds of cost. The Government produced figures to show that it was more expensive than X or Y regime, yet they did not know the extent of its effectiveness in preventing reoffending. Those figures were not available because the research had not been completed. It was said that early results were promising. That shows the dangers of considering matters only in terms of costs.
<P>
The amendments would improve the Bill. I have a lurking doubt that sentencing will be dictated by cost. The doubt has not become a firm belief, but my suspicions have grown during the debate. However, I shall not press the amendment. [Hon Members: "We should!"] Perhaps I have been slow in developing my lurking doubts. I shall put down a marker to show our anxiety [Interruption.] I suspected that the Minister was secretly on our side. I shall not repeat what I heard him say from a sedentary position, but I appreciate that he has a better half that is trying to get out but which is suppressed by his ministerial half. However, in view of all the doubts and various comments, I shall have to press the amendment to a Division.

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> There are obviously lurking doubts among Conservative Members about the clause.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough was right to point out that this clause on sentencing guidelines will tend to move us towards sausage machine, computerised justice in the long run. Justice and sentencing should never be that.
<P>
I have read an example prepared by the National Association of Probation Officers. It welcomes the clause, and I was surprised by that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman remind us which Administration introduced mandatory sentences and the fixed-fines system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> That question gives us an opportunity for another debate. I have to admit that a Conservative Administration did. I was not happy about mandatory sentencing and I used to write from afar to the then Home Secretary to express my views. The Minister also mentioned unit fines. They are a most interesting topic that could keep us going for a long time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is most entertaining, but it is hardly in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Indeed, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
NAPO talks about widespread inconsistencies in sentencing in the past decade. It provides figures showing that in 1996 a defendant was seven times more likely to be gaoled in Chesterfield than in Wakefield. For an offence of theft, 1 per cent. were gaoled in Swindon compared to 25 per cent. in Sunderland. So what? I do not trouble myself about inconsistencies in sentencing. After all, judges and sentences are entitled to take into account the prevalence of an offence in their locality. That is perfectly proper sentencing and I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough would agree. Certain crimes are more prevalent in certain localities.
<P>
It would be a sad day if sentencing became too similar and there was not room for the odd sentence that deviated from the norm. That is why the clause creates slight worries. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough put his finger on it when he talked about the need for variety in sentencing. He was right to do so.
<P>
Judges' hands should not be tied. I do not think that there is anything wrong with a defendant turning up at a Crown court where there are six courts and saying, "I hope that we don't get Judge Smith because he always puts you in prison for this. I hope that we get Judge Bloggs because he is more likely to give you probation." That is part of life's rich pattern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Do offenders look forward to the hon. Gentleman's appearance in court?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I must admit that I have a reputation for being gentle on sentencing. However, I have a reputation for toughness in other areas. I shall not go into that.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 75 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
