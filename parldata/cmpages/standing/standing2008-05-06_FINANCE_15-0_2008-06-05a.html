<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000277"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I will try to keep the pace as lively as it has
been so
far.</div><a name="08060589000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
85 allows the Treasury to make consequential and transitional
provisions in relation to clauses 68 to 84. That is a catch-all power,
and it includes the clauses on the abolition of industrial and
agricultural buildings allowances, which we discussed at length in the
previous sitting. Amendment No. 185 would remove paragraph (b) from
subsection (4), which allows any changes to have retrospective effect
providing that the provision</div>
<a name="08060589000217"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;does not
increase any person&#146;s liability to tax&#148;.</div>
<a name="08060589000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 186 would
remove the negative resolution procedure and introduce the positive
resolution procedure for any changes made under the
clause.</div><a name="08060589000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
tabled the amendments to seek assurances on a couple of matters. First,
I would like to ask the Financial Secretary whether paragraph (b) will
allow the Government retrospectively to alter provisions to reduce
allowances, for example by reducing the phasing-out levels for
agricultural buildings allowances from those decided in clause 82. Will
the right hon. Lady explain whether there is scope for changing the
goal posts agreed in subsequent finance Bills? Secondly, do the
Government think that it is appropriate to use statutory instruments
and the negative resolution procedure to introduce retrospective
provisions?</div><a name="08060589000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
context for this part of our deliberations is, as we discussed at
length on Tuesday afternoon, the widespread concern that people who
made planning assumptions about their business investments, in some
cases dating back to the 1980s, as well as people who made those
assumptions as recently as the middle of the current decade, will be
adversely affected by the changes. However, at least they now know the
scope of that adverse effect. They know that the tapering-out will
leave them worse off, but they can make calculations about how much
worse off they will be and make adjustments. Given the state of the
public finances, I am seeking reassurance from the Minister that the
goal posts will not be further moved in subsequent Bills; for example,
that the tapering-out will not take place more rapidly than envisaged
in the
legislation.</div><a name="08060589000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000278"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy):</b> It is
a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook. It is
a very fine day and I hope that we can bring that good atmosphere into
the Committee, as has been our practice so far in our
debates.</div>
<a name="08060589000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
scale of the reforms that we have been considering in the last few
clauses&#151;14 of the last 17 clauses having been part of
the package business tax reforms announced in 2007&#151;it is
possible that some of the consequential amendments that need to be made
to other Acts, which refer to legislation that has been repealed or
changed significantly, have been missed. The hon. Member for Taunton
has tabled a probing amendment to ascertain the purpose of the powers
that we would take under the clause. I hope to reassure him by saying
that they could be used only to relieve tax, but not in a way that
would be detrimental to a taxpayer. The clause provides the power to
make any transitional 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column509" />Column number: 509</div>and savings provisions that are necessary as a result of the reforms.
They allow such amendments to be retrospective only when the change
does not increase someone&#146;s liability to tax. The statutory
instrument that deploys that power would be subject to negative
resolution. I hope that that provides the reassurance that the hon.
Gentleman was seeking. His question was a sensible one. Given my
reassurance, I hope that he is prepared to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="08060589000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000279"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her reassurance,
and I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08060589000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

86</h4><a name="08060589000007"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Balancing

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000280"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 218, in
clause 86, page 48, line 29, leave
out subsection (4) and
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4) Where this
section applies&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a)
section 343(2) shall apply, but as if the words &#147;and are subject
to section 343A (company reconstructions involving business of leasing
plant or machinery)&#148; were omitted;
and</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) section 343A shall not
apply.&#146;.</div><a name="08060589000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a technical drafting amendment, the authorship of which I do not
claim. It comes from the Law Society, which is concerned about the lack
of clarity in the drafting of subsection (4). The amendment intends to
clarify the intention of that subsection so that it is clear that in a
case to which the anti-avoidance provisions of clause 86 apply, section
343(2) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 would be omitted
and, separately, that section 343(A) would not apply in a case to which
this anti-avoidance section applies. There is no question about what
the provision is trying to achieve, but the wording in the Bill is
clumsy and is capable of more than one interpretation. The Law Society
has proposed that subsection (4) be divided into two paragraphs, so
that it says clearly where section 343(2) should apply, but as if the
words,</div>
<a name="08060589000218"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and are subject
to section 343(A)&#148;</div>
<a name="08060589000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">were omitted, and,
separately, that section 343(A) itself &#147;shall not apply&#148;.
I hope the Minister can confirm that the Law Society&#146;s
interpretation is correct, and that the amendment does not change what
the Government intended. If she will not accept our amendment, will she
at least place on record an acknowledgement that the interpretation as
per the amendment is correct for future guidance of Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs decision-makers and the
courts?</div><a name="08060589000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000281"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Amendment No. 218 does no more than seek to
clarify the intention of clause 86 (4). I appreciate the way in way in
which the hon. Gentleman moved it, and it may help if I explain how
subsection (4) works. This will be quite a technical reply, but it is a
proper and technical amendment, which has the same effect as the
subsection that it seeks to amend. I will try to explain why we do not
believe that it is necessary.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column510" />Column number: 510</div><a name="08060589000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (4)
of new section 343ZA applies section 343(2) of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988 to transactions that fall within the scope
of the new section. Section 343(2) is one of its main operative
provisions, providing that a trade is treated as not ceasing and
commencing for the purposes of the Capital Allowances Act. This is the
effect that is needed for the new clause.</div>
<a name="08060589000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
section 343(2) ends with words that ensure it normally applies subject
to the provisions of section 343A. As section 343A ensures that section
343 does not apply in some circumstances, it could have the effect of
allowing a trade to be treated as ceased. Therefore, in applying
section 343(2) to new section 343ZA, it is necessary to ensure that
section 343A does not affect the outcome. This is achieved by omitting
the closing words of section 343(2). It is at moments like this that I
wish I was next door in Committee Room 9 debating the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology
Bill.</div><a name="08060589000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is the effect of subsection (4) of new clause 343ZA. The proposed
amendment would have the same effect. We can debate the elegance of the
wording, but our advice is that the wording in the Bill is what is
required to have the effect I have described. I believe that new
subsection (4) is unambiguous and there is no need to make the
amendment. It would be interesting to hear the views of the Law Society
after that explanation. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="08060589000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060589000282"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000283"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> As the hon. Gentleman says, that is clear. How
the right hon. Lady can suggest that that is unambiguous is slightly
beyond me. I am quite sure that it is fairly ambiguous. It emphasises
how complex the tax code is. The important point is that although I do
not pretend to have followed precisely the logic of her explanation, as
she read it out, those who need to interpret this statute will not only
have followed it, they will be able to refer to it. Therefore the
matter is clarified for the future guidance of HMRC practitioners and,
if ever necessary, the courts. The purpose of the amendment has been
served, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08060589000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

will say a few brief words about the schedule and raise a question
about parity. The schedule should be regarded as being in honour of the
right hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls), now the Secretary of State
for Children, Schools and Families, who had a particular obsession with
the ways in which people could inherit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column511" />Column number: 511</div>tax-relieved forms of savings. Comparatively simple sections of the
Finance Act 2004 on alternatively secured pensions were amended in 2006
and 2007. Here we are in 2008 amending those same sections and
extending to other types of pension schemes the measures used to
discourage people from using alternatively secured
pensions.</div><a name="08060589000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not entirely clear what mischief, if any, the schedule is supposed
to tackle. I do not have any evidence that there has been widespread
abuse of the pension schemes that are identified. I would be grateful
if the Economic Secretary would provide clarification, because one of
the consequences of the measure is the application of a tax charge of
up to 82 per cent. to payments made from scheme pensions when there is
an increase in the pension rights of one member following the death of
another member who is part of the family or a partner. This is quite a
complex
measure.</div><a name="08060589000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to raise several issues with the Economic Secretary. As I
understand it, a number of these small pension schemes have at their
heart an asset that is relevant to the business. The pension scheme
might own a factory, an office or a shop that is used in the business.
When these measures were first discussed, I spoke to a number of
pension advisers who were concerned that these changes could lead to
the forced realisation for sale of those assets to fund pension
charges. The responses to the consultation from organisations such as
the Association of British Insurers suggest that those concerns have
been
allayed.</div><a name="08060589000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are still areas where there is a lack of clarity for taxpayers in
interpreting these rules. I refer the Committee to the concluding words
of paragraph 7(3)(a), which
state,</div><a name="08060589000219"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;but
otherwise having regard to the circumstances of the
member&#148;.</div><a name="08060589000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph

explanatory notes are commendably brief on the topic, but they do not
provide clarity for tax advisers or pensioners about what might be
deemed to be the circumstances of the dependant. I do not know whether
the intention is to produce guidance to supplement that paragraph and
the explanatory notes, but it would be useful for people to have
greater clarity on the purpose and the meaning
of</div><a name="08060589000221"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;having

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000285"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Kitty Ussher):</b> It is a
pleasure, as always, to serve under your chairmanship, Mr.
Cook.</div><a name="08060589000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham correctly summarised what the schedule is
attempting to achieve. It will change current legislation to ensure
that scheme pensions and lifetime annuities are used to provide a
retirement income for life, and not as a means of diverting
tax-relieved pensions savings into inheritance. It will make the
treatment of scheme pensions and lifetime annuities consistent with
that of alternatively secured pensions, which the hon. Gentleman
rightly says have been considered by previous Finance Acts, and so
create a level playing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column512" />Column number: 512</div>field for the different ways in which individuals aged 75 or over can
use their pension funds to secure an income for the rest of their
lives.</div>
<a name="08060589000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked why we are doing that, and it is really a point of
principle. The purpose of giving generous tax relief on pension savings
is to support savings that provide a secure income in retirement, so
provisions allowing tax relief to be redirected and passed on to
inheritance are contrary to that fundamental principle. In addition,
mass-market providers of pensions told the Government that a level
playing field between alternatively secured pensions and other types of
pensions was required, and we agree. While the measure was not being
particularly abused, according to our evidence, the failure to act
would have left in place a perverse tax incentive for members of
pension schemes to select pension options that provide the best
opportunity to increase inheritances for their children and grand
children, rather than maximising the income in retirement available to
them and their dependants. There are other ways of saving for
one&#146;s children and grandchildren, rather than doing so through
pension
schemes.</div><a name="08060589000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman made a point about assets belonging to a scheme&#151;a
factory, for example&#151;having to be realised as a result of this
measure, but that is not our view. The measures apply only after the
pension scheme has begun to pay a secure pension, and therefore will
not affect the type of assets that the scheme must realise to provide
that pension, so I hope that I can allay the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
concerns and those of the wider audience in that regard.</div>
<a name="08060589000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman questioned the precise meaning of the phrase</div>
<a name="08060589000222"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;having regard
to the circumstances of the member&#148;.</div>
<a name="08060589000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is intended to
ensure that account is taken of the fact that an individual may have a
higher nil-rate band if a claim has been made to transfer the nil-rate
band on the death of a spouse. However, we will shortly provide further
guidance on that point, which I hope will allay any
concerns.</div><a name="08060589000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000286"></a>Mr.

better parliamentary

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000287"></a>Kitty

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000288"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I want to ask some detailed questions that cover a
number of different issues relating to the schedule. Paragraph 7(3)
states that</div>
<a name="08060589000223"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the individual
is one of a class of at least 20 pensioner
members&#148;,</div><a name="08060589000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
that term is not defined. That is quite important, because there is an
anti-avoidance provision in paragraph 7(4), which will insert new
sub-paragraph (4) into the original legislation so that any increase
within 12 months of a previous increase is not acceptable if the class
of pensioner members is different between the two increases and
if</div><a name="08060589000224"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the individual&#146;s being
included in the new class
is&#148;</div><a name="08060589000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">to
avoid being caught through an excessive
increase.</div><a name="08060589000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister confirm that the class will be defined by reference to
criteria, and that it does not matter that the individuals within a
class are different at two different dates? A class of pensioners is
likely to change over time, because pensioners may die, but new
pensioners will join that class. Hence, any second increase within a
12-month period may involve what is technically a different class, even
if 90 per cent. of the individuals have remained the same. Is class
defined by the individuals who are part of that group or by specific
criteria?</div><a name="08060589000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
8 discusses threshold annual rates and circumstances in which
exemptions may be taken for relatively small increases. There is
concern that, at times, Department for Work and Pensions legislation
requires changes and there has been a suggestion that those increases
may exceed the retail prices index. Therefore, it would be appropriate
for an exemption from testing to apply to any increase required by
legislation. Has the Minister given any thought to
that?</div><a name="08060589000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
18 deals with the inheritance tax treatment of non-UK pension schemes.
In principle, the paragraph is widely welcomed by pension advisers. It
corrects a situation that has arisen since A-day, when changes were
made to the pension regime. Prior to A-day, a sponsored superannuation
scheme was outside the scope of inheritance tax legislation , including
overseas pension schemes. However, post A-day, only registered schemes
and something called &#147;section 615 schemes&#148; have been
outside the scope of IHT. All non-registered schemes, both UK and
overseas, were within the scope to IHT and subject to the ensuing
complexity.</div><a name="08060589000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recognising
that there are overseas schemes that should fall outside the scope of
IHT is welcome to the industry. However, there is concern about the
definition of the scheme as set out in the draft statutory instrument,
which the Minister kindly circulated to members of the Committee.
Because it reflects the way in which Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs looks at UK tax schemes, it creates a slight problem. If a
scheme does not qualify it imposes burdens. Pension schemes could be
treated as a settlement and subject to significant IHT consequences,
such as 10th anniversary charges. There are pension schemes designed to
deal with expatriate employees or people who work overseas that could
become liable to those charges, because they do not fall within the
definition of qualifying schemes as set out in the draft statutory
instrument. I shall give some examples.</div>
<a name="08060589000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, some
countries, such as the US, have limits on benefits in approved pension
schemes, and management often has unapproved schemes on top of the
approved schemes. While it may be reasonable for those schemes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column514" />Column number: 514</div>not to enjoy full UK income tax approval, because they will not qualify
for the exemption, long-term inheritance tax burdens may be imposed on
them. Secondly, some skilled mobile executives often end up in
international pension schemes in cases in which individuals move from
country to country a number of times and no particular country&#146;s
pension scheme can cover them. Those people often form part of a key
group of senior management but, because of the mobile nature of their
employment, their pension scheme is not often open to ordinary local
employees, as it is geared to benefit mobile expatriates. According to
the draft statutory instrument, such schemes would not qualify, so IHT
burdens could be imposed on them with compliance and reporting
obligations. Such complexity is not normally found in other countries.
That has an impact on how business friendly the UK tax regime is seen
to be, compared with other countries where businesses might think about
locating skilled, mobile
executives.</div><a name="08060589000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be grateful if the Minister considered that issue. Could
amendments be made to the wording of the statutory instrument that
would broaden the definition of a qualifying non-UK scheme? They could
take into account situations such as those in which the benefits in one
territory are capped and there are additional schemes, or situations in
which a pension scheme can be set up to cover people working in a range
of different companies. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="08060589000231"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000289"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> This is rather a hotch-potch of miscellaneous
provisions, and the questions that the hon. Gentleman asked each refer
to a different provision. I request the patience of the Committee, as I
will describe what the schedule is attempting to achieve, before coming
on to the points made by the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="08060589000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
29 to clause 89 contains the details of a package of amendments that
simplify the administration of the pension system. The amendments
respond to industry lobbying, pre-announced consultation and
clarification of the rules, following the enormous exercise that led to
the changes at A-day. The amendments, while providing administrative
easements, also preserve the key underlying principle that tax relief
is given for pension savings, in order to encourage and support saving
that will produce income in
retirement.</div><a name="08060589000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
changes in the schedule fall into three categories. The first and by
far the largest category simplifies the administration, bringing
practice into line with intention and providing the deregulatory
benefits that we could achieve. We became aware of a number of
circumstances in which pension schemes make payments, often in innocent
error, such as an overpayment of an ongoing pension, that would
currently be treated as an unauthorised payment, and so are subject to
a tax charge of up to 70 per cent. A change to the
regulation-making powers, as we propose, would allow those payments to
be taxed in the same way as authorised payments from pension
schemes.</div><a name="08060589000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second change that our regulations will provide are relaxations to the
rules on trivial commutation, allowing occupational pension schemes to
trivially commute pots of up to &#163;2,000 and to help tackle the
issue of small stranded pension pots. A further administrative 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column515" />Column number: 515</div>change will ensure that the funds that migrant workers build up in
non-UK pension schemes that have received UK tax relief are
appropriately identified, to ensure that UK tax relief and charges for
overseas pension schemes equate with those for registered pension
schemes. That ensures that the legislation works as intended,
simplifies administration and protects tax revenues by removing a
potential
loophole.</div><a name="08060589000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
further administrative improvements resulted from proposals made by the
pensions industry. The first change simplifies complexities for scheme
administrators in the calculation of lump sum payments. The second
ensures that the members of large occupational schemes are not
unintentionally caught by the rules preventing tax-relieved investment
in residential property. Finally, in the category of administrative
improvements, the schedule includes a change to restore from April 2006
protection from inheritance tax charges to savings in certain overseas
pension schemes, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, which was
inadvertently removed in changes made to the pension tax rules. The
protection will apply where the overseas scheme is regulated and
tax-recognised in the country in which it is set up. If the country has
no system for regulation and tax-recognition, the pension scheme must
provide for the savings to be used to provide a pension income for
life. The hon. Gentleman queried whether that imposed burdens on
schemes that are liable to IHT charges. The regulations have been
published in draft, and are intended to give the same inheritance tax
protections that apply to schemes broadly equivalent to UK-registered
pension schemes, so we hope that there is not an additional burden.
That is the purpose of the regulations, but we have only published them
in draft, and my colleagues at HMRC are happy to accept and consider
representations. If groups outside the Committee have made points to
the hon. Gentleman, we are happy to take them on board and consider
them to make sure that we get this right.</div>
<a name="08060589000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
first category of issues which the schedule covers. The second category
is the change, following consultation, to rules preventing avoidance of
the lifetime allowance charge. The pensions industry has welcomed those
easements, which make the administration of the rule simpler and less
costly. The third category is the clarification of the rules on
employer contributions. The change confirms that during the period from
April 2004 to April 2006, the only tax relief is the actual
contribution paid in the year, which prevents any doubt about how the
provision operates.</div>
<a name="08060589000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman made two other points. First, he asked about the increase of
the threshold annual rate. It allows exemption from the test if the
increase is below the higher figure of 5 per cent. or RPI, which we
believe will account for all the circumstances that we envisage. It
works in conjunction with the rule allowing exception if more than 20
members have the same increase.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000296"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> These are small amendments to ensure that clause
91 and schedule 30 have the effect that we intended when we drafted
them. The Government expected the changes introduced by clause 91 and
schedule 30 to remove the need to notify HMRC of more than 270,000
transactions per year. It is a welcome deregulatory measure. Clause 91
introduces a rent notification threshold of &#163;1,000, which
applies to the grant of leases for a term of seven years or more and
reduces the administrative burden of stamp duty land tax. Previously,
one was required to notify HMRC of a grant of any lease for seven years
or more, provided it was made for a chargeable
consideration.</div><a name="08060589000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
clause 91 also applies the same &#163;1,000 notification trigger in
respect of leases that are assigned or surrendered. The assignment of a
lease refers to the transfer of rights to use leased property, which
can obviously happen periodically as rents are renegotiated. The
requirement to notify the assignment or surrender of leases when the
relevant rent was &#163;1,000 or more, regardless of the size of any
other chargeable consideration for the assignment or surrender, was
added to ensure that the data the Government collect on property
transactions were not harmed by the measure.</div>
<a name="08060589000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
since the Bill was published, we have received representations about
the extra reporting that the additional requirement will create. We
are, as always, keen to ensure that we can deregulate wherever possible
and that we do not place additional burdens on business, so we think
that we can collect the data in another way. We have re-examined the
requirement and agreed that we can offset the deregulatory savings if
we proceed as we originally intended.</div>
<a name="08060589000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the data collected from the notification of the granting of leases
would not be unduly affected by an amendment that removed the
requirement to notify HMRC of the assignment and surrender of leases
when the relevant rent is &#163;1,000 or more. I trust that the
amendment is uncontroversial.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column517" />Column number: 517</div><a name="08060589000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060589000297"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again, Mr. Cook.
The Financial Secretary said earlier that she hoped that the pleasant
weather outside would be reflected in a pleasant environment in this
room. I do not think there will be a great deal of controversy about
this clause. Although we might take issue with the Economic
Secretary&#146;s characterisation of the Government as always keen to
deregulate, this is, none the less, a deregulatory
measure.</div>
<a name="08060589000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">We welcome the intention behind
clause 91, which raises the threshold of notification to HMRC of a land
transaction for stamp duty land tax purposes. We also welcome the fact
that the Government have listened to
representations&#151;particularly from the British Property
Federation and the Law Society&#151;that the original wording would
not perhaps have been as successful in reducing the regulatory burden
as was intended. We therefore welcome the fact that the Government have
produced not only the clause, but the amendments.
Indeed, we tabled an amendment on removing the &#163;1,000 rent
requirement that is identical to Government amendment No. 150. Hence,
the entire Conservative Front Bench supports amendment No.
150&#151;such is our enthusiasm for the measure. No doubt, the
Liberal Democrats will make a statement that they are the real
alternative by not putting their name to the
amendment.</div><a name="08060589000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a couple of questions for the Economic Secretary. The first
question is about the requirement of notification for the
&#163;40,000 threshold&#151;chargeable consideration. Given that
SDLT is payable at &#163;125,000 or &#163;150,000&#151;I would be
grateful if the Economic Secretary will confirm that&#151;I assume
that the &#163;40,000 requirement exists to provide the Government
with property-related information, as opposed to being for the
assessment of SDLT. That would enable the Minister for Housing to share
that information with the Cabinet and, indeed, with passing
cartographers.</div> <a name="08060589000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are difficulties in filing a correct SDLT return under section 75A if
the purchaser has no connection with the other parties to the
transaction and therefore cannot obtain the information to complete the
return and self-assessment. I know that representations have been made
to the Treasury on that point, so I should be grateful to know whether
the Government are considering the issue of filing SDLT returns and
whether there are plans to address that concern. In conclusion, we
welcome the clause and the Government&#146;s
amendments.</div><a name="08060589000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000298"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an important point
because there is obviously tension between the need simply to acquire
information about what is happening in the market for a variety of
Government purposes and the genuine desire to deregulate in relation to
the companies and individuals concerned. The implication in his
question is why the notification threshold is not the same as the
threshold for the tax itself. We need the information collected from
notifications to help other Departments, such as the Land Registry and
valuation offices, to make assessments based on data collected from
returns. Even if no tax is collected on the transactions, there is a
requirement in relation to
that.</div><a name="08060589000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment follows on from the abolition of the so-called &#163;600
rule for residential purchases and amends the stamp duty land tax rules
for shared ownership in schedule 9 to the Finance Act 2003. With the
abolition of the &#163;600 rule for residential property, the premium
paid for a shared ownership lease will no longer attract stamp duty
land tax at 1 per cent. when it is below the threshold of
&#163;125,000, or &#163;150,000 in a disadvantaged area. A special
relief then exempts staircasing transactions that do not take the
purchaser beyond an 80 per cent. share of the property.</div>
<a name="08060589000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention
was that shared ownership purchasers would normally pay SDLT only on
purchases that took them beyond 80 per cent. ownership of the property,
but when there is a series of transactions between
the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column519" />Column number: 519</div>same vendor and purchaser, the SDLT linked transactions rules set the
rate of stamp duty on each transaction by reference to the aggregate
consideration given in all the transactions. The premium on a shared
ownership purchase and subsequent staircasing transactions are linked
transactions for that purpose. That means that any purchase of a share
in a shared ownership property that takes the buyer over the SDLT
threshold of &#163;125,000, or &#163;150,000 in a disadvantaged
area, would bring the premium back into charge at 1 per cent., even if
it was below the starting threshold. That is the case even if the
purchase does not give the purchaser an 80 per cent. share in the
property and even though the further transaction is itself not
chargeable because it attracts staircasing relief.</div>
<a name="08060589000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">These matters
are complex, but we have realised that a situation would have been
created that was not the intention of clause 92, so the amendment
disapplies the linked transactions rules as they apply to the premium
paid for a shared ownership lease to keep the premium out of charge
when it is below the starting threshold. The amendment makes a similar
change regarding an initial payment by a beneficiary of a shared
ownership trust that provides shared ownership facilities for
commonhold flats. The amendment will have no Exchequer cost, and I hope
that it has the support of hon. Members on both sides of the
Committee.</div><a name="08060589000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000300"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I thank the Economic Secretary for her clear
explanation of the amendment. I have one question about the clause,
which relaxes the &#163;600 rule that prevents the manipulation of
lease thresholds by entering into leases in which both rent and a
premium are paid. Like many measures, the &#163;600 rule was
introduced as an anti-avoidance measure, and I should like to know what
persuaded the Treasury that it is no longer necessary. What assurances
can the Minister give that the consequence of its repeal will not be
the avoidance behaviour that was the very cause of its
introduction?</div><a name="08060589000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000301"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. We have
decided that the risk of manipulation between premiums and rent to
avoid paying SDLT is much greater for non-residential property than for
residential property. The removal of the &#163;600 rule for
residential properties would bring huge benefits to those purchasing a
property through a shared ownership scheme, by ensuring that in the
vast majority of cases they pay stamp duty land tax only on
transactions that take them beyond 80 per cent. ownership of the
property. We were advised, for example, by the Chartered Institute of
Taxation that retention of the &#163;600 rule for non-residential
property is disproportionate to the level of possible abuse. We are
trying to balance the risks, and we are comfortable that there is no
major incentive to abuse the
provision.</div><a name="08060589000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000304"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I shall speak to the Government amendments, which
in many cases will resolve some of the issues raised by both Opposition
parties. I assume that Opposition Members wish to speak to their own
amendments, so I shall respond to them in detail when they have done
so, rather than pre-empt them. I shall instead explain what we are
trying to do with our amendments, which might lead us on to what other
hon. Members wish to
propose.</div><a name="08060589000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
93 has been introduced to close a loophole that has been widely used to
avoid paying stamp duty land tax. Following its announcement in the
Budget, a number of representations were submitted by the industry
detailing concerns about parts of the operation of the clause. In
particular, there was uncertainty about how the legislation will be
applied in practice and concerns that it might catch innocent
transactions. The legislation is not intended to disadvantage genuine
taxpayers, so the Government amendments have been introduced to ensure
that the legislation operates as intended and to provide the certainty
sought by the
industry.</div><a name="08060589000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
representations suggested that the clause is retrospective, which is
not the case. It is not intended to penalise anyone who has acted on
the basis of existing legislation, so Government amendment No. 158 has
been introduced to ensure that the provision applies only to transfers
of assets occurring after Budget day. Concern was also expressed about
the meaning of &#147;control&#148; in the clause&#151;this may
relate to amendment No. 187, in the name of the Liberal Democrat
Members. The word &#147;control&#148; has been used in this context
for many decades, but it has been suggested that a change in control of
the purchasing company might be inadvertently triggered resulting in a
clawback of group relief. I would expect a property group to take the
necessary legal steps to pre-empt such a possibility, without being
caught by the legislation.</div>
<a name="08060589000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
considered the representations, however, I wish to provide greater
certainty in two specific areas, which might pre-empt some of the
points that may be made. The first point relates to a change in control
arising as a result of refinancing where the finance is not provided by
a bank. Such a finance provider is defined in legislation as a loan
creditor. In certain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column521" />Column number: 521</div>circumstances, financing obtained from a loan creditor would trigger a
change in control, which might present difficulties to groups seeking
refinancing. That is not the Government&#146;s intention, so we have
proposed an amendment to introduce an exclusion that will ensure that
financing obtained from a loan creditor will not result in a change of
control for the purposes of clawing back group relief. We have also
proposed the introduction of a similar exclusion elsewhere in schedule
7 to the Finance Act 2003 to ensure consistency across the group relief
legislation. Those two measures refer to Government amendments Nos. 153
and 154.</div>
<a name="08060589000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments Nos. 155 to 157 are consequential and address the second
area of concern, which is that HMRC might construe the meaning of a
change of control so widely that the change of one shareholder in a
quoted company might result in a change of control and, therefore,
trigger the clawback provision. Similar concerns were raised in
relation to reconstruction relief. I can confirm that we intend to take
the same approach&#151;if control of a publicly owned company changes
as a result of an ordinary market transfer of its shares, there will be
no recovery, because we do not intend to interpret change of control so
widely that simple day-to-day transactions by unconnected minority
shareholders in the stock exchange could trigger a clawback. We will
issue guidance shortly to confirm that
view.</div><a name="08060589000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, the Government amendments will provide the certainty sought
by the industry, while ensuring that the loophole exploited by those
seeking to avoid their share of tax will be closed. The amendments will
have no Exchequer costs or revenue implications and will be welcomed by
a wide range of practitioners and the industry. I shall stop now to
allow others to speak to their amendments and then I will wrap up the
debate.</div><a name="08060589000137"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000305"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I think the Minister dealt with the concerns
raised in amendment No. 187 which stands in my name and that of my hon.
Friend. I tabled  the amendment after I received a letter from
PricewaterhouseCoopers, which was no doubt also sent to the Minister
and Conservative Members. The letter drew attention to a fictional case
study, which was none the less a perfectly reasonable hypothetical
case, and expressed concern that the wide drafting of section 416 would
inadvertently lead to the withdrawal of group relief. I should be
grateful if the Minister could confirm that the example would be
addressed as my amendment would then have achieved its objective. PWC
wrote:</div><a name="08060589000227"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
the top company in a group is owned by three unconnected shareholders
(each holding 40 per cent. 30 per cent. and 30 per cent.), section
416(3) ICTA 1988 would treat them as together controlling the top
company. If one shareholder leaves, they will no longer be considered
as controlling the company &#145;together with others&#146; and
group relief withdrawal will be
triggered.&#148;</div><a name="08060589000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Three
other examples were given in the letter. I appreciate that this is a
complex area, but will the Government amendments address that concern?
PWC also suggested creating a statutory definition of an SDLT group.
Has that, too, been provided for by the
Government?</div><a name="08060589000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000306"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for her
comments. She will be aware that a number of representations have been
made on the clause. It might be helpful if I briefly outline how it is
supposed to work. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column522" />Column number: 522</div>I also have a number of examples where there may be an issue on which I
seek reassurance.</div>
<a name="08060589000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 1
of schedule 7 of the Finance Act 2003 allows companies to claim group
relief on transfers of assets between group members. A restriction
allows clawback when the purchaser ceases to be a member of the same
group as the vendor. For perfectly obvious reasons, the use of group
relief would otherwise be a rather easy way to avoid SDLT. The problem
the Government are seeking to address is that if first the vendor and
then the purchasing company leaves the group, it is no longer possible
to make the
clawback.</div><a name="08060589000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause allows clawback where the vendor leaves the group and then
within three years there is a subsequent change of control of the
purchaser. There was certainly concern about the possibly retrospective
nature of that provision and I am grateful to the Government for
tabling amendment No. 158, which addresses that concern. However, we
are still left with a structure such that if the vendor transfers
property to another group company, the vendor leaves the group and then
there is a change of control of the purchaser, clawback may
occur.</div><a name="08060589000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has addressed one of the concerns that was raised. If the
purchaser was part of a public group, arguably any change in the
shareholders could trigger these provisions, which is not the
Government&#146;s intention. None the less, given the comments made
by the Economic Secretary, there could still be an issue in the event
of the purchaser being part of a public group that is then taken over.
In those circumstances, the effect of a change of control would be a
three-year poison pill for companies that have carried out transactions
of the sort to which we have referred. That may well have some
significance for the liquidity of the stock
market.</div>
<a name="08060589000233"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="08060589000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be grateful if the Minister could confirm that that
interpretation is correct&#151;that the amendments tabled by the
Government will, as well as rightly addressing circumstances where
there is a change of just one shareholder, address circumstances where
the purchaser is part of a group that is taken over.</div>
<a name="08060589000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
where the purchaser is part of a group that is taken over and executive
share options are exercised, could that conceivably trigger a change of
control for these purposes? Equally, a corporate restructuring that
would involve the insertion of a new holding company above the
purchaser but below the top code, would not result in an ultimate
change in economic ownership, but may well be a change of control for
the purposes of clause 93. That is not an uncommon restructuring for a
private company that is preparing for an initial public offering. In
those circumstances, that change of control and therefore clawback
may&#151;perhaps unintentionally&#151;be triggered.</div>
<a name="08060589000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
also circumstances where the purchaser group&#146;s majority
shareholder is a partnership. That is common with regard to private
equity arrangements, which are normally structured through
partnerships, and if there is any change in the partners&#151;the
investors in a particular fund that may be a majority shareholder in
the purchaser&#151;a change of control would be
triggered.</div><a name="08060589000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
such circumstances, I do not think that we are talking about the
mischief that the Government legitimately seek to address. We are
talking not about a tax scheme, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column523" />Column number: 523</div>or some sort of plan to avoid stamp duty land tax, but about something
that is happening as a consequence of the ordinary workings of a
business which may cause particular concerns. There is also an issue,
if we are talking about an entirely legitimate series of transactions,
if the vendor has left the group, no longer has any control over what
happens with regard to the purchaser, and then finds itself ultimately
liable when it was not expecting it. A degree of uncertainty is created
here.</div>
<a name="08060589000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
159 tries to address the matter by limiting these provisions to
arrangements that were made with a view to avoiding stamp duty land tax
effectively, because they were all part of one particular plan. There
are various ways in which that could be addressed, but we have tabled
the wording proposed by the Law Society on the matter. The hon. Member
for Taunton referred to the definition of an SDLT group, which is
another way of addressing that particular matter.</div>
<a name="08060589000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">We remain
concerned that the provisions of clause 93&#151;notwithstanding the
Government amendments, which, in themselves, are welcome&#151;are too
limited. In particular, the reference to lone creditors does not, as
far as we can see, address the circumstances that I have outlined.
Perhaps the Economic Secretary can provide some clarification.
Therefore, we are not yet satisfied that the concerns, which, I think
the Government recognise, are legitimate, have been
addressed.</div>
<a name="08060589000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sadly, the
hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) is not part of
the Committee proceedings this year. He was for the previous two years.
He was always keen to point out that he disliked beginning a paragraph
with the word, &#147;But&#148;. He would consistently object to it.
In his absence, I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to clause 93(4)
and proposed new paragraph 4ZA(4) of schedule 7 to the Finance Act
2003, which begins with that word. I am also not sure that Government
amendment No. 153, which
ends</div><a name="08060589000228"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(but
see sub-paragraph

the most elegantly drafted. I make those points in honour of the hon.
Member for Wolverhampton, South-West&#151;people in my party quote
him quite a lot at the moment&#151;but I would be grateful if the
Economic Secretary addressed my main concerns with clause
93.</div><a name="08060589000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000307"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. In paying that tribute, the hon.
Gentleman has simultaneously, craftily, crept into a stand part
discussion. I must warn the Committee that if there are any remarks to
be made in a stand part debate, they should be made at this
point.</div>
<a name="08060589000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060589000308"></a><b class="B">Peter
Viggers</b> (Gosport) (Con): If I have appeared so far to

because I have not been following the debate with keen interest. On
several occasions, I have been minded to table amendments similar to
those tabled by Conservative Front Benchers, so I congratulate them on
the solid and professional job that they are doing of criticising the

<a name="08060589000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
frivolous to complain about the language. &#147;But&#148; and
&#147;see&#148; are not very good lawyerly words&#151;they are a
little casual&#151;so I hope that my hon. Friend&#146;s comment
will be fed into the well oiled Treasury
machine.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column524" />Column number: 524</div><a name="08060589000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060589000309"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): Given
your point on stand part remarks, Mr. Cook, I should like
briefly to say that the amendments would be quite sensible. In fairness
to the Government, they have tried to deal with a number of concerns
with the clause with their own
amendments.</div>
<a name="08060589000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
make this narrow point. We understand the Government&#146;s desire to
ensure that the changes come into play when there is a withdrawal of
group relief. Equally, the notions of change of control and group
relief in the modern commercial world are changing. As the Economic
Secretary will be aware, the emergence of private equity funds and the
way in which they operate are changing, and the welcome prevalence of
executive share option schemes brings into play a range of new
organisations within business that could fall foul of what might
traditionally have been regarded as a change of control by group relief
provisions.</div>
<a name="08060589000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Economic Secretary will give a satisfactory answer even if she does
not accept the Opposition amendment, and that she will be able to give
a broader overview. Many of the professional advisers who have
contacted us fear that the clause will go far wider. Will she assuage
their
concerns?</div><a name="08060589000157"></a>

he will be delighted that his concerns have been raised by Opposition

recorded in <i class="I">Hansard</i>.</div>
<a name="08060589000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer to
the two questions asked by the hon. Member for Taunton is yes. We are
addressing both issues that were raised by PricewaterhouseCoopers. It
is probably obvious from my earlier comments that the Government have
benefited from a close dialogue with various industry bodies, and I
place my thanks to them on the
record.</div><a name="08060589000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire raised the commonly described
concern that the withdrawal of relief will represent a poison pill for
the property industry. That is why the clause will make amendments to
the Finance Act 2003 to ensure that the legislation will affect only
those transactions that occur after 13 March this year. Anyone using
the exemption will now be aware of the potential consequences should
there be a change in control of the purchasing company within three
years of the transfer of the assets. I hope that that explanation
answers the
point.</div><a name="08060589000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s substantive question was: why are we seeking
clawback of SDLT group relief in circumstances where there is no
disposal of a property-holding company by the group? Without the vendor
exemption, group relief would have been withdrawn at the point that the
vendor left the group. We believe that it is reasonable that we should
seek to withdraw where there is a change in control of the purchasing
company. The asset within the purchasing company would then 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column525" />Column number: 525</div>be owned by someone else. It is exactly the same if a group is sold.
There is still a change in the ownership of the asset. To suggest that
one scenario is acceptable and the other is not, ignores the reality of
the situation. That is why our proposal is as it is. He is within his
rights to oppose the clause if he thinks that we are handling the
matter
incorrectly.</div><a name="08060589000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will discuss the arrangements test and amendment No. 159 that the hon.
Gentleman tabled with text suggested by the Law Society. The Law
Society also expressed concern to us that the clause will catch
innocent transactions and create uncertainty for taxpayers who do not
engage in tax avoidance. Amendment No. 159 deals with the involvement
of such transactions. It is not clear to us, however, that the
arrangements test would ensure that all the scenarios presented by the
Law Society would be excluded, nor would we wish that to be the case in
all
situations.</div><a name="08060589000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
arrangements test has been suggested as a method of distinguishing
between what are regarded as commercial transactions and tax-avoidance
schemes. Indeed, many of the commercial scenarios presented use the
same loophole that has been exploited for avoidance purposes. It has
only been by exploiting the existing legislation that groups have been
able to avoid the withdrawal of group relief in the
past.</div><a name="08060589000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 159 would open potential avoidance possibilities. For example, it
would require HMRC to demonstrate that arrangements are in place for
the control of the purchaser, but not the vendor. It would be
relatively easy for avoidance schemes to devise around that test, thus
reducing the effectiveness of the clause. We also feel that
arrangements tests are difficult to administer and create uncertainty
in the industry. Clearance application requests to HMRC would also
increase as groups sought to obtain certainty that they would not be
caught.</div><a name="08060589000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that we have already addressed the Law Society&#146;s main
concern with the Government amendment to ensure that legislation will
apply only to transactions after 13 March. We have introduced a further
amendment to exclude loan creditors from the changing control tests.
The Government amendments were requested in representations and we feel
that they will assist industry without traducing the effectiveness of
the clause. Its effectiveness would be traduced if we accepted
amendment No. 159 and I invite members of the Committee to resist
it.</div><a name="08060589000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000313"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> May I address the comments made by the Economic
Secretary? On the issue of the poisoned pill, as in my earlier comments
I acknowledge that this measure is not retrospective in the sense that
it relates only to transactions after 13 March. However, there is still
an issue of the poisoned pill. For example, it is still possible for a
transaction to occur when the vendor leaves a group and there is a
subsequent change in control of the purchaser. There would still be a
poisoned pill event in that circumstance. The concern therefore
remains.</div><a name="08060589000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Economic Secretary stated that the asset will be owned by somebody else
because there will be a change in control of the property. She did not
address my example of a new holding company being inserted into a
group. As I understand it, that will still constitute a change of
control, even though the economic ownership will remain exactly the
same. As far as I can see, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column526" />Column number: 526</div>concern about private equity funds raised by my hon. Friend the Member
for Cities of London and Westminster has not been
addressed.</div><a name="08060589000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000314"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I apologise for my oversight in not addressing the
point raised by the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster,
who was concerned that private equity would be adversely affected. We
do not think that that is the case and would be concerned if it were.
Like all groups in the property industry, private equity will need to
consider the clause when a vendor leaves the group. To clarify the
matter, we intend to work with the industry to produce guidance that we
hope will put any of those concerns to rest and provide the reassurance
that is sought. That will take
place.</div><a name="08060589000234"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="08060589000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000315"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful for that intervention, although it
was more of an assertion that the measure will not affect private
equity firms rather than evidence that it will not. As we shall see
later, the Government are relying on guidance rather than statute. I am
not persuaded by the Economic Secretary with regard to flaws in
amendment No. 159. An arrangements test would, I think, address the
Government&#146;s legitimate concern and would not cause the problems
that I have identified. I am inclined to push amendment No. 159 to a
vote and will not seek leave to withdraw it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060589000339"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I have only one brief point to make about the
clause, which aims to restrict the scope of the anti-avoidance measures
introduced in the Finance Act 2007 by ensuring that when there is a
transfer of an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column528" />Column number: 528</div>interest in a property within an investment partnership, there will be
no charge to SDLT. The measure will be retrospective and take effect
for transactions that occurred on or after 19 July 2007. The concern
that the anti-avoidance provisions will apply more than the Government
intended, with regard to an interest in a property within an investment
partnership, was made at some length this time last year in Committee
by my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs.
Villiers), and in an intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for
Ludlow (Mr. Dunne).</div>
<a name="08060589000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
represents one of those occasions when the concerns that they and
various professional groups raised have been recognised. On the one
hand, I welcome the Treasury&#146;s recognition of those concerns,
but this time last year, it was apparent that the legislation in the
2007 Finance Bill was flawed and would have an unfortunate effect. As a
consequence, there has been a period of uncertainty, and I just wanted
to put on record that it is regrettable that clause 94 is necessary
because of flaws in last year&#146;s legislation. They were known to
the professionals and to the equivalent Committee last year.</div>
