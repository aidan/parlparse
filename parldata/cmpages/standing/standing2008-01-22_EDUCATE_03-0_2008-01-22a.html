(Con): Thank you very much for coming to give evidence.
Referring to part 4 of the Education and Skills Bill, what is
registration and regulation of schools? How does it differ from the
inspection role and why are the Independent Schools Inspectorate and
the Independent Schools Council unhappy with the proposal to transfer
the registration and regulation of independent schools from the
Department for Children, Schools and Families to
Ofsted?</div>
					<a name="08012460000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Jonathan
Shephard:
							</b>
						</i> Firstly, it is a matter of principle. I
think it is desirable for legislation to be done on the basis of facts
and not fiction. If you look at the regulatory impact assessment, page
14, under the title &#147;Analysis and Evidence&#148;, it
says,</div>
					<a name="08012460000231"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Independent schools
will benefit from only dealing with Ofsted.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>
					<a name="08012460000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">But that is untrue in
respect of more than 80 per cent of the children in independent
education in England who will deal not only with Ofsted but with the
ISI.</div>
					<a name="08012460000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a matter of
principle, it is very important that inspection and regulation should
be separated. Inspections can be wrong. Inspectors can make mistakes.
It is important that when they go to a regulator to say that there is a
problem with the school, the regulator has the power of decision to say
what should be done because that is a necessary check and balance. If
the inspector goes to itself, that check and balance is not
there.</div>
					<a name="08012460000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conversely, if
the regulator is told&#151;by members of the public or others, as
does happen&#151;that there are concerns about a school, it is
important that the regulator should be able to direct the inspector to
go into the school and sort out the problem. If the inspector and the
regulator are the same body, that may not happen because the inspector
may decide not to direct itself, because it may think there is no
problem. So the separation of powers is really important, and the
rationale behind the whole of these proposals does not exist, because
it is based on a complete misunderstanding of what happens on the
ground.</div>

						<i class="I">

								Christine
Ryan:
							</b>
						</i> It might be helpful if I just make a
distinction between the registration function and inspection.
Registration occurs when schools want to set up as independent schools.
Now, they must be registered with the Department, and that means they
apply to be registered as independent schools. They then have an
initial inspection to check their suitability to operate as independent
schools.</div>
					<a name="08012460000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
inspection function is one that occurs routinely on a rolling programme
and that inspection function is not carried out by the Department or
the regulator. Inspection is carried out either by Ofsted for
independent schools, or by ISI for the vast majority of the children in
independent schools, or by another approved inspectorate that looks
after schools that are members of the Focus Learning Trust&#151;I
think there are 26 members at the moment. There is a distinction
between what happens now with the Department, which is the body by
which schools register, the regulator, and the interpreter of the
regulations for the inspectorates, and what happens in terms of
inspection and ongoing inspection&#151;the quality assurance side of
what happens on a routine basis on the rolling programme for all the
schools. Those two things are quite
different.</div>

Ofsted?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Christine
Ryan:
							</b>
						</i> Well, I think there are two things here. One is
that a lot of the thrust of the proposals repeats the desire to create
a single unified strand of registration, regulation and inspection. Now
of course that will only occur&#151;if the proposals are put in
place&#151;for independent schools inspected by Ofsted, which have
only 20 per cent of the pupils educated in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>independent schools. The vast majority of them will
still be inspected by the ISI. So even if the proposals come in, you
will not have a single unified strand of registration, regulation and
inspection; you will still have a division across two bodies. One of
the thrusts of these proposals reflects the desire to create a unified
body, but that will not occur, because they will still be inspected
either by ISI, or by the Focus Learning Trust, or any other approved
inspectorate that comes forward in the
future.</div>
					<a name="08012460000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why does
it matter which body is acting as the regulator? At
the moment, of course, as an inspectorate, we liaise with and have very
good links with the independent schools team in the Department. One of
the very important functions that we carry out is to check on
regulatory compliance of independent schools. The regulations&#151;as
is the nature of the beast&#151;are often open to some
interpretation. If a school challenges whether or not regulatory
compliance is there or not and we want to be sure, we can go to the
Department and we agree a decision on interpretation, say, of
regulations on a particular matter.</div>
					<a name="08012460000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">That link and that contact with
the Department works very smoothly&#151;it has a dedicated team who
know our system very well. Ofsted is already having to cope with a very
large number of changes from the other duties it has taken on. If this
transfer happens now, we are concerned about the loss of that
communication. We often deal with problems that are happening in real
time&#151;while inspections are going on, perhaps. It is crucial that
you are able to liaise properly with the regulator, so that you are
giving correct information to schools and that you are supporting
inspectors who are out in the
field.</div>

Cabinet office guidelines in that ISI, an important stakeholder, was
not consulted as it should have been, in advance of the consultation

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): In some of your written
evidence, there is a suggestion that some of the concerns about
Ofsted&#146;s greater involvement are down to what is described as a
one-size-fits-all approach that might not be suitable for independent
schools. Could you say a little more about those concerns and how they
might impact on the ground in terms of their effect on the
schools?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Jonathan
Shephard:
							</b>
						</i> Christine is the expert on this, so I shall
give a very brief answer. There is a concern about creeping regulation
and Ofsted-isation. The management standard, which came completely out
of the blue, is particularly worrying because, if you have Ofsted
imposing a management standard on all independent schools, then the way
in which the schools are run will tend to conform with that standard.
You may or may not like independent schools&#151;there are perfectly
valid views held on either side&#151;but they do educate children at
all levels of ability in a very good, effective and workmanlike way.
They do that because they are able to be flexible and responsive and
they have to answer to three demanding constituencies: parents,
children and universities. If you get a one-size-fits-all, increasingly
prescriptive manner from Ofsted, which is beginning to set criteria for
qualifications of staff, you may lose that flexibility and independence
and that is a very serious
worry.</div>
					<a name="08012460000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Christine
Ryan:
							</b>
						</i> In terms of the one-size-fits-all approach, it
is important that people are aware of the difference between the two
approaches to inspection. Ofsted&#146;s remit on inspection has
changed over the years as schools have matured in the inspection
process, and as Ofsted has taken on different roles. Whereas Ofsted and
ISI inspections were at one time very similar in what they did, they
are now quite different. Ofsted has transferred a lot of the things
that used to happen on inspection out to other bodies, such as local
authorities, regional inspection service providers and so on. ISI still
has an inspection set-up where school improvement is an integral part
of the inspection process.</div>
					<a name="08012460000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both Ofsted and ISI carry out
checks for regulatory compliance&#151;we check schools&#146;
compliance with the independent schools standards, so we both do the
regulatory bit. Ofsted does not do a great deal beyond the regulatory
sections because they are dealing with a whole range of schools, not
just those in the independent sector. However, our inspections are
specifically tailored to the very varied set-ups that we find in the
independent group. The starting point, for example, for an ISI
inspection is the particular aims of the school, so one of the things
that we judge schools against are their own aims&#151;what it is that
they claim to do. Judgments will be made in the report, so that parents
can see whether the school is fulfilling what it claims to
offering.</div>

						</i> From an inspectorate point of view, my main
concern is a procedural one. At the moment, it is very clear that if
independent schools&#151;even if they are members of the ISC, which
would normally fall under our remit&#151;have approved status, they
are by definition inspected by Ofsted. It is very straightforward: even
if they are ISC schools, if they have approved status, they are
inspected by Ofsted. We all know where we are with that. Once the
approved status is removed, my concern, from an inspection point of
view, is that there may be schools in that category where it is not
clear who should be their inspectorate. For my part, I would say that
it needs to be clearly defined.</div>
					<a name="08012460000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill talks about schools
that have children who are statemented, but it needs to be very
specific about where the trigger point is&#151;when the school
becomes one that needs to be inspected by Ofsted because it is like the
former approved-status schools, or when it becomes a school that needs
to be inspected by the ISI.

probably follow some form of inspection or peer review of what had been

what the ISI does&#151;to inspect and, in a sense, to
investigate&#151;and it is quite right for Ofsted then to produce a
report setting out its views. For probably 99 per cent. of the time,
you would have no disagreement, yet there will be genuine disagreement

used. May I give you an example of what happens at
the moment? There are different sets of regulations that affect
independent schools. There are three sets of different standards:
regulations; independent schools standards regulations; and the
standards relating to boarding welfare and so on. The way in which
those regulations are interpreted on the ground in inspection is
slightly different depending on whether you are looking at it from a
boarding welfare inspection point of view or an education inspection
point of view. At the moment, you can have two different teams in the
same school, one inspecting boarding welfare and one inspecting
education. Each team is looking at different sets of regulations and
coming to different conclusions about the same sort of provision. That
cannot be a good idea.</div>

the regulator for the early years sector&#151;we inspect and regulate
it. That has worked very well so it seemed to us that it fitted well
with other work that we do. We also felt that there would be efficiency
gains, because at the moment, in the registration process for
independent schools, the Department always relies on our advice through
inspection as to whether or not we should register. So, if we were
giving ourselves the advice, as it were, that would cut out some
paperwork and bureaucracy. We saw it as efficiency in deregulatory

has difficulty are children&#146;s homes that provide education as
well as care. Some of them are catering for children with special
educational needs. These are the sorts of schools that have most
problems. Last year we had only 6 per cent. of the schools that we

institutions that do not belong to the Independent Schools Council,
they would have one inspection body looking at child care, education

moment because the boarding inspections only came over to us in April.
Those that the ISI inspects, we are also working with them to make sure

proportionate way: for example, we only monitor a small proportion of
the ISI inspections; it is a well-established inspectorate. Last year,
that was 10 per cent. of inspections and about 15 per cent. of reports.
We also looked at some of their quality assurance mechanisms. Our
report was based on that. We monitored more of the inspections of the
Schools Inspection Service, which inspects for the Focus Learning
Trust. We made sure that we monitored all of its lead inspectors, for
example, because they were a new inspectorate. So we take, and will
continue to take, a proportionate approach. As I understand it, the
point of the Bill is to give public assurance that any inspectorate set
up to inspect independent schools is providing a good service and is
inspecting at the required standard. We would provide that by our
monitoring.</div>
