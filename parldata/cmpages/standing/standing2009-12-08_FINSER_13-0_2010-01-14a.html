<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000233"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton,
for the Committee&#146;s penultimate sitting. I wish to make some
preliminary remarks about the clause and what it seeks to achieve,
which I believe is important. I shall then discuss the amendments. I
suspect that it may also be a stand part debate, as I have some
detailed questions about other parts of the clause.</div>
<a name="10011437000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 was introduced, a clear
structure was put in place to give adequate protection to consumers.
The Financial Services Agency is responsible for regulating the conduct
of firms; the Financial Ombudsman Service deals with individual
complaints; and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme provides
protection in the event of insolvency.</div>
<a name="10011437000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 404
of that Act provided a mechanism by which groups of complaints could be
resolved. It recognised the fact that although the ombudsman service
dealt with individual complaints, a mechanism was needed to deal with
instances of widespread mis-selling. We heard examples of that in
earlier sittings.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 415</div><a name="10011437000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 404
provided for a review of past business. It contained important
provisions that allowed the Treasury to decide whether there had been a
widespread failure on the part of authorised persons. The Treasury
could authorise a scheme to determine the nature and extent of that
failure, establish the liability of authorised persons to make
concession payments and determine the amounts payable by way of
compensation. Significant provisions were in place to facilitate
collective redress.</div>
<a name="10011437000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The White
Paper described the provisions as</div>
<a name="10011437000188"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;powers to
impose redress schemes on a firm-by-firm basis where a large number of
consumers are
affected.&#148;</div><a name="10011437000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that section 404 has never been used. Indeed, Which? said in
its
submission:</div><a name="10011437000189"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At
present the FSA is only able to order past business review if it
attains an order in Parliament. The process is burdensome, and it is
apparent that the industry does not consider the threat of activation
to be realistic. Despite numerous episodes of mis-selling by the
financial services industry, the powers have never been used. Allowing
the FSA to take direct action will create a more credible
deterrent.&#148;</div><a name="10011437000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know that the powers in section 404 have never been used, but has the
FSA ever asked the Government to exercise those powers?</div>
<a name="10011437000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">As section
404 has not been used, there is a vacuum. What happens if consumers
make a series of claims about a firm or type of product? The reality is
that the vacuum has been filled by the Financial Ombudsman Service,
which, effectively, has administered compensation for mis-selling if
there has been a significant number of claims. It has been going beyond
its remit of dealing only with single claims. That is not satisfactory
from the ombudsman&#146;s perspective, nor from the perspective of
the industry or consumers.</div>
<a name="10011437000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need an
effective mechanism to allow redress for a large number of claimants.
That is the reason for the provisions in clause 26, which replace those
in section 404. The proposed new section 404 seeks to
modernise the procedure and, importantly, to ensure that it
works.</div>
<a name="10011437000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The White
Paper, &#147;Reforming financial markets&#148;,
states:</div><a name="10011437000190"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government proposes to update FSMA with new powers to make redress
powers more effective and capable of use in a wider set of
circumstances. One option for achieving this is to give the FSA the
power to establish a review of past business failure, without requiring
the involvement of the Treasury or Parliament as FSMA currently
requires.&#148;</div><a name="10011437000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the thrust of the new section 404.</div>
<a name="10011437000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
powers will be far-reaching and easier to deploy, albeit at the expense
of Treasury and parliamentary approval and scrutiny. As to where the
provisions fit within the architecture, consumer redress schemes should
follow where regulation and practitioner schemes fail. I should hope
that they would come before collective proceedings, which were the
subject of a clause that we debated on Tuesday. We would expect that if
a regulator noticed a situation in which there was systemic failure
affecting a product or customer, the powers under  clause 26
would be used, which would pre-empt the need for consumers to have
resort to the
courts.</div><a name="10011437000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is right that consumers should have adequate redress where there has
been widespread mis-selling. If the current regime is not being used,
it is important to try to improve on it. Andrew Whittaker, the
FSA&#146;s general 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column416" />Column number: 416</div>counsel, made some relevant points in giving evidence to the Committee,
when he contrasted the old and new
powers:</div><a name="10011437000191"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;They
involve quite a complex process of an assessment by the FSA, a report
to the Treasury, and then a parliamentary process. This is a more
direct process involving standard rule-making by the FSA. We think that
it will be speedier and more flexible than the process that is
currently in the
legislation.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Financial Services Public Bill Committee, </i>8 December 2009; c. 35,
Q85.]</div><a name="10011437000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
old system built in fairly robust safeguards, in that the Treasury and
Parliament had to approve the scheme. That set a very high hurdle for
the FSA and, I suspect, contributed to the fact that the powers were
not used. If we are to give the FSA the new powers, which do not
involve Treasury or parliamentary approval, the question is what
safeguards are build into the process. We need to bear in mind that the
cost of redress, not just in relation to compensation, but in relation
to the work that will be needed to review past business and come up
with and administer a scheme, could run into hundreds of millions of
pounds and affect the viability of a firm. Those are not insignificant
sums, and I think that firms and consumers expect a proper process to
be in place to protect their
interests.</div><a name="10011437000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
are the safeguards? First, any scheme would have to undergo the
FSA&#146;s usual rule-making process. That is a requirement in new
section 404(3). Secondly, the scheme takes on some characteristics of
an enforcement process, under section 404A(8)&#151;the rules can
include provision for warning and decision notices and an appeal to the
tribunal&#151;if the rules under section 404A(1)(k) are made. Those
are the rules that give power to the FSA, rather than the relevant
firm, to investigate the
matter.</div><a name="10011437000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are some safeguards in the process, but the final sanction is, as
Andrew Whittaker told us in Committee,</div>
<a name="10011437000192"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a judicial
review by any affected party on the basis that we had misdirected
ourselves about what a court would be likely to decide. That will be
quite a high hurdle for us to get over, and we will need to do our best
to do so.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Financial
Services Public Bill Committee, </i>8 December 2009; c. 35,
Q86.]</div><a name="10011437000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is, as the final safeguard, recourse to judicial review, and given the
amounts that could potentially be involved, it is clear that firms may
choose to resort to that
process.</div><a name="10011437000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
British Bankers Association has suggested as an
alternative:</div><a name="10011437000193"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Given
that the circumstances in which these new provisions might apply will
never be clear cut, it seems only logical that an independent party
should review all sides of the issue, however this has not been built
into the legislation. The FSA will be given largely autonomous powers
to draft rules, supervise compliance, consider enforcement action and
take potentially retrospective action with no mechanism to challenge
its decision, outside judicial
review.&#148;</div><a name="10011437000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thus
under the rules set out in clause 26 the FSA is in the position of a
court. It goes beyond simply acting as a court: it investigates, judges
and sentences authorised firms, without an independent check.</div>
<a name="10011437000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be
under no illusion about the complexity of the cases. Where there is no
legal certainty, the FSA will need to use its own processes to ensure
that it is as robust in reviewing a case as a court system would be.
One need think only of the case about bank charges  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>that went through the courts recently. Effectively, it was resolved in
the Supreme Court, and the FSA would have to internalise that process
in its operations.</div>
<a name="10011437000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendments
would remove some of the uncertainty and minimise the risk of judicial
review by ensuring that there is court approval for a redress scheme.
That would act as a safeguard. In the amendments that I tabled on the
previous group of clauses on collective proceedings, my objective was
to make sure that there were proper safeguards to ensure that orders
were used appropriately, and the same thinking is behind these
amendments. I want to ensure that there is a proper process and that
there is an independent check on the FSA&#146;s actions. The
objective is to ensure that people have confidence in the process that
the FSA would go through.</div>
<a name="10011437000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">What are the
benefits of court approval for a redress scheme? A requirement for
court-based approval would ensure that decisions were taken by legal
experts with complete impartiality and no risk of conflict of interest;
that interactions with the Human Rights Act 1998 were fully taken into
account when such decisions were made, thus providing an equitable
justice mechanism; that we had full and impartial consideration of a
firm&#146;s arguments, based on their legal merits, rather than the
narrow test applied on judicial review, which might not allow
sufficient scope for challenge; that there was a full and impartial
legal assessment of the arguments and the evidence presented by all
parties to the proceedings; and that the court could give direction
where required, subject to the scheme coming into force.</div>
<a name="10011437000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would permit consumer redress schemes to be put in place
swiftly, but with an important procedural safeguard: the requirement
for the scheme to be approved by the court. That would provide for
greater certainty and independent oversight of the scheme. Indeed, when
we quizzed Mr. Whittaker on the application of the consumer
redress proposals, he
said:</div><a name="10011437000194"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
process of this kind could be useful after a court
decision.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Financial
Services Public Bill Committee, </i>9 December 2009; c. 35,
Q87.]</div><a name="10011437000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">He was
referring particularly to the bank charges case.</div>
<a name="10011437000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 70
to 73 would replace references to rules with references to scheme
orders. Those orders are covered in more detail in amendment 74, which
defines an order as being primarily the rules under which a consumer
will be compensated. There is also a requirement to notify relevant
firms and an opportunity to make an application to the court to amend
the order. The basis on which the court should approve a scheme is that
it would be the most appropriate form of redress, would be fair and
would comply with new section 404A.</div>
<a name="10011437000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 81
provides for new rules for the court to use on receipt of an
application for a consumer redress scheme, mirroring the provision in
previous clauses that provided that court rules would be put in place
to enable the collective proceedings order to work. The amendment also
outlines the criteria that the court should use to approve the scheme.
In addition, to ensure that matters are resolved quickly, proposed new
section 404AA(2)(a) includes the criterion that cases should be heard
and determined expeditiously.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div><a name="10011437000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
should improve the new provisions and give us the best of both worlds.
We need to ensure that new section 404 is made more relevant and up to
date so that the power can be used by the FSA and represents a credible
deterrent and a credible process for compensating consumers, while
ensuring that proper safeguards are in place. That is the thrust of the

want to refer to a number of questions that have been raised about new
section 404, but which are  not covered in my amendments. At
the moment, new section 404(1)(a) applies
if</div><a name="10011437000195"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
appears to the Authority that there may have been a widespread or
regular failure by relevant firms to comply with requirements
applicable to the carrying on by them of any
activity&#148;.</div><a name="10011437000185"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">What
is missing is a reference to the authority having evidence, and a
reference to the relevant firms not having complied with the
requirements of the authority&#146;s rules. We are worried that the
FSA will be able to instigate a consumer address scheme without
evidence of a widespread regulatory failure by
firms.</div>
<a name="10011437000206"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="10011437000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Bill is drafted, the power will significantly reduce the burden of
proof required to establish a review of past business. It would enable
the FSA to oppose past business reviews on firms and implement
compensation schemes for whole classes of customers, even if it had
little or no evidence of consumers having suffered significant
detriment. That would be costly to providers and offer no benefit to
consumers. If the clause was more tightly drafted to required
evidential standards to demonstrate that the firm has not complied with
the requirements of the authority&#146;s rules, it would make it
clear in what circumstances the powers would be used and demonstrate
that there was clearly a reason for such
action.</div><a name="10011437000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come now to new section 404(1)(b) and the words &#147;or may
suffer&#148;, which mean that the new section could be invoked purely
in the belief that consumers may suffer loss or damage. Such a belief
is speculative. Neither the fact nor the quantum of such a loss or
damage could be established until it had actually occurred. What is the
purpose of including &#147;or may suffer&#148; in the provision
because it seems to be going beyond the situation of those who have
actually suffered
loss?</div><a name="10011437000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
section 404(7)
states:</div><a name="10011437000196"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the firm determines that the failure has caused (or may cause) loss or
damage to consumers, it must then&#148;.</div>
<a name="10011437000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would require a
firm to speculate whether&#151;and if so, to what extent&#151;any
action on its part might have caused loss or damage to consumers or may
cause loss or damage at some point in the future. Neither the fact nor
the quantum of such a loss or damage could be established unless and
until it had actually occurred. Should we not be in a position when the
power is applied only to the extent to which there is evidence of loss
or damage having been suffered by consumers as a direct consequence of
the actions of the firm and within the firm&#146;s control? We need
to be clear about what the Government are trying to achieve with such
loose wording under the proposed subsection.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 419</div><a name="10011437000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">New section
404A(1)(b) states that rules may make
provision</div><a name="10011437000197"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;setting
out, in relation to any specified description of case, examples of
things done, or omitted to be done, that are to be regarded as
constituting a failure to comply with a
requirement&#148;.</div><a name="10011437000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has been suggested that the use of &#147;examples&#148; provides
too much latitude and uncertainty in the scope of the scheme, which
could extend beyond the examples actually cited. It might be
appropriate to tighten the wording and perhaps, rather than paragraph
(b), have something along the lines of &#147;setting out, in relation
to any specified description of case, things done, or omitted to be
done, which constitute a failure to comply with a requirement of the
Authority&#146;s rules.&#148; That would tighten up the
scheme&#146;s rules so that we know exactly what the firm has
done.</div><a name="10011437000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
next point concerns the role of the ombudsman, about which I have a
later amendment. In new section 404B(4), there appears to be
a double jeopardy. A complainant can not only be covered by the
consumer redress process but can also make a complaint to the
ombudsman. If consumers are covered by the redress scheme, they should
be able to apply only to that scheme and not also be covered by the
ombudsman
service.</div><a name="10011437000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill says that a consumer who is subject to the consumer redress scheme
can make a complaint to the ombudsman. My later amendment deals with
the parameters around which a complaint can be made. However, if a
consumer is unhappy with the redress scheme, given that it has been
proposed by the FSA, should not the complaint about the application of
the scheme be made to the FSA rather than to the ombudsman, since the
scheme is being made under FSA rules? The argument might be that the
complaint ordinarily goes to the ombudsman when a consumer is unhappy
with what a firm has done. That is the normal process. Where a firm is
applying a scheme established by the FSA, it is odd that the complaint
goes to the ombudsman and not to the FSA as the originator of the
scheme&#146;s rules. In such a case it would be appropriate for the
complaint to be made to the FSA rather than to the
ombudsman.</div><a name="10011437000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
there is a definition of the meaning of &#147;consumers&#148; on
page 32 of the Bill. One can understand that someone who has entered
into a transaction should be covered by the redress scheme, but what
happens when people have merely &#147;contemplated&#148; a
transaction? How should they be covered by the redress scheme? For
instance, I might think about buying payment protection insurance. It
has been offered to me, but I did not take it up because I thought it
was a complete waste of money. However, the fact that I contemplated
taking it up might mean that I had a complaint under the redress
scheme, so I am not clear why those who might merely think about buying
a product should be covered by the redress scheme. It should be focused
on those who  have actually bought a product. Can the
Minister  clarify the inclusion of &#147;may have
contemplated&#148; in new section
404D(1)?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000234"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I call the next speaker, may I say to the
Committee that the question of clause stand part has already been
extensively referred to. It might be appropriate if we include
discussion on clause 26 in the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div>next group of amendments, so will members of the Committee bear that in
mind? The vote on clause 26 will be put direct to the
Committee.</div>
<a name="10011437000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000235"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> I, too,
welcome you to this penultimate sitting, Mr. Benton. I will
explain to the Committee in general terms the importance of the new
power for the FSA to make rules requiring firms to establish consumer
redress
schemes.</div><a name="10011437000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
your instructions, Mr. Benton, I will start by explaining
broadly the purpose of the clause, which it is twofold. First, we
believe that it will provide better routes to redress in cases of
widespread mis-selling or other scandals, contributing to the
restoration of consumer confidence in financial services. Secondly, it
will provide a regulatory alternative to large numbers of consumers
bringing claims before the ombudsman or the
courts.</div><a name="10011437000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
FSA already has powers to impose redress schemes on individual firms,
but its power to deal with a widespread failure is insufficient. The
hon. Member for Fareham pointed out that the existing power in section
404 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 has never been used,
and I can confirm that the FSA has not approached the Government with
the intention of doing so. That is partly because the scope of the
power is limited to compliance with regulatory rules, whereas failures
often involve a mix of breaches of general law as well as FSA rules.
The power also requires the approval of both the Treasury and
Parliament, which sets a high threshold for action, as he
noted.</div>
<a name="10011437000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a shame
that the hon. Member for Chichester is not here. I admit that I have
not taken the opportunity to review the debates from 2000 on the
Financial Services and Markets Bill, so I do not know whether he warned
us at the time that the powers involved an incredible hurdle and would
never be used. The practical reality is that we probably did not get it
right in the Bill in 2000 and made the power unlikely ever to be used,
thereby creating a gap. That emerged clearly in the responses to the
consultation.</div><a name="10011437000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
26 provides for the FSA itself to make rules requiring firms to
establish and operate consumer redress schemes. It will be able to act
in cases of widespread failure by firms to comply with legal or
regulatory requirements. Consumer redress schemes will involve firms
investigating their past business, assessing their liability in
accordance with the rules governing the scheme and making redress where
it is due. The clause will therefore enable firms and the regulator to
deal quickly and efficiently with large-scale cases of mis-selling or
other failures that have caused detriment to
consumers.</div><a name="10011437000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Fareham would alter the basis
on which the FSA could act by requiring the FSA to apply to the court
for a consumer redress order, passing on decisions about whether to
introduce a consumer redress scheme from the FSA to the courts. The
courts would apply certain tests before approving a scheme. Anyone
would be able to appeal an order to a higher court or go back to the
court that made the order to seek an amendment.</div>
<a name="10011437000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am simply
not persuaded that the court is the best party to take a decision that
is the preserve of the regulator. The decision to establish a scheme is
an extension of the FSA&#146;s normal regulatory remit, and in my
view, it is properly the role of the regulator, not the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 421</div>court, to make such decisions. The court does not have the same degree
of specialist knowledge as the regulator; its established role is to
check whether the FSA has exercised its powers lawfully and in line
with its FSMA responsibilities. Courts should not be asked to make an
ex ante assessment of the merits of regulatory action. I believe that
the amendments would lead to a significant departure from the current
regulatory and judicial framework and relationships.</div>
<a name="10011437000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">We envisage
that under clause 26, where the FSA believes that there has been
widespread legal or regulatory failure by firms, it should have the
power to require firms to carry out an investigation. The FSA itself
will not, in general, carry out investigations or determine liability;
it will be for the firms to do so in accordance with the rules made by
the FSA. That seems a purely regulatory
matter.</div><a name="10011437000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000236"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> In the Minister&#146;s view, where there is
uncertainty whether there has been a breach of regulation or law, what
safeguard in the process will give certainty?</div>
<a name="10011437000207"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div>
<a name="10011437000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000237"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will come on to safeguards in a moment. The
hon. Gentleman will be aware of judicial review processes that can
already be
applied.</div><a name="10011437000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Involving
the court is likely to be burdensome, and the likelihood of firms
appealing adverse decisions or applying for amendments to orders will
work against the speedy facilitation of redress for consumers. It is
important to remember that the schemes are intended for the most
serious and widespread cases of mis-selling or other failures by firms
in order to provide a viable alternative to individuals taking claims
to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the
courts.</div><a name="10011437000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is right to say that other avenues should be explored
first. We hope that, in the first instance, the regulations are right,
so that there will not be mis-selling, but the ability to have the
schemes means that there is no need for recourse to the courts through
individual cases or collective proceedings, which we have discussed.
Without that power, there is an overall weakness in the
system.</div><a name="10011437000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, however, that the regulator
should not have unfettered powers to impose decisions without adequate
oversight or appeal mechanisms. The FSA has a responsibility to act
reasonably and proportionately, as he knows. He will be aware that
clause 26 proposes a number of safeguards. Let me list them. First,
rules made by the FSA under this power will be subject to a public
consultation, including a cost-benefit analysis. The FSA must have
regard to any representations made to it, and a further cost-benefit
analysis must be provided if the issued rules differ significantly from
the consultation draft, along with an explanation of the
differences.</div><a name="10011437000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the new power is limited so that the only failures that a redress
scheme can address are breaches of legal or regulatory requirements, as
opposed to a subjective assessment of the reasonableness of a
firm&#146;s actions. Thirdly, where the power allows the FSA itself
to take over an investigation by a firm and to take decisions relating
to the firm&#146;s liability, firms will be able 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div>to appeal those decisions to the Financial Services and Markets
Tribunal. Fourthly, firms will be able to challenge the FSA through
judicial review, as I said, and the High Court will be able to review
the reasonableness of a decision to require firms to establish redress
schemes. It will correct any errors of law made by the FSA in setting
out the terms of a
scheme.</div><a name="10011437000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman is aware, the Financial Services and Markets Act
does not provide a right of appeal against the FSA&#146;s other
rule-making powers, other than through judicial review. That is because
judicial review is the right way to challenge rules that apply on a
general rather than an individual basis. They do not involve
consideration of the facts of individual cases. That is exactly what we
propose here
today.</div><a name="10011437000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have serious reservations about whether the amendments would be
workable. I am concerned that they would provide for applications to
the court seeking changes to a decision that the court has made. That
would in effect be a disguised appeal mechanism. The amendments would
create a risk that a regulatory decision to launch an investigation
would be delayed, perhaps by years, through legal challenges about the
meaning of words, and we are trying to provide swift and appropriate
redress for
consumers.</div><a name="10011437000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000238"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister talks about the safeguards and refers
to a situation in which rules have been made under new section
404A(1)(k), in which the authority takes over the investigation and
there is then the potential for appeal to the tribunal. He will be
aware of just how long that can take in slowing down the process. In a
recent case, it has taken several years for enforcement action to go
through all the steps of warning notices, decision notices and then the
appeal to the tribunal. Therefore, even the mechanism that the Minister
proposes as a safeguard can involve quite significant delays to the
process.</div><a name="10011437000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000239"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Gentleman helps me to make my point,
because that is an instance in which the FSA is stepping in and taking
actions with regard to an individual firm, as opposed to making general
rules. Where it makes general rules, the general rule has been that
those can be JR&#146;ed. However, where it is taking action against a
specific firm, if the firm has a dispute with what the FSA is doing,
having a mechanism in such a case is not unreasonable. Yes, that may
take some time&#151;we would all like things dealt with
speedily&#151;but it is appropriate that for that to be done in an
individual case. That does not detract from the general principle I was
outlining. The requirement for prior court approval places an
unnecessary hurdle in the way of swift and effective action. The point
of new section 404 is to make court action a last resort, for the
benefit of firms as much as for consumers. The amendment thwarts that
objective, which is why it should not be
agreed.</div><a name="10011437000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman talked about a situation in which there is uncertainty
in law. Our intention is for the FSA to use the power where the law is
sufficiently clear, for example if there had already been a test case
in the courts. The FSA does not want to act when the law is not
sufficiently clear. It would always be open for the FSA to seek a
declaration from the court, but that would be the exception rather than
the norm.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div><a name="10011437000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000240"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Is that safeguard of the FSA acting  only
if there is certainty built into the measure? If so,
where?</div><a name="10011437000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000241"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As I said, we anticipate the FSA acting where the
law is sufficiently clear. We have talked about collective proceedings
in previous debates, when it has been made evident that the reason why
collective proceedings might be entered into is because the FSA has not
felt able to act because the law is not sufficiently clear. I am happy
to put that on the
record.</div><a name="10011437000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I go through the points made by the hon. Gentleman about the more
general issues relating to clause 26? First, on new section 404(1)(b),
he raised the specific issue of the phrase &#147;or may
suffer&#148;. The purpose of that phrase is to ensure that cases of
contingent loss are captured, such as a person who has been mis-sold a
pension scheme but who may not have suffered any loss at the close of
the scheme. Another example, endowment mortgages mis-selling,
demonstrates why the provision is needed. The consumer has been
incorrectly sold an endowment mortgage, which is an inappropriate
product, but the detriment will not be felt until the clock stops
ticking and we find that the money to repay the mortgage when the
endowment expires is insufficient. That is why &#147;or may
suffer&#148; is
included.</div><a name="10011437000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000242"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister raises an interesting issue, because
in a number of the cases of mis-selling around mortgage endowment, we
do not know what the outcome will be until the policy matures. What is
the expectation for such schemes? If a scheme comes to an end and we
are not clear whether a loss had crystallised, what provision will
there be in the rules for consumers to be compensated for a loss that
may not have crystallised or may never
crystallise?</div><a name="10011437000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000243"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am not sure that I want to get into the detail
of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific case of a general nature. What
we are trying to do with consumer redress schemes is clear. In effect,
they require companies to put things right and ensure that there is
appropriate compensation. It will be up to companies in the first case
to review their operations and to make their decisions on what they
think is effective redress. The FSA, as a regulator, will want to
oversee the actions companies take in that respect. The hon. Gentleman
said that the FSA could act&#151;he did not say on a whim, but
without there being widespread evidence of a problem.</div>
<a name="10011437000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come back
to the fact that the FSA is under a duty to act reasonably and
proportionately. It must have a reasonable basis for deciding to use
the power. I do not believe that the test is too weak. Nor do I believe
that new section 404A(1)(b) needs to be tidied up, as the hon.
Gentleman suggests. However, I shall reflect upon that, and if there is
a particular problem with the wording we can come back to it on Report.
Similarly, I am not persuaded of the risk of double jeopardy in new
section 404B(4), but again I undertake to consider the point.</div>
<a name="10011437000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">New section
404D defines consumers. The hon. Gentleman referred to subsection
(1)(a). The definition covers those who may have contemplated using the
relevant services. He asked why. It will enable the FSA to establish a
scheme, if there has been widespread discrimination, ensuring redress
for those who are unlawfully  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div>denied access to a service. The FSA can require firms to establish
consumer redress schemes only if there is legal liability, so there is
no room for spurious claims.</div>
<a name="10011437000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hoped to
have clarified matters, but I see that I have
not.</div>
<a name="10011437000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000244"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister has not. I am not sure what is meant
by discrimination in the context of financial services. Is he saying
that there may be a breach of equality rules&#151;that a service has
been denied by virtue of race, gender or sexual orientation? Does he
mean that sort of
discrimination?</div><a name="10011437000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000245"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It will certainly cover that, but I am not sure
whether it covers anything else. The provision covers those who are
unlawfully denied access. The hon. Gentleman mentioned some obvious
ways in which someone might be unlawfully denied access, but there may
be others.</div>
<a name="10011437000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000246"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> If there is discrimination on those counts, are
there not other means of taking action that do not require a regulatory
response? I am not sure how it would fit in with the FSA&#146;s
rules. I would expect prosecutions to be made under the Equality Bill
when it becomes law. That would be the way to deal with the matter,
rather than giving the FSA that remit.</div>
<a name="10011437000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000247"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> There may well be other avenues to pursue a
remedy. It might, however, be appropriate and best for financial
services products if we get the company to sort it out. Indeed, the law
provides for that to happen. That is why it is sensible to include such
a measure in the Bill.</div>
<a name="10011437000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
my clarification has helped. If further clarification is needed, we
will seek to provide it. I hope that I have answered the points raised
by the hon. Gentleman. It is not right to ask the courts to deal with
such matters. The regulator is responsible for taking action on those
matters. I urge the Committee to resist the
amendment.</div>
<a name="10011437000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000248"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for taking the time
to make those general remarks and for his response to the amendments
and the questions that I asked. I am concerned about the process that
the FSA will have to go through in order to establish the redress
schemes. I do not think that there is any disagreement between us that
there is a necessity for a proper consumer redress scheme to come into
play. In some of the discussions that I have had prior to the outcome
of the Supreme Court case on bank charges, it was indicated to me that,
at that point, there was not a proper mechanism in place to deal with
the back-book of consumer complaints if the case had gone in the
OFT&#146;s
favour.</div>
<a name="10011437000208"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="10011437000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
26 contains a vehicle that would help to deal with the determination of
historic cases involving bank charges, if that determination was deemed
appropriate. It would give certainty to the industry and consumers
alike that complaints would be resolved, so I have no doubt about the
merits and necessity of that action.</div>
<a name="10011437000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, the
previous measure&#151;section 404 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000&#151;has not worked. The fact that the FSA has not
even sought to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div>engage in this process demonstrates that we got it wrong in passing the
original measure. I gather that it was structured that way to ensure
political engagement when there was a mis-selling case, and I suspect
that, over time, politicians and others have decided that these matters
are best left in the first instance to regulators, rather than being
subject to a political decision. It is therefore right that there be a
general framework.</div>
<a name="10011437000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">What concerns
me is the circumstances in which this new scheme could be used and what
the process is to ensure that proper safeguards are in place. Where
there is certainty that there is a breach of the rules or the law, that
is a good starting point for using this process. Where that certainty
does not exist, I am not sure that the safeguards are adequate for
firms regulated by the FSA. There may not be a clear-cut case and, if
so, how do we achieve certainty in such a process? Also, we are asking
the FSA to internalise in its thinking some of the processes that a
court may go through in establishing certainty. At the moment, there is
not adequate provision in the clause to protect firms where there is no
clarity or certainty about whether a rule or the law has been

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000249"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 78, in
clause 26, page 30, line 48, leave
out from beginning to end of line 2 on page 31 and
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4) Matters may not
be set out in a redress scheme order as a result of subsection (1)(d)
if a court would not grant such relief in the circumstances
specified.&#146;.</div><a name="10011437000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000250"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this, it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 79, in clause 26, page 31, leave
out lines 3 to
5.</div><a name="10011437000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000251"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b><b class="B"> </b>Amendments 78 and 79 are obviously
amendments to clause 26 and to measures set out on pages 30 and 31 of
the Bill.</div>
<a name="10011437000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 78
seeks to leave out subsection (4) of proposed new section 404A of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Amendment 79 seeks to remove
subsection (5) of that proposed new section.</div>
<a name="10011437000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, the
question is, what sort of remedies can the FSA grant in connection with
the losses that a consumer might suffer? Amendment 78 says that the
only remedies the FSA could consider are those that a court might grant
in comparable circumstances, so that there is a more robust basis to
what the FSA can do, rather than its simply doing what it considers to
be just in relation to the description of a case. That tighter
definition would give people more confidence about how these powers
will be used in practice.</div>
<a name="10011437000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011437000252"></a><b class="B">Ian
Pearson</b>: We want to ensure that the redress offered to
consumers is the most appropriate for them. Payment of compensation or
another remedy available 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div>in court is not always the best outcome for the consumer or the firm. I
can give two examples of that from recent experience. First, in the
case of personal pensions, there may be tax reasons and consumer
protection reasons to require redress in the form of a top-up to the
personal pension, rather than as a cash payment. During the pensions
mis-selling of the 1990s, many consumers were wrongly advised to
transfer out of an employer&#146;s occupational pension scheme into a
personal pension. The pensions review went beyond the legal redress
that would have been available to consumers. It required firms to
negotiate with the employer&#146;s occupational pension scheme
trustees to reinstate the consumer into that scheme. That would put the
consumer back in the position they would have been in without the
mis-selling. If that was not possible, the firm was required to top up
the personal pension rather than pay compensation, thereby preserving
tax benefits. Alternatively, it could provide a guarantee to do so in
future if the customer&#146;s pension experienced a shortfall on
retirement. Cash compensation was the last
option.</div><a name="10011437000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
in the case of the mis-sale of a single-premium payment protection
insurance policy, the legal remedy for misrepresentation would normally
be rescission of the contract. The premiums would be returned to the
consumer with interest and the policy would be cancelled. However, it
might not be in the interests of consumers to forfeit their protection.
It might be preferable to keep the insurance cover, which may now be
more expensive, or impossible, to obtain. The firm could be made to
convert the single premium policy into a regular premium policy, and
pay back the difference in cost. That approach might also cost firms
less.</div><a name="10011437000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are trying to provide more effective forms of redress for consumers
than those available through the courts. Although I would expect the
FSA to be largely guided by the type of relief a court would grant, the
examples I have provided show why it is important to be able to depart
from them. Clause 26 provides that the FSA can do so where it is just,
having regard to the nature and extent of the loss or damage. We are
trying to ensure the best outcome for consumers and firms. I hope that
that explanation has been helpful, and that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="10011437000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000253"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister makes a good explanation of the
circumstances in which the powers can be used. The steps that can be
taken to put consumers back in the right place are to be welcomed in
this situation. It would have created more certainty if the language in
subsection (4) had been a bit clearer. Part of people&#146;s concern
about this issue is that they are not sure what it means in practice.
The Minister&#146;s explanation has clarified the purpose behind
subsections (4) and (5). I do not know whether any further changes to
the drafting can be made to ensure that his explanation is more closely
reflected in the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000254"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 80, in
clause 26, page 31, leave out lines 21 and
22.</div><a name="10011437000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(9) of proposed new section 404A
states:</div><a name="10011437000198"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nothing
in this section is to be taken as limiting the power conferred by
section 404.&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div><a name="10011437000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new section
404A does not strike me as exhaustive, which means that the rules under
proposed new section 404 may make provision. Therefore,
subsection (9) seems slightly redundant. Perhaps the Minister can say
why it needs to be in the Bill.</div>
<a name="10011437000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000255"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> If I heard the hon. Gentleman correctly, he has
answered his own question. Proposed new  section 404A is not
intended to be exhaustive, so we need subsection (9) to make the point
that we are not limiting the powers to make rules. There may be other
circumstances that are not covered in the provisions, which are, as he
says, illustrative. We therefore require subsection (9) for exactly the
reason he gave in his question.</div>
<a name="10011437000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000256"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Subsection (1) says that proposed new section 404
&#147;may make provision&#148;, so it is clear from the outset that
it is not prescriptive or exhaustive. The language suggests that the
rules can include certain matters; it certainly does not say that the
current matters are the only ones that can be included, so subsection
(9) seems redundant. It is clear that section 404A is permissive and
does not set a limit on what can be done, but if the Minister feels
that subsection (9) is necessary, I will not divide the Committee. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000257"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 82, in
clause 26, page 31, leave out lines 32 to
38 and insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2) If a
consumer considers that a relevant firm has failed to make an accurate
determination in accordance with a consumer redress
scheme, the consumer may, in respect of that determination or failure,
make a complaint under the ombudsman
scheme.&#146;.</div><a name="10011437000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
goes back to proposed new section 404B, which concerns complaints to
the ombudsman. Subsection (2)(a) tells us that a consumer
who</div>

satisfied with a determination...under a redress
scheme&#148;</div><a name="10011437000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">can
complain to the ombudsman&#146;s service, but it is not clear what is
meant by &#147;is not satisfied&#148;. This is not the most tightly
drafted clause in the Bill. I am not sure what the usual definition is
of &#147;is not satisfied&#148;. However, subsection (2)(b) is much
clearer in referring to a situation in which the consumer believes that
the relevant firm has not made</div>
<a name="10011437000200"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a determination
in accordance with
the...scheme.&#148;</div><a name="10011437000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would place much clearer limits on the circumstances in which
a consumer can make a complaint to the ombudsman by saying that they
can do so only where they believe that the</div>
<a name="10011437000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;firm has failed
to make an accurate determination in accordance
with&#148;</div><a name="10011437000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
scheme rules. So we are not necessarily talking just about the
calculation of a loss or of the amount to be paid to the consumer. The
amendment would cover circumstances in which the firm has decided that
the consumer falls outside the scheme. The wording of subsection (2)(a)
is a bit loose and flabby and could do with tidying
up.</div>
<a name="10011437000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000258"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am interested in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
view that this part of the Bill is in need of a little tidying up. I am
not sure that that is the case, and there is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>problem with the amendment, which would limit the circumstances in which
a consumer can complain to the ombudsman to cases where</div>
<a name="10011437000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a consumer
considers that a...firm has failed to make an accurate
determination in accordance with
a...scheme.&#148;</div><a name="10011437000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
does not cover a situation in which a firm has failed to make any
determination, in breach of the scheme rules, which is something the
Bill does allow for. The amendment would therefore remove a valuable
protection for consumers, which is why it is defective. However, I will
look at the Bill&#146;s wording to see whether it needs tidying up,
although it not currently my view that it
does.</div>
<a name="10011437000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000259"></a>Mr.

<a name="10011437000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000260"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> My understanding is that it is fairly standard
legal terminology. Section 404B gives the FSA the authority to
introduce a scheme. We are not trying to limit a consumer&#146;s
right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service, but the service
will have to look at complaints in the light of the scheme rules.
Therefore, provided that the firm has complied with the rules, the
complaint will not be upheld. That should cover the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point. Again, I do not think the amendment would
achieve what he intends. It would remove a valuable protection from
consumers, so I hope he will withdraw

provide my own definition, by pointing out that I am not satisfied with
the Minister&#146;s definition of it. That might take us part of the
way there. It is not very clear, to my mind, and it is not clear to a
number of people who have considered the Bill from a legal perspective
and raised concerns with me. I welcome the Minister&#146;s

Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): I beg to move, That
the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="10011437000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
always, Mr. Benton, it is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship. New clause 3 responds to concerns that the Financial
Services Authority has not always dealt with consumer problems
effectively or in a timely fashion. The new clause would ensure that
the FSA becomes much more of a consumer champion, as I think we would
all like it to be.</div>
<a name="10011437000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern
arises because, in reality, the FSA is very producer-oriented. Its
funding comes from the financial services industry, and that is
unlikely to change. It is staffed mainly by people who have worked in
the industry for many years. To be honest, many people, particularly in
consumer advocacy bodies, think that the FSA&#146;s links to such
bodies and to consumers is far too weak. The new clause is an attempt
to strengthen the consumer focus and redraw the balance between
producer and consumer interests within the
FSA.</div><a name="10011437000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause sets out clearly that the FSA&#146;s enhanced role in
protecting consumers should not be just about redress, as it is at the
moment. The FSA must be able to spot growing or potential problems and
halt their spread, and it should prioritise prevention and mitigation
as well as redress. The new clause reflects those important issues.
Although the FSA has wide powers to set rules, enforce its decisions
and deal with consumer detriment, it does not have a duty to agree a
time frame for action or to provide a comprehensive solution to
problems that emerge. Although the FSA has, in essence, a consumer
protection objective, it often does not deal with specific problems
that emerge in the market, and there is nothing specific or explicit in
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to trigger the objective,
so there is no real guarantee that the production of evidence of
problems in the marketplace to the FSA will ensure that an
investigation takes place.</div>
<a name="10011437000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many would
say that the FSA has been robust in the action that it has taken and is
defending consumer interests, but that has not always been the case.
The new clause would ensure that we never go back to some of the
problems that emerged in former years. For example, the saga of payment
protection insurance has been a scandal in the financial services
market for a considerable period. In 2005, the FSA carried out a
review. After the review, although evidence was produced by a number of
bodies, including Citizens Advice, the FSA gathered evidence of its
own.</div>
<a name="10011437000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
super-complaint was launched with the Office of Fair Trading, but even
after a year of intense activity, very little had changed.
Subsequently, the FSA has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>changed the rules, banned certain products in the marketplace and
strengthened complaints handling in the insurance market. However, no
one would say that we have finally resolved all the problems relating
to payment protection
insurance.</div><a name="10011437000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can also take the case of mortgage arrears. That was brought to the
FSA&#146;s attention by, again, a number of consumer-oriented bodies.
It took the FSA two years to produce what is an excellent report in the
&#147;Mortgage Market Review&#148;, but we still have outstanding
problems of charges. Concerns are still expressed widely in the
marketplace. We do not seem to have got to the heart of all the
problems in the mortgage
market.</div><a name="10011437000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the FSA is doing much better than it did previously, there is the
lingering concern that we may return to the era of light-touch
regulation. That would not be in the interests of consumers. New clause
3 is designed to provide protection for the consumer that could
withstand any change in the environment in which the FSA operates. The
new clause would enhance consumer protection in two ways. It would
ensure that problems were dealt with appropriately, quickly and
effectively, and it would do that by ensuring that there was a
comprehensive solution to the problems brought before the FSA. In the
words of the new clause, it is
designed</div><a name="10011437000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
remedy, mitigate or
prevent&#148;</div><a name="10011437000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">consumer
detriment. That is a very important aspect of the new clause. It would
do that in a number of ways, but within a certain time frame, because
the new clause states that the FSA must act within one year of becoming
aware of the particular problems in the
marketplace.</div><a name="10011437000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause sets out the circumstances in which the duty would be
triggered. It would be triggered when the FSA was made aware of an
issue. Making it aware could happen in three different ways: something
could emerge from the FSA&#146;s own research; bodies such as the OFT
or the ombudsman could draw their research to the FSA&#146;s
attention; or a designated consumer body could also bring a matter to
the FSA&#146;s attention, and we would need to decide which were the
designated consumer bodies. Under the new clause, the FSA could not
delay dealing with an issue until its next review in that particular
part of the marketplace. That has happened in the past and the new
clause is designed to change that. The FSA would have to respond
directly and promptly when evidence was brought to its
attention.</div><a name="10011437000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not go into the wording of the new clause. It is long and
detailed, and I expect that my hon. Friend the Minister will have
something to say about the wording, but it is drawn specifically from
the Enterprise Act 2002. Let me give an example. When I talk about a
designated consumer body triggering action, that is very similar to the
super-complaint procedure in section 11 of the 2002
Act.</div><a name="10011437000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
with the 2002 Act, there would be various protections against frivolous
or vexatious complaints. We understand that there is a lot of anguish
among individual consumers and various consumer bodies. However, we
need to protect the integrity of the FSA, and that would be done under
the new clause, because the FSA would not be compelled to act in every
single case. That would be especially evident in relation to individual
complaints. It would normally require groups of consumers or sub-groups
of consumers to trigger such an investigation. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>They would have to make a reasoned case, which would have to include
evidence of detriment. That detriment or consumer harm would have to
be, in the words of the new clause, &#147;significant&#148;, and
the action required to be taken by the FSA arising from the triggering
of an investigation would be limited to &#147;reasonable and
practicable&#148;. Protections for the FSA are included, but in
essence the new clause would strengthen its consumer protection
objective, ensuring that it must act in a robust and timely way when
evidence of consumer detriment is brought to its attention in the way
specified in the new clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000277"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Member for Edmonton has done us a great
service. New clause 3 highlights the concerns of a number of people
over how the FSA has dealt with some aspects of the conduct of business
in recent years. It also raises the question of there being an
increased focus on individual products, as opposed to regulating only
the sales process.</div>
<a name="10011437000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman gave a couple of examples. If an issue has caused the
regulator concern for a long time and has been flagged up with the
sector, but little is done by the sector to respond to that concern, it
may get to the point where the scale of the problem, which is
relatively minor in itself, becomes quite significant. The hon.
Gentleman mentioned payment protection insurance, which is a good
example. If more effective action had been taken in 2005, the industry
may have been able to avoid having to make the large payments in
compensation that it now has to make as a result of the work done by
the FSA.</div>
<a name="10011437000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
is whether we should expect the FSA to act as a consumer champion. If
so, will that affect how it regulates the sector? Will it become much
more proactive, much more interventionist, and more heavy handed at an
earlier stage? Every time we hear of a regulatory failure by the FSA,
particular if a number of people have been involved, it undermines
people&#146;s confidence in the sector as a whole. The complexity of
financial services products and the huge imbalance of knowledge between
the consumer and the provider all make it harder for people to engage
in the purchase of such products.</div>
<a name="10011437000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The consumer
finance education body, set up under the Bill, will give consumers more
confidence in engaging with financial services businesses, but
consumers will need to know that an effective regulator will always be
standing behind the purchase or sales process. I am not convinced that
the FSA has done that job as well as it should. That is why, in our
white paper &#147;Plan for Sound Banking&#148;, we talk about the
need to set up a new regulator&#151;in the white paper we call it a
consumer protection agency. It will adopt a new approach to the
regulation of financial services when it comes to the conduct of
business. We expect it to be much more proactive, and to take earlier
action.</div>
<a name="10011437000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
hon. Gentleman did not talk about the detail of the new clause, we
share an interest in some of the elements that have been raised. I am
particularly interested in the mechanism for ensuring accountability.
Under subsection (7), the authority should be more transparent in the
way that it responds to matters that have been raised by consumer
bodies. Under subsection (9), 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 433</div>the authority would be required to produce reports within a year. Again,
that would ensure that there would be much greater transparency about
the steps that the regulator should take to tackle some of the issues
that have been identified in the retail financial services
sector.</div>
<a name="10011437000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">So I have a
great deal of sympathy with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause. It
reflects the widespread concern that exists about how effective
regulation of the retail financial services sector actually is under
the FSA, and it sets out an approach that could yield dividends, not
only by improving outcomes for consumers but by acting in the interests
of the industry itself, in trying to take earlier action to avoid these
large-scale cases of mis-selling that do so much to undermine
consumers&#146; confidence in what is an important sector of the
economy.</div>
<a name="10011437000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011437000278"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): I agree entirely
with the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) and I support
the aims of the new clause.</div>
<a name="10011437000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
period of time that the FSA has been in operation, two things have
happened. First, of course, it was set up and brought together all the
regulation. That was a very good thing; it was a good body to bring
together regulators. Secondly, during that period of time, the
so-called &#147;light touch&#148; that it took and its
encouragement of new products, innovation, new business and everything
else was also very good, but the FSA relied very much upon what was
perhaps perceived to be an inherent integrity within the financial
services sector. Regretfully, that inherent integrity was not perhaps
as strong as we all might have expected.</div>
<a name="10011437000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over time,
there has been a certain amount of confusion among consumers about what
the FSA&#146;s role is in relation to them. I think that many
consumers, when they have confronted the FSA with a problem or anything
else, have often looked upon it more as a trade association of the
financial services companies rather than as a body that looked at
matters from their point of view, as people who are basically lay
people and who feel that they have been wrongly advised, wrongly sold a
product and everything else.</div>
<a name="10011437000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause is very valuable in that it places a much clearer emphasis on
what is now a necessary role for the FSA. Perhaps that role was not
quite as necessary when the FSA was set up. However, given what we have
seen subsequently, including the various events of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div>past few years, there is a need for clarity and some real understanding,
so that consumers can look at the FSA in a way that is much more
acceptable to them, rather than seeing it as a trade association, and
so that, if the FSA is not a consumer champion, at least it can be seen
to look at things much more closely from the viewpoint of
consumers.</div>
<a name="10011437000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011437000279"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am sure that we all agree with the intention of
the new clause, which is to ensure that the FSA takes appropriate
action to protect consumers. However, I must say to my hon. Friend the
Member for Edmonton that, although I congratulate him on its ingenuity,
I am not sure that it is the right way to achieve that aim of
protecting consumers.</div>
<a name="10011437000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Committee knows, the FSA has a number of regulatory objectives,
including consumer protection. Indeed, the Bill adds a further
objective in relation to financial stability. In discharging its
general functions, the FSA is required, under section 2(1) of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, to act, so far as possible, in
a way that is compatible with its regulatory objectives and that it
considers appropriate for meeting those objectives. Those general
functions include making rules and giving guidance.</div>
<a name="10011437000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
discharging those functions, the FSA must also have regard to a number
of other matters, including whether any burden or restriction that it
imposes is proportionate to the benefits that are expected to result.
As I think the Committee is aware, no attempt is made in FSMA to rank
the FSA&#146;s various regulatory objectives. Effectively, new clause
3 would promote the FSA&#146;s consumer protection objective above
its other objectives, such as financial stability, where it is not
subject to a corresponding duty.</div>
<a name="10011437000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">To some
extent, the argument about new clause 3 is the converse of the argument
about amendment 41 to clause 5, which was tabled by the hon. Member for
Fareham and which we discussed some time ago. Amendment 41 was a
probing amendment that proposed giving the FSA a new financial
stability objective and making that objective a priority. At that time,
we discussed the need for the FSA to be able to exercise judgment and
discretion. Those same arguments apply
here.</div>
