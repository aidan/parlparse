</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 109, in clause 17, page 7, line 34, after ‘State’, insert ‘or regional chamber’.
<P>
<B>Mr Breed:</B> Although there are many amendments in this group, they all bear down on one 
feature. Chapter 11.4 on page 53 of the White Paper “Building Partnerships for Prosperity” states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“RDAs and the chambers must work together in a fair and transparent way within and between 
regions”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We all agree that that is vital for the future success of the RDAs. The relationship between 
chambers and RDAs is at the heart of that working together, and the RDAs accountability to the 
regional chambers and the way in which the bodies consult, operate and, we hope, agree will be 
fundamental to it.
<P>
The amendments deal with the status and the powers of regional chambers and contain 
important arguments. The regional assemblies could play a substantial role, but the danger is that 
their meetings with local councillors may simply be to say what they do not like about the RDA and 
that it is not doing what they want it to do. The RDA could become divorced from the regional 
chambers, which would be powerless to influence the RDA board and its actions. In a sense, therefore, 
the RDAs and the regional chambers could work to different agendas, but they must work together to 
tackle the economic deficit.
<P>
The Bill says that the RDA must have regard to the chamber’ views and consult it. Both this 
clause and clause 18 do not reassure me that the chambers will be able to hold the RDAs to account. 
The RDAs could go off and do their own thing, instead of working with the regional chambers. 
Therefore, the Secretary of State’s ability to direct these matters needs to be stiffened, to ensure that 
the bodies work together.
<P>
The amendments give the regional chambers modest extra powers to ensure that they and the 
RDAs build up a relationship that is in the region’s best interests. The amendments seek to prevent 
future conflict between the two institutions. This is new territory. These will be exciting and often 
difficult times. There are likely to be differences of opinion and different emphasis on certain aspects 
of policy and strategy. Our amendments ensure that the bodies work together in the fair and 
transparent way flagged up in the White Paper, instead of working to different agendas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Yeo </B>(South Suffolk): The amendments appear to be designed to do two things, namely, 
to strengthen the powers and the role of regional chambers in relation to RDAs and, in amendment 
No. 90, to widen the range of bodies that agencies should consult.
<P>
I agree that RDAs should consult as widely as possible. Indeed, the thrust of many amendments 
tabled in the past two weeks has been designed to achieve exactly that goal. Amendment No. 90 is, to 
say the least, inoffensive. However, it could be argued thatit is more than that, and that it would have 
a positive benefit. Amendment No. 90 would ensure that consultation by RDAs was not confined to 
regional chambers, where such bodies existed. It would therefore give effect to the Government’s 
commitment in paragraph 11.7 on page 53 of the White Paper:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“We do not intend the RDA/chamber relationship described above”—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
this is the important phrase—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“to be to the exclusion of consultation by the RDA with other specific groups or 
individuals.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that that intention will be honoured.
<P>
One of the many unsatisfactory aspects of the Bill is that we are legislating for a role for regional 
chambers when it is extremely difficult to assess what will qualify an organisation to be designated a 
regional chamber by the Secretary of State. I shall want to return to that unsatisfactory aspect in the 
clause stand part debate because its implications are rather wider than the scope of the amendment.
<P>
Clause 8 as drafted will allow RDAs to confine their consultation to an unelected body that has 
been chosen for that purpose by the Secretary of State. All that can be said for the Government is that 
they are consistent. In clause 7, the Secretary of State was given the power of a total and unquestioned 
dictator in setting RDAs’ strategies and over which functions would be transferred from central 
Government to RDAs.
<P>
I suspect that the issue of consultation by RDAs where regional chambers do not exist is perhaps 
not the most crucial matter to which those dictatorial powers will be extended. Nevertheless, given 
that it is in addition to the powers that I mentioned and the fact that RDA boards will be appointed 
exclusively by the Secretary of State, it seems that the Bill leaves little to chance—or, rather, that it 
leaves little to anyone except the Secretary of State to decide.
<P>
I am therefore inclined to support amendment No. 90, subject to what the Minister has to say. I 
believe that the Committee may want to vote specifically on that amendment, even if not on the other 
amendments in the group.
<P>
The other amendments in the group strengthen the role of regional chambers. The weakness of 
the Bill is that those regional chambers are not necessarily any more directly accountable to the public 
or to those 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“in a regional development agency’s area with an interest in its work.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Making one unelected group of ministerially selected bureaucrats a little more answerable to 
another group that the same Minister has chosen, on the basis of credentials that are as yet undefined, 
to be representative of a region, does not seem to do much to remedy the gaping holes in the Bill and 
the extraordinary democratic deficit and accountability gap that lie at the heart of the structure of 
RDAs proposed by the Government.
<P>
Those gaping holes have been created by the Governments insistence, which is now being 
enshrined in statute, that RDAs are to be circumscribed at every turn, and that their deeds, their words 
and even their thoughts will be subject to the prior approval of the Secretary of State. It may not be 
only the audience at Britpop who eventually want to pour a bucket of water over a member of the 
Government.
<P>
The Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning (Mr. Richard Caborn): Very original.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Well, I could not have said it last week because it had not happened.<P>

<P>
Even the subject matter of the thoughts of RDA board members are to be selected in advance by 
the Secretary of State—we established that last week. In future years, Government Back Benchers 
may wish to deny membership of this Standing Committee because they will not want to admit their 
complicity in passing such appallingly centralising legislation. Even those amendments that relate to 
clauses 18 and 16 do nothing to deal with the fundamental and all-pervasive flaw that runs through 
the Bill. That is not the fault of the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed), who tabled 
the amendments; it is a flaw endemic in the Bill.
<P>
The provisions of clause 18, as usual, leave absolutely everything to the discretion of the 
Secretary of State. Every power in clause 18 is exercisable only if the Secretary of State so chooses. 
That renders amendments Nos. 95 to 98 limited. If the Secretary of State does not choose to specify in 
his directions what regional chambers may require of RDAs, nothing will transpire, and since the 
Secretary of State seems unlikely to specify anything that would cause him or the Government the 
remotest difficulty or embarrassment, the amendments are unlikely to be of much practical help.
<P>
Exactly the same defect exists in amendments Nos. 107 to 109, which do not alter the all-
powerful position of the Secretary of State, confirmed yet again in clause 16. I do not criticise the hon. 
Member for South-East Cornwall for tabling the amendments because they are an honest and 
constructive attempt to strengthen the role of one of the bodies that may conceivably have some 
independent thoughts—even if it does not have any power—but I fear that the amendments would not 
make much difference.
<P>
For the sake of displaying uncharacteristic flexibility, the Minister may decide to accept some 
amendments, if they are as tame in their consequences as these. This might be a chance for him to 
show his willingness to listen, if not to reason, then at least to a view other than that of his civil 
servants. Tactically, that may be an astute move, but I fear that, on past form, rigidity will prevail.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I am puzzled by the unusual praise, or at least faint praise, from 
the hon. Member for South Suffolk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I praised the hon. Lady last week.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I was not aware of that. I read Hansard, but I missed that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I even moved one of her amendments.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Thank you. 
<P>
I should like to probe a little further the interesting partnerships that are developing in 
Committee, and I should like to probe the Minister on the guidance that the Secretary of State will 
issue to RDAs. Will he confirm that guidance will be issued to RDAs, requiring them to consult 
regional chambers and take account of their views? What will happen if there is a clash of views—for 
example, if there is a disagreement between the RDA and the regional chamber on the content of the 
regional economic strategy? If the RDA does not take on board the views of the regional chamber, 
will it have to give reasons for not doing so? People in rural areas are especially worried about what 
will happen if there is a conflict between the regional economic strategy and regional planning 
guidance or local development plans. What guidance will the Minister issue to RDAs to deal with 
such cases?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I hope that we can get back to reality after the outburst from the hon. Member for 
South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo). He began by arguing a good case, but spoiled it by going into the realm of 
fantasy. The Labour party has been consistent over the years. In 1975, the Labour Government created 
the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, which have stood the test of time. They have been not 
jackboots but well-respected bodies. As Prime Minister, baroness Thatcher used the same model for 
an agency in Northern Ireland. Our White Paper models English regional development agencies on 
what was done in Scotland and Wales.
<P>
As I have said in earlier sittings in relation to the powers of the Secretary of State, we are 
managing fundamental change and we will, at every stage, take with us the British people—the 
people of the English regions in this case. The people will determine how we devolve real power to 
real people in the real world.
<P>
The amendments are concerned with making RDAs accountable to the people’s representatives 
in the regions. I have some sympathy with the amendments and am grateful to the hon. Members for 
South-East Cornwall and for Taunton (Mrs. Ballard), who tabled them, for giving me an opportunity 
to confirm our commitment to the modernisation of our democracy and the decentralisation of power 
to the people.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have made clear our intention that the people of the regions of England will, in time, have 
the opportunity to decide whether they wish to move to more decentralised government in the regions. 
At that time, there will be a case for putting RDAs into a regional democratic framework in which 
elected representatives from the regions will take decisions about what an RDA does and will be held 
accountable for the actions of the RDAs.
<P>
The process is already beginning: Scottish Enterprise will be responsible to the Scottish 
Parliament and the WDA will be responsible to the Welsh Assembly. It remains to be seen what will 
happen in London, but on the assumption that a London-wide authority will exist, the agency in 
London will be responsible to that directly elected body. We will give the English regions the same 
opportunity in the fullness of time. I favour that approach, but we will not rush into it or force it on 
people. In the end, the people will decide. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made it clear 
that all major constitutional issues will be decided on the will of the people.
<P>
If we were scrutinising a Bill that created regional government, the amendments would not be 
necessary as they would already be reflected in such a Bill. However, our present concern is to remedy 
the economic deficit in the English regions, as outlined in the White Paper. RDAs will be non-
departmental public bodies and will, within the current democratic framework, be responsible to 
Ministers who will have to account for their actions.
<P>
Before I deal with specific amendments from the large group under debate, I should like to 
outline my general approach. RDAs will be significant new bodies in each region with important 
powers and considerable resources and influence. They should take account of regional views and give 
an account of themselves to their region. Clauses 8 and 18 provide for how that should be done. I 
understand the purpose behind the amendments, which seek to go further than that by giving regional 
chambers control or a veto over an RDA’s actions. As I have said, in another Bill that would be a 
crucial consideration, but it is not appropriate to the NDPB framework that we are considering.
<P>
Some of the amendments would require the Secretary of State to make directions about, for 
example, the provision of information, instead of leaving him discretion on whether to do so. There is 
no question of RDAs not consulting—they will consult. What we hope to avoid is the need to make 
directions in, for example, a case where the RDA and the chamber have worked out their own 
arrangements.
<P>
I know that the loyal Opposition find it difficult to understand that we are trying to seek the will 
of the people in a bottom-up process that will create a partnership agreement for the regions. The 
dictatorial attitudes of the centralised state that we have lived in for past 18 years have created a 
culture of conflict. The Opposition find it difficult to comprehend that in a modern, industrialised 
society we can have bottom-uppartnerships, and that we are able to resolve problems for the 
betterment of all while we create wealth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister has again spoken of his wish to take account of the people’s view of 
regional structures. Is he aware that tomorrow the House will be able to give the people of London an 
opportunity, that is presently to be denied to them? Can his statement this morning be interpreted as 
one which heralds acceptance of Opposition Members’ view that there should be a separate vote in 
London so that people have a chance to say whether they want an elected regional assembly for 
London? Yes or No?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> No.
<P>
Finally, some amendments would put chambers on a par with Ministers in determining an 
RDA’s working process. They might affect the production of the annual report and might require 
Ministers to be overly prescriptive about what an RDA should do. General direction-making powers 
in the Bill give Ministers great scope to decide how to ensure that a full and meaningful dialogue 
takes place between an RDA and a chamber. I assure the Committee that those powers will be used as 
and when necessary. We should remember that the Bill introduces decentralising measures. We do not 
want to have to chaperone an RDA or a chamber at every stage of their relationship
<P>
Amendment No. 86 would require the Secretary of State to make directions on consultation 
instead of leaving it to his discretion. Amendment No. 96 would also require the Secretary of State to 
make directions on how an RDA should account to a chamber, again without leaving it to his 
discretion. I hope that all members of the Committee would expect the RDA and the chamber to 
conduct their relationship in a spirit of partnership and co-operation. It will always be in the interests 
of RDAs and chambers to co-operate. If they fail to do so and do not speak with a single voice, their 
influence within the region and beyond will be greatly diminished. I do not want to start from the 
position that they cannot be relied on to sort matters out for themselves. I do not want to tell them 
what to do in prescriptive guidance issued from Whitehall.
<P>
The Bill should not provide that the Secretary of State must make directions. However, it is 
likely that both parties may require guidance. I would not rule out using powers in the Bill to provide 
guidance, especially if it were generally felt in the regions that that would be helpful.
<P>
Amendment No. 88, it is clear, would give chambers the upper hand in their relationship with 
RDAs. An RDA would have to comply with a chamber’s instructions and seek its approval for its 
economic strategy. RDAs will be required to take account of the views of chambers and work in 
partnership with them. But within the NDPB framework, an RDA cannot be subject to a chamber’s 
instructions. The amendment is more appropriate to a different Bill on regional government. 
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): I do not quite get what the Minister has said to ad up. He 
said that an RDA must do as a chamber tells it. He then said that it did not have to do what the 
chamber told it. What is the relationship between the two, and does it make a difference whether a 
chamber is elected at some date in the future, or whether it is designated?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I think that the right hon. Gentleman knows well that we are talking about setting 
in train a non-departmental public body. The responsibility of all NDPBs is to the House of Commons 
through the ministerial route. We are saying that the RDA ought to and will consult a wider body 
within the region—the chamber. The right hon. Gentleman knows, probably better than anyone on 
the Committee, that NDPBs are responsible to the House of Commons and are subject to the scrutiny 
of the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office, which protect public moneys. If, 
however, the House decides at a future date, after the public mood in the regions has been tested, that 
it wants to bestow those powers on directly elected regional chambers, the House has a right to do 
that. The Bill does not seek such powers; it seeks the powers to set up a non-departmental public body 
that would, within the structure that we are debating this morning, cross-check with the people of the 
region concerned. That must take place before we accept the RDA’s final submission to the Secretary 
of State. That is clear, and the right hon. Gentleman knows how NDPBs operate far better than I do
<P>
Amendment No. 109 requires that an RDA’s annual report should contain such information as 
the chamber specifies. Clause 17 gives this power to the Secretary of State alone. I am afraid that that 
is how it must remain. The annual report is an important link in the chain of accountability from the 
RDA to the Secretary of State and ultimately to Parliament. It must contain such information as the 
Secretary of State considers appropriate to maintain such accountability.
<P>
That said, annual reports will be an important tool for explaining the purpose of an RDA and for 
giving an account of performance, not least to the chamber. I will consider these issues in any 
guidance I give on the preparation of annual reports. I hope that RDAs will also consider how best to 
present their annual reports in their regions and what information to include over and above the 
Secretary of State’s requirements. If the chamber has helpful ideas as to how to improve an annual 
report, I would expect the RDA to consider them, but that will be for the RDA to decide.
<P>
Amendment No. 108 relates to the publication or circulation of the annual report. Clause 17 
provides for a copy of the report to be sent to the Secretary of State and for him to lay a copy before 
each House of Parliament. That is also part of the accountability process. The amendment proposes 
that a copy of the agency’s annual report should be sent to the chamber. I propose that too; I think that 
it is a splendid idea. Indeed, I would go further. I would propose that copies should be more widely 
circulated than just to the chamber. I would be dismayed, however, if RDAs needed much guidance 
from me on how to circulate an annual report. Therefore, while accepting the intention behind the 
amendment, I do not think that it should be included in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 97 would include a description in the Bill of some of the documents that an 
RDA might be directed to supply to the chamber, namely, its statement of accounts and its annual 
reports. As with amendment No. 108, I would hope that an RDA could arrive at this decision without 
Ministers having to tell them to do so. Ultimately, however, an RDA could be directed to do so, and it 
is not necessary to list these documents in the Bill for this purpose. 
<P>
Amendment No. 107 relates to clause 16, which is about the provision of information by the 
RDA to the Secretary of State. That clause is another important link in the chain of accountability to 
Ministers and, ultimately to Parliament. The Secretary of State should have access to such advice and 
information as he thinks necessary to maintain that accountability.
<P>
The amendment requires that the RDA should provide the chamber with such information as it 
requires. The Government already intend that that should happen. [Interruption.] This is rather 
a long explanation. However, we do not wish to institutionalise the relationship between the RDA and 
the chamber, which should be based on trust.
<P>
Members of the Loyal Opposition find it difficult when Labour Ministers explain their policies 
in great detail. We were left in the dark under the previous Government when our attempts to drag out 
such detail were similar to a dentist dragging teeth out of a patient. This new Administration, 
however, like to be open so that people understand what we are doing and why we are doing it and so 
that sound decisions can be made. We are not walking away from the argument.
<P>
We will expect RDAs to adhere to the best principles of open government—as do this 
Administration—and to develop a constructive working relationship with the regional chamber. It 
would not be helpful to give the chamber the upper hand in what information should or should not be 
provided. We have the powers under clause 18 to intervene if necessary, but I hope that it will not be 
necessary.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 95 and 98 relate to clause 18, which provides the Secretary of State with 
powers to make directions as to the way in which an RDA gives account of itself to the regional 
chamber, by providing information, answering questions and holding public meetings. The 
amendment provides for the chamber also to be able to direct how the RDA accounts to it.
<P>
Amendment No. 98 offers a slight variation on the same theme and provides for the chamber to 
specify what information is to be given to it by the RDAs.
<P>
I should be very much in favour of the chambers and the RDAs reaching agreement among 
themselves on how such arrangements should work. As I have said before we expect the chamber—
RDA relationship to grow out of co-operation and partnership. It should be one of mutual respect and 
trust. I should not want to provide that one party to the relationship would have the upper hand. This 
is what the amendments would do and I do not believe that would be helpful to the relationship. If 
these matters cannot be worked out in the region—I very much hope that they will be—the Bill gives 
Ministers the means to intervene.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments No. 87 and 90 are unnecessary. Amendment No. 90 would add to clause 8(2) a 
reference to the RDAs’ functions set out in clauses 4, 5 and 6. The amendment would ensure that 
RDAs can be required to have regard to the views of the chamber in exercising these functions. 
Clause 8(2)(a) relates only to the economic strategy in this context. However, that is already provided 
for in clause 8(2)(b). The use of the word “consult” means that an RDA should both consult on the 
exercise of its functions and have regard to the response it receives. The different formulation used in 
clause 8(2)(a) arises because we wish to be able to require the RDAs to have regard to the views of 
chambers when they are drawing up their strategy—that is, before there is a draft on which to consult.
<P>
Amendment No. 90 provides that in addition to consulting the chamber the RDA should consult 
other bodies. To the extent that such bodies are already represented in the chamber, that could amount 
to unnecessary additional consultation. However, there will be individual groups, whether involved in 
the chamber or not, that might be particularly interested in or affected by a specific RDA. In those 
cases I believe it would be right for the RDA to consult directly with such groups. I hope that RDAs 
will develop their own procedures for involvement of those directly affected by their activities without 
Ministers having to tell them what to do and hold their hands. However, if necessary, Ministers could 
give guidance and directions on such individual consultation using the general powers in clause 31, so 
amendment No. 90 is not necessary.
<P>
In conclusion, I am sorry that my explanation has been so long, but the relationship between the 
RDAs and the chambers is important. I know that hon. Members who tabled the amendments will be 
disappointed that we have been unable to accept them when our objectives are so similar. None the 
less, I hope that I have shown that we are committed to furthering the cause of regional accountability 
and that in the Bill we have gone some way down the road to making the RDAs, which are important

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Well, may I tell the hon. Member for Taunton (Mrs. Ballard) that if she attended the 
Committee more often she would discover that on some issues the Opposition not only support 
amendments tabled by her and her hon. Friends but in their absence we are even able to move them 
on their behalf because we consider them to raise important matters for debate?
<P>
The Minister’s astonishing refusal to allow the people of London the chance to express their 
views on whether London should have an elected regional assembly makes his assurances on the 
Government’s intentions on consulting people in other regions on the same issue completely 
worthless. The Government have fallen at the very first fence. The first regional assembly will be 
established and the people in the region concerned will not be allowed a vote on that question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick </B>(Poplar and Canning Town): My recollection may be hazy, but was it not the 
Conservative Government who abolished the Greater London Council and deprived Londoners of any 
say in their own affairs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Conservative Government did indeed do that, and they did not precede that 
excellent and sensible decision with a lot of weasel words about the way in which the people of 
London would be consulted about it. The Minister has told us at least half a dozen times during our 
proceedings how much significance the Government attach to the process of giving the people in the 
regions a chance to vote on whether there should be a directly elected regional assembly. Yet on the 
first assembly to be set up, the Government are refusing to give the people the chance to vote on it. 
There is still time tomorrow—the House of Lords has already amended the relevant Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That is a very democratic body.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister makes a rather derogatory comment about the House of Lords from a 
sedentary position. The House of Lords is endeavouring to ensure that the Government honour this 
promise. It is a promise that has been repeated time and time again, and on the first opportunity the 
Labour Government have to honour it, they break it. What kind of message does that send to the 
people in the other regions? It sends a very clear message, which is this: “Don’t pay any attention to 
what the Minister of State says in the Committee about the fact that you may have a chance in a 
referendum to vote on whether there should be a directly elected regional assembly.” People even 
more exalted than the Minister of State have been promising for months, if not years, that that will be 
the basis on which directly elected regional assemblies are created, and on the first occasion that we 
reach the threshold of establishing such an assembly, the promise is broken: it is thrown into the 
gutter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I am amazed by such passion to defend the democratic process felt by the party that 
wiped out local government, wiped out the metropolitan counties and wiped out the GLC without any 
votes or consultation—just by an Act of Parliament pushed through. The hon .Gentleman knows that 
in the first week of May this year Londoners will decide whether they want a directly elected authority 
in London, together with a mayor. The Government do not intend to take instructions from an 
undemocratic body in the other place on whether Londoners can vote on a mayor and a directly 
elected assembly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am sure that the Minister’s comments about the other place will be noted with some 
interest in those quarters. The difference is that the Conservative Government carried out exactly what 
they said they would with the GLC. Labour Members may not have liked the decision, but that was 
the pledge that the Conservative party gave the people: it then honoured that pledge.
<P>
Contrast that with what has happened now. A pledge was given that people would have a chance 
to vote on this matter. That pledge is about to be broken. If it is to be broken on the first of the 
assemblies, we can only conclude that the Minister’s words this morning and in previous sittings are 
not even worth a bucket of warm spit. There is no assurance for the people of the eastern region, the 
south-west region, or the Yorkshire and the Humber region. They can look at what has happened in 
London and they can say to themselves, “We will not be consulted.”
<P>
The Minister said that he hoped that RDAs would not need to have their hands held. If they do 
not need their hands held, why does clause 18(3) contain a provision that enables the Secretary of 
State not only to decide how long the notice of a meeting to be held by the RDA should be, but even 
gives the Secretary of State power to decide how to publicise that notice? If that is not holding 
people’s hands, what on earth is?
<P>
Given the absolutely valueless assurances that we now have about consultation, it will be 
necessary to press amendment No. 90 to a vote. I hope that the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall 
will vote in favour of his own amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I want to speak in support of my hon. Friend the Member for 
South Suffolk and in defence of the amendment. As a new Member, I am not satisfied by the 
Minister’s explanation. I am disappointed that he does not accept the Opposition’s amendments, 
which raise concern about a fundamental weakness in the Bill. We are discussing a hypothetical 
situation. We are talking in concrete terms about the creation of a regional development agency, a 
direct conduit for power to the regions and, theoretically, a regional chamber, which will act as a 
counterweight, but, as the Minister said, that will be the subject of another Bill. 
<P>
In theorising about checks and balances, it cannot make good law to use a relatively weak clause. 
It is the words “may give” that cause me concern. That phrase places too weak a requirement on 
RDAs to consult. Working in Brussels, I often saw European legislation drafted with the word “may”, 
but “may” never works because it is disregarded; only the word “must” has real force. The clause must 
be strengthened so that the consultation process is clear.
<P>
I have received representations from local authorities who are concerned about the curious 
transitional period that is implicit in the Bill. RDAs will be created before there is any statutory 
requirement to set up regional chambers. That vacuum will give rise to an unclear situation for 
democratically elected local authorities. It is naive to think that there will not be clashes and conflicts 
during that transitional phase. The geography of RDAs is such that they will cover the area of several 
local authorities of different political complexions and social composition. It is unrealistic to think 
that, for example, in the West Midlands region, there will be no tension between the local authorities 
for conurbations and those that represent rural areas. Unless there is a strong requirement to consult 
local authorities, and to give correct weight to their concerns to resolve the inevitable tensions, I fear 
that the RDAs, using the powers vested in them by the Secretary of State, will ride roughshod over the 
opinions of local authorities.
<P>
I am still dissatisfied with the level of accountability of RDAs to the Secretary of State. At a 
previous sitting, I asked what measures of performance would be used for the 12 board members—
who will have considerable power—so that we could be sure that they would be held accountable, and 
by what mechanism of accountability the electorate could be absolutely sure that the policy of RDAs 
would reflect the regional view. The Minister used the phrase, “the will of the people”, but the will of 
the people can be correctly tested only through the ballot box at local and general elections.
<P>
Local authorities are right to think that their views may not adequately be considered. The 
Minister said that he wanted to avoid creating a culture of conflict, but some conflicts and tensions are 
inevitable in the critical period between the establishment of RDAs and the introduction of any 
democratic checks and balances that the Government have in mind. During that time, local authorities 
should be consulted, and “may” is too weak to give that assurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I thank the Minister for his explanation. One of the difficulties in drafting 
amendments is that we are setting up the second tier of a structure before the first tier is in place. 
Perhaps, in an ideal world, we might first have had regional government and, from that, been able to 
develop RDAs. Then, the relationships and accountability could have been more easily dealt with. The 
amendments are, to some extent, anticipatory—although there is no certainty about that. It is difficult 
to table amendments that anticipate accurately how the regional chambers will operate.
<P>
When we first began to debate the Bill, I had the impression that the transition period would be 
relatively short. As we have gone on, I fear that it may be longer than I had hoped. That makes it even 
more important to get the accountability message over. Our amendments apply what might be called 
rules for divorce, in that while chambers and RDAs will go flat out in the full flush of their initial 
work, differences of opinion will probably develop as time goes on, as the hon. Member for Meridan 
(Mrs. Spelman) said. Almost inevitably, some disputes will have to be settled to avoid a logjam. 
Although we envisage real progress as bodies work together to benefit their regions, we do not want 
two institutions hell bent on scoring points off each other.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I accept what the Minister has said, because the amendments are anticipatory rather than 
attempts to address RDAs directly. His guidance will be essential, and I hope that it is regarded as 
instruction. RDAs must reflect public opinion and what is needed in the regions. Business men, 
environmental groups and housing associations have a real interest in what happens in the RDAs.
<P>
Notice must be taken of them and they must be consulted in a way that is proper, not just a paper 
exercise.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk indicated that he would support amendment No. 90, an 
important amendment. Consultation with other representatives could become contracted rather than 
diversified, so the widest possible consultation is needed and should be an element of the Bill. I will 
not seek to press the other amendments, but want to test the Committee’s resolve on amendment No. 
90.

<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I found the speech of the hon. Member for Meriden rather sad. I appreciate where 
she comes from, but there is a hint of arrogance among the loyal Opposition who feel that they know 
best. Telling us that words such as “partnership” or “may” should be dismissed from the English 
language is a sad thing indeed.
<P>
We are trying to address real issues of wealth creation through the RDAs. We are addressing the 
economic deficit that 18 years of Conservative Government left to the nation. Eight of the 10 English 
regions are underperforming. The Conservatives have left us in the third division. The Government 
will change the culture of the nation, as my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has said, so that we 
can work in partnership and develop consensus. The hon. Lady’s speech epitomises the arrogance still 
endemic in the loyal Opposition: they know best and do not want consensus. They wanted to dismiss 
the word “society” from the English language. What famous person said, “There is no such thing as 
society”? They now want to remove the word “may” from the Englishvocabulary, because “may” 
means that there is consensus and that we can work together. It is sad that that is their contribution to 
this important debate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Perhaps there was a misunderstanding. A new Conservative Member is of 
contrite spirit. The spirit of my words were in recognition of the role of local government. I was 
thinking not in the terms described by the Minister but in practical terms.
<P>
Local councillors have considerable concerns about the Bill. For example, powers to make 
compulsory purchase orders over the heads of local authorities are causing anxiety. I merely wanted to 
impress it on the Minister that the need to consult local authorities should be inherited. I was 
defending the role of local authorities without a touch of arrogance in my mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I assure the hon. Lady that not only will local authorities be consulted but their 
members will be a substantial minority on the boards—four out of the 12 members. That is clear. 
RDAs will have to consult regional chambers—indirectly elected bodies, I accept—which will exist in 
the majority of local authority areas. The fears of local authorities do not stand up to scrutiny.
<P>
Finally, there is a precedent in the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies. Conservative 
Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales used those agencies to great effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): In the earlier part of the Minister’s speech, he mentioned that 
consultation and consensus were at the heart of the Government’s approach. I am sure that he will 
accept that it is necessary to consult to discover a consensus. If a consensus needs consultation, what 
is wrong with saying “shall”?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We do not believe that it is necessary. The spirit of co-operation and bottom-up 
partnership which pervades the Bill, clearly shows the Government’s direction. We could play about 
with the odd word here or there, but the thrust of the Bill is to drive consensus forward. The vast 
majority of the 1,500 responses—1,494, I think—wanted us to follow that direction. There may have 
been the odd criticism, but in contrast to that, the constructive approach of the Liberal Democrats has 
helped us to scrutinise the Bill in a more responsible and effective way.
<P>
As for moving the programme forward to establish directly elected regional assemblies, which is 
what I think Opposition Members want, I remind the Committee that on 4 May last year the 
parliamentary timetable was determined for London, Scotland and Wales, and it included the 
Regional Development Agencies Bill. We should realise, with that date of 4 May 1997 in mind, that 
the London authority will probably not become operational legally until 2000. After provisions in the 
referendum bill have been implemented, the assembly in London will have to be directly elected. We 
will not know the consensus of the people until 2000. It is difficult for some Opposition Members to 
understand that. Even if we decided to establish directly elected regional assemblies in this 
Parliament, we probably would not have them in place until the next Parliament. The Government are 
attempting to address the economic deficit with RDAs. We believe that introducing regional chambers 
shows that we want to move towards directly elected regional assemblies. We believe that there is 
enough constitutional legislation in this Parliament—
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Too much.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> There again, arrogance prevails. “Too much” constitutional change—the 
devolution of real power to the people. Arrogance prevails from the Opposition Whips, as we now 
expect. I assume those Opposition Members who agree with the devolution of power that we shall do 
it in a systematic and well-managed way, with the consent of the people.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As there has been a further speech, amendment No. 86 cannot now be 
withdrawn. I shall put it formally to the Committee. Before doing so, however, I remind hon. 
Members that they do not need to withdraw grouped amendments. The Committee is formally 
considering only the first amendment in the group.

given the role of regional chamber for the agency.’<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘directions for the purpose of securing that it carries out appropriate consultation, in relation to 
the exercise of its functions, of all the local authorities in its area’.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Clause 8 deals with RDAs consulting a body that is suitable to be given the role of 
regional chamber, which the Secretary of State designates. I appreciate the Government’s 
commitment to regional government, especially in the White Paper. However, after the Minister’s 
remarks a few moments ago about the timetable for the referendum Bill for London, I am rather 
worried that regional governments will not be in place for two Parliaments, and then only if we retain 
the same party in government. However, it seems from their earlier contributions that the 
Conservatives have suddenly also made a commitment to regional democracy. I found that rather 
surprising, but then I would find any commitment to democracy from the Conservatives surprising.
<P>
There is little in the Bill as drafted that encourages chambers to be established. There seems to 
be reliance on the initiative of local councils or other local groups to establish regional chambers. If 
there is no regional chamber, the Secretary of State will give guidance and direction. There appears to 
be nothing in the Bill that says that central Government will encourage the development of regional 
chambers. The amendment will ensure that the Secretary of State gives that lead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Amendment No. 92 has a different purpose from amendments Nos. 76 and 77, which 
stand in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) and myself. Amendment 
No. 92 appears to be about creating a regional chamber where none exists. I shall want to explore 
what might constitute a regional chamber on clause stand part. For the present I merely observe that 
in some areas there may be little enthusiasm for creating a regional chamber. The Government’s 
refusal even to consider giving the people of London a vote on whether they will have a directly 
elected regional assembly tacitly acknowledges that there may be a lack of enthusiasm even for an 
elected assembly. Still less will the public perceive, therefore, what a regional chamber should do. I 
certainly do not favour giving the Secretary of State a statutory power to coerce local authorities into 
forming a regional chamber, if they do not wish to do so. 
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 76 and 77 require RDAs to consult the local authorities in their areas where 
no regional chamber exists. I admit that that is a fairly limited aim, but it is a worthwhile one. It 
would ensure that the views of local authorities, which at this stage would be the only directly and 
democratically elected bodies in the regions, could not be totally ignored by the RDAs, because, as the 
Bill stands, there is nothing in statute that would require RDAs to consult local authorities, they 
would not even have to talk to them. It seems hard to reconcile that with the commitment in the 
opening paragraph of chapter 11 of the White Paper. The relevant sentence reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Organisations representing local interests, and above all the democratically-elected local 
authorities, have a right to contribute to the work of the RDAs.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that is what the Government mean, why do they not include a provision in the Bill to carry it 
out?
<P>
We have learnt this morning how little value the Minister of State puts on all the assurances and 
promises given before the election, during the election and since the election to the people of greater 
London. Let us therefore try to retrieve some of the damage that has been done and perhaps prop up 
the Government’s credibility in this matter by inserting into the Bill a simple amendment that would 
give effect to a sentiment carried prominently in the opening paragraph of the chapter on regional 
accountability.
<P>
The amendment would reinforce the extent to which the Bill reflects the Government’s aims and 
would make the success of RDAs more likely. Although I am not convinced about the merits of RDAs 
for every part of England, if we are to have them, let us at least try to make sure in a constructive way 
that they have a fair chance of succeeding.
<P>
Hitherto the Government have resolutely opposed all amendments, but at last I am hopeful that 
we have some that may fall on more receptive ears. For once the amendments do not remove the 
Secretary of State’s powers to choose a body that suits him and designate it a regional chamber. They 
would come into force only if the Secretary of State could not find such a body. Indeed, the 
circumstances that the amendments envisage may not arise, but, if they do, it is surely right to ensure 
that the local authorities are involved. I suspect that some Labour-controlled local authorities may 
even support my view. Indeed, I strongly advise Government Members to consult their local 
authorities about their views of the amendments. They should check to see how enthusiastic they are 
about rejecting an amendment that would require them to be involved in this way.
<P>
The Government Whip, who is temporarily out of the Room, may be all-powerful here in the 
House of Commons, but when it comes to getting re-elected the support of councillors in Labour 
Members’ own constituencies may be even more valuable than the warm approbation of the 
Government Whips Office. The support of those councillors might be given a little more 
enthusiastically and readily to Members who back the interests of their councils in seeking an 
inoffensive but valuable amendment to the Bill. To ensure that those Members receive credit for 
taking that course, I may be able to arrange for copies of the Hansard report of our proceedings and a 
list of theMembers who voted for the amendment to be sent to their local councillors so that they may 
see what part their Members of Parliament played in the debate.
<P>
The Minister has spoken again and again, this morning and previously, of his intention to 
consult. Refusal of the amendment would be arrogance of a high order and would show that the 
Government, in bringing forward a centralising Bill, have nothing but contempt for the voice of local 
democracy.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I think that we should treat the last part of the hon. Gentleman’s contribution with 
the contempt it deserves.
<P>
I return to the point made by the hon. Member for Taunton on the timetable. When we make the 
sort of constitutional changes that we are discussing, the Bill, like those covering Scotland, Wales and 
London, must take its time through the procedures of the House of Commons. It will be the year 2000 
before the directly elected assembly and mayor will be elected, if that is what the people of London so 
desire. That does not mean that within a second term we could not have directly elected regional 
assemblies. That could happen even within that timetable.
<P>
I refer again to the point raised by the hon. Member for South Suffolk. The electors of London 
will be given the opportunity during the first week of May to decide whether they want an assembly 
and a mayor.
<P>
A Bill such as this must include safeguards. Every region in England is in the process of setting 
up regional chambers and they have been developed with enthusiasm. There is great enthusiasm, even 
in areas that are not traditionally seen as official regions of England. It will be interesting to see how 
the structure of RDAs and chambers evolves. That may happen faster in some regions which have not 
been traditional regions because the traditional regions probably carry much baggage from the past 
whereas the new regions may be green-field sites and able to move quite quickly.
<P>
This group of amendments is concerned with circumstances in which there is no representative 
and suitable body which the Secretary of State can designate as a regional chamber. I hope that that 
proves to be unduly pessimistic. The role which the Bill gives to chambers provides a real opportunity 
to people who are keen to carry the regional agenda forward to do just that, and I believe that good 
progress is being made towards putting in place a chamber in every English region.
<P>
There is cross-party support for the measure. In my area of Yorkshire, as I am sure the right hon. 
Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) knows, there has been clear support from Conservatives 
as well as Liberal Democrats and, of course, Labour, for the move to the Yorkshire assembly, and we 
welcome that.
<P>
In all but two regions, a representative structure exists at regional level that is open to all the 
local authorities in the region. Some have long-standing links with business and other interests at 
regional level and are actively exploring arrangements to satisfy the criteria set out in the White 
Paper. Subject to the will of Parliament, I would not be surprised if several regions were knocking on 
the door of Eland house seeking designation soon after Royal Assent.
<P>
In the south-west and in the eastern region, the partners are a little behind the rest, but I 
understand that in both regions local authorities are actively considering how to establish region-wide 
structures and how to involve other regional partners.
<P>
None the less, we must provide for the possibility that a chamber might not exist in a region and 
the Bill does that.
<P>
Amendment No. 92 would require the Secretary of State, where no chamber exists, to give 
guidance and directions to the RDA, local authorities and other interested parties for the purpose of 
creating a body to be given the role of regional chamber. I agree that if people in the regions need 
guidance on how to establish chambers, then such guidance should be provided. The White Paper 
gave a lead on the type of arrangements that we envisage, and we are currently considering whether 
further general guidance is required. Ministers can make such guidance available without the need for 
a specific provision in the Bill.
<P>
As the White Paper explained however, we believe that regional structures should develop to 
meet different regional circumstances. I expect that arrangements will vary from region to region. For 
example, the number of local authorities in each region varies considerably and they may need 
different representative structures. I believe that it is very important for chambers to be a product of 
their region.
<P>
As far as I am aware, people in the regions are not seeking guidance and, as I have said, good 
progress is being made. I certainly do not want to be required to give guidance—which this 
amendment provides for—when it appears to be unnecessary and is not being sought. None the less, I 
take the point, and I can assure the Committee that I will provide guidance should this prove to be 
necessary.
<P>
Amendment No. 76 provides that the Secretary of State shall give directions and guidance as he 
thinks fit on consultation in the absence of a chamber, whereas the Bill provides that he may give 
guidance as he thinks fit. I assure hon. Members that the Secretary of State will give whatever advice 
he thinks necessary, and I am not sure that the amendment adds anything to the Bill.
<P>
In the absence of a chamber—a situation which I am hopeful will not arise—we would want the 
RDA to establish alternative arrangements for consultation in the region. I would hope that the RDA 
could work this out for itself, in consultation with the other interests to be involved. As in other 
matters, Ministers do not want to be under a duty to tell an RDA what to do when it is unnecessary. If 
it was felt, however, that arrangements were unsatisfactory, the powers in the Bill would enable 
Ministers to intervene, which we would do.
<P>
Amendment No. 77 would limit the power to give guidance and directions on consultation in the 
absence of a chamber to arrangements involving local authorities, to the exclusion of other groups and 
bodies. That would be unsatisfactory. I assure the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr Yeo) that I 
would expect such consultation arrangements to involve local authorities, and we have the power to 
ensure that they do so. Consultation would also have to involve other groups however such as those 
that would otherwise be represented in the chamber. I urge the hon. Lady to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> The Minister is right to say that enthusiasm for chambers is more marked in some 
areas of the country than in others. In some areas—the Minister mentioned the south-west—local 
authorities have found it difficult to reach agreement and have divided along political lines because 
one particular party, the Liberal Democrats, has been in the forefront of campaigning for regional 
chambers. Labour party groups on certain city councils have joined Liberal Democrats on this issue 
rather late in the day, and now want to be in the driving seat.
<P>
I would hope that all regions would recognise the value of chambers, and perhaps a more 
proactive lead from the Secretary of State might encourage them to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I have already taken a proactive role by meeting Liberal Democrat Members of 
Parliament and other representatives of that party in the south-west. I have met the Labour party 
leaders in Bristol, Exeter and Plymouth and have asked them to ensure that good progress is made 
towards a regional chamber. All the information that I have received suggests to me that there is now 
agreement on the need to consider how to represent the seven counties—as they are called—or the 
south-west. I have been to the south-west a number of times for discussions with representatives of all 
political parties on this issue. We have laid the groundwork for the creation of a regional chamber in 
the not-too-distant future.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I thank the Minister.
<P>
<B>Dr. Doug Naysmith </B>(Bristol, North-West): Coming from Bristol, I have been involved in 
discussions on the chamber and can confirm what the Minister has said. I take slight objection to what 
the hon. Member for Taunton said about the Labour party coming on board late and now wanting to 
drive the car. We want a share in driving the car so that we can make sure that it goes in the direction 
everyone wants. My main reason for standing up, however, is to confirm what the Minister said; 
things are coming together and it should not take us long to have a chamber in the south-west with 
support from all the region.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I thank the Minister for his helpful intervention and the hon. Member for Bristol, 
North-west (Dr. Naysmith) for his. The Minister talked of the proactive role that I had in mind, and I 
will therefore be happy not to press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> In commenting on my amendment, the Minister hoped that regional development 
agencies could work matters out for themselves. The Bill does not even allow RDAs to decide when to 
hold their annual public meetings—that decision is retained by the Secretary of State. It is 
extraordinary that the Secretary of State should be reluctant to allow a provision for appropriate 
consultation with local authorities if there is no regional chamber, a situation that the Minister hoped 
would not arise in any event. Given that the Minister has placed himself firmly on the side of 
centralisation and against the voice of local democracy, I want to press our amendment to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I should like to explore what the regional chamber must do to receive the Minister’s 
imprimatur—in other words, to be designated. As Liberal Democrats have said, we could have been 
considering elections to regional assemblies—that is the impression that was given before the general 
election, although it did not take long after the election for the Deputy Prime Minister to put that 
beyond the next election. Now we have an attempt to create a sort of surrogate chamber. If this was a 
Health Department, I would say that this was a Minister’s attempt to define a partial pregnancy.
<P>
We are not discussing proper elections to a democratic assembly; we are trying to find all sorts 
ofself-appointed people to receive the Minister’s accolade. I want to know what criteria they must 
fulfil before they receive that accolade. We are all familiar with attempts to set up so-called 
representative bodies, and we need to know how representative these bodies will be.
<P>
We all accept that local government will play a significant part. After all, local authorities are 
most enthusiastic about regional chambers. I have already asked what term someone who already 
serves on a district and county authority will be deemed to have; but how will people be selected? How 
will the Minister require geographical and political representation, and will he require representation 
from different types of authorities?
<P>
In all regions there are a variety of types of local authority. There are unitary authorities and 
metropolitans: the characteristic form in Yorkshire and Humberside, an area of large conurbations. 
There are county councils, in north Yorkshire, for example—the Minister is right that north 
Yorkshire is represented on the embryonic regional chamber in Yorkshire—and there are district 
councils, some of which cover large areas. Harrogate, in the rural area that I represent, is one of the 
largest district councils. Craven, with only 30,000 people, is one of the smallest in the region, but that 
is a very distinctive area, and the characteristics of Craven are entirely different from those even in 
Harrogate, on the other side of the Pennines.
<P>
How will the Minister judge whether those different interests are effectively represented? RDAs 
will have to pay close attention to what is said, and we must ensure that they reflect people’s views, 
not just the corporate view of the assembly.
<P>
The notes on clauses are about the most useless that I have ever read because they are as 
impenetrable as the legislation. I thought that notes on clauses were supposed to simplify and render 
legislation comprehensible, but these are even more incomprehensible than the Bill. It is pretty 
desperate when one has to look at the legislation to find out what they mean, usually without success. 
The Leader of the House might want to pay some attention to the need to ensure that notes on clauses 
translate the intentions of legislation into comprehensible English.
<P>
However, I have found an interesting little paragraph in the notes on clause 8, which state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The local authority element within the chamber should be dominant, but the overall size of the 
chamber should enable the wide range of non-local authority interests to be represented.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What does that mean? I cannot see which part of the Bill that interprets. What does “dominant” 
mean in that context? The Minister has made it clear that the RDAs will be business-led. He has spelt 
out many times that there will be four local representatives. Of course, if the regional chamber were 
democratically elected, all its representatives would be taken from the local authority, but as it will not 
be, what does “dominant” mean? How many local authority members would he expect to find in the 
chamber? What other interests would he expect to find represented, if they are to be designated? 
Business, obviously, but will the business men be representatives of the chambers of commerce or 
chambers of trade? In other words, will they be ex officio or will they be appointed because they have 
something to say in their own right? We must be careful, as I have said before, that these bodies do 
not represent all the great and good of the region and that just about everybody who is dispensable 
will sit on one of them because they are no longer needed to pursue their career actively at work. 
Many trade organisations and representative bodies co-opt people who are no longer in the first flush 
of dynamic business activity.
<P>
I have no doubt—this would vary according to the region—that in Yorkshire and the Humber 
region the Minister would look for some representation of the ethnic minority communities, because 
he has ground on about that for some time. There are many ethnic minority communities in that 
region, not just a handful. How would he expect them to be selected and represented? What proportion 
would he expect to find? He will know that in a city like Bradford there are a number of important 
ethnic minority communities, and their interests are no more identical with one another’s than they 
might be with those of families who have lived in Bradford for generations.
<P>
Then there is the increasing interest in these matters on the part of what I suppose we must now 
call the faith communities, which I used to call churches. Every church worth its salt now produces 
economic development strategies and seems to have moved entirely from the spiritual to the material 
plane. Perhaps that simply reflects the modern age. The northern churches have just sent me a 
document on the spiritual aspects of the RDAs. Whether that means they want parsons on board I am 
not clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> They would get the divine touch.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister no doubt believes that the Prime Minister has a direct line to the 
almighty. coming from a rather low Methodist background myself, I have never been quite so 
arrogant as that. I have always assumed that I have to work it out for myself with occasional guidance, 
not permanent contact.
<P>
It is a serious question. Would the Minister regard representation of the faith communities as 
important? They represent a point of view and there is a constantly changing scene among them. One 
could argue that the miracle of the loaves and fishes was an early example of extremely commendable 
productivity.
<P>
What about the voluntary organisations, of which the Minister makes great play? I have just 
been reading, in a rare moment of lassitude in the Committee, the Government’s White Paper on local 
democracy and community leadership. It goes on about aspirational things such as how the whole 
world will be brought into this great warm embrace. Whether the Government will do anything at the 
end of the day is another matter, but it is all extremely interesting.
<P>
There are thousands of voluntary organisations, as the Minister knows: we fall over them. Which 
ones will be represented? Will there be a system to work out who will be represented? We are all 
familiar with the citizens advice bureaux, which take the sticky end of some of our cases and in many 
ways take some of the work load off MPs in their surgeries—those of us who are sensible work pretty 
closely with the CABs in our constituencies. They are at the hard end of things. But voluntary 
organisations go all the way to people who want to save the whale, the dolphin and kestrels and those 
who are concerned about the future of racing pigeons because of the growth in the number of raptors. 
The Under-Secretary will be particularly familiar with that problem, which I suspect may be one of 
the most difficult on her books.
<P>
What about other organisations that have a major economic impact but one which is difficult to 
categorise? For example, housing associations are now major providers of housing. If the RDAs are to 
have a housing role—that role would need to be spelt out—and are to play their role in the great 
debate about whether we develop on brownfield or greenfield sites, the housing associations will be 
germane to that. How will they be represented?
<P>
Once the Minister has decided all that, what is the nature of the relationship? We do not want 
the RDA to spend all its time dealing with this organisation and not having time to do the things that 
it was elected to do. We will start appointing public relations organisations, interfaces and 
government relations organisations to deal with all the local assemblies, and there will be an 
enormous bureaucracy of interface between the RDAs and the various organisations to which they are, 
imperfectly and impartially, supposed to be beholden.
<P>
If referendums are held eventually—we do not know when they will take place, because the 
Deputy Prime Minister hastily shunted them off until after the next election—and the people say no, 
because we all know that the regions are different, as is their sense of identity, will the RDAs still be 
subject to a surrogate assembly? In other words, if people do not want a democratically elected 
assembly, will the Minister still insist on a nominated one—a self-appointed one—which he will 
require the RDAs to have regard to? Once that democratic decision is taken, will he pretend that the 
people were wrong and should have voted for one, and will have one willy-nilly, or will he abandon 
that part of the agenda? These are all important issues.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am not a particular fan of regional assemblies. As I keep repeating, the first constituent has yet 
to come into one of my surgeries and volunteer to me his enthusiasm for the idea, but I can see the 
Government’s purpose in wanting to ensure that, if new and powerful organisations are created, they 
do not become removed from the preoccupations of local people. The balance between observing the 
needs of local people and responding to the preoccupations of individual local politicians is a difficult 
one to achieve, and the Minister will have to sort that out. We are in a curious transitional phase at 
the moment—although we are not sure that we are “transitioning” towards anything—in which we 
know that we will have the regional chambers, which will receive the Minister’s nod of approval. 
What do they have to do before they get that nod?

<P>

<B>Ms Rosie Winterton </B>(Doncaster, Central): I wanted to refer briefly, on the subject of consultation 
between the RDA and the chamber, to a document produced by the regional assembly for Yorkshire 
and Humberside, which, as my hon. Friend the Minister will know, is extremely enthusiastic about the 
establishment of RDAs. It has been produced in conjunction with the wide range of regional 
stakeholders, many of whom will constitute the eventual chamber. It is called “A Strategic Framework 
for Yorkshire and Humberside: The Next Ten Years” and is a broad-based strategy for the region, 
embracing economic, social and environmental issues. It is an excellent document. What guidance 
will be given to RDAs about consultation on this type of document?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The clause is the first in the Bill to refer to regional chambers. It does so without 
attempting to define them and without stating what their aims, composition or full range of powers 
should be, I find that an extraordinarily unsatisfactory state of affairs. Indeed, in my experience it is 
also quite an unusual one. To give the Secretary of State power to designate certain bodies as regional 
chambers, to recognise their existence in primary legislation and to give them substantial influence 
without attempting to provide the definitions to which I have referred is extremely unusual and 
something that we may wish to try to rectify on Report.
<P>
Our judgment as to whether it will need to be rectified then will depend considerably on the 
answers that I hope the Minister will give to questions raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for 
Skipton and Ripon and me.
<P>
All our questions arise from what the Government said in their White Paper. As my right hon. 
Friend pointed out, it is difficult to learn much from the notes on clauses about the role or composition 
of the regional chambers. It is equally difficult to do so by reading the Bill. However, one or two 
tantalising clues are contained in the White Paper, although they raise more questions than they 
answer. In Chapter 11, on page 52, a box titled “Regional Chambers” states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“almost all regions are making progress in the same direction; that is, to create a chamber 
which can provide a regional voice which includes all the regional stakeholders.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
“All” is very precise. Knowing the care with which the parliamentary draftsmen and the civil 
service write such documents and how minutely every phrase, sentence and word is examined, I find 
that statement significant. I dare say that Ministers do not always have the time to scrutinise their 
White Papers as minutely as officials can, but the Minister will find my first question easy to answer. 
Who are the regional stakeholders? Specifically, who are they in the eastern region? A couple of 
weeks ago, the Minister rejected an amendment intended to omit the eastern region from these 
burdensome arrangements. For that reason, if no other, he must be confident about the need for an 
RDA there. He must also be confident about the need for a chamber and he must know clearly who 
the regional stakeholders are. He will not know just one or two of them—“all” is the word in the 
White Paper. We look forward to the Minister supplying us with a list of “all the regional 
stakeholders”.
<P>
Paragraph 11.4 on page 53 of the White Paper refers to the Government’s view that different 
regional circumstances require different structures. We can all agree with that, but the very next 
sentence refers to the Government’s
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“expectation that the partners to these voluntary arrangements should achieve an appropriate 
gender and ethnic balance”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon has alluded already to that point. Will 
the Minister tell us precisely what the ethnic and gender balance should be for the eastern region?
<P>
Paragraph 11.4 (i) continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The local Authority element of the chamber should reflect regional, local and political 
balance, and type of authority.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, what balance will the Minister expect to be reflected in the regional chamber in the 
eastern region? I should like to be able to advise people who ask me about that in Suffolk. As my right 
hon. Friend has said, it is not the first subject raised in the Red Lion in East Bergholt when I pop in 
there after surgery for a refreshing pint. It is not even the first issue raised in the highly political 
surroundings of the Sudbury Conservative club. Nevertheless, some people are interested in what 
regional chambers will do and how they will be composed. I would like to advise people who wish to 
take part in creating the body that will aim to achieve designation as the eastern regional chamber on 
what, precisely, the local authority element will be. What will be the role of parish councils? They are 
highly respected in many parts of the country and are certainly part of the local authority structure. It 
would be helpful for people who serve on them, many of whom have a non-political background, to 
know what their participation in the regional chamber might be.
<P>
On page 53, paragraph 11.4(ii) of the White Paper it is stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The non-local authority element should be open to representatives of the main regional 
economic development stakeholders with an interest in the work of the RDA”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Who are the main regional economic development stakeholders in the eastern region? Which 
industries does the Minister expect to be represented to fulfil that commitment? Will those industries 
be represented by management, employees, representatives of shareholders or proprietors? How will 
small businesses, which are an important feature of the eastern region, be represented in 
implementing the commitment? How will the membership of regional chambers evolve so that it 
continues to reflect the economic balance in the region? Industries rise and fall in different parts of 
the country. Presumably the regional chamber is not to be set in concrete.
<P>
Paragraph 11.4(iii) raises a point touched on by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton 
and Ripon. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The local authority element within the chamber should be dominant”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How dominant? Is 50.1 per cent. sufficiently dominant? We know that with a bit of adjustment 
of the voting procedure it was sufficient to get the Welsh assembly on the road. Or will 66 per cent., 
75 per cent. or 90 per cent. be considered dominant?
<P>
Let us consider a different region—Yorkshire and Humberside. My right hon. Friend the 
Member for Skipton and Ripon is more of an expert than I am in that area, but even he might be 
interested to know what representation Doncaster council, an important unitary authority in that 
region, can expect to have on the regional chamber if the local authority element is to be dominant?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> As little as possible, I hope.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I rather share that view. I wonder whether the tribunal recently set up by the Prime 
Minister to investigate the full extent of corruption among Labour local councils has considered that. 
The tribunal might have a long life, given the scale of the problem.
<P>
Paragraph 11.4(iii) goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“but the overall size of the chamber should enable the wide range of non-local authority 
interests to be represented”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will groups that represent the interests of council tax payers count as part of the local authority 
element or the non-local authority element? How big will the chambers be? How many members will 
they have? Interested parties must deal with those questions now.
<P>
Paragraph 11.4(iv) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“All the regional stakeholders should have the opportunity to contribute to the debates of the 
chamber and for their views to be reflected in its published statements.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How will regional chambers publish statements? How often will they publish them? What 
subjects will they cover? Where will they be published? Will regional chambers have to consult the 
Minister before statements are published? Will they have to ask him in what form they should be 
published? Paragraph 11.4(iv) makes an important point when it says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“All the regional stakeholders should have the opportunity”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that mean that minority reports will be published if some stakeholders take a different view 
from that of the majority in the regional chamber? Will councils which disagree with one other be 
able to require their differing views to be published?
<P>
I turn to the small matter of costs, which is scarcely addressed in the White Paper. Who will 
meet the cost of the regional chambers? The final sentence of page 52 of the White Paper contains the 
only reference to costs and sates:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“We expect the costs of these arrangements to continue to be modest and to be met from within 
existing budgets.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We know that the activities of the regional chambers are important. They are referred to 
extensively in clause 8. The chambers are clearly intended to exercise greater influence than the 
predecessor bodies from which they are emerging and evolving.
<P>
<H5>12.15pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The question of costs is important. Do the Government expect local authorities to bear the costs 
of regional chambers for arranging meetings, providing a secretariat and travel, which may be 
substantial in some regions? Will other stakeholders, apart from local authorities, have to contribute 
to the costs? However modest those costs, they are another potential burden on local authorities for 
which, as with the others costs that have been imposed in the past few months, no resources will be 
made available. Will the Minister also tell the Committee exactly what he expects those modest costs 
to amount to? If it is helpful for him to relate his answer to a particular region, I know that my 
colleagues in the eastern region would be interested in his reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Would it be of assistance if such figures could be given for all regions? I would be 
interested to hear the figures for the North-west region.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> My hon. Friend is correct—the figures should be available for all regions. If the 
Minister confirms that the costs will be borne entirely or largely by local authorities and perhaps also 
by other stakeholders, it is important for people to know what those figures are when they are 
planning the basis of their participation in regional assemblies.
<P>
Clause 8 shows—and the Minister confirmed this morning—that the Government expect 
suitable bodies for designation as regional chambers to emerge in most and perhaps all regions 
relatively soon. The clause envisages a substantial role for the regional chambers and it is important, 
if the Committees to approve the inclusion of the clause in the Bill, that the Minister explains what 
the characteristics of the bodies will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Hepburn </B>(Jarrow): How does my hon. Friend the Minister see the role of the 
regional chambers in strengthening the role of the RDAs? Reference has been made to the well-
established, better-organised and better-funded Scottish and Welsh development agencies, but I refer 
specifically to the problems that have been highlighted in the press and the allegations of gazumping. 
How will the regional chambers add to the strength of the RDAs?
<P>
I hope that the regional chambers in the northern region will be short term because we are 
hoping for an early move towards some form of regional government. Will my hon. Friend assure us 
that there will be real consultation with a business-led regional development agency? We have 
supposedly had consultation for 18 years, but that has been lip-service consultation. We need an 
assurance. What assurance do we have that local and environmental views, which may not accord 
with those of the business community, will be taken into consideration by a business-led RDA?
<P>
A voluntary sector presence in the regional chambers is proposed for the northern region. What 
role will that sector have? Will there be a sufficiently strong voluntary sector presence on RDAs to 
enable them to take an expert view on the voluntary sector’s opinions in the regional chambers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> As far as the Government’s long-term intentions are concerned, regional chambers are 
undoubtedly a halfway house to something else—assemblies. If assemblies are to exist, I recognise 
that it is essential to have some control and check on their operations. Hence the constructive 
approach that Opposition Members have adopted to the Bill.
<P>
However, like the Bill’s other provisions, the clause does not fully explain the Government’s 
overall thinking and their true intentions. The Minister repeated on several occasions, not only during 
the debate on this clause and the amendments to it, but also at other times in our proceedings, the 
phrase that RDAs were there to fill the economic deficit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Address the economic deficit, not fill it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Okay, address the economic deficit. That is the rationale that the Government always 
use, here and in the Chamber. The statement is largely meaningless. Regional assemblies, RDAs and 
the chambers attached to them are manifestations of a different agenda. With your permission, Mr. 
Benton, I should like to explore that agenda.
<P>
RDAs are being set up purely and simply as an excuse to set up regional assemblies. There is no 
other reason. The move has nothing to do with economicrealities in any region. The assemblies are an 
attempt to balance the Scottish and Welsh assemblies from an English perspective. It is a poor attempt 
to redress the imbalance of representation better know as the West Lothian question.
<P>
RDAs are being set up before regional assemblies because the Government were frightened off 
after the Welsh result. They were frightened that if they went ahead with regional assemblies and held 
referendums in the English regions, those regions would do what the Welsh almost did—reject the 
concept.
<P>
It is no accident that the Minister said earlier that people were lining up to join the chambers 
and interpreted that as enthusiastic support for what the Government were doing. The truth is that 
people are realists: they know that the Government intend to use their majority to bring about RDAs, 
and ultimately assemblies—for the time being, chambers. Their logic is, therefore, that they may as 
will be involved in something that is going to happen anyway. That does not mean that there is 
enthusiastic support for the concept. I concede that perhaps one area of England—the Northern 
region—has a genuine interest in a regional assembly, but there is no interest in assemblies or 
development agencies in any other region.
<P>
What is a stakeholder? In the north-west, where lies, as the Minister knows, the wonderful 
constituency of Cheadle, which I have the honour and privilege to represent, there are industries that 
are viable and essential to the British economy. Aerospace, defence-related industries, engineering, 
and high-tech industries are successful in the north-west. Many of them have head offices in or on the 
periphery of Cheadle. British Aerospace is a classic example. Can the Minister tell us whether those 
companies constitute stakeholders alongside the local authorities?
<P>
I visit employers in my constituency and throughout the region because many of my constituents 
work in such industries. Not once in my talks with the management of those companies have they said 
that they want a regional development agency or think it essential that the region should have an 
assembly. It is the last thing on their minds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> How do you know that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Because I listen to the people whom I visit and who are major employers in my area. 
When they express their concerns about the new Government’s policies—as, naturally, they also did 
under the previous Government—they never identify a need for a development agency in the north-
west.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Clark </B>(Gillingham): May I ask whether the hon. Gentleman raises the issue with them? 
Opposition Members have said that constituents do not raise the matter, but Members of Parliament 
can take the matter further by initiating a balanced discussion about economic performance, jobs, 
sustainable development and regional development agencies. Perhaps that is the way forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> I like to think that I am living proof that the Tory party is not as arrogant as the 
Minister constantly claims. I believe that the people in the companies that I visit know what they are 
talking about when they mention their economic needs and the political structures required. I do not 
propose to lecture them on any subject. I never do. I listen.
<P>
In all honesty, on no occasion in my 11 years as Member of Parliament for Cheadle has the 
subject of regional development agencies or assemblies been raised by an employer. The hon. member 
for Gillingham (Mr. Clark) may like to know that my constituents have certainly never mentioned the 
need for an RDA in the north-west and have never contemplated an assembly.
<P>
Cheadle lies in the greater Manchester area but has a Cheshire postal address. After 20-odd 
years the people there still see Cheshire as their county. Their sense of identity goes no further. They 
do not identify with the north-west. They have no perception of the north-west, other than perhaps as 
the area that Granada Television broadcasts in. It is the same across England: the perception for most 
English people is the counties.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman consider whether his constituents have anything in 
common with my constituents? On the one hand, local authority members express frustration at the 
powers of the government office, which is not democratically accountable, and wish that it were 
elected instead of being a Government quango; on the other hand, employers whom I meet express 
frustration that regions in England cannot compete with very strong regions in the rest of the 
European Union in terms of inward investment and structural funding. Does the hon. Gentleman find 
that employers in his area say that? If they do not, they are very different from those in my area.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> To answer the hon. Lady’s point, the major employers that I speak to export widely to 
Europe, but like all successful companies looking to the future, they also export to the whole of the 
world, so they do not express particular concern about that. They are successful in the present 
circumstances, and I hope that they will be more successful in future.
<P>
I genuinely believe that the concept of a region does not exist in the psyche of the people of the 
so-called north-west, and I find it difficult to believe that it ever will.
<P>
I hope that during the remainder of its proceedings the Committee will take some of the 
Opposition’s amendments a little more seriously, because, despite my serious doubts about the Bill’s 
intention, agenda and practicalities, we are trying to improve something that we know the 
Government will use their majority to pass through the House. The people granted the Government 
that majority and democratically they have every right to use it. But I hope that the Minister will 
recognise that we have a duty as an Opposition to express our concerns. We also have a duty to amend 
the Bill and to improve it if we possibly can. Although I get on well with the Minister outside the 
Committee Room, he is being unresponsive to the various points that my hon. Friend the Member for 
South Suffolk and other Opposition Members have put forward to improve the Bill and, particularly, 
the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Arrogant!
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Arrogant indeed, as my right hon. Friend says.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clark:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Cheadle for responding to my intervention. I am 
delighted to know that he does not lecture his constituents. It is right that we should not do so. He is 
clearly one of that rare breed of Tory Members who listens to his constituents, because he told us so.
<P>
On the clause and the matter of debate between the agencies and the chambers, I hope that my 
hon. Friend the Minister can clarify an issue that will affect the whole country and involves the 
integrated transport strategy document. Gillingham, the Medway towns, and the Thames gateway are 
areas to which the transport issue is vital. With the advent of the Channel tunnel rail link, it will be 
even more essential. Therefore, the document is very much in the forefront of our minds in Kent and 
east London. 
<P>
Will the White Paper due in the spring recognise the important role of the RDAs and the 
regional chambers? Will the direction and leadership that we rightly expect of the Government be 
implemented to meet local requirements and circumstances and to deliver the RDAs’ main objectives 
of economic growth, employment and sustainable development? It is essential to incorporate regional 
dynamics in the work of the RDAs and the chambers.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> This is the key clause for setting out the relationship between the RDAs and the 
regional interests represented by regional chambers as and when they arise. Liberal Democrats believe 
that if bodies are appointed my Ministers, as the RDAs will be, it is vital that they be accountable at 
regional level to ensure that they have the credibility and ability to respond to regional needs. The 
clause requires the RDAs
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“to have regard...to any views expressed by the chamber”,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but that is too weak a form of regional accountability. A relationship based solely on consultation 
is not sufficient. There are bound to be tensions between a body which has been appointed by 
Ministers and whose members see themselves as having a wider regional remit—with their power 
coming direct from the Secretary of State—and anotber body which has been elected by local 
authority members and believes that it has a democratic legitimacy.
<P>
The need to strengthen the accountability of RDAs to regional chambers was a key 
recommendation of the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs when 
it discussed regional development agencies on 12 January 1998. The purpose of the Liberal Democrat 
amendments to the clause was to explore the Government’s thinking on that.
<P>
The Conservatives asked about regional stakeholders—who they are, how would we know who 
they are and where consultation would end. I know that they have great difficulty with the concept of 
consultation—[Hon. Members: “Oh!”] They have expressed their difficulties this very morning.
<P>
Local authorities are used to working in partnership with a wide range of people in their areas 
and I am sure that any notable interests that were not included on the list of consultees would make 
themselves known. Considerable work has already been done by local government organisations, 
together with other partners in their regions, to put together regional strategies for economic, 
environmental, social and training needs in the regions. Regional chambers will wish to build on that 
work and will have a broad mandate from a range of interests in order to do so.
<P>
In conclusion, I am not sure that I have had a response to my earlier question to the Minister on 
how possible conflict between the regional economic strategy put together by the RDA and regional 
planning guidance on local development plans will be resolved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We have had a useful debate on clause stand part with some good contributions 
from Labour Members, for which I am grateful. Those contributions were probably more penetrating 
than the contributions of and amendments tabled by Opposition Members, but that is to be expected in 
view of the quality of Labour Members. I shall try to answer the questions raised.
<P>
I shall reply first to the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon. I do not know whether some 
people live in a different world from the one that I live in. When he was a Minister, the right hon. 
Gentleman dealt with the North-West Partnership and the Yorkshire and Humberside assembly. Such 
partnerships exist and are already developing in many regions. They will be voluntary bodies which 
will not be imposed by central Government. We expect them to be consulted. Paragraph 10.6 of the 
White Paper lists the bodies and relevant interests as being:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Businesses; Co-operatives and community enterprise bodies; Education’ Local authorities; 
Rural areas; Voluntary Sector; Wider business perspective; and Wider employee perspective.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That list was borne out of the consultation that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I had on 
two occasions when we went around the country to visit the regions. We met a considerable number of 
bodies which represented various interests. I set up a national sounding board including the 
Confederation of British Industry, the voluntary sector, the chambers of commerce, the Trades Union 
Congress and local authorities, all of which were represented at national and regional levels. We 
reached a consensus which was incorporated in the White Paper.
<P>
Before various interests groups get the nod, as the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon 
said, we will ensure that they follow the remit set out in paragraph 11.4 of the White Paper, which 
broadly outlines who the representatives should be. The right hon. Gentleman made disparaging 
remarks about the notes on clauses when he referred to the statement that local authorities should be 
dominant, but the words were taken from the White Paper.
<P>
We will be looking for a majority of Members of the Chambers to be from directly elected local 
authorities. That is the broad approach. We will not, however, prescribe from the centre. We will 
allow partnerships to grow. Indeed, many partnerships already exist.
<P>
When the hon. Member for South Suffolk referred to Yorkshire and Humberside, he deferred to 
the knowledge of the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon. That is what we are doing. I imagine 
that the Minister will defer to those in the regions to decide the composition and quality of the 
chambers. The hon. Gentleman was right to defer to his right hon. Friend on the matter of Yorkshire 
and Humberside. I shall defer to those in the regions to ensure that regional chambers are 
representative, because they will be voluntary bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister rightly said that I believed that my right hon. Friend had a greater 
knowledge of Yorkshire and Humberside than me. Is the Minister saying that he will consult my right 
hon. Friend on stakeholders in that region?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon has a credibility in the House and, 
indeed, in the European Parliament where we worked together as members of different parties 
representing British interests. His contributions to the Committee and the House on important issues 
such as local government and local democracy are respected. Indeed, they are more respected than the 
opinions of some of the people who hold senior positions in the Conservative party and in the loyal 
Opposition. To that extent, I probably would defer to the right hon. Gentleman’s opinion of what 
Conservative members should serve on a body in his region.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) made a telling point. She 
answered many of the Opposition’s questions when she explained what Yorkshire and Humberside 
was doing to tackle the economic deficit and some of the social problems that have arisen in 18 years 
of Conservative Government. Partnerships have already been formed in Yorkshire and Humberside, 
led by major utilities such as Yorkshire Electricity, Yorkshire Water and Yorkshire Cable, all of 
which are stakeholders in the Yorkshire area.
<P>
Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour members of local authorities are coming together to 
reach an agreed agenda on how to take Yorkshire and Humberside forward with “A Strategic 
Framework for Yorkshire and Humberside: The Next Ten Years”—to quote the document to which 
my hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) referred. She must have been reading the 
Prime Minister’s agenda for the next 10 years. That will mean real partnership, real bottom-up and 
real stakeholders producing real documents, and it will produce real wealth in future. My hon. Friend 
the Member for Doncaster, Central put that forcefully.
<P>
I shall now deal with the other points raised by the hon. Member for South Suffolk, who wanted 
me to prescribe for the eastern region, the north-west region, Doncaster council, and so on. I refer him 
to paragraph 10.6 of the White Paper, which lists the bodies that will be consulted, and to paragraph 
11, which outlines what the chambers will do.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I know it is difficult for the hon. Gentleman to grasp the idea that one can trust people and that 
partnerships can be developed without the centralising, dictatorial attitude that we have been used to 
for the past 18 years. He emphasised the role of local authorities, so I must tell him that the Local 
Government Association has been deeply involved in discussions. It was represented on the national 
sounding board and has been involved in discussions at regional level with regional organisations, 
where it received the support of members of all political parties—I must have had 10 or 12 all-party 
meetings with the Local Government Association.
<P>
I remind the hon. Member for South Suffolk that when I was at a meeting in Manchester, and 
met a sole representative of the Conservative party there, I turned to him and said, “It must be a bit 
difficult for you, as a member of the Conservative party, to make a contribution to the debate when 
your colleagues in the House of Commons are totally opposed to the proposals.” He replied, “Ah no, 
because we are new Conservatives and they are old Conservatives.” That encapsulates it; I thought 
that adequately summed up the rump on the Opposition Benches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Heard it before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> It’s better this time.
<P>
I know that the hon. Member for South Suffolk is desperate to find a division somewhere 
because he wants to drive a wedge between local authorities and our attempts to devolve powers, but 
nothing could be further from the truth. The Local Government Association is very supportive of our 
proposals, and that support comes from representatives of all political parties. We expect that the 
boards, in consultation with the Local Government Association and other stakeholders outlined in the 
White Paper, will bring balance to the system. They know that, in the first instance, we want them to 
address the economic deficit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> The minister referred to the co-operation of local authorities, and I am sure that in 
many cases they will co-operate, but is it not a fact that many local authorities and associations have 
expressed concern that the legislation does not devolve power but removes power from local 
authorities and transfers it to a higher, regional level?

<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> On the contrary, the Local Government Association is pushing for us to introduce 
regional assemblies quicker than the current timetable. It may be possible to pick out the odd remark 
made by a particular councillor somewhere, but in terms of the broad thrust of policy, the Local 
Government Association has been involved. I have addressed the Local Government Association on 
several occasions. Indeed, I addressed some of its members on Saturday and they were all supportive. 
The Local Government Association supports regional development agencies and regional chambers. 
Its criticism is that we are not moving fast enough to introduce directly elected regional assemblies. I 
have given it a categoric assurance that we are devolving central powers downwards, not sucking 
powers up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Is the minister saying that I am mistaken in my understanding that widespread concern 
has been expressed about RDAs taking over local authority responsibilities, particularly planning?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Absolutely right. The LGA has expressed concern about what the previous 
Administration did with English Partnerships. The powers relating to land use planning were in the 
Bill that the previous Adminstration enacted. English Partnerships is a very good organisation, so we 
have taken what happened with that into our Bill. There are concerns about that, and we shall 
continue to address them.
<P>
I cannot give figures for the costs. They vary because, for example, Yorkshire and Humberside 
assembly or the North-West Partnership will be funded by a balance between public and private 
sector. We shall find out what the balance will be and I guess that it will vary considerably. I know 
that there has been an offer for the embryo RDA in London to be fully funded by the private sector, 
picking nothing out of the public purse. It will vary, but I shall try to get some useful figures.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Hepburn) expressed concerns for the northern 
region. We are trying to move all of England forward at the same rate to address the economic deficit. 
I know that the north has been a pioneer in this area for a long time, through the Northern 
Development Company. We will move as quickly as possible to give powers to RDAs to address the 
economic deficit. We will then give the people of the north the opportunity to address the democratic 
deficit by determining whether they want a directly elected regional assembly.
<P>
I can tell my hon. Friend that the word “consultation” has been brought into disrepute over the 
past 18 years. Like other words in the English language, we will use that word properly. Consultation 
will mean consultation, and we shall take it seriously. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I 
have gone around England, we have found people receptive to the new development of Ministers 
consulting genuinely.
<P>
We hope that the environment and the voluntary sector can be factored in, not only for the RDAs 
but within the chamber structure. We hope that partnership will develop to allow us to address such 
serious issues as the environment, which is a particular concern in the north-east.
<P>
I do not know what world the hon. Member for Cheadle lives in. I took part in an hour-long 
programme for television in the north-west, along with the right hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. 
Ancram). An audience of 150 cross-examined us for an hour. The local television company 
commissioned a MORI poll and ran a phone-in—[Interruption.] I am justified in putting this 
point, as all 150 senior industrialists and representatives of local authorities spent an hour questioning 
us and supported our proposals overwhelmingly on a show of hands. the television company’s poll 
found 85 per cent. supporting RDAs and directly elected regional assemblies. That was in the north-
west, the very area where the hon. Member for Cheadle argues that there is no support. There were 
several Conservative Members present in the audience, along with local leaders. All were present to 
ask questions about the proposals.
<P>
The British aerospace industry is important for the well-being of the nation. I was with 
representatives of the company British Aerospace last night, discussing the regional dimension and 
the European Union fifth framework, in which they want a 50:50 partnership across Europe.
<P>
I do not accept that the need is not there. If the region is as successful as has been argued, the 
most striking figure is in the table on page 12 of the White Paper. Regardless of what the hon. 
Member for South Suffolk says, I do not think that 89 per cent. in GDP per capita terms, relative to 
Europe at 100, is good in terms of wealth creation for the north-west. People want those issues to be 
addressed.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham isabsolutely right. We are trying to remove 
theOpposition’s blinkers. We have already proposed the modernisation of the planning system, which 
the Labour Government introduced in 1947. As Opposition Members know, we introduced the first 
major planning Act 50 years ago. We introduced the concept of the greenbelt and of national parks. 
We shall now revisit and modernise the planning system. On regional planning guidance, we shall 
strengthen the system, in line with what we are doing with RDAs.
<P>
As my hon Friend the Member for Gillingham said, for the first time in 20 years, a White Paper 
on an integrated transport system is being published. I am not now at liberty to disclose what is in that 
White Paper, other than to say that there will be a strong linkage between land use planning, spatial 
planning and economic development. The DETR is about protecting the environment, wealth creation 
and delivery. The White Paper on integrated transport will play a major regional role.
<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton expressed anxiety over the accountability of land use planning. I 
assure the hon. Lady that land use planning will not be an RDA issue. It will remain within the 
democratic process, whether it be at national, local or regional level. That is why we have issued 
consultation papers to ensure that we can improve the planning system. At the regional level, we want 
to move towards spatial planning. That is the connection between RDAs, chambers, land use planning 
and, eventually, the White Paper on integrated transport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Is the Minister aware that the only anxieties about RDAs that any constituent has 
expressed to me are about the publication of those documents and the threat posed to the greenbelt by 
the establishment of such agencies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We still seek answers to several questions. The Minister raised the question of 
modernising the planning system. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle said, it appears that the 
Government’s interpretation of that phrase is ending the protection of the greenbelt. One of the 
cornerstones of our planning system for the past 50 years is now being cynically thrown aside in 
pursuit of some rather obscure political aim.
<P>
The Minister referred more than once to the Local Government Association. Perhaps he would 
like to reflect on what it said about clause 8:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Clause 8 is the key clause setting out the relationship between the RDA and the regional 
interests represented on the regional chamber. As bodies appointed by Ministers, it is vital that RDAs 
are accountable at regional level to ensure that they are able to respond to regional needs. Although 
the Bill proposes in Clause 8 that the RDA should ‘have regard’ to views expressed by the chamber, 
this is a weak form of regional accountability, a relationship based on consultation is 
insufficient.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems to contradict the Minister’s assertions about the LGA’s support for the structure as 
proposed in the Bill.
<P>
I should like to return to the question of stakeholders. The Minister, for a reason that is unclear, 
referred to a section of chapter 10 of the White Paper, which deals with RDA boards and is not about 
regional chambers. He has still not told us how a body that wants to be designated a chamber should 
compose the membership of that body. Whom should it ensure is represented?
<P>
