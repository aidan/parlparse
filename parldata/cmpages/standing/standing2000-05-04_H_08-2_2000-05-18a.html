[Continuation from column 278]
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 63, in page 161, line 26, after `Treasury', insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`after consulting the industries concerned'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a simple, straightforward but important amendment. Paragraph 49 deals with the question of energy-intensive installations. Paragraph 50 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Treasury may make provision by regulations for varying the installations covered by paragraph 49.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is rather peremptory. Our amendment would oblige the Treasury to consult before making such regulations. I am fairly sure that the Financial Secretary will tell me that it would not dream of doing otherwise, but it seems appropriate that the obligation to consult should be in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman has partly anticipated my response. The intention of the provision to make regulations to vary installations covered by paragraph 49 is that the list should keep in step with the installations in parts Al and A2 of the pollution prevention and control regulations. They give effect to the requirements of the IPPC directive that we talked about before our break. The regulations are currently out for consultation, so it is not possible to given the final list of installations in paragraph 49. Any changes will be made only after the consultation.
<P>
If there are any changes to the regulations in future, paragraph 50 will allow the installations covered by paragraph 49 to be varied accordingly. The proposed regulations will be subject to parliamentary approval. The affirmative procedure will apply, so there will be an opportunity for fulfil parliamentary consideration. I hope that the hon. Gentleman finds that reassuring.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I find that reassuring, and I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for that reply. We wanted to hear that there would be consultation, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 102, in page 165, line 9, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(g) the making of a taxable supply gives rise to a double charge to levy within the meaning of paragraph 19A.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 103, in page 165, line 13, after `supply' insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(or, in such a case as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(g), one of the supplies)'. [Mr. Timms.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 114, in page 170, line 40, leave out `10' and insert `3'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 112, in page 171, leave out lines 7 and 8.
<P>
No. 113, in page 188, leave out lines 32 and 33.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The amendment deals with a technical point about the interest on amounts assessed. If a credit has been wrongly claimed because of an innocent mistake, a high rate of interest could be charged. In our judgment, that is disproportionate. If penalty interest is to be charged, the commissioners should have to show fraud or negligence on the part of the levy payer. The Bill adds 10 percentage points to the rate already specified in the Finance Act 1996.
<P>
Paragraph 68(8)(c) excludes acting ``in good faith'' from the scope of ``a reasonable excuse''. In our judgment, that will merely make matters worse. Amendments Nos. 113 would delete that provision and give the tribunal much more discretion if a genuine mistake has been made for one reason or another.
<P>
The tribunal will have extraordinary discretion. As I am sure the Financial Secretary will point out, under paragraph 68(6) it will be able to reduce the amount payable to nil. However, such wide discretion for the commissioners strikes us as inappropriate. That is why we believe that the additional rate should be three percentage points, rather than 10 as provided for in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As the hon. Gentleman says, amendment No. 114 would reduce the rate of penalty interest to three percentage points above what might be termed ordinary interest, from 10 percentage points as provided for in paragraph 68(5), but only in circumstances involving an overclaim of credit or interest.
<P>
Penalty interest is set at a higher rate to provide both commercial restitution for money outstanding and an element of penalty. The penalty element is payable only when the trader has made an erroneous claim for repayment of levy or interest. In addition to ensuring that the Treasury is not treated as an inexpensive alternative to a bank, the penalty acts as a disincentive to carelessness falling short of dishonesty, and is proportional to the amount involved. However, as with all such matters, a safeguard has been provided in that customs can mitigate the penalty in circumstances of genuine difficulty or, failing that, the trader can appeal to an independent tribunal against the imposition of penalty interest.
<P>
In proposing a reduction to three percentage points above the ordinary rate of interest that is applied to levy on returns that are submitted and paid late, the hon. Gentleman is drawing a distinction between penalty interest due under paragraph 68, which he wants to reduce, and penalty interest due under paragraph 84, which would remain at 10 percentage points above the ordinary rate. The same provision can be found in the arrangements for the landfill tax, which the previous Government introduced. A valid distinction cannot be drawn between the two sets of circumstances. I hope that that will provide us with a consensual basis for the provision, and that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 112 and 113 would delete the references to one of the cases that is not considered to constitute grounds for reduction of the penalty for a default that gives rise to penalty interest or a civil penalty. The Bill specifies three cases that are not to be taken into account—insufficiency of funds; no loss of levy; and good faith. The amendments would delete the references to the third case—good faith on the part of the person liable to pay the interest or penalty or a person acting on his behalf.
<P>
Section 70 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994, which a Conservative Government introduced, albeit a considerable time ago, contains exactly the same provision. If Opposition Members want to argue against the provision, it is incumbent on them to justify doing so on the basis of circumstances that do not also apply to value added tax. I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman has done so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I hope—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Vernon Coaker </B>(Gedling): I hear thunder. It must be a warning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It is indeed.
<P>
The Financial Secretary raised two important points. We were aware of one of them, but not the other. He was right to refer to paragraph 84. We did not table an amendment to that and I accept the Financial Secretary's logic that there is no reason for amending paragraph 68 and not paragraph 84. If the hon. Gentleman is to take the right action, he should amend both. The same logic applies to VAT about which we are well aware although, alas, clearly the Financial Secretary is not. I forgive him for that because is a busy man. We have prepared a policy statement to the effect that significant changes should be made to how VAT is levied. Included in that statement is the idea that it should not be presumed that people are guilty.
<P>
I accept the Financial Secretary's point that we are as responsible as the present Government for the problem—more so, genetically. The sorry history of VAT is that it should have been brought within the scope of the Inland Revenue for various reasons, which I shall not trouble the Committee with. It landed up in the hands of HM Customs and Excise because, for other historical reasons, that organisation had always been charged with tasks in which they had generally to find villains, and the presumption was always one of guilt. Unfortunately, that logic has applied to the Bill.
<P>
If the private citizen, when claiming back what is probably the most complex and horrible tax since advance corporation tax, is to be charged a 10 per cent. penalty rate—a fine—when he has acted in good faith under the terms of the Bill, surely when Customs and Excise makes error, it should pay a penalty. I accept that customs always acts in good faith in the sense that its officials are not out for themselves and carry out their duties as well as they can. However, its officials make mistakes because, like the rest of us, they are only human. There should be some symmetry. It cannot be right that, when the private citizen acts in the same way as another private citizen who happens to be employed by the state, a penalty rate is payable in one case, but not in the other. That situation is unjust. I admit that such an injustice runs through some other parts of tax legislation. I hope that the Financial Secretary will attend to it and, if he does not accept the amendment, that he will table his own proposal later in our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman often has a nice line in attacking the actions of previous Conservative Governments, and I would not want to deter him from exploring such territory. In defending paragraph 84, I feel that I am on safe ground. It reflects what is in the landfill tax regulations and associated legislation, which was introduced by the right hon. Member for Wells, so I know that he agrees with me at least on the matter under discussion. The rate will not be applied to a private citizen because the levy applies only to business. The arrangement has been set in that context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for saying that. In due course, I shall cut out and frame that part of the excellent Hansard report of our proceedings. It shows the essence of the Government's approach to the measure, which is that they do not regard business as consisting of individuals. It is an extraordinary idea. Business is, is it not, a private activity involving private individuals? We are drawing a contrast between those private activities of private individuals that will be clobbered and the public activities of other individuals that will not be clobbered.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 115, in page 175, leave out lines 30 to 43.
<P>
Paragraph 76(4) allows an estimate of levy for a later period to be increased, on a basis other than facts about that later period and as a punishment for failing to make a return for an earlier period. It allows the commissioners to make an estimate for a sum
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that is greater than the amount that they would have considered appropriate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not think that I have encountered anything as extraordinary as that. What are we doing in the legislation? Are we giving commissioners carte blanche to pluck figures out of the sky? That is unacceptable to the Opposition. If assessments are estimated, they should always be made as accurately as possible, on the basis of available information. They should not be inflated as a punishment. To give the commissioners such a power is an extraordinary development and totally unacceptable to the Opposition.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It was not unacceptable to the Opposition when they introduced the landfill tax. The right hon. Member for Wells, who sadly is not present, was the Minister responsible for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> To pick up the Financial Secretary's current leitmotif, does the Minister think that the fact that we took a wrong position is a defence of that wrong position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am interested that the hon. Gentleman says that what his right hon. Friend did in 1996 was wrong. Conservative Members tell us that what we are doing is unacceptable to their party, yet not long ago they were doing exactly the same.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I would not be at all surprised if the Financial Secretary, when in opposition, argued that what he is now trying to do was unacceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that I did not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not remember exactly what line the Financial Secretary's predecessors took because I was otherwise engaged. I am sure that he did not argue that, but I wonder what his party argued when the landfill tax was proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I certainly do not recall any debate on this point.
<P>
The amendment would prevent the Commissioners of Customs and Excise from taking account of a trader's willingness to pay an assessment rather than render a return when deciding the amount of a subsequent assessment to be issued in the case of a further default. The commissioners have to use best judgment to decide the amount of an assessment. The purpose of the provision is to ensure that they can account for the fact that the trader was prepared to pay an earlier assessment rather than render a return and pay the correct amount of levy due. In those circumstances, it is a fair inference that the trader got off lightly when he paid the earlier assessment. If the trader thinks that the later assessment is too high, all he has to do is render a return stating the correct amount of levy due. He can readily do so.
<P>
The provision is entirely sensible. I have the comfort of knowing that that view is shared by the right hon. Member for Wells. I hope that the Committee will leave the provision in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The banter is jolly, but there is a problem. The Financial Secretary may want to continue in the guinea pig's wheel. For a long time, successive generations of Ministers from both parties have been captured by an official view that such actions by Customs and Excise and other such bodies are legitimate. He should rid himself of that Sir Humphreyism, because the matter is not party political. He should think of himself as another politician who has individual constituents and businesses to deal with. He should ask himself whether it is reasonable for a bureaucracy to deal with the public by trying to extract the right result—that is, what one wants in the end—by means of consciously mis-estimating in order to terrify. Is that what we want?
<P>
I accept responsibility for the previous Government, and it will no doubt turn out that previous Labour Governments acted in the same way. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood is right that there was outrage by shadow Financial Secretaries on previous occasions. Is it not time to stop going back and forth? We should consider the system in operation and ask whether we want to keep repeating that precedent in tax legislation. It is not necessary, and is most unpleasant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I was not going to join in, but it seems as though the claps of thunder and the flashes of lightning were a little bit premature. They should have come during this debate, one for each party, as the issue seems to be one of blame allocation on an unexpected scale. Each party's justification for its current course of action is reliant on what its predecessors did with previous legislation, which it readily confesses was wrong. I have been trying to untangle that.
<P>
I come to the Committee with two advantages over hon. Members on the Conservative and Labour Front Benches, as I was not in the House when the previous Government's legislation was discussed, and my party opposed the measure then and does so now. I am happy to make those points clear. While they argue about the blame, I would like to consider the principle of the provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that there was blame allocation. He is not participating in that at all, is he?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman. He is right that I come to the Committee with clean hands and a clean conscience. I intend to keep those hands clean and that conscience clear. I hope that the Financial Secretary will stop saying: ``Well, the Conservatives did it as well,'' and explain why it needs to be done now. I do not believe that he would really want to justify every action of his Government since 1997 solely on the basis that that is what the Conservatives did. I was under the impression that he sought election in 1997 to do something different from what they had done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I have explained to the Committee why the measure in the schedule is right. I am sad that the right hon. Member for Wells, who could not join us for this sitting, has not heard the attacks made on him by his hon. Friends. However, I am certainly not saying that the measure should be in the Bill simply because the previous Government also introduced it.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) has misunderstood something. He says that the measure sanctions customs to make a conscious mis-estimate That is not the case. We are simply allowing the commissioners to take account, in reaching an estimate, of whether the assessment was readily paid on a previous occasion. Commissioners can use that additional information—that is all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> My hon. Friend will recall that the hon. Member for West Dorset asked whether there were other examples of such a policy. I have no personal experience of the example that I am going to give, of course. Under parking regulations in Westminster, one's penalty is reduced from £80 to £40 if it is paid within 14 days. The hon. Gentleman referred to the setting of the penalty as terrorising people by making over estimates. There are all sorts of examples where account is taken of the effect on the recipients of the measure to urge prompt settlement and to prevent there being further administrative costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend that the measure is entirely proportionate. If an assessment is made that traders regard as too high, they can simply render a return that shows the correct amount of levy due, and that will be the end of the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I want to clarify something because, for Pepper v. Hart purposes, the Financial Secretary made a helpful and important statement. If it can be shown that a conscious mis-estimate has been made, it is intended that that should be an unlawful practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Does the hon. Member for Croydon, South wish to intervene?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am happy for the Financial Secretary to answer that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I hope that I am winding up the debate because I do not intend to contribute further to it. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the wording towards the end of paragraph 76(4). It explains that the commissioners
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may, in the assessment in relation to the later period, specify an amount of levy due that is greater than the amount that they would have considered to be appropriate had they had regard only to the later period.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the paragraph deals with what the commissioners can take account of in reaching their assessment.

<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 116, in page 183, line 36, leave out `in the belief that' and insert `with the intention that'.
<P>
The amendment is on a deeply legal point, and I wonder whether the Treasury has consulted the Lord Chancellor's Department on the matter. What is or is not a conspiracy is a fundamental principle of English law. Paragraph 93 allows plotting to evade to be am offence even if there is no conspiracy. In English law, a conspiracy is when two people get together with the intent of committing a crime. That, in itself, is a crime, even if the crime is not carried out. If I were to plan, with another person, to burgle St. Thomas' hospital and the idea was abandoned, we would be liable for conviction. Under the paragraph, I would be liable for conviction even if I had only intended to discuss burgling the hospital with that other person. My private thoughts of an intention to carry out a burglary would therefore be a crime, which has no precedent whatever in English law.
<P>
The Opposition have no sympathy with evaders, but the Financial Secretary should think hard about introducing such a dangerous legal precedent into the English legal system.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that there is no precedent in English law, but there is—
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The landfill tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Yes. It was introduced by his right hon. Friend the Member for Wells.
<P>
The purpose of the provision is to ensure that a person cam be charged with a criminal offence when he facilitates the evasion of the levy but does not evade it himself. For example, if a supplier and a customer entered into an agreement that a large amount of a taxable commodity would be provided at a favourable price, but no invoices were to be issued and the payment was to be cash, the customer would realise that levy would not be accounted for on the supply. Therefore, as the supplier is to be liable to criminal charges, the customer should be, too. After all, the fraud could not take place without the customer's willingness to enter into the arrangement. As I said, such a provision is specified in paragraph 15(5) of schedule 5 to the Finance Act 1996, under which the landfill tax was introduced. I share the view of the right hon. Member for Wells that it is necessary to protect revenue, but in the circumstances that I have described, rather than those to which the hon. Gentleman alluded. That may reassure him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am beginning to have my doubts about the landfill tax as a result of this debate. I accept the Financial Secretary's reply, and I am comforted by the fact that I may have misunderstood the provision. I must confess that, having stripped down the provision, my interpretation of it is that which I presented to you, Mr. Cook. However, if a precedent exists and was introduced by the previous Government, so be it. This is not the sort of amendment that I would press to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 193, line 4, after `person', insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`connected with the non-resident taxpayer and likely to be able to obtain access to the business records of that non-resident taxpayer'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 56, in page 193, line 36, leave out from `Schedule' to end of line 38.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Paragraph 112(1)(e) allows the commissioners
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to give a direction requiring a person specified in the direction to be treated as the appointed tax representative of a non-resident taxpayer so specified.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In our view, that is rather vague. It effectively allows them to appoint anyone as the representative of the non-resident taxpayer. The person might be unknown to the non-resident taxpayer or may not have access to the business records of the taxpayer. If he were unknown to the non-resident taxpayer, he could not be responsible for the administration of the tax. It is a dangerous precedent that will create bad law. I hope that the Financial Secretary will seriously reconsider introducing such a provision. I hope that he will not say that it is found in the arrangements for the landfill tax; we may have moved off that territory now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The precedent is not, in this instance, in the arrangements for the landfill tax, but a precedent does exist. A taxpayer who is not established in the United Kingdom must arrange for his tax liability to be properly discharged. If he fails to do so, customs must have the right to appoint someone to be his tax representative and to assume responsibility for liabilities.
<P>
Amendment No. 55 would greatly restrict customs' ability to direct someone to become a tax representative, as the person would have to have a close connection with the non-resident taxpayer and access to his business records. It would certainly be advantageous for everyone involved if the tax representative had a connection with and knowledge of the taxpayer, but in practice that might not always be possible.
<P>
Customs has a responsibility to secure revenue. The amendment would make that more difficult by preventing the appointment of anyone not connected with the taxpayer. In practice, a direction made under the Bill will usually apply to someone who has a connection to the taxpayer involved, should such a person exist. If such a person does not exist, customs must have the power to direct another person as it sees fit. As a safeguard against any unreasonable requirements, it will be possible to appeal against the terms of any such direction by reference to the VAT and duties tribunal.
<P>
Amendment No. 56 would remove any element of retrospective liability in respect of an appointed tax representative. It would create a loophole and make the recovery of any such debt difficult and perhaps impossible. Retrospective liability is not a new departure. It features in the insurance premium tax legislation introduced by the previous Government in the Finance Act 1994.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Financial Secretary has given us a charming history lesson. He appears to regard it as his role in office to uncover a series of ghastly deficiencies in tax law and then extensively employ them as precedents for replicating the problem I fail to see why we are arguing about the issue.
<P>
Our discussion on the previous amendments makes me cautious. I thought that the Financial Secretary had stated that we were mistaken in thinking that arbitrary action was taking place. When I pressed him, it turned out that he was not willing to state that, for example, Customs and Excise could not make a consciously misleading and incorrect assessment. I may have misunderstood the genuine effect, but let us get the situation extremely clear. To the layman, the two passages on page 193 of the Bill that we seek to amend appear to have the clear effect of getting Mr. or Mrs. X—not someone who is connected with or has access to a malfeasant non-resident taxpayer—appointed by the commissioner. Having been appointed, they are then, under paragraph 113(2), which we seek to amend in amendment No. 56, ``under a duty''—a duty which, it turns out, includes obligations and liabilities arising or incurred before they became tax representatives.
<P>
The image conveyed by the paragraph is that of Mr. and Mrs. X, wandering happily down Baker Street or Dorchester High Street, being nobbled by someone from the commissioner's office and told: ``You are the lucky chap,''—or chapess—``who is hereby representative of this malfeasant non-resident taxpayer. You have just won the pools and have become liable for all the past payment deficiencies by that person you have never heard of, with whom you have no connection, to whose records you have no access and about whom you were previously blissfully unaware.''
<P>
I do not say that that is what the commissioners will generally do. We could write all sorts of legislation and then say that no one would dream of implementing it. It may not matter if it is written in such a way that if it were implemented as written it would be ludicrous, but that is not a good way to enact laws—in fact, it is an astonishingly bad way to do so. I freely accept, before the Financial Secretary points it out—I hope this time without crowing about it—that we may have been passing laws in that way for a long time. That is not the shred of an excuse for continuing to do so.
<P>
If the Financial Secretary can clearly spell out why the circumstances that I have just described cannot occur under the law—I mean not that they are unlikely to do so because people are likely to exercise their discretion, but that they cannot occur under the law—we would be happy to withdraw the amendments. If he cannot give us that explicit assurance and a power is given to the commissioners to choose an innocent and unconnected individual and make them liable for something about which they had no previous knowledge, that is an outrage. The Financial Secretary must realise that and, surely to goodness, should accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Financial Secretary drew attention to the insurance premium tax, as a precedent for the measure. As his predecessor in office, who put that tax on the statute book, perhaps I can offer an historical perspective on it. My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset is right that there was an oversight for which I, as one of the Treasury Ministers at the time, accept responsibility. We left unnecessarily wide the discretion on who is appointed as the tax representative and in what circumstances. The Financial Secretary will no doubt say that we need to be able to identify somebody to answer for a particular taxpayer in the case of malfeasance; where that person is offshore, I understand and basically accept that principle. The argument of my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset is that such a power must be exercised within the confines of reasonable discretion. It is not that the underlying principle of the measure is wrong We legislated for that in the insurance premium tax. It is a correct principle. Perhaps it is even more appropriate in relation to that tax when the service can easily be offered from offshore. It is much easier to offer insurance from offshore than, for example, a supply of gas. We want the framework within which the discretion under the Bill can be exercised to be set down in law or in supporting secondary legislation.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> First, I will respond to the hon. Member for West Dorset. I reassure him that Customs and Excise cannot consciously make an erroneous judgment. It is required to use best judgment and, by definition, a consciously erroneous judgment would not qualify.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary. He has been extremely helpful. The force of law will clarify the interpretation of the measure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am glad to have been of assistance. It is important to make directions. The unconnected person who might be appointed could be a person with power of attorney or a liquidator. The liquidator may have been appointed by the court and not on the taxpayer's application. Such an arrangement would be excluded by the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I wish first to conclude my argument. The exercise will be a constraint for reasonableness and normal judicial review principles will be applied by the tribunal. It would be wrong to make it impossible for Customs and Excise to act in the way I have described because there will be circumstances in which it will have to so act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I accept that the power must be exercised within the confines of the over-arching principle of reasonableness. It is up to my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South to determine what we should argue collectively, but I think that the Financial Secretary should reconsider whether there is a way in which the broad drafting of the provision can be confined. The person who is at risk of being appointed a tax representative and held accountable for the malfeasance of the taxpayer should be someone who is defined as having a pre-existing relationship with the taxpayer or one that arises from a decision of the court or a law enforcement agency.
<P>
I am thinking on my feet, but will the Financial Secretary say whether the commissioners would want to appoint anyone as a tax representative who was not either someone who had a pre-existing relationship that gave him access to information and papers or someone who was appointed as a result of a separate and independent legal process? Who else might the commissioners want to appoint as a tax representative? If the answer is no one, I suggest to the Financial Secretary not that he accepts the principle—it was developed on my feet, which is not a good basis for making law—but that he owes it to the Committee to consider whether there is a way to confine what seems to be a wide discretion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I agree with my right hon. Friend, who makes the point better than I could. I hope that the Financial Secretary will reflect on the matter. I certainly have no problem with the drafting. His argument may be right, but I think that the court is more likely to interpret the term ``connected'' in this instance as including a liquidator, which was the case that was given. It is certain that a liquidator has or is likely to be able to obtain access to the business records. I doubt whether the reference to the way in which the amendment would work was correct.
<P>
If the amendment's drafting is deficient, it should be changed. Clearly one wants to restrict it to the case that my right hon. Friend described, or to an employee or subsidiary of the non-resident taxpayer. I should have thought that the matter was common ground. I hope that the Financial Secretary will tell us that he will consider it. In those circumstances, we would be happy not to insist on the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> A thought came into my mind as I listened to this interesting exchange. If the Financial Secretary remains convinced that the part of the schedule to which the amendments refer is as he would want, why does he not agree to some sort of provision to enable persons so named or identified who felt that they were inappropriate, ill equipped and basically not right for the representative function to say to the commissioners: ``Not me, guv. I am not the person to do it''? I am not certain whether the provision enables someone to make a representation to the commissioners.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The provision that the right hon. Member for Fylde seeks exists. A review and an appeal are available. However, I am happy to reflect on what he said.
<P>
I cannot see why hon. Members should fear that an arbitrary person in Dorchester High Street might be alighted on by Customs and Excise officers to fulfil the role. I cannot envisage circumstances in which that would happen, but I am happy to reflect on the points that have been made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall not detain the Committee more than a minute, but I want to explain that the breadth of the drafting gives rise to a worry. This is not a black and white item; there are grey cases. Someone may not be so distant from the malfeasant non-resident taxpayer as the person in my consciously extreme case and the breadth of discretion could lead the commissioners to identify someone as a representative merely because he is easy to get hold of, has sufficient funds to pay and has some rather tenuous link that makes it not wholly unreasonable to choose him. That is a level of discretion one that I suspect might be challenged under human rights legislation that gives rise to a set of possibilities that we do not want in official actions.
<P>
I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for being willing to consider the issue again, and I expect that my right hon. and hon. Friends will agree that we can withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 57, in page 194, line 13, leave out `The' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Where some members of a group have requested such treatment, the'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment deals with the situation in which companies may be grouped together for the purposes of the schedule. It is far from clear why such grouping may be desirable, but if some utilities wish to have it, they should not be prevented from applying for it. However, because there is no input tax it is not immediately apparent that avoidance could be engaged in by the act of grouping. No doubt, Customs and Excise would wish to be able under regulations to introduce appropriate measures, but such measures should not be permissible in secondary legislation.
<P>
In the absence of overriding control, it seems to be open to Customs and Excise to use the powers under paragraph 114(2)(e) and (3)(c) to introduce a holding company or other group of companies as guarantors. That should not be permissible at any time, but it is particularly inappropriate when the regulators must cut some margins to a level at which those affected may need to sell off peripheral businesses. The introduction of a grouping covering such companies would complicate the disposal arrangements, possibly to the extent of making purchasers withdraw.
<P>
Customs should be able to action their extensive powers, which in relation to VAT is to be introduced under primary legislation, only in the event of a grouping being requested. It would be unacceptable for customs to be given the power to introduce grouping when none existed purely to create a guarantee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am not sure what the amendment is driving at, but the matter may be settled if I give the hon. Gentleman an assurance. If there is concern that the commissioners might force companies to form groups against their will—
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am encouraged by the hon. Gentleman's assent. The Commissioners of Customs and Excise have no intention of taking such action. Group treatment is intended to be an administrative convenience only. It will be available as an option for corporate groups. Unlike the treatment for VAT groups, supplies between group members will be liable to the levy in the normal way. The purpose of the group is to enable only one climate change levy return to be submitted, when otherwise a group might have to submit several separate returns. I am happy to assure the Committee that the regulations will make it clear that group treatment will be available only when a suitable application is made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> We are delighted to receive the Financial Secretary's assurance. I am sure that it reflects his intention, which will be carried through into the regulations. In that case, why does the hon. Gentleman not accept the amendment or some variant of it to make it clear that grouping can apply only when at least one member of the group has sought it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I cannot do that because there is a problem in the amendment's drafting. It could mean that the commissioners may make separate regulations for each request, which would not be sensible. I hope that I have clarified our intention and that the Committee is now reassured by that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We shall not press the amendment to a Division, given that the Financial Secretary agreed with our point to a certain extent. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 195, line 49, leave out `the Commissioners think fit' and insert `is reasonably appropriate.'
<P>
The amendment deals with death, which brings me to the point that I made when I asked the Financial Secretary to explain the Wednesbury test and the reasonable man test. In the event of death, the commissioners will be involved in securing continuity in the application of the schedule. That hardly chimes with the Human Rights Act 1998. A reasonableness test should be included, and that is why we have tabled the amendment.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The purpose of the provision is to protect revenue. The commissioners have been charged with collecting the levy, and it is right that they should have the power to decide the circumstances in which regulations are required to secure continuity. It is also proper to provide that people who carry on a business are liable to account for the levy. If Parliament believes that the Commissioners of Customs and Excise are being unreasonable in their regulations, it can annul the regulations through a resolution of the House. That safeguard will always be available. The provision is reasonable and proportionate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I cannot agree, and I wonder whether the Financial Secretary means what he says. Technically, he is absolutely right, but I wonder how many regulations issued by commissioners he has in his time in the House found himself reading in the Lobby, the Library or the Tea Room, and how often it has occurred to him as a matter of ordinary practice to pray against them. How often has he witnessed the House annulling them? That is a fiction, although I admit that it exists, legally speaking. Indeed, he may even be able to find a precedent in which my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells was involved, but by and large such matters go unnoticed.
<P>
The provision reflects a general tone of voice that will, incidentally, be used as a precedent by the Minister's successors and their successors. We are being asked to agree that the commissioners may make
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such other provision as the Commissioners think fit for securing continuity in the application of this Schedule,
<P>
without restriction.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It seems clear that it would be within the scope of the provision for the commissioners to make regulations—the provision relates to regulations, not am action or an administrative decision—that are unreasonable according to the Wednesbury test. I do not believe that it would be possible to defeat a set of regulations that become subordinate legislation under primary legislation on the grounds of Wednesbury unreasonableness. It would be interesting to hear whether the Financial Secretary has echoes behind him that will challenge that belief by funding a precedent, but it would be extremely surprising for commissioners' regulations, as opposed to decisions, to be struck down by a court.
<P>
The provision will give the commissioners unrestricted ability to make regulations. No doubt they will in practice by and large make perfectly sensible regulations, but on that basis, we do not need the wretched provision; indeed, we do not need most of the Finance Bill or most other legislation. We need simply say that the commissioners should tax people sensibly and specify the taxes that they should raise.
<P>
We have a complex structure of law that is designed precisely to limit the scope of executive action. It has a rather long history attached to it, with which I do not intend to bore the Committee, and of which the Financial Secretary is perfectly aware. It is not a defence to say of such a Bill that in practice the power will probably be exercised reasonably. The point of legislation is to constrain executive action so that it is reasonable by law, and not because we hope and expect that the people appointed will be reasonable.
<P>
Discretion does not come any wider than ``as they think fit''. The provision does not specify ``as they reasonably think fit'', or ``as they think fit in light of the circumstances'', or place any other constraint on the discretion. The Financial Secretary must provide a better argument than the one that he has provided.

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Customs and Excise does, of course, act reasonably, which is why we are not constantly being asked to annul its regulations. All the secondary legislation involved will be discussed in detail with representatives of fuel and power companies. Customs and Excise will make initial regulations available in draft form for consultation, and the regulations will be subject to the usual parliamentary procedures. I do not believe that this provision, or, indeed, any other in the schedule, constitutes grounds for alarm.

Question, accordingly negatived.
<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 196, line 9, after `(b)', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`where the transferee has asked to use the same registration number as the transferor,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have tabled the amendment as a probing amendment. A transfer of going concerns is a mixed blessing for VAT purposes and can cause problems. When a transferee takes over the registration number of the transferor, he can be liable, as a result of the decision in the Ponsonby case, for the transferor's deficiencies in VAT. However, he is not liable if he insists on a new registration number. It is inappropriate that Customs and Excise should be able to transfer compliance liability to the transferee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The purpose of paragraph 117 is to secure continuity in the application of the climate change levy if a business is transferred to another person as a going concern. The mechanics necessary for that include the possible transfer of the registration number. Such administration is properly a matter for regulations, which is why it is in the VAT regulations. The provision for a transfer of the registration number is a trade facilitation and if the transferee wants that, he must also take on the debts and credits of the transferor. That is voluntary and the transferee should ensure that he is fully aware of the financial state of the business before agreeing to the transfer. The amendment is not necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister seems to say that the transferee must get a lawyer. However, as this is a probing amendment and we are grateful for his explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 60, in page 201, line 19, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) Where a person is the recipient of supplies of taxable commodities there shall be no obligation upon him
<P>
(a) to compile any information, or
<P>
(b) to retain any records in addition to those he is obliged to retain under the provisions of the Taxes Management Act 1970
<P>
unless and until he has been given reasonable written notice of such information and records by the Commissioners.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, the amendment covers a simple point. To allow compliance, there should be a reasonable period before information can be given to the Commissioners. Notice should be given in writing. That is simply a matter of courtesy. I would not have thought that the Financial Secretary would be too troubled by the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We have previously announced exclusions and reductions relating to the climate change levy. The application of exemptions and climate change levy agreement reductions is likely to be by way of a self-certificate provided by the person receiving the supplies of taxable commodities. Certificates will be sent to the supplying utility, which will make the appropriate deductions before calculating the climate change levy chargeable. The system will ensure that relief is given at source and will have cash flow advantages for the consumers involved.
<P>
To ensure that the reliefs are correctly claimed, the information used to create the certificates must be verifiable. Records will have to be maintained by consumers involved in the self-certification system. I should emphasise that, of the millions of consumers receiving energy supplies, only a small number—in the thousands will operate the self-certification system. For the vast majority, there will be no involvement and no requirement to maintain records for that purpose. They will merely receive and pay their fuel invoices in the normal way.
<P>
To ensure that no undue burden is placed on those involved in the scheme, Customs and Excise is working with colleagues from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and Government agencies to develop a system that is as straightforward and simple as possible, both for energy suppliers and for consumers. Regulations will be laid in due course, specifying the circumstances in which records will be necessary and the form that they should take. They are likely to consist mostly of the energy consumption data that many enterprises already keep.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> In the light of that explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 61, in page 211, line 5, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may also discuss amendment No. 62, in page 211, leave out lines 7 and 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> When a businessman who receives supplies from an unregistered person is liable to register, he must be placed on notice and must be given a tax invoice by his supplier. The thinking behind the amendment is straightforward. Those replying to the first consultation on the levy were said to have opted unanimously for the compulsory issue of a tax invoice. The measure in the draft legislation, which is repeated here, noted only that the circumstances in which that would be required was when suppliers wished to operate a bad debt relief scheme. While it seems unlikely that any firm of any size would choose not to do so, the possibility of that option not being taken and of a supplier choosing not to issue invoices when appropriate under the preceding provisions of the schedule, should not be regarded as a mere technicality.
<P>
Under paragraph 38(2), the recipient of supplies from a non-resident who is not a utility is required to register an account for t he levy. In the absence of a system requiring registered suppliers to provide an invoice, how is a person to know whether he falls into that category? The issue is complicated by paragraph 152(c), which makes an unincorporated business resident if one of its members has
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a usual place of residence in the United Kingdom.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will appreciate that the point is administrative and is complicated. The best thing would be for him to say that he recognised the concerns raised and that he would reflect on them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am in some difficulty, Mr. Cook. I think that you called amendments Nos. 61 and 62, which relate to paragraph 141 of the schedule, but the hon. Gentleman was referring to paragraph 152.
<P>
The issue at stake is whether the word ``may'' should be used rather than the word ``shall''. The use of the word ``may'' rather than ``shall'' is common practice, and I have no shortage of precedents with which I could regale the Committee. I see no reason to depart from common practice in this instance. Climate change levy accounting documents will be used only by suppliers of electricity and gas. They are not necessary to administer supplies of other commodities, for which invoices will continue to be used. We do not want to widen the scope of the regulations to cover supplies that, by definition, will not be administered by the regulations.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I emphasise that the concept of a climate change levy accounting document is new and has resulted from a great deal of discussion with the industries concerned. We want to be able to provide for regulations to deal with the detail. The use of regulations in that way is accepted practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister said that he did not understand my comments on the amendment; I must confess that I did not understand his response either. We had better leave it at that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. During the process of line-by-line scrutiny, the Chairman is required to stay awake, so I hope that the Committee will do the same.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Sixth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not intend to be in the slightest bit deterred by the sedentary tut-tutting of the Government Whip.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): It was me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise to the Government Whip. for once, it was not he who was sedentarily tut-tutting.
<P>
We have now had the opportunity to review the whole of this ghastly schedule. Notwithstanding your remarks about the Committee going to sleep, Mr. Cook, the debate has been a fascinating enterprise in many respects. I feel sure that many of the hon. Members who are present will have the opportunity to engage in the repeal of the legislation in due course. It is a remarkable piece of legislation altogether. It will introduce what is probably the least happy, or least happily constructed, tax that has been introduced for a very long time. It is certainly one of the most complicated.
<P>
What has come out of our scrutiny of the schedule is that its complexities, inordinate length, arbitrarinesses and other bizarre features have a history behind them. That history starts with a good intention, as the road to legislative hell often does. The Government wanted to introduce legislation that would diminish the amount of carbon dioxide that is sent into our atmosphere. There is no conflict between the Government and Opposition Members on that aim: the Government wanted to do the right thing. They probably started with a carbon tax or an energy tax that was properly conceived and which was the sort of measure that all hon. Members have discussed. That would have been a tax on the right party: the producers.
<P>
However, various things got in the way of that approach, as we have seen during our consideration of the Bill as a whole. In the first place, the Government were determined not to end up with a tax that would have to be paid by householders who needed energy but who were not well off. No doubt that explains the first fundamental problem: the Government were driven from taxing the right people to taxing the wrong people. They were driven away from taxing consumers of electricity, gas and other such commodities instead of producers, because they wanted to be able to distinguish between consumers that they were going to tax—the bad consumers, such as poor old British business—

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> My hon. Friend is on to the right point. Earlier, I invited the Financial Secretary to enlarge on the distinction between benign and malign activities. My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset is right. The Financial Secretary has to address that question because he is taxing individual producers and seeking to distinguish between benign and malign producers when he surely started out with the policy objective of cutting energy consumption. By his definition, the tax is distortive for 60 per cent. of the tax burden, as it affects manufacturing industry which saves 50 per cent. of all energy consumption.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. The first stage in the definition of malign in the schedule is that business is malign and domestic consumers are benign. That is a recurrent theme. That is not surprising, as the Government have done more than any previous British Administration to tax business. The next thing that the Government discovered, as the schedule makes clear, is that some businesses are more malign than others. Therefore, the Government tried to find ways of distinguishing them. The Financial Secretary is obviously put out and lacks his normal good-humoured courtesy, as we saw when I half-heartedly suggested the use of a banana index. He obviously has something far more professional to offer: the IPPC index. That bears no more relation to the matter in hand than the banana index does, but it sounds better.
<P>
The fact is that, having decided that some businesses are malign and some are very malign and to tax the more malign more heavily and the less malign less heavily, the next problem was to create a definition of degree. The Financial Secretary found that his officials had all sorts of reasons why most of the rational definitions would not work. They came up with this marvellously irrational means of defining who will be liable for more and who will be liable for less of the tax.
<P>
Next, as no one at the Treasury who knew anything about economics was available—the people who did were presumably too busy doing something else—the Government decided that it would be much better if the tax fell heavily on sectors of British industry that can ill afford a tax on marginal costs. They tried to make sure as far as possible that they avoided that eventuality through the more malign, less malign definitions. However, as they were using irrational definitions they ended up imposing the tax on a large number of people who cannot afford it.
<P>
But then things got worse, because of one of their colleagues, who has been immensely active and was indeed active in Treasury questions today. The hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) has a powerful mind and is a powerful rhetorician, and he stood up no doubt somewhere in Whitehall and said: ``Goodness me, you must not allow the tax to discriminate between people who actually produce a lot of carbon and people who do not produce a lot of carbon, or between people who buy from people who produce a lot of carbon and people who do not, because that would land us with the most dreadful of all eventualities: it would discriminate in favour of the nuclear industry, which produces no carbon dioxide at all. That would destroy the coal industry.'' Therefore, the Government came up with the present marvellous version of the tax—another set of clauses that we had to look at—which managed by hook and by crook to define means of ensuring that we have the world's first example of a crypto-carbon tax, which actually falls on electricity produced by nuclear means, which produces no carbon whatsoever.
<P>
Then it turned out that there was precious little way to create any effect on even the most malign, who would be most heavily taxed on energy consumption, because there would be no incentive to do anything. The real incentive would be to skip the country and build a factory somewhere else. So the Government came up with the brilliant idea of agreement, which is the most profound part of the brilliance of the schedule—for the benefit of Labour Members, I flash the irony card. It is the first time in the history of British legislation that the commissioners have been given the specific power to make arbitrary agreements, with not just particular classes of taxpayer but particular taxpayers, to reduce a tax by 80 per cent.
<P>
I have no doubt that in next year's Finance Bill Committee, the Financial Secretary and his successors will tell us that this is a precedent. The commissioners will be able to engage in all sorts of agreements with taxpayers to change their tax bill for reasons that are to be negotiated in private deals between officials and businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman is correct to say that that sets a precedent. Surely, the situation that he describes already occurs with respect to inheritance tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. One deficiency of inheritance tax is the fact that it bears some similarity to this provision, although the discretion in this case is wider, to avoid massive avoidance of a tax that is hugely complex. The complexity is a consequence of a history of mistakes and tergiversations and efforts to correct those mistakes and tergiversations. It has become apparent that there is great potential for tax avoidance and great potential for anti-avoidance measures—hence the huge discretion. The draftsman was sent away and asked to look for any precedent that would maximise discretion for Customs and Excise. At the end of all that, we have a tax, benevolent in origin, which tries to achieve a decent result, but which, because of a series of political problems on the way, has become ludicrously complicated and arbitrary in its action. It gives Customs and Excise colossal new powers and, notwithstanding the remarks of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), it will be used as a precedent for future, equally deficient, legislation.
<P>
The right thing to do is to remove the schedule wholesale, start again, and produce a halfway decent tax that has the intended effect, as opposed to a tax—this is the final and spectacular irony—that will have no measurable impact at all, but which will have a significant impact on tens of thousands of British citizens.
<P>
I say all that in the public interest. If I were acting in the political interests of my party, I would take the opposite position and vote in favour of the schedule, because I think that the schedule will do the Conservatives more good than the whole of the rest of the Bill or all the activities of the Government put together. When the election comes, we shall have great fun wandering around the country talking to people in little convenience stores and explaining to them the wonders of this tax. From that point of view, I welcome the schedule, which makes a marvellous contribution to the advancement of the Conservative cause. It is just a pity that, on the way, the economy of the country, the smooth functioning of business and the proper relationship between bureaucracy and business will be severely compromised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I remind the Committee that the Liberal Democrats supported clause 30 when it was debated by a Committee of the whole House. We support the principle of a sensible and reasonable tax on the use of carbon by industry and by all consumers. We also believe that it is right to tilt the balance to encourage a lower carbon output from consumers. We want to see a switch from fossil-based to non-carbon-producing fuels. We want to see efficiency improvements in the consumption of energy. Plenty of well accepted academic studies show that existing technology could be applied at a nil cost that could reduce energy consumption by between 20 per cent. and 30 per cent.
<P>
We want efficiency, a reduction in consumption and fuel switching. We supported clause 30 because it pointed in the right direction. We took the optimist's view that the glass was half full rather than the pessimist's view that it was half empty. However, we have grave reservations about schedule 6, which I expressed on Second Reading and which I hope have been expressed effectively in Committee.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Schedule 6 is a mess. It is not based on the carbon output of fuels. It does not even give full exemption to all renewable sources of electricity generation. Nor does its introduction give the industries affected by it long enough to make sensible investment plans. We moved amendments during the previous two sittings to address each of those issues. Sadly, none of our questions or doubts has been settled or appeased. Our worries about the detailed implementation of the climate change levy remain substantial. We have debated them already, and I do not intend to repeat myself. Schedule 6 should not be accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I want to speak against schedule 6 and in support of my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset. First, however, I pick on a revealing remark made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton in his intervention on my hon. Friend. He told my hon. Friend that there is a precedent for one of the principles included in the schedule—that the tax will be fixed by negotiation between the taxpayer and the authorities. That precedent is the inheritance tax.
<P>
Whatever one's view of taxing the inheritance of wealth, I defy anyone to argue that our inheritance tax is sensible. If I had to draw up a list of the worst taxes that I encountered during my two years as a Treasury Minister—[Interruption.] My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset certainly has a strong candidate in the climate change levy, but the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton has a stronger runner in the race—the inheritance tax.
<P>
I shall compare the climate change levy with one of the worst taxes that it is possible to imagine. I do not argue against the taxation of inherited wealth; I am making a technical point about the delivery of a policy objective. The first obvious characteristic of the inheritance tax is that it is levied on a vanishingly small proportion of estates. The second is that, because its tax base is so narrow, it is levied at a high rate. It is ineffective in its principal policy of raising revenue. It is a neat coincidence that the revenue to be raised by the climate change levy is almost the same as that raised by the inheritance tax. We have a runner in schedule 6 that is as bad a tax as inheritance tax; that is a killer argument against including it in the Bill.
<P>
The tax is not a desirable policy objective, as the hon. Member for Hazel Grove has argued. There are plenty of frozen ponds but, given the environmental steer, I can understand the argument for a broad-based carbon tax. But that is not what the Committee is being presented with. The overwhelming majority of carbon consumed for energy escapes that tax. The tax is not imposed on the domestic consumer. As we heard earlier, it is not imposed on 60 per cent. of energy consumption in manufacturing industry. There are many other smaller exemptions. It is a narrowly based tax.
<P>
A further objection—again, a close parallel with inheritance tax—is that the rate of tax paid by the taxpayer is the subject of a private deal between the taxpayer and the tax authorities. When the House of Commons asked what were the principles under which those private deals would be done, we were told to mind our own business. The nearest we get to enforcing a principle in those private negotiations is set out in the pre-Budget report, which stated that an 18 per cent. exemption from this tax would be awarded to those who have a plan for state-of-the-art energy-saving investments.
<P>
The House of Commons is being asked to endorse a narrowly based tax, but to endorse also the fact that half of its potential yield should depend on the view of Ministers, guided by officials, about the state of the art for energy-saving investment. That is wholly absurd. Furthermore, as the Financial Secretary said, the great majority of that potential yield will be given away by private negotiation between the interested parties and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. I cannot conceive of a worse basis for deciding the imposition of a tax burden than that it should be done by private deal in a way that cannot be challenged in Parliament or any other forum.
<P>
I freely concede that, until I arrived here this afternoon, I had not studied the text of schedule 6. As I read it, it became clear to me that it is an extraordinarily bad tax—almost as bad as inheritance tax, perhaps even worse. That is a show-stopping argument against it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I want to pick up where my right hon. Friend left off. He has shone a little light into this area. Ministers will come to regret that. When people ultimately discover that they do not like what is being said in private negotiations about what is or is not good energy-saving practice, the commissioners will have to deal with the appeals. If I wanted to put a spanner into the legislative works of this dog's breakfast of a schedule, I should take every opportunity to make such an appeal to test in depth exactly what the provision is about.
<P>
It is ironic that when I was discussing the impact of that part of the schedule on the horticulture industry, I reminded the Committee that Germany has a climate change levy that is charged in full to all firms, but that civil servants are being employed to ensure that it is revenue-neutral within each company. We have a schedule that employs more civil servants—not to achieve that wholly laudable economic objective, but to introduce and run a tax that my right hon. Friend has aptly described as incredibly complex.
<P>
It seems to me that, in encouraging the development of sources of electricity such as nuclear power, the schedule does nothing. Yet that is a CO2-free method of generating electricity that receives no encouragement whatever under the schedule. It seems illogical that we should be invited to put in place a tax that my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset have described as complex and badly drafted. Is it good or bad tax law? In my judgment, it is bad. [Interruption] If the Government Whip wants to intervene, I shall happily give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am sure that all Opposition Members will endorse my right hon. Friend's invitation to the Whip to offer us his justification for the tax. He regularly offers us insights, but they are not developed because they are offered from a sedentary position. If we had the opportunity to hear his views at rather greater length, they would be listened to with rapt attention—as much by Labour Members as by us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allen:</B> On a point of information, Mr. Cook. In order to give the Opposition some sort of chance, I have been sworn to silence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I think that that will go down in the annals of Parliament as one of the most unusual interventions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I fancy that I must be dreaming. I thought that I heard an hon. Member say that he had been sworn to silence. If he had been sworn to silence, he cannot have been speaking. Something must have gone wrong.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for the Chair. Let's get on with it. I call Mr. Jack.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am now deeply worried that a secret society is operating on the Government Benches, and that Labour Members are being invited to swear allegiance to silence and Trappistry, which is the complete opposite of the reason that they were elected. I look forward to reading the headline in the Government Whip's local newspaper: ``Silent MP confirms pledge not to say anything.'' His electors will doubtless be very pleased at that phenomenon.
<P>
The Financial Secretary did me the courtesy of listening to my arguments on the horticulture industry. I apologise that they were lengthy, but we live in a world that is so often dominated by comment and soundbite instead of rational and factual argument. I am disappointed that we are being invited to endorse—I certainly shall not do so—a schedule that goes no further than to offer the horticulture industry a 50 per cent. reduction in its climate change levy. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove and I tabled amendments on that matter, but the Financial Secretary resisted them. I make a final appeal.
<P>
If, between now and Report, and despite sticking to the Treasury line, the Financial Secretary were to hear messages from the industry or from other parts of Government—I understand from the National Farmers Union that representations are still being made—he may repent, even as a good sinner repenteth, or like St. Paul on the road to Damascus, he may see just a glint of light, which might persuade him to assist the industry at this difficult time.
<P>
For those reasons, I do not find it in my heart to support a bad schedule and a bad tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The issue before the Committee is whether Parliament is willing to take the steps needed to tackle the problem of climate change. It is one of the greatest challenges that the planet faces. I regret that the Conservative party has taken the dishonest position in Committee that it wills the end and that it wants reductions in carbon dioxide emissions but is not willing to support the means. It seems to be saying that there should be a simple, straightforward measure that will achieve the necessary reductions in emissions without having to take difficult decisions. That is dishonest and wrong. We are willing to take the necessary steps. They are set out in detail in schedule 6.
<P>
The climate change levy package will save at least 5 million tonnes a year of carbon dioxide emissions by 2010. I was concerned to hear a couple of the speeches from Opposition Members. I got the impression that hon. Members had not been listening properly to the debate. The hon. Member for West Dorset talked about negotiated agreements with Customs and Excise. The agreements will be not with Customs and Excise but with the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. The details of the agreements will be made public. The 60 per cent. of energy used by manufacturing industry to which I referred is not exempt from the levy. A reduced rate of levy will be applied to it, but it will still be part of the tax base. A fundamental point in the argument of the right hon. Member for Charnwood was wrong as well.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for West Dorset chose to launch an attack on officials who are not in a position to defend themselves. They have given superb advice throughout the process and have enabled us to reach our current position. I am sorry that hon. Members have chosen to ignore the views of the green organisations to which I referred at Question Time. The World Wide Fund for Nature, the Wildlife Trusts, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Council for the Protection of Rural England have joined together to urge the implementation of the levy as described by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment. I am sorry that hon. Members have chosen to ignore the views of the previous Secretary of State for the Environment and have instead exercised a lurch to the right, which has put them—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are discussing the climate change levy. I am anxious to ensure that we do not change the climate in Committee. The debate has been good so far, so let us keep it that way and hear what other people have to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, I am not going to give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Go on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I regret that Opposition Members have exercised a lurch to the right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Minister give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No. We have in schedule 6 a well-designed tax, carefully planned and consulted on during the three-year period before its introduction. It is revenue-neutral for the private sector and will deliver savings in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 5 million tonnes a year. It will boost employment by reducing employers' national insurance contributions. The package is superb and I commend it to the Committee.

<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Seventh schedule to the Bill.
<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Government Whip will be delighted to hear that I do not intend to spend more than a few minutes on the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allen:</B> He always says that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Oh no. I did not say anything of the kind when we considered schedule 6.
<P>
Will the Financial Secretary clarify the assurances that he gave, which are welcome? I think that he gave us an assurance, by implication, that the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions and his officials would not communicate in any way with Customs and Excise officials in respect of agreements made in relation to the climate change levy. He seemed to suggest that there would be complete separation between decisions about the agreements and Customs and Excise. Will he provide clarification? If it is true, it is welcome news.
<P>
I think that the Financial Secretary also said that the agreements would be published. Will he also put on record an assurance that every agreement will be published, however particular it may be and whether it relates to individual companies, groups of companies or sectors? I thank him for his statements, but will he make them absolutely clear?
<P>
The schedule deals with consequential amendments. We are not aware of any provision within it perhaps because of a failure of our imagination and conscientiousness—that is not consequential or which causes great trouble. We do not oppose the schedule, other than in the sense that it is consequential to schedule 6, to which we have made clear our opposition.

Schedule 7 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 32</center></H4>
<H4><center>EXTENSION OF STARTING RATE TO SAVINGS</center></H4>
INCOME OF INDIVIDUALS
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 20, line 28, at end insert— 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) After subsection (1), insert—
<P>
``(1AAA) Where a taxpayer makes an election that he is taxable at the starting rate on income to which this section applies then subsection (1A) shall have effect as if for the words `lower rate' there were substituted `starting rate'.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We now move on from the climate change levy provisions to the part of the Bill that deals with income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. Clause 31 was dealt with in the House, so the Committee now comes to clause 32. It seems churlish for us to table an amendment when the Government have done what we asked them to do in clause 32. We are complaining about a position in which they have found themselves, when we found ourselves in the same position between 1992 and 1995. The difference is, however, that the previous Government dug themselves out of the hole, while this Government have dropped themselves back into it.
<P>
If you will indulge me, Mr. Cook, I shall go briefly into history and outline the origins of the difficulties caused by the starting rate of savings vis-à-vis individuals and their savings. The first time that a lower-rate band was introduced was in the 1992 Budget, by Lord Lamont, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer. It posed an immediate problem, as, although the basic rate of tax was 25 per cent., people were being taxed on savings with a starting rate of 20 per cent. Those whose savings took them just into the 20 per cent. band had considerable difficulties in claiming back the over-deduction of tax. Tax was deducted from savings at 25 per cent., but those who were liable for tax only at 20 per cent had to claw back that 5 per cent. Higher rate taxpayers had to pay an additional proportion of tax up to the higher rate level.
<P>
The problem was remedied in 1995 when the 1995 Budget changed the system. Deductions on savings for basic rate taxpayers and those on the starting rate were set at 20 per cent. That solved the problem for those people who had crept into the starting rate band because the amount of tax that was deducted from their savings matched their obligation to pay tax. People in higher rate bands had to pay more. That was the situation from 1995 to this Budget—savings were taxed at 20 per cent. and deductions were made at 20 per cent.
<P>
Last year's Budget introduced a starting rate band of £1,500 at 10 per cent. That was an election pledge. It was no surprise and it has been uprated to £1,520 in this Budget. However, the old problem has returned. People who just qualify for the starting rate because they have a small amount of savings, will find that 20 per cent. is deducted from their savings, but that their liability for taxation is only 10 per cent. Therefore, they will have to claw back from the Inland Revenue the 10 per cent. to which they are entitled. That will cause a huge administrative problem. The changes in the 1995 Budget were introduced to deal with the difficulties that those on low incomes had in clawing back the sums that were due to them which, at that time, was only 5 per cent. They now have a considerably larger sum to claw back. The only way to do that is to submit a tax return.
<P>
Part of the press release—REV2—that accompanies the Budget explains that the change will benefit 1.5 million pensioners. Is that true? Between 1992 and 1995, most people did not claim money back because of the administrative complexities, which is why the Government introduced the 1995 changes. The press release says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As a result, over 2.5 million individuals will pay up to £152 a year less tax and gain an average of £1.15 a week.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would be the case if all those people claimed it back by filling in a tax return, but millions of people do not fill in tax returns. It is highly unlikely that many people will go to the trouble of filling in a tax return to reclaim funds. I accept that tax returns have been simplified. We now have self-assessment. I have to confess, as a graduate in tax law and a lawyer, that I find my self-assessment form difficult to complete. People who live in housing estates in Croydon or in the constituencies of Nottingham or Bristol—
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> Use the internet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Paymaster General is labouring under an illusion about the type of person involved.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not want to mislead the hon. Gentleman. I was suggesting that he should use the internet.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> In order to save myself 10 quid, I might just do that.
<P>
Self-assessment is a challenge; it is difficult. The type of person—I do not want to be patronising, although my remarks will be interpreted as such—who has an income of only £5,000 or £6,000 a year is not the sort of person who will find filling in a self-assessment form or using the internet easy. I do not claim that we on our side had any great answers between 1992 and 1995.
<P>
The amendment says that someone who is taxed at the starting rate should be able to elect that the tax be deducted on their savings at 10 per cent. That puts the onus on the Inland Revenue if they have lied or if they have gone up into the basic rate bands to recoup the money. That is in effect a personal cashflow position. The onus is on the Inland Revenue to help the people who are affected by the measure. It is up to the Inland Revenue to address the issue.
<P>
The matter is complicated by the abolition of the married couple's allowance and the gap year between that and the children's tax credit, which we will come to in clause 34. Many more people have moved upwards because they do not receive the same sort of tax reliefs. More people will get into the starting band I have had a letter from a member of the public in Scotland who complains that following the abolition of the married couple's allowance she finds herself paying more tax than she might have expected. She was paying 10 per cent. last year, but now finds herself in the 22 per cent. band.
<P>
The central point is that people will have difficulties clawing back the tax that has been deducted from their savings. Our proposal addresses that.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> It is with pleasure that I rise to answer the points that the hon. Gentleman has made.
<P>
First of all, I would like to address his no-surprise comment that the Government keep their promises. The reduction of the starting rate for tax to 10p is another example of the Government keeping their promises. The hon. Gentleman went on a trek through history and referred to the 25 per cent. basic income tax rate, which is now 22 per cent. under a Labour Government. A number of differences have been mentioned.
<P>
Despite what the hon. Gentleman says about the amendment and its purpose, it will allow an individual to elect that all their savings income, which is currently taxable at 20 per cent., be taxed at 10 per cent. That is the effect of the amendment. Over 17 million individuals would be able to elect that. While that would be good for them, the amendment would cost the Exchequer the considerable sum of £1.4 billion. I regret that, for that reason, we cannot support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> If the hon. Lady is saying that the amendment is defective, I do not claim to be a genius at drafting. However, I put forward an essential problem. If there is a better way of resolving it, I will be glad to hear it. An important principle is involved here and I would grateful if she would address the principle rather than what I consider the last refuge of a Minister—saying that an amendment is defective.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am delighted to address the other practicalities involved in the amendment. The hon. Gentleman is obviously not going to pursue his amendment.
<P>
The proposal before us would add more complexity and red tape to the system, even if it did not work in the way in which it does. I understand that the Opposition support the Government's moves to cut red tape and complexity. Financial institutions would have to differentiate between those whose tax should be deducted at 20 per cent. and those for whose tax should be deducted at 10 per cent. There would be considerable systems costs for financial institutions, and they could not deal with the matter retrospectively to April 1999, which is the date from which the measure will apply. The Inland Revenue would have to increase compliance measures to ensure that those electing were entitled to the 10 per cent. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to think that the matter has anything to do with a tax return or self-assessment form. If one pays the 20 per cent. rate when one should have paid the 10 per cent. rate, the form to be filled in is the R40, which is a single sheet of folded paper. One does not have to fill in very much on that form to claim back the tax that has been overpaid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Economic Secretary tell me what plans she and her Department have for publicising the uptake of the IR44?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I think that the right hon. Gentleman misheard me. The form that I mentioned was the R40. We are running a general campaign to ensure that people are aware of their need to reclaim their tax. The Government have launched a taxback campaign, which will pick up during the year with a theme week at the end of October—now is not the right time because tax offices are busy with self-assessment returns and annual repayment claims. The campaign will ensure that people know that they can claim tax refunds on bank and building society interest, and that the 10 per cent. rate has been extended to savings income.
<P>
I urge hon. Members to oppose the amendment, which would be hideously expensive to the taxpayer, adding red tape to the system without serving its purpose.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I want to probe the Economic Secretary a little further on the taxback campaign, which is an activity that I support. When I was the Financial Secretary, I, too, tried a taxback campaign. I went around, offering people their fair share of £539 million, and it was very difficult to find takers for the money.
<P>
The Economic Secretary says that it will be part of a general campaign. Has there been some innovative thinking on the subject? How much will the campaign cost, and what mechanisms will be deployed? If my hon. Friend's amendment is not accepted, the campaign will be important in making certain that people are given, in the nicest sense, their just desserts. It would be to the advantage of not only the Committee but the wider population if we could hear some more chapter and verse on the innovative ways in which the Government plan to give people their own money back, which was a task that eluded me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): It is of course better to be able to claim the tax back than not, but does the Economic Secretary realise what the measure will look like in practice? Hundreds of thousands of elderly people will claim back modest amounts—£10, £20, £30 or £40. They will have to fill in a form, have all the hassle of posting it and so on.
<P>
Of course, the claim back campaign will not work. The Government could surely come up with a more just method so that the people who fall into the category that we are discussing, who are not people who are clever at monitoring their tax, can receive their income with the right amount of tax stopped. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South tabled an amendment that the Economic Secretary said would not work; so be it, but there must be another method of achieving something simple and fair, by which people can avoid bureaucratic hassle and win justice.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall briefly reiterate some of the points I made before, because the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs did not listen to what I said at the beginning. If the amendment were made, there would be much greater complexity, and many more individuals—up to 17 million more—would have to complete a full tax return. Under the current drafting, the number of people will be 1 million to 1.5 million—
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am just trying to the answer the points made by the right hon. Gentleman's hon. Friends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I accept that the amendment does not work, but surely the Government can arrive at a better mechanism, so that millions of elderly people do not have to fill in forms and wait for small amounts of money.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> As I pointed out, the burden would fall on the financial institutions. They would have to differentiate between those who were due 20 per cent. and those who were due 10 per cent. tax. Financial institutions would therefore incur a considerable compliance cost, as their systems are not geared up to differentiate in that way. The Inland Revenue would have to introduce compliance measures to check that people were not illicitly claiming that they were due 10 per cent. instead of 20 per cent.
<P>
To return to the taxback campaign, I regret that not enough precedent exists in the 18 years of Conservative Governments for us to draw on their experience. However, I note that the right hon. Member for Fylde was responsible for one such campaign. We are developing the campaign programme, the aim of which is to help those savers who receive bank or building society interest and who pay little or no tax. We will consider the many ways in which such help might be given. A helpline is also available, on a freefone number, which provides additional information to people who may want to check their standing. It has dealt with 11,500 calls since it was set up at the time of the pre-Budget report last November, and continues to receive 250 calls a week.
<P>
We are providing as much help as possible, but we are also conscious of the need to cut back the burdens on business. The provision allows people to pay a much lower rate of tax when that is right and fair, in a way that is easy for the institutions to cope with, and as easy as possible for individuals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I have listened with interest to the Economic Secretary's response to my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. I have some fellow feeling for her. I was the Financial Secretary who introduced exactly this proposal in 1992, following the introduction of a lower rate of tax by Lord Lamont. I drew the conclusion, which I was not able to make public at the time, that it is a mistake, in tax policy, to introduce thin lower rate bands, or starting rate bands. They look like good political fixes but achieve little more than the enhancement of bureaucracy.
<P>
I sympathise with the Economic Secretary, because her right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has put her in an impossible position, which is an experience that I shared. She must design a system that achieves equity for small savers. However, the problem is entirely of the Government's making, in the way that it was of Lord Lamont's making. The introduction of a lower rate band of £1,500 was intended to achieve a relatively cheap political score. My conclusions are based on my experience I certainly do not speak on behalf of those on the Conservative Front Bench on this subject.
<P>
It is no good trying to pin on the Tory party the withdrawal of the lower rate; no one can make that stick. I shall argue my own considered view within my party, but I have not yet persuaded it of its wisdom. The only sensible policy for income tax structure is to have the minimum possible number of rates. By far the most important objectives of the income tax system are to deliver the lowest possible basic rate of tax and to apply it as broadly as possible. Those are consistent principles.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I can assure the Economic Secretary that her problems are wholly insoluble. It is not for want of trying, but they are problems of the Government's making. I hope that one Government one day will change the rules in the way that I describe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Can the right hon. Gentleman confirm that Lord Lamont brought in the 20p tax rate two days before a general election was called, when debt was rising rapidly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is historically correct to say that it was introduced ahead of a general election—one that I am pleased to say that the Government of the day won. My point is a broader one about how we extract ourselves from the problems with which the Economic Secretary is wrestling I sense that she understands that they are as insoluble for her as they were for me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My right hon. Friend has hit on something by drawing attention to the fact that the Government have not learned from the mistakes of the past. He says that the starting rate should be as broad as possible. The difference between where we are now and where we were between 1992 and 1995 is that the starting rate was only 5 per cent. below the basic rate. That slowly broadened throughout the Parliament of 1992 to 1997, much as my right hon. Friend said. I shall take a punt. If the Conservatives had won the 1997 general election, we would have gone on to make that band the basic rate of tax. Eventually we would have come down to a basic rate of 20 per cent. I may be wrong, but I believe that such an ambition was set out in broad terms in our manifesto.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) rightly implied that he thought that it was technically possible for the banks, building societies or institutions to make the distinction. The Economic Secretary said that it would be impossible. With modern technology, the institutions should be able to deal with the issue. Every time that they have a new saver, someone could punch something into a computer. Hitting an extra key is not a huge administrative burden. Would it not be sensible for the Government to investigate the compliance costs of such a measure?
<P>
I encourage the Economic Secretary to do so because I welcome the simpler form. The lesson from 1992 to 1995, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood said, is that people did not sign up. That is why the deduction from savings was matched with the starting rate in the 1995 Budget. History can teach us about that mistake. Although it is a worthy objective to have a taxback campaign and hotlines, it will not work. The Economic Secretary said that 11,500 people have called the hotline so far, and she thinks that there will be 12,500 next year at a rate of 250 a week. That still leaves 1,487,500 who have not called the hotline. At the rate of progress that she is talking about, it would take 80 years for them all to elect to do so. She is in for an unpleasant shock. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs was right: the taxback campaign will not work, and the Economic Secretary will get herself in trouble.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I appreciate that it is difficult for Conservative Members to be optimistic about the future because it does not look very rosy. As with self-assessment helplines, many people will complete the form or know what to do without ever contacting a helpline to find out. The Conservatives' gloom is much misplaced, but we shall run our campaign with enthusiasm to ensure that people get it right.
<P>
We have simplified the tax band position because for savings, as for income tax, the figures are 10 per cent., 22 per cent. and 40 per cent. The system is as straightforward as it could possibly be. Only four out of 10 pensioners pay income tax, so the majority of them will not be affected one way or the other. The provision is part of a package of measures to make work pay and a result of cutting the new starting rate of tax is that the marginal rate for many taxpayers will also be cut. It is an incentive.
<P>
Banks have commented that taking the action to which the hon. Member for Croydon, South referred is too expensive and complex. The changes are the all-round, practical red-tape-free answer.

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The debate has been useful and interesting. We have noted the Economic Secretary's argument. We shall revisit the matter after the start of the taxback campaign and see who is right. There is time between now and the general election to work that out. Nevertheless, the purpose of the amendment was to stimulate such a debate and, under the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Will the Economic Secretary explain to what extent progress might be made on the integration of income tax and national insurance contributions? As a result of the lower starting rate of income tax, the gap is becoming closer at the upper end of the limit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> In our discussions on the previous Finance Bill, Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members advanced arguments along the lines of what is contained in the clause, namely that the 10p rate that was introduced should have applied to savings. It was wrong last year to exclude savings, especially given the impact on pensioners, and I am glad that the Government have at last seen the light. I gave them the opportunity to put the matter right last year—although possibly with a technically defective amendment—and it was a shame that they failed to do so.
<P>
As the explanatory notes say, last year about 2.5 million people, including 1.5 million pensioners, lost out by an average of £60—nearly double the amount that they will be receiving from the 75p a week increase. I hope that the Government are now feeling slightly contrite and will start putting right other mistakes that they have made in their tax legislation, which has penalised pensioners.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall ensure that I do not test your patience too much, Mr. Cook. The hon. Member for Croydon, South tried to draw the debate into complex areas into which I have no intention of venturing. A discussion about NICs would test your patience considerably, Mr. Cook.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton is right that many of the amendments tabled last year were technically defective. Indeed, they were seriously defective and had the sort of technical defects contained in amendment No. 10. Different combinations of Opposition Members, including the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, tabled several amendments—involving such amounts as £900 million, £1.8 billion and £18 billion on the subject. The Government have found the right technical way to secure our objective and I hope that hon. Members will support us in our attempt to make the legislation simple, straightforward and helpful to all members of the public.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 32 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 33</center></H4>
<H4><center>Deduction of income tax from foreign dividends</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Given that the clause corrects a cock-up from last year, we have no objection to it.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 33 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Allen]
