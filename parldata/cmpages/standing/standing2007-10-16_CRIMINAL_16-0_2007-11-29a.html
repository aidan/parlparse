							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Hollobone</b> (Kettering) (Con): &#151;as to the
Minister&#146;s intentions with regard to how the legislation would
affect the gentleman who was protesting in Parliament square. In that
case, the gentleman was shouting that he felt that homosexuals could
pervert children. Mr. Summerskill made it quite clear in his
evidence that he felt that that was incitement, and that any
legislation brought forward by the Government ought to make a
prosecution of that gentleman rather more straightforward. Could there
not be a situation whereby people quote from religious transcripts in
such a way that others would be offended by it? Although they might not
be trying to incite anyone to violence, huge offence could be caused
nevertheless.</div>
					<a name="0711302000178"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001025">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Maria
Eagle):
						</b> I tried to make it clear that intention to incite
hatred was a key part of the offence as drafted. Does that not answer
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001026">Mr.
Hollobone:
						</b> It does not really answer my point. It may be
that the individual concerned does not intend to cause an offence,
under the terms of the new legislation, but that others
may&#151;</div>
					<a name="0711302000180"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001027">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> He does not have to intend to cause an offence, but
he has to intend to incite hatred. It is quite
clear.</div>
					<a name="0711302000181"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001028">Mr.
Hollobone:
						</b> It comes down to a debate about what is
inciting hatred. To give an example, I will quote a reference made by
Mr. Summerskill, in his evidence, from the Bible, in
Leviticus, chapter 20, verse
13:</div>
					<a name="0711302000182"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
a man lies with a male as he lies with a woman, both of them have
committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. Their
blood shall be upon
them.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000183"><div class="hs_Para">If
someone were parading up and down the street outside with a banner
displaying that quote from the Bible, while a legitimate homosexual
meeting was going on in a nearby building, could not a prosecution for
incitement to hatred be brought under the new legislation? The person
doing the demonstrating is exercising their religious beliefs, which we
may or may not share. The huge worry among evangelical Christian
groups, Islamic groups and those of other faiths is that the
legitimate, though perhaps sometimes offensive, expression of their
beliefs, could be caught by the new
legislation.</div>
					<a name="0711302000184"><div class="hs_Para">It is not
only those of us with a religious perspective who have cause for
concern about the new legislation, but also gay people. I find myself,
rather surprisingly, quoting Mr. Peter Tatchell, who is a
well known gay rights activist and has developed a considerable
reputation for his activities. He
says:</div>
					<a name="0711302000185"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
there are going to be laws against inciting hatred, they should be
universal and prohibit all incitements to hatred&#151;not just some.
Singling out race hate and homo hate for special legal penalties
strikes me as unfair and undesirable. It creates resentment among
social groups who are not protected by such laws, which is bad for
community cohesion. My view is very simple: everyone should be equal
before the law, in which case all incitements of hatred should be an
offence.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000186"><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Tatchell then goes on to define incitement, which is the point that the
Minister has just made. He
says:</div>
					<a name="0711302000877"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;After
all, similar laws have been abused in the recent
past.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000187"><div class="hs_Para">He
cites the example of an Oxford student who was arrested and fined under
the public disorder laws for making a joke about a policeman&#146;s
horse being gay. The officers construed that joke as a homophobic
remark and named the student under the already existing wide-sweep
public order legislation, which bans behaviour that is likely to cause
harassment, alarm or distress. He
says:</div>
					<a name="0711302000878"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is not
clear whether it was the police officer or the horse that was
supposedly offended by the student&#146;s off-the-cuff
quip.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000188"><div class="hs_Para">Then we
have evidence in the newspapers this week that the
Attorney-General herself may have some private concerns about the
appropriateness of this legislation. It has been reported&#151;I
would welcome the Minister&#146;s response to this&#151;that
Baroness Scotland has privately 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column685" />Column number: 685</div>expressed concern about the controversial legislation being brought
before us. The article in <i class="I">The Times</i> states that:</div>
					<a name="0711302000879"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Baroness Scotland, who is also
determined to crack down on the problem of homophobic behaviour,
believes that there are sufficient laws on the statute book to deal
with this issue.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000189"><div class="hs_Para">The
article goes on to
state:</div>
					<a name="0711302000880"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;She is
understood to have told colleagues that she wants to see more
successful prosecutions in this area, but is unconvinced that a new law
is the way to do it and would prefer to focus on existing
procedures.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000190"><div class="hs_Para">The
distinguished correspondent and former Member of Parliament, Mathew
Parris, who is a homosexual himself, stated in <i class="I">The Times
</i>newspaper:</div>
					<a name="0711302000881"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Some
groups may be so weak and fragile as to need the law&#146;s
protection from hateful speech. I&#146;d like to think that we gays
are no longer among
them.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000191"><div class="hs_Para">From
the entertainment profession, Rowan Atkinson has also criticised the
proposals. He said that society was already &#147;working things
out&#148; without the need for any legislative interference. He is
concerned, as am I, about the extendable nature of the legislation
because it could be extended in future to other groups. Rowan Atkinson
cites as an example, &#147;people with big
ears&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0711302000192"><div class="hs_Para">This
week, both the Church of England and the Catholic Bishops&#146;
Conference of England and Wales have commented on the proposals before
us. In a joint initiative, the Churches
stated:</div>
					<a name="0711302000882"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
main concern is that any legislation on incitement to hatred on the
grounds of sexual orientation permits the expression of traditional
Christian (and other) opinions on sexual behaviour and consequent
criticisms of particular forms of behaviour or lifestyle. As with
incitement to religious hatred, we believe it is vital that there
should be the maximum possible clarity about what is forbidden and what
is permitted. Christians engaged in teaching or preaching and those
seeking to act and accord with Christian convictions in their daily
lives need to be assured that the expression of strong opinions on
marriage and sexuality will not be illegal.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000193"><div class="hs_Para">In their submission, they point out the
possible chilling effect on free speech, which formed much of our
previous debates on the religious hatred legislation. They
say:</div>
					<a name="0711302000883"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Uncertainty
in the law has the effect of inhibiting behaviour which may not in fact
be illegal.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000194"><div class="hs_Para">They call, as
I do, for an exploration of the relevant safeguards, along with those
included in the law of incitement to racial hatred, namely the famous
section 29J, which this legislation is screaming out for.</div>
					<a name="0711302000195"><div class="hs_Para">I am also disturbed that a lot
of the interpretation of this new legislation will be left in the hands
of police officers, who will be faced with the confusing prospect of
having, on the one hand, laws passed in this place under the Racial and
Religious Hatred Act 2006, which contains a section 29J that explicitly
states that there is not an offence as far as free speech is concerned,
and the proposed legislation before us today that does not. Police
officers might well be confused by
that.</div>
					<a name="0711302000196"><div class="hs_Para">The guidance from
the Association of Chief Police Officers on hate incident reporting
procedure describes a homophobic incident as
any</div>
					<a name="0711302000884"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;incident which is
perceived to be homophobic by the victim or another
person.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column686" />Column number: 686</div>
					<a name="0711302000197"><div class="hs_Para">On the prosecution of cases of homophobic
crime, the Crown Prosecution Service guidance defines
homophobia as</div>
					<a name="0711302000885"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
fear of or a dislike directed towards lesbian, gay or bisexual people,
or a fear of or dislike directed towards their perceived lifestyle,
culture or characteristics, whether or not any specific lesbian, gay or
bisexual person has that lifestyle or
characteristic.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000198"><div class="hs_Para">The
subjective emphasis of those definitions coupled with the growing
pressure placed on the authorities to respond to such complaints will
lead to significant problems. By emphasising the perception of the
victim or any other person in defining something as an incident,
regardless of the consideration of context or content that an objective
valuation could make, there is a danger that a semblance of
reasonableness could be stripped away.</div>
					<a name="0711302000199"><div class="hs_Para">It is suggested that the Crown
Prosecution Service will provide a safeguard as it will only bring a
case if there is a reasonable prospect of conviction and if that
prosecution is in the public interest. I am disturbed, however, by the
published guidance of the CPS. There are real concerns about the
chilling effect on free speech. I shall cite examples of how
legislation has been affected by differing interpretations on the
street.</div>
					<a name="0711302000200"><div class="hs_Para">In 2005, a
Christian couple&#151;Joe and Helen Roberts&#151;were interrogated
by the police because they complained about their local
council&#146;s gay rights policy. The police said that they were
responding to a reported homophobic incident under the guidelines. They
later admitted that no crime had been committed and, following legal
action by the Roberts, the police and the council issued a public
apology. It all worked out in the end, but that is a rather alarming
example of the chilling effect of legislation such as that proposed
today.</div>
					<a name="0711302000201"><div class="hs_Para">The Bishop of
Chester was investigated by the Cheshire constabulary in November 2003,
after he told his local newspaper of research showing that some
homosexuals reoriented to heterosexuality. The police passed a file to
the Crown Prosecution Service, which decided not to prosecute. The
Cheshire constabulary issued the following
statement:</div>
					<a name="0711302000886"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Crown Prosecution Service has been consulted with at length, and
Cheshire Police are satisfied that no criminal offences have been
committed, as current public order legislation does not provide
specific offences based on
sexuality.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000202"><div class="hs_Para">Again, it all
worked out in the end, but that is another alarming example of the
chilling effect of such a
law.</div>
					<a name="0711302000203"><div class="hs_Para">In 2004, the
Christian Union of the university of Cambridge was reported to the
police following its distribution of St. John&#146;s gospel to
students and its hosting of an evangelical meeting at which the dean of
Sydney cathedral put forward a traditional biblical view on
homosexuality. In December 2005, police questioned the family values
campaigner, Lynette Burrows, after she expressed the view on a radio
programme that homosexual men may not be suitable for raising children.
Police telephoned saying that they were investigating a reported
homophobic incident.</div>
					<a name="0711302000204"><div class="hs_Para">I
do not believe that the Government are malevolent about matters but,
however well intentioned the legislation, it will give rise to alarming
chilling effects on the way in which people with profound religious
beliefs can espouse their views. Our nation does not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column687" />Column number: 687</div>require the measure. Enough legislation is already on the statute book
to deal with the vile incidents of homophobic hate
crime.</div>
					<a name="0711302000205"><div class="hs_Para">My argument is
that our present law is not used effectively enough. One example of
that is in respect of Northern Ireland. The Minister will claim that
that is a different jurisdiction, but she has more experience of the
affairs in that Province than I have, and she may well have been
responsible for introducing the law to which I am
referring&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I am told that it was the
Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, my right hon. Friend the Member
for Delyn. However, if this legislation is so wonderful&#151;if it is
really meant to do what it says on the tin&#151;why have there been
no prosecutions in Northern Ireland in respect of offensive rap lyrics
against homosexuals? Why are the Government not using the legislation
that they have already introduced to take action against such vile
crimes?</div>
					<a name="0711302000978"><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div>
					<a name="0711302000206"><div class="hs_Para">I am worried
that we are putting another piece of legislation on to the statute book
that will have a profound chilling effect on people who hold religious
beliefs, that will damp free speech, and that will be another case of
thought crime. Trying to make incitement to hatred of specific groups a
criminal offence is the wrong way to go. I agree that we should
consider making it an offence to incite hatred across the board, but
picking that off group by group is the wrong way to go: it will set one
group against another and will not help community cohesion but damage
it.</div>
				
					<a name="0711302000207"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001029">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> We have had a good debate, during the morning
sitting and concluding just now, about this issue and I think that most
of the concerns from all sides of the debate have been covered. I want
to deal with amendments (a) and (b) to new schedule 2 and new clause
49, tabled by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough. I will not
re-rehearse the original Government amendment, which I dealt with this
morning.</div>
					<a name="0711302000208"><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome highlighted a real problem with
amendment (a) to new schedule 2 and I have a lot of sympathy with the
concerns that he has attempted to formulate into a legislative phrase.
He was characteristically modest in suggesting, before I had the chance
to do so, that his amendments were defective or not as good as they
might have been if he had been a parliamentary draftsman. However, he
has not done a bad
job.</div>
					<a name="0711302000209"><div class="hs_Para">My concern about
his trying to formulate the issue as he has done is more about what it
would do to the rest of the law. He said clearly that he thought that
the Government amendments and new clauses pitched the offence at about
the right level. He was particularly concerned about inhibiting free
speech and thought that pitching the offence at the level of
threatening words and behaviour with an intention to incite hatred was
right. However, our problem is that amendment (a) goes further than
threatening words. On one hand the hon. Gentleman says that he believes
that the offence is pitched correctly in the Government
amendments&#151;the new clauses and new schedule&#151;but on the
other hand he says that he wants a little bit extra, extending the
provision to what might be characterised as insulting, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column688" />Column number: 688</div>abusive language, which we have specifically excluded from the offence.
That is our difficulty and I think that the hon. Gentleman recognises
that. He wished to highlight a particular concern, which is that gay,
lesbian and bisexual people are sometimes portrayed by those who wish
to incite hatred as paedophiles who intend to corrupt and harm the
young.</div>
					<a name="0711302000210"><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0711302001030">
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): I am grateful to
the Minister for the care with which she has responded to my
suggestion. I want to make it clear that I am not trying to include
language that is simply offensive: it has to be construed within the
context of the general offence. In other words, it has to be
threatening, the context has to be such that it is threatening and it
has to have the intent of incitement to hatred. The fact that there is
a subset within that group means that it does not extend the provision,
but simply identifies a particular sort of language that is intended to
incite hatred&#151;which I am convinced it
is.</div>
					<a name="0711302000211"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001031">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is
trying to make and I have some sympathy with it. However, it is
important that there is clarity: I think that all Committee members
agree with that. As currently cast, the offence requires threatening
words or behaviour. The hon. Gentleman is now talking about a
threatening context, which is a slightly different thing. As the
provision is currently drafted, the words or behaviour have to be
threatening and there has to be an intention to incite in order for the
offence to be made
out.</div>
					<a name="0711302000212"><div class="hs_Para">It is undoubtedly
the case that the kind of allegations to which the hon. Gentleman
referred are insulting, demeaning, abusive and untrue, and might also
amount to defamation in certain circumstances, in which case that could
be dealt with by the civil courts. However, they are not necessarily
threatening of themselves. That is the difficulty. The Government have
confined the proposals to words or behaviour that are threatening or
intended to stir up hatred. We think that that strikes the right
balance between dealing with stirring up hatred and securing freedom of
speech. Our proposed offences interfere with freedom of speech only
when there is a need to do so to protect vulnerable groups and preserve
public order.</div>
					<a name="0711302000213"><div class="hs_Para">I have
every sympathy with the concerns that give rise to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment. However, we are trying to be very clear
about the boundaries of the offence so as to provide a proper balance
with people&#146;s freedom to say what they think, and I believe that
the amendment would make them less clear. That is why I cannot agree to
it.</div>
					<a name="0711302000214"><div class="hs_Para">On amendment (b),
the hon. Gentleman tried to indicate that his wording was not perfect,
but actually it is otiose&#151;I always try to get the word
&#147;otiose&#148; into Public Bill Committee deliberations at
least once. The Human Rights Act already provides the safeguard that he
seeks, because the Bill as a whole has to be compatible with that Act.
The difficulty with the express inclusion of such a
provision&#151;the same point applies to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
proposed new clause 49, whose purpose he has explained&#151;is that,
if the Human Rights Act is generally implicit and is certified as
applicable, express inclusion presents an issue for judges who try to
construe the express provision.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column689" />Column number: 689</div>

						<a name="0711302001032">
							<b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): It does not if it is
otiose. However, the decline in the respect accorded
to Ministers&#146; rubber-stamping of Bills is now self-evident.
Nobody really thinks that, when a Minister stamps a Bill to say that in
their view the provisions of the Bill are compatible with the
convention, they have seriously applied their mind to that question. It
is just part of the printing on the front of the Bill. That might be
grossly unfair, but it is what the public now think, and it is also
certainly what many Members of Parliament think, so whether it is fair
is neither here nor
there.</div>
					<a name="0711302000216"><div class="hs_Para">As regards
express mention of things that the Minister says are implicit, she is
perfectly right that the convention is now justiciable under our law
and that our courts must bear it in mind. However, not every judge and
magistrate has the convention in the forefront of their mind. Indeed, I
do not think I am being controversial if I say that not every judge and
magistrate will even have read the convention. That might be the most
appalling admission to make&#151;indeed, I do not know how I dare say
such a thing. However, for that reason I think that it is quite
important occasionally to remind those who have to implement the law of
what the law is.</div>
					<a name="0711302000217"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001033">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> I understand the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s point. On the ministerial declaration, Ministers
have to turn their mind to the question of compatibility. They are
advised by officials and lawyers on compatibility, and I can assure the
hon. and learned Gentleman that, in my experience as a Minister, that
advice has been both seriously given and seriously taken. I do not know
of any Minister who would ignore advice from departmental lawyers that
suggested that any part of a Bill whose compatibility he was about to
certify was in fact incompatible. He would not be in a position to do
that. So this matter is taken seriously, although perhaps the hon. and
learned Gentleman&#146;s cynicism is born out of longer years in
Opposition; he may become a lot more cynical before that period in
Opposition ends.</div>

					<a name="0711302000219"><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady cannot have it both ways. Amendment (b)
cannot be otiose and give difficulties to the judge in construing the
Bill; either it affects the law or it does not. If it is unnecessary
and makes no difference to the law, there is no difficulty in
construing it. If it does make a difference, it is achieving the effect
that I want it to have, which is to ensure that free speech is
protected in every other circumstance except the circumstance that is
specified within the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001037">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> I have tried to explain, but I do not want to get
tempted down the highways and byways of this matter. In our view, it is
not necessary expressly to put in different parts of the European
convention that are implicit in the legislation and it would be bad
practice in draughtsmanship to do so. I understand the points that the
hon. and learned Member for Harborough makes about having judges read
the law 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column690" />Column number: 690</div>now and then. I am sure that most judges do so; one would hope that all
of them do. Anyway, that is my point in respect of amendment (b). He
might not agree with it; that is up to
him.</div>
					<a name="0711302000223"><div class="hs_Para">Let
me turn to new clause 49, with which I had
considerable sympathy, in that the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate
wished to see a clear and succinct statement of the law. It is
certainly a cause of some frustration to me that the way in which the
amendments have been drafted by parliamentary counsel, although proper
and correct, does not make it easy to read and understand precisely
what the law says, if the Committee agrees to these amendments. That is
why I have tried to be extremely clear in setting out what the law
means and that is why I have said on a number of occasions during the
debate that we will be issuing guidance, because clarity is
important.</div>
					<a name="0711302000224"><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman has set out and spoken to the new clause with some aplomb and
he has suggested why he set it out in the way that he has. As I say, I
have some sympathy for it. Were we starting with an empty book, I would
be much more willing to take on board what he has said, but because we
already have law relating to incitement in similar circumstances it
could cause a lot of problems if we started to cast a particular aspect
of the law in completely different terms to the way in which similar
offences are cast.</div>
					<a name="0711302000225"><div class="hs_Para">So,
while I have some sympathy with new clause 49, that is my basic
difficulty in being able to accept it. I am sure that the hon.
Gentleman will understand my point. It is really for that reason that I
am not able to take on board new clause 49 completely. Many of the
offences that he sets out and that he spoke to with clarity earlier
this morning are already on the statute book in other places and, as I
have said, we are not starting with a blank statute book. That is my
point.</div>
					<a name="0711302000226"><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0711302001038">
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Burrowes</b> (Enfield, Southgate) (Con): Does the
Minister have some sympathy with our seeking to have an alternative
language and framing of the law, particularly given the public order
legislation? When that goes down to the officer on the beat, they see a
range of offences from subsection (5) onwards and, as far as they are
concerned, they see them in the language of perception, of how people
perceive an offence to have affected them. That causes concerns about
the application of the law.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001039">Maria

						</b> I do have some sympathy with new clause 49; it
touches upon the increasing complexity of the criminal law across a
range of areas, and the fact that we have a common law and statute
combined in a way that means that we must give some thought as to how
similar offences and previous offences are cast. So I have some
sympathy, but I think that the way forward that the Government have set
out is the most practical way forward. I am not saying that I do not
have sympathy for the way in which the hon. Gentleman is pleading for
clarity; I have tried to provide that clarity in a slightly different
way.</div>

on the importance of freedom of speech, which nobody wants to impinge
on more than is necessary. I think that I have tried to be extremely
clear on where the offences would bite. I would have understood many of
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points better if, like others, he had made
them before the Government amendments, new clause and schedule had been
selected. The offence has been pitched at the highest level by
referring to the use of threatening words and behaviour intended to
incite hatred.</div>
					<a name="0711302000230"><div class="hs_Para">I have
discussed that matter in detail with many organisations on all sides of
the argument since we made it clear that we would go down this path.
The way in which the Government have cast the offence has been widely
welcomed and has reassured many of those concerned. The briefing to the
Committee from the department for Christian Responsibility and
Citizenship, the Catholic Bishops&#146; Conference of England and
Wales and the Church of England&#146;s mission and public affairs
division
stated:</div>
					<a name="0711302000887"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
welcome the narrow focus of the amendment on the use of threatening
words or behaviour which are used with the intention of stirring up
hatred. This goes a considerable way towards meeting our
concerns&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0711302000231"><div class="hs_Para">That has also
been my experience in talking to those in the theatrical profession who
have also expressed concerns. We think, therefore, that the offence is
pitched correctly and that it will provide the necessary
reassurance.</div>
					<a name="0711302000232"><div class="hs_Para">Some of
the more lurid examples used by the hon. Member for Kettering would
clearly fall outside the ambit of the legislation. He spoke as though
abusive and threatening words and behaviour would be caught&#151;that
sounds more like elements of the race hate offence. Were the amendment
worded in that way, I would have much more sympathy with some of his
concerns. However, such matters will not be caught, and he should not
suggest that they
are.</div>
					<a name="0711302000233"><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman
referred to the Attorney-General, who was reported in <i class="I">The Times</i>,
on 26 November, as being &#147;set to scupper plans to make gay hate
a crime&#148;&#151;that is what the headline said. That
proves that we cannot believe everything that we read
in the newspapers, given that the Government amendments, which have to
be cleared across Government, were tabled on 14 November. Clearly, the

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001049">Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> We come now to an interesting part of the Bill and
our deliberations. We valued very much the huge range of contributions
that we had during the review of the protection of children from sex
offenders, which, as hon. Members will know, the Government published
in June. It was an extremely good process, involving a wide range of
stakeholders. Given the huge differences in opinion on the issue, I
think that a reasonable compromise has been
reached.</div>
					<a name="0711302000269"><div class="hs_Para">The review
rejected the idea of a Megan&#146;s law, but concluded that greater
use of controlled disclosure was necessary to enhance the protection of
children. Under existing guidance, police in England and Wales already
disclose information about registered sex offenders in a controlled
way. The guidance states that consideration must be given in each case
to whether information about an offender should be disclosed to others
to protect victims, potential victims, staff and others in the
community. That applies to all categories and levels of multi-agency
public protection arrangements
cases.</div>
					<a name="0711302000270"><div class="hs_Para">The
review found that the extent to which information is disclosed varied
from area to area. We believe that greater use should be made of
controlled disclosure, and that the process needs to be formalised and
auditable, with clear guidance to ensure that it is consistent and
accountable, as part of the MAPPA process.</div>
					<a name="0711302000271"><div class="hs_Para">New clause 38 builds on the
existing duty to co-operate placed on all
MAPPA-responsible authorities, which is included in the Criminal
Justice Act 2003. It will ensure that MAPPA authorities are under a
specific duty to consider the disclosure of a child sex
offender&#146;s convictions to members of the public. There will be a
presumption that convictions will be disclosed, if a child is at risk
of suffering harm through the offender&#146;s committing another
child sex offence, and the disclosure is necessary to protect the
child. So for example disclosures may be made to employers,
girlfriends, friends or family members, or individuals in organisations
where children may be assessed, who are able to protect a child who is
at risk.</div>
					<a name="0711302000272"><div class="hs_Para">The list of
offences, convictions or cautions that could be the subject of
disclosure is included in new schedule 4, which will become schedule
34A to the Criminal Justice Act 2003. It includes sexual offences that
can be committed only against children, such as sexual activity with a
child, and other sexual offences that are not specifically child sex
offences, such as sexual assaults, in cases in which the victim was
under 18. The duty will be relevant to any offender managed by a MAPPA
authority who has been convicted of one of the offences against a
child. However, the disclosure may include all previous convictions for
a child sex offence, not just those that have led to the offender 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column696" />Column number: 696</div>being managed by a MAPPA authority. It will also include spent
convictions, and we are amending the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act
1974.</div>
					<a name="0711302000273"><div class="hs_Para">The duty placed
on MAPPA authorities will be to consider disclosure, not necessarily to
disclose. That is an important point. Although there will be a
presumption that information will be disclosed if a child sex offender
managed by MAPPA authorities poses a risk of harm to any child or
children generally, there will not be an absolute duty to do so. That
will allow the MAPPA authorities discretion to deal with each
case.</div>
					<a name="0711302000274"><div class="hs_Para">Amendments (a)
and (b) to new clause 38, tabled by the hon. Member
for Somerton and Frome, would remove that presumption and place the
MAPPA authorities under a duty to consider disclosure, which they are
already entitled to do. Although that would ensure that all MAPPA
authorities considered disclosure, it would not provide a steer to them
on whether they should disclose. Furthermore, a presumption in the
cases identified in the new schedule must surely be justified in the
interest of public
protection.</div>
					<a name="0711302000275"><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s view&#151;I know that it is the view
of everyone in the Committee and that the debate is
about how we achieve it&#151;is that the public will presume that, in
cases where a risk of harm has been identified and disclosure would
prevent that risk, an authority with the remit to do so would make that
disclosure. That is certainly the Government&#146;s position, as
outlined in the review and reflected in the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="0711302000276"><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
to new clause 38 would also limit the duty to
consider disclosure to cases in which the offender poses a risk to an
identified child or children and such disclosure is necessary to
protect the child or children from harm. Our view is that a MAPPA
authority will at least need to consider disclosure in all cases, in
order to identify the cases in which it is necessary. I say to the hon.
Members for Somerton and Frome and for Cambridge that we shall consider
on Report the inclusion of the word &#147;serious&#148;, as
suggested in their amendments (c), (d) and (e), although we cannot
accept the other changes that they suggest. I hope that the inclusion
of that word will make a significant difference. I take the point that
we need to consider the best way of making that change, and I do not
want to get into whether amendments are flawed, but we accept the
principle on the word
&#147;serious&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0711302000277"><div class="hs_Para">I
spoke about the concerns this morning to Dame Mary
Marsh, the chief executive of the National Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, and told her that, in response to the
amendments, we will consider what we can do about using the term
&#147;serious harm&#148;. It is an important point; it came out in
the review, and on Report we shall look to put the word in. Although I
am not able to give any comfort to the hon. Gentlemen on their other
points, I hope that I have shown that Ministers listen and, when good
points are made, try to include them in a Bill so that it is
improved.</div>
					<a name="0711302000278"><div class="hs_Para">The other
amendments to the new clause, which we cannot accept, would broaden the
scope of the presumption to disclose to situations in which adults are
at risk. The focus of the provisions is primarily the protection of
children, which was identified as necessary in the review of the
protection of children from sex offenders. MAPPA authorities are not
prohibited from disclosing in other cases, but we want 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column697" />Column number: 697</div>the duty to focus on cases involving children. The word
&#147;identified&#148;, which is in amendment (c), would limit the
duty to consider disclosure to identifiable individuals. There may be
cases in which a risk to a group of children is identified&#151;at a
leisure centre, for example&#151;but it is not possibly to identify
precisely every individual child who may be at risk. We want to be able
to protect all children who attend such a leisure centre and might be
at risk, even if we cannot specifically identify a particular
individual. That is why we have a problem with that part of amendment
(c).</div>
					<a name="0711302000980"><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div>
					<a name="0711302000279"><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
(f) would add to the requirements necessary for the presumption to
disclose to apply, by requiring that disclosure be in the best
interests of promoting public safety. Our view is that it is
unnecessary. Its apparent purpose is to ensure that a balanced risk
assessment is made prior to disclosure. However, to comply with the
Human Rights Act 1998, the MAPPA authority will already have to
undertake such an assessment and conclude that the disclosure is both
proportionate and necessary in the interests of public safety or, just
as importantly, for the prevention of
crime.</div>
					<a name="0711302000280"><div class="hs_Para">Amendment (g)
appears to be intended to dissuade members of the public from making
requests for information from their local police forces. Members of the
public cannot be prevented from requesting disclosure, but they do not
have the automatic right to such information. We do not anticipate that
the duty to consider disclosure will automatically lead to a huge rise
in the number of public requests. When a request is made, however, any
decision to disclose will be subject to the relevant processes and
safeguards. To whom the information is disclosed will be determined by
the nature of the risk and whether disclosing information to a
particular individual or organisation is necessary. MAPPA authorities
will be able to impose conditions on the recipient of the information,
limiting its further disclosure to other parties.</div>
					<a name="0711302000281"><div class="hs_Para">Whatever decision is taken, to
disclose or not, the responsible MAPPA authorities will be required to
record the reasons for it. We stated explicitly in the review of the
protection of children from sex offenders that the new duty would
include the presumption outlined in the Government amendment, to ensure
the greater but more consistent use of controlled disclosure. As I have
said, the review was conducted in consultation with stakeholders, from
whom there was broad support for its
outcomes.</div>
					<a name="0711302000282"><div class="hs_Para">The
overall effect of the amendments tabled by the hon. Members for
Somerton and Frome and for Cambridge would be to lessen the direction
given to MAPPA authorities&#151;I know that that is partly the
intention&#151;and hinder attempts to ensure greater consistency in
the use of controlled disclosure. To ensure that MAPPA authorities are
given further direction and to guard against inappropriate disclosure,
the responsible authority will be required to follow any guidance
issued by the Secretary of State on the duty to consider disclosure.
Amendment No. 244 will amend the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to allow
such guidance to be issued and to require the MAPPA authorities to have
regard to it. They will also have to report on their disclosure
functions in their annual reports.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column698" />Column number: 698</div>
					<a name="0711302000283"><div class="hs_Para">I am taking my time and going
through the amendments methodically, because it is important to outline
their details. A lot of people will read the debates on the matter, so
I apologise; I would normally be a bit more spontaneous&#151;I hope.
It is important to reiterate that controlled disclosure already exists.
MAPPA authorities can and do disclose information if the circumstances
warrant it. Amendment No. 244 will not prohibit the disclosure of other
information not covered by the duty to consider disclosure, but it will
ensure that disclosure happens more consistently and with greater
accountability in the most critical cases involving the protection of
children from sexual abuse. I know that we all share that
aim.</div>
					<a name="0711302000284"><div class="hs_Para">I turn to new
clause 39. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 introduced sexual offences
prevention orders. They are used to impose prohibitions on violent
offenders or sex offenders who pose a risk of serious sexual harm, for
example by preventing an offender from loitering outside playgrounds. A
sexual offences prevention order also makes the offender subject to the
notification requirements of the Sexual Offences Act. The orders have
proved an effective and well used method of managing the risks posed by
sex offenders. However, we have identified a potential anomaly that
allows offenders convicted of certain violent offences to be made
subject to a sexual offences prevention order in a wider range of
circumstances than offenders convicted of sexual offences. New clause
39 will widen the circumstances in which those in the latter category
can be made subject to an order.</div>
					<a name="0711302000285"><div class="hs_Para">Currently, a sexual offences
prevention order can be made against anyone convicted of, or cautioned
for, an offence listed in either schedule 3 or schedule 5 to the 2003
Act. Schedule 3 lists sexual offences. Schedule 5 lists violent
offences, which although not inherently sexual, could indicate a risk
of sexual harm. However, schedule 3 is also used to determine whether
an offender is subject to the notification requirements, commonly known
as the sex offenders register. Consequently some of the offences listed
in the schedule contain thresholds for the sentence length, type and
the age of the offender and victim that must be met before an offender
becomes eligible for the notification
requirements.</div>
					<a name="0711302000286"><div class="hs_Para">These
thresholds also apply to eligibility for a sexual offences prevention
order, which means that if these criteria are not met, there is no
discretion for a court to make an offender subject to an order, even if
the offender poses a risk of sexual harm. By contrast, where someone
has been convicted of one of the violent offences in schedule 5, no
such thresholds exist and the court has discretion to make the
individual subject to an order, regardless of any age or sentence
criteria. Under new clause 39 thresholds in schedule 3 will be
disregarded for the purposes of making an order. That will provide
courts with the same discretion to make sexual offences prevention
orders for those convicted of sexual offences as they currently have
for those convicted of violent offences. That will help the police to
restrict the offending behaviour of offenders in certain
cases.</div>
					<a name="0711302000287"><div class="hs_Para">I apologise to
the Committee for what was a fairly long introduction to this series of
amendments, but given their importance, I wanted to read much of that
into the record so that people would have clarity about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column699" />Column number: 699</div>what the Government are proposing. I look forward to the debate, as I
know that we all share the aim of protecting our children from sex
offenders.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001051">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am most grateful, Sir Nicholas. This is a very
important debate within the context of this Bill and we need to take
due care here. I very much appreciate the way that the Minister
approached the subject and made the point that had to be made: if we
disagree about the means it does not mean to say that we disagree about
the end, which is the proper protection of children in our society from
sexual offenders. He knows, because this has been a matter of enormous
controversy over the years, the genuine reservations that not only
observers but practitioners in this area have about the widespread
disclosure of information on sexual offenders. They are concerned about
the consequences for the management of those offenders in society and
the ability to keep proper tabs on their activities and the
consequences for the children who should be the focus of our
attention.</div>
					<a name="0711302000290"><div class="hs_Para">The view
from the Home Office over many years was to reject calls for anything
that could be described as Megan&#146;s law or Sarah&#146;s law, on
the grounds that it would make matters worse. There has been vocal
support in some parts of the popular press, and indeed popular support,
for such a law, because unless one thinks it through it seems an
obvious move to let everyone know where a sexual offender lives and
that they are in a particular community, so that everybody can take
proper care. We cannot begin to address the issues properly until we
think through what the consequences are in terms of the ability to
manage someone on the sexual offences register and to ensure that they
do not renege on the commitments that they give as part of their
management regime and disappear, posing a much greater risk to children
in other areas.</div>
					<a name="0711302000291"><div class="hs_Para">As I
said, the Home Office rejected those calls for a long time. Then, for
reasons that I do not entirely understand, there was a change of view.
The view was that they should send a Minister over to America, and
perhaps there is merit in Megan&#146;s law after all. The Minister
did his study tour of America and looked at the experience there. When
he came back, the view was still that we do not want this
measure.</div>
					<a name="0711302000292"><div class="hs_Para">The empirical
evidence in America is very clear that this measure does not improve
the protection of children from sexual offenders. Off the record, some
of the best-known practitioners in the police forces of the United
States who have worked within this legal construct and outside it say
that we do it better. We do it better with MAPPA and the sexual
offenders register. Far from making it easier for the police to do
their work, this law makes it considerably more difficult. That is
quite apart from the corrosive effect that the disclosure can have on
the individual. Some people would say that they deserve it, because
they have committed some of the most serious crimes that society can
imagine, but if it causes further social disengagement, it perhaps
encourages exactly the sort of crime that we want to
discourage.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column700" />Column number: 700</div>
					<a name="0711302000293"><div class="hs_Para">I am a little surprised that at
the end of that process of careful consideration, the outcome was to
bring the measure back to the Committee. I say from the outset that the
measure before us is the least bad option: there were options that I
would have been more strongly resistant to. This suggests to me that
the Home Office feels constrained to do something by a decision taken
by a previous proprietor. However, having taken everything into
account, it wants to do the minimum that is consistent with the
commitments that were made. I may be wrong, and I may be
misinterpreting the position, but it feels strongly as if this is the
bare minimum that the Home Office feels it can do to be consistent with
previous policy, while not changing the arrangements too much. I
understand that.</div>
					<a name="0711302000294"><div class="hs_Para">I
respect the fact that the Minister is trying do the best job that he
can on the policy area with which he is dealing. However, I still do
not agree, because I think that the good practice that he described is
being done already. Those for whom there is a real risk are notified
under the present arrangements. That is done discreetly, quietly and is
not splashed all over the tabloids or the local newspapers. It is
absolutely right that they are told and that proper precautions are in
place.</div>
					<a name="0711302000295"><div class="hs_Para">I sometimes
criticise the resourcing that is available to MAPPA, because I am
always fearful that we expect an awful lot from people in this very
difficult area and do not always provide the resources that they need
to do it properly. Nevertheless, my general view is that they fulfil
their duties conscientiously, carefully, and with considerable
success.</div>

					<a name="0711302000297"><div class="hs_Para">Does the
hon. Gentleman accept that where agencies engage in such good practice,
they are left hung out to dry if something goes wrong? That has been a
real issue in my constituency. They have no legal protection at all. If
there is any criticism of what happens or there is a climate of fear
because of what is going on in the tabloid newspapers, they clamp down
and do not persist with good practice and things move
backwards.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001053">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady because I do
recognise that issue. One of my concerns about the proposals is that
they make that situation worse, by the word
&#147;presumption&#148;. If authorities are no longer to have
discretion, it will be expected because of the word
&#147;presumption&#148; that they will release the information
except where they judge that it is not in the child&#146;s interests
to do so.</div>
					<a name="0711302000299"><div class="hs_Para">What will
happen when it goes wrong? If the authorities take the view that they
should not release information to a family or institution and an
incident happens, the media will crawl all over them saying,
&#147;The presumption was that you should have released the
information, and you didn&#146;t. How could you possibly have come to
the conclusion that X, a known sex offender, should be on the loose in
our community and not tell the local primary school or swimming pool,
or the woman who lives two doors away?&#148; With a presumption in
favour of providing such information, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column701" />Column number: 701</div>it will be almost impossible for the responsible authorities to answer
that
question.</div>
					<a name="0711302000300"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001054">Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,
but is it not true that that type of situation arises under existing
arrangements as
well?</div>
					<a name="0711302000301"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001055">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> Yes&#151;I think that the hon. Member for
Northampton, North made that point&#151;but the measures will make it
worse. They will change it from an entirely rational view taken by the
authorities, on the basis of all the information at their disposal
about whether to notify, to a presumption in favour of notifying and
releasing information. That will raise expectations that cannot
possibly be satisfied if the authorities are to do their job. It also
raises the issue of liability. Where there is a legal presumption in
favour of releasing information, the information is not given and an
incident occurs, will there be a liability on the public authority for
not having done what was presumed in the Bill?</div>
					<a name="0711302000302"><div class="hs_Para">While I am dealing with such
issues, there is a further complication. If an individual is notified,
they are required to keep it confidential. How on earth can
Mrs. X be notified confidentially that her children are at
risk from an offender? If she sees that the children of Mrs.
Y, her good friend and near neighbour, are being befriended by that
individual, do we really expect Mrs. X not to tell
Mrs. Y the information that she has been given&#151;that
that person is a registered sex offender? Will that offender constitute
a risk to Mrs. X&#146;s children but not to the other
children? It is not realistic to expect that that confidentiality can
be respected, and I venture a guess that in certain circumstances it
will not be. What will be the
consequence?</div>
					<a name="0711302000303"><div class="hs_Para">To return
to my amendments, the Minister, absolutely rightly, saw through some of
them, quickly identifying that their purpose was to remove the
presumption. That is exactly what they seek to do&#151;to change the
terms of his amendment to respect the current practice of MAPPA
authorities. However, amendments (a) and (b) would move a little in his
direction if they were passed. They would require every MAPPA
authority, when making such assessments, to consider whether to release
the information. They would leave intact the discretion but maintain
the principle, which I think he was espousing, that consideration
should be made in every
case.</div>

							<a name="0711302001057">Mr.

to preserve best practice, which I believe we have, rather than
introducing a distortion of that practice, which I believe is what the
Minister intends. I hope that we can have a friendly discussion about
it, however, because that presumption worries me.</div>
					<a name="0711302000306"><div class="hs_Para">I accept the Minister&#146;s

the Minister for saying that he will consider the matter on Report.
However, unless he is going to spell the word differently, why not
accept the amendments now rather than taking time on Report, when time
is always limited, so that the amendments can be in his name rather

					<a name="0711302000313"><div class="hs_Para">I think I heard
the Minister say that such a provision is implicit in the Bill, in
which case the amendment is less necessary.</div>
					<a name="0711302000314"><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will
consider amendment (g) a little more, and the implication that the
clause gives people a right to demand the information. He may
underestimate the response of the general public, especially when they
are reminded or encouraged&#151;or whatever the appropriate verb
is&#151;by the tabloid press to take a positive interest; he may find
it much more difficult to resist a request for information than he
supposes.</div>
					<a name="0711302000315"><div class="hs_Para">I went
through this some years ago, when Mr. Sidney
Cooke&#151;some Members will remember him&#151;was on my patch, and
it was not a happy experience. It took a lot of clear thinking and much
determination, by the authorities and by elected Members, to resist the
view that we should throw him to the wolves and advise everyone in
which of our police stations he was resident. It was a difficult
situation. I ask the Committee not to underestimate the fact that it
can cause enormous upset in communities. Strong
representations&#151;I put it politely&#151;will be made if people
suspect that there is a sexual offender in the area.</div>
					<a name="0711302000316"><div class="hs_Para">I have spoken extensively on
this group of amendments, because it is an important issue. Other
innovative practices are in place at the moment, quite apart from the
MAPPA proposals. Some members of the Committee may be aware of the
Circle of Friends initiative; it is enormously valuable. I have spoken
to people who give up their time to befriend others and to provide that
sort of service. Some are Quakers, members of the Society of Friends,
which is active in my constituency, but it is not exclusively a matter
for them. I cannot sufficiently express my admiration for those who are
prepared to undertake such difficult work in order to reduce
reoffending by individuals for whom they have little personal sympathy.
They try hard 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column703" />Column number: 703</div>to act as mentors, as befrienders&#151;as people to whom others can
turn whenever they are tempted to reoffend. I do not want that to be
disrupted and fear that the proposals, well intentioned as they might
be, will undermine not only our formal protection procedures, but
initiatives such as those I have described. For those reasons, I think
that my amendments would improve the clause in the main. I am still not
persuaded that the clause will advance the present situation&#151;it
may be a serious
regression.</div>

this issue, as I am sure the Government have done over the past eight
years or so.</div>
					<a name="0711302000318"><div class="hs_Para">We all
remember in September 2000, the then Home Secretary announcing what was
called</div>
					<a name="0711302000890"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a package of
measures intended to strengthen the protection of children and provide
better information to the public on the management of sexual and
violent offenders in the community.&#148;
</div>
					<a name="0711302000319"><div class="hs_Para">In the course of that press
release, he was quoted as saying:</div>
					<a name="0711302000891"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These proposals have
come about after close consultation with the police and probation
services.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000320"><div class="hs_Para">Again, we have had
further mention of close consultation from the Minister. The Home
Secretary
continued:</div>
					<a name="0711302000892"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
part of this, I have considered very closely the question whether there
could be some form of controlled access to the Sex Offenders&#146;
Register. But in practice controlling such access would be impossible
to enforce. The arguments against a general right of access are well
rehearsed. Such an arrangement would not in our judgement assist the
protection of children or public safety.</div>
					<a name="0711302000893"><div class="hs_brev">Controlled disclosure is I
believe the better and safer route. Therefore I have concluded that the
professional agencies&#151;the police and probation
services&#151;are best placed to determine the disclosure of
information on individual sex offenders.</div>
					<a name="0711302000894"><div class="hs_brev">But I do believe that the public
should have a right to know what measures the police and probation
services have in place to protect the public. The guidance which I will
issue will also include the question of disclosure of information to
groups or individuals and will help to develop a consistent approach.
The introduction of the Criminal Records Bureau will enable better
information to be
provided.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000321"><div class="hs_Para">I
will not go into a long rant on the
Government&#146;s failure to follow the Bichard inquiry&#146;s
recommendations on the need to set up a more effective national police
computer system. I will pray in aid MAPPA, as the hon. Gentleman has
done. Although those arrangements have had a few hiccups, by and large
they have worked pretty well&#151;the failure rate is under 3 per
cent. There will always be cases where the probation services or the
police do not manage to keep an eye on a particularly ill-motivated
person and a terrible crime is committed.</div>
					<a name="0711302000322"><div class="hs_Para">I know that the Government are
in trouble over pretty well anything to do with IT. Problems over
CNOMIS, which have been mentioned in the Committee before, and problems
over VISOR, which is the violent and sex offender register IT system,
are also becoming increasingly apparent. Huge sums of money are spent
to make those systems work. Sometimes they do and sometimes they do
not. Essentially, machinery is in place to ensure that children are
protected from attacks or interference by sex offenders, as best as can
be humanly arranged.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column704" />Column number: 704</div>
					<a name="0711302000323"><div class="hs_Para">Since the Home Secretary made
that announcement in 2000, various tabloid newspapers
have become interested in such cases, no doubt for genuine reasons, but
also for reasons of circulation and competition. They make good reading
and sell newspapers. When a tabloid newspaper gets hold of an idea,
Governments become frightened and lose their judgment. They do things
that they might not do under cooler circumstances. I suspect that in
this case, the Government feel that they have been forced into at least
doing something, rather than doing everything that the various tabloid
newspapers, which have run with these campaigns, want them to do. We
all understand the difficulties of being in government, just as we
understand that politics is not always a rational exercise of mental
thought.</div>

					<a name="0711302000324"><div class="hs_Para">I want to look
at new clause 38. In case one starts feeling sorry for the Minister
having to read rather than be spontaneous&#151;I think perhaps that
he meant extemporary rather than spontaneous&#151;I hope that he was
not being spontaneous, because then we are in even more trouble than I
thought that we were. It is difficult to think that
the Government are anything other than spontaneous, if one considers
that since the Bill was first published, they have come forward with 85
Government new clauses. That has nothing to do with an interfering
Opposition thinking up tedious points and moving commas around, these
are 85 Government new clauses, and that is without adding up the number
of amendments and new schedules. No doubt they are designed to improve
the Bill. However, whether the Minister was being spontaneous, speaking
extemporarily or reading verbatim things he had thought about earlier
in his office, I am not sure that new clause 38 is the best way to
improve the protection of children from child sex offenders.</div>
					<a name="0711302000325"><div class="hs_Para">What factors will weigh in the
minds of those who have to do the considering, as
referred to in subsection (1) of proposed new section 327A to the
Criminal Justice Act 2003? What will be considered when deciding
whether to disclose some information about the relevant previous
convictions of a child sex offender to a member of the public? Are the
considerations that would apply to member of the public A, different
from those applying to member of public B? Would different
considerations apply in relation to an institution such as a
children&#146;s home, or a facility open to the public, as

There are equal concerns with regard to subsection (3)(b) of proposed

offender.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000330"><div class="hs_Para">&#151;or
&#147;serious harm&#148;, as we now think it will
be.</div>
					<a name="0711302000331"><div class="hs_Para">There is the same
relationship with regard to subsections (4) and (5). What do the
Government expect the person to whom the information is disclosed to do
with it? What do they expect the mother or grandmother of a child, or
the carer of a group of children, to do when given information that in
the next door flat or near to where they are, lives somebody with
previous convictions for child sex offences? Are they expected to keep
that information to themselves and say, &#147;I&#146;m glad
I&#146;ve been told that.&#148; Are they expected to do something
positive with the information such as move house, change schools, or
not go to a particular swimming pool? Should they inform others?
Clearly, they are not intended to inform others as that would be a
breach of the disclosure arrangements. There needs to be some clearer
thinking about what is proposed to be done by the person who receives
the information. There will be breaches and people will probably
contact the tabloid newspapers and say, &#147;Guess what? I have been
told that such and such a person lives four doors down the
road,&#148; or someone will have a conversation with a neighbour and
so the rumour mill will grow.</div>
					<a name="0711302000332"><div class="hs_Para">No doubt the inaccuracy of the
information will become greater as the story gets further and further
from the original source and we will come to the extraordinary and
utterly unpleasant situation that occurred in a housing estate in
Portsmouth not so long ago, when a paediatrician&#146;s property was
attacked because the attackers did not know the difference between a
doctor who looks after children and a child sex pervert who does
anything but look after children. Although those are rather fanciful
extensions of the position against which the Government seek to protect
us all, it is amazing how often the most exaggerated examples prove
eventually to come to fruition.</div>

						</b> It is not clear what the sanction is for anyone who
is given a disclosure subject to a condition that prevents them from
disclosing the information to any other person. If it is a criminal
sanction, can the hon. and learned Gentleman imagine any jury finding a
person who has passed on information about a convicted sex offender to
another parent guilty of any conceivable
offence?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001067">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I may have been careless but I am not sure I can
see what the sanction is in the new clause, which would bite in the
event of impermissible disclosure of information. There are references
to the impermissible disclosure of information in other parts of the
Bill, so perhaps we are supposed to guess how it fits. It might be a
matter of summary events or lead simply to civil liability. It is
bolting the stable door after the horse has left the premises to rush
round getting an injunction, because that will have gone. It may be
that one can do all sorts of things but we should be told what the
Government have in mind and remind ourselves what the Secretary of
State for Justice and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column706" />Column number: 706</div>Lord Chancellor said in 2000 about the confidentiality of the
information, which will be extremely difficult to
enforce.</div>
					<a name="0711302000335"><div class="hs_Para">The
late Lord Donaldson, Master of the Rolls, when dealing with a case on
the disclosure of confidential information said that
publishing confidential information was rather like putting a block of
ice in the sun, because once it is in the sun it melts and its value as
confidential information goes. I do not know whether his tongue was in
his cheek or whether he did not know how funny he was
being.</div>
					<a name="0711302000336"><div class="hs_Para">We need to be
careful about the consequences of the new clause. I think it is
tabloid-driven and politically driven; I regret that the protection
measures that have been in place since MAPPA and the creation of the
sex offenders register although not perfect need to be further extended
by this proposal and I urge the Committee to be extremely sceptical, to
the point of rejecting new clause
38.</div>
					<a name="0711302000337"><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman
quite properly said that the new clause could well raise expectations.
We do not need to go into the detail of the arguments but it presents
legal liability problems. I believe that the mother of one of the
victims of the Yorkshire Ripper brought a case against West Yorkshire
police for failing to protect her daughter from the activities of the
Yorkshire Ripper&#151;I think that the case was called Taylor, but
the hon. Gentleman will tell me.</div>
					<a name="0711302000338"><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0711302001068">
							<b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): The hon. Gentleman should bear
it in mind that that case was lost by the plaintive, and that it is
difficult to obtain civil liability against the authorities in such
circumstances, but the point that he is making about the lack of
clarity on the sanction in the new clause is important. The normal
presumption would be that where no criminal penalty is put forward, and
where the obligation is not on the state but on a private individual,
civil liability is intended by Parliament. I think that it is incumbent
on Ministers to say what they mean.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.

							<b class="B">:</b>
						I am partly grateful, and partly peeved by
the hon. Gentleman. I am peeved because I was about to explain that
Mrs. Taylor&#151;if that is what her name was&#151;was
not able to establish liability against West Yorkshire police for
failing to protect her daughter from the future attack by the Yorkshire
Ripper. However, the second point that he made is a good one and I
entirely agree with it.</div>
					<a name="0711302000340"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001070">Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman seems to imply
that he may vote against new clause 38, but if he refers to subsection
(5) of the proposed new clause 327A to the Criminal Justice Act 2003,
he will see that it
states:</div>
					<a name="0711302000897"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
the responsible authority makes a disclosure under this
section...it may impose conditions for preventing the member of
the public concerned from disclosing the information to any other
person.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000341"><div class="hs_Para">My understanding of that
situation is that if the authority imposed such conditions and then the
person did disclose the information, there would be the sanctions of
liability that the hon. Gentleman has already mentioned, but also, if
in disclosing that information there was then an assault or any other
type of criminal activity, that would of course be subject to the
criminal law.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001071">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> That is all after the event. Once the information
is out, its value as confidential information has gone. I can
understand that the mother of a child might want to be told if a sex
offender lived next door to her, but we do not know what the conditions
are and we do not know what the sanctions will be for breaking the
conditions. If they are going to be criminal sanctions, they ought to
be on the face of the Bill. If we are extending the criminal law, we
should know how we are doing it.</div>
					<a name="0711302000343"><div class="hs_Para">In relation to civil liability,
how far down the chain of causality does one go? If I tell my
neighbour, my neighbour tells someone else and we move 20 or 30 people
down the road, and that twentieth person then grievously assaults or
kills the sex offender, how far back does the Government think that
they are going to go in pinning liability on the disclosure of the
confidential information? Often, these people are not going to have any
money to pay damages; often what is needed is anticipatory relief, not
ex post facto relief. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Cambridge,
who has now reminded me that the mother of the victim of the Yorkshire
ripper was called Mrs. Hill. As I was about to say and he
did say, she was unable to pin civil liability on West Yorkshire
police.</div>

quite enough. I said that my remarks were going to be short but they

							<a name="0711302001072">Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I shall not be spontaneous but extemporary. In
many of the debates, including that on the provisions on homophobia and
incitement to hatred of gay people, the standard has been very good,
particularly the contribution of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary.
Opposition Members have raised some interesting points, but the
legislation before us is not tabloid-driven. There is a real debate in
all our communities and in all sections of the country about the best
way to protect our children from paedophiles. I accept that we all wish
to do that, and I do not suggest that anybody in the
Committee&#151;from whatever party&#151;intends to make the country
less safe for children. To suggest otherwise would be ludicrous and
insulting. However, there is a real debate, which is driven not just by
tabloid newspapers, but by ordinary people, unless hon. Members&#146;
constituencies are different from mine.</div>
					<a name="0711302000346"><div class="hs_Para">Ordinary people are talking. I
do not mean that in a disparaging sense. People who live in our
communities, take their children to school and worry about these
matters ask what the Government are doing to protect them from people
whom they see as a threat to their children. The answer could be that
the Government are doing everything possible, nothing further needs to
be done and we just shrug our shoulders or it could be that the
existing system is fine and there is no need to change the law.
Frankly, we did not feel that either response was appropriate, but we
knew that there were huge variations of opinion.</div>
					<a name="0711302000347"><div class="hs_Para">Some people say that we should
keep everything among professionals, others that everybody should have
the right to know everything. The Government thought, &#147;How do we
respond to that? What is the best way forward?&#148;. So we went out
to consultation, and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column708" />Column number: 708</div>then Minister, now the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport, went to the United States to examine practice there. We
consulted a huge range of stakeholders, as every hon. Member knows.
They will have seen the review of protection in respect of child sex
offenders, and I do not want to read out every stakeholder, but people
from the Association of Chief Police Officers, through the probation
service, to children&#146;s charities all made a contribution to the
very real debate about what we do to protect our children. We felt, and
I feel, that the reasonable approach that the review tries to take is
the way in which politics ought to be conducted. It presents a real
change while offering some reassurance to people who have concerns
about how their children will be protected.</div>
					<a name="0711302000348"><div class="hs_Para">I was grateful to the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome for his appreciation of
my point about the reasonableness with which we have tried to advance
the issue. I hope that the Committee consider the measure a reasonable
response to a very difficult problem. The Government think it necessary
to move forward, but we want to do so proportionately, without
allowing, as the hon. and learned Member for Harborough said, those
appalling scenes in which people mistake paediatricians or others for
paedophiles. That, however, does not alter the fact that a very real
issue exists.</div>
					<a name="0711302000349"><div class="hs_Para">We have
not taken the move lightly, and I take absolutely the point from the
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that we must be careful and
proportionate about the way in which we move forward. If we go too far,
there is a real risk that, instead of protecting children and alerting
people to the dangerous paedophile who may be in their community, we
just lose track of the paedophile and control of the situation, because
they go underground. Equally, we have tried to address the support and
help that we could give parents or head teachers and how to provide
them with information to assist them in protecting children who are
their responsibility.</div>
					<a name="0711302000351"><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0711302001073">
							<b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): Although I believe in
rehabilitation, there is a question that we need to address about
whether dangerous paedophiles should be returned to the
community.</div>
					<a name="0711302000352"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001074">Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Risk to the community is a very real issue. At
present, however, we are discussing the MAPPA arrangements, which have
been very successful in dealing with child sex offenders and other
violent offenders. We are considering what extension to the powers of
disclosure would be helpful.</div>
					<a name="0711302000353"><div class="hs_Para">This is not
Megan&#146;s law. It is controlled disclosure, not automatic
disclosure. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome mentioned
presumption, but there is a presumption in the existing guidance
available to MAPPA. The decision on whether to disclose to third
parties must be considered in all MAPPA-managed cases, and all level 2
and 3 MAPPA meetings must consider disclosure, with the presumption
that it will occur.</div>
					<a name="0711302000354"><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are putting a duty on the relevant authorities to try to
overcome some of the variations between different MAPPA authorities in
different parts of the country. It is surely right to have that
consistency, so that the performance of the best 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column709" />Column number: 709</div>MAPPA authorities is replicated across the country, and our children get
the level of protection that we all
want.</div>
					<a name="0711302000355"><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome mentioned America. He knows that
there is automatic disclosure there, and that is not what is being
proposed. I mentioned earlier to the hon. and learned Member for
Harborough the conditions that we can impose in response to subsection
(5)(b). We believe that sanctions are available through both the civil
and criminal routes if people break those conditions. When people ask
how that will stop someone disclosing when they should not, they
underestimate the deterrent effect that the law can have. If we say to
people, &#147;These are the conditions under which you are to be
given the information, and if you break them you may well be subject
either to a civil sanction or to the criminal law&#148;, that would
for many people operate as a deterrent.</div>
					<a name="0711302000356"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001075">Mr.
Walker:
						</b> On a slightly technical point,
if someone who owned a home was told that their new near neighbour was
a paedophile who posed a danger to children, and, having learned that
information, decided to sell their home and move on, would they be
obliged to tell the purchasers or would the authorities do
so?</div>
					<a name="0711302000357"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001076">Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Not necessarily, because it would depend on the
purchasers&#146; circumstances. If the purchasers had young children,
it would be for the MAPPA authorities to consider whether they should
be told.</div>
					<a name="0711302000358"><div class="hs_Para">We have had a
good debate. I have tried to assure the hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome in particular on the inclusion of the word
&#147;serious&#148;, to which we shall return on Report. Without
making any commitment, I shall consider his concern in relation to
people demanding disclosure from the MAPPA authorities, and ensure that
that concern is covered. At present, however, my understanding is that
we can control the position by means of guidance.</div>

							<a name="0711302001079">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The amendments address how we look at the
control of tobacco sales to persons under the age of 18. The Government
strongly favour the view that more needs to be done to tackle under-age
smoking. All members of the Committee recognise that access to
cigarettes remains far too easy for many. In a recent survey, fewer
than a quarter of 11 to 15-year-olds who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column713" />Column number: 713</div>tried to buy cigarettes from small shops found it difficult to do so. We
need to encourage retailers to comply with the recent changes in the
law to raise the level of the age of purchase of cigarettes to 18, and
to prevent the sale to children and young teenagers of a product that
it is generally recognised can cause addiction, long-term health
problems and premature
death.</div>
					<a name="0711302000374"><div class="hs_Para">Ministers at the
Department of Health introduced in 2004 the &#147;Choosing
Health&#148; White Paper, in which the Government signalled their
intention to introduce preventive measures such as those before us that
will effectively deal with those who repeatedly sell cigarettes and
tobacco products to under-age children through a negative licensing
scheme. The implementation of the scheme, which was discussed in the
2004 paper, was subject to public consultation last year by the
Department of Health and my predecessors. The vast majority of
respondents felt that the approach was preferable to the alternative,
which would have been a positive licensing
scheme.</div>
					<a name="0711302000375"><div class="hs_Para">Government new
clause 41 puts into effect the proposals for a negative licensing
system by enabling magistrates to impose orders on retailers
prohibiting the sale of tobacco for up to one year for persistent
flouting of the law restricting the sale of tobacco to people under the
minimum age of
18.</div>
					<a name="0711302000376"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001080">Mr.
Hollobone:
						</b> I would be genuinely interested to know how the
proposal compares with similar proposals with regard to persistent
sales of alcohol to those under
18.</div>
					<a name="0711302000377"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001081">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> There is a difference of approach in relation to
alcohol sales. One of the later amendments tabled, I think, by the hon.
Member for Enfield, Southgate relates to that. I would like to listen
to his arguments and potentially respond to the queries made by the
hon. Member for Kettering at that point. Initially, I want to speak to
the Government new clauses and pause to let the hon. Gentleman and
others comment on the Opposition clauses. I will try to respond to
those matters in due
course.</div>
					<a name="0711302000378"><div class="hs_Para">The Government
new clauses introduce two new types of order. First, a restricted
premises order, which prohibits the sale of tobacco on the premises at
which there has been persistent flouting of the law on under-age sales
of tobacco. The second is a restricted sales order, which will prohibit
any person to whom it relates from selling tobacco or cigarettes from a
shop or vending machines, or from managing the shop where the offences
occurred or other shops where tobacco is sold. Both orders are needed
to ensure that the retailer cannot simply avoid the restrictive
premises order by, for example, transferring management to another
person.</div>
					<a name="0711302000984"><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div>
					<a name="0711302000379"><div class="hs_Para">It is my strong
view that the measures adequately reflect the seriousness of selling
tobacco to children and to young teenagers. Given the change in the law
this year, which raised the age to 18, it is important that we look at
those retailers that persistently flout the law. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column714" />Column number: 714</div>Most retailers are responsible, sensible and attempt to abide by the
law, but if we examine the performance of retailers across England and
Wales, there will, sadly, occasionally be some who persistently flout
the law. The sanction is reserved solely for the most serious cases.
When there has been a persistent flouting of the law, local authorities
will be able to apply to the courts for an order following conviction
for breaking the minimum age law on at least two occasions previously
within a two-year period. That is both fair and reasonable.</div>
					<a name="0711302000380"><div class="hs_Para">In the legislation, I am
attempting to ensure that we do not come down on retailers at the first
opportunity. That can happen and the retailer can be taken to court. If
someone commits more than two offences within a two-year period, there
is a serial nature to those offences, and the opportunity is there for
the local authority to apply for an order. The order can be one of the
two types before the Committee today. Managers of retail premises
selling tobacco products have a responsibility to train their staff in
compliance, to keep within the law and to ensure that, as far as
possible, the minimum age requirements are met by those who work in the
various outlets.</div>
					<a name="0711302000381"><div class="hs_Para">If
there is doubt about the customer&#146;s age, staff
should ask&#151;as I hope that they will do&#151;to seek proof of
age, such as driving licences, passports or other cards with
tamper-proof holograms. There is an opportunity for us to look at
changing the culture, setting a standard and giving local authorities
the ability to tackle persistent offenders in a very strong
way.</div>
					<a name="0711302000382"><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 248 ensures that only offences committed after the
commencement of new clause 41 would be relevant when the court
considers whether to make a restricted premises or sales order.
Whatever the outcome of our discussions on the Opposition amendments, I
hope that those two clauses can be accepted in Committee. I await the
discussions on the amendments and will respond
accordingly.</div>
					<a name="0711302000383"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001082">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I am glad to respond to new clause 41 and to
speak to the amendments in our names. The context of the provisions is
the extension of the minimum age of 18 to the availability of tobacco.
That is an important point from which to start. My comments, and the
new clause, are supported by the British Retail Consortium, which is
the lead trade association and represents a whole range of retailers,
from large multiples and department stores through to independents,
selling a wide range of products in towns, rural areas and virtual
stores and by the Association of Convenience Stores, which is the voice
of 30,000 local shops in the UK and has members in town centres,
neighbourhoods and rural areas across the country. The representatives
of the BRC and the ACS cover a wide range of retailers, which support
the Government&#146;s new clause 41, but feel that the issue needs to
be addressed proportionately. They express both concern and support for
the Government&#146;s target to reduce the availability of tobacco
for young people, but want a consistent approach.</div>
					<a name="0711302000384"><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Kettering mentioned alcohol, and there needs to be a
consistent approach to the way that we deal with alcohol and tobacco
sales and enforcement. It is also important&#151;and I welcome the
Minister&#146;s comments in relation to responsible
retailers&#151;to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column715" />Column number: 715</div>ensure that we are supporting responsible retailers, because they are at
the front line, ensuring that any strategies concerning the
availability of tobacco and alcohol for young people are properly
enforced. We need to support those
retailers.</div>
					<a name="0711302000385"><div class="hs_Para">We must also
recognise the context in which this law would be applied. More often
than not, that context would be the small local shop with a rapid
turnover of staff, including temporary staff, who have to deal at the
counter with people asking for alcohol or tobacco. There is also a fair
turnover among the management of such shops.</div>
					<a name="0711302000386"><div class="hs_Para">Regarding tobacco, the other
context is that industry figures show that, on average, tobacco
accounts for up to 22.3 per cent. of turnover in such shops. The sale
of tobacco is a key part of their business, particularly for those
shops that, in many areas, are struggling for survival. It is important
that we support those small shops in particular and show those shops
that have responsible management that we are on their
side.</div>
					<a name="0711302000387"><div class="hs_Para">New clause 41
warrants support, in that it presents tough but flexible penalties. In
trying to have a proportionate response, the amendments put forward in
my name and those of my hon. Friends&#151;amendments (a) to
(d)&#151;seek to alter the time period during which the three
offences can take place, from two years to three months, and also to
reduce the maximum period of a ban on tobacco sales from one year to
three months. Taken together with amendment (e), there would be a
requirement for trading standards officers, if they have evidence that
an under-age sale offence took place, to notify the premises
involved.</div>
					<a name="0711302000388"><div class="hs_Para">The
remaining amendments and new clause 51 try to achieve equality between
the way that we apply tobacco laws and the way that we apply alcohol
laws. We seek to make it illegal for someone under 18 to buy tobacco
products and to make it illegal for someone over 18 to buy tobacco on
behalf of someone under
18.</div>
					<a name="0711302000389"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001083">Mr.
Hollobone:
						</b> As I understand it, the Licensing Act 2003 made
it a criminal offence for a young person to attempt to buy alcohol or
for an adult to supply them by proxy. Is this Bill not a superb
opportunity to have the same rules and regulations with regard to
tobacco products? I simply do not understand why the Government are not
making that simple link.</div>
					<a name="0711302000390"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001084">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for his intervention and it encourages me to take new clause 51
first. I support his point; from the point of view of both consistency
and equality, there is a need to deal with the issue of tobacco in the
same manner as we deal with alcohol. New clause 51 seeks to do that, to
achieve equality between the law on selling tobacco and the law on
selling alcohol. Presently, anyone under 18 who attempts to buy alcohol
is committing an offence, but anyone under 18 who attempts to buy
tobacco is not.</div>
					<a name="0711302000391"><div class="hs_Para">That
puts the legal onus entirely on the retailer and our concern is that we
should ensure that the young person themselves is also made accountable
and we would achieve that by new clause 51. We would like to see the
law changed so that the young person is made properly accountable for
their actions, and that change would put the law on the side of the
responsible retailer who wants to ensure that that young person knows
that, if they attempt to buy tobacco, the law will come 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column716" />Column number: 716</div>down on them and not be on their side. In new clause 51, we would prefer
that they were dealt with by way of a fine, which would be a
proportionate response and act as a deterrent in the first place, to
try to stop them buying tobacco themselves or having an adult buy it on
their behalf.</div>
					<a name="0711302000392"><div class="hs_Para">The
remaining amendments in our names seek to deal with the issue of
proportionality in different ways. First, amendments (a) to (d) concern
the length of reference period. We suggest that the reference period
should be reduced from two years to three months. As discussed before,
that would create parity with the sanction on the sale of alcohol in
the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006. It is important to recognise that
staff and managerial turnover levels are high in the retail sector and
the most effective way to put the sanctions in place through the
Government&#146;s approach would be for a short time frame. Three
months would enable staff and management to deal properly with the
matter. If there were three test purchases in a three-month period,
that would certainly be a serious and persistent offence, which the
Government would seek to address. It would need to be dealt with
properly and
firmly.</div>
					<a name="0711302000393"><div class="hs_Para">Given the high
turnover, staff and management in business might have to deal with
offences that took place two years ago, which is not right or fair.
That is why we have tabled amendments (a) to (d), which would deal
proportionately and effectively with the intention behind the
Government&#146;s new clause
40.</div>
				
					<a name="0711302000394"><div class="hs_Para">Amendment (a)
would reduce the one year ban, which is too long a sanction.
Proportionality is necessary, given that convenience stores and
newsagents have a high turnover. It is also important to recognise that
if we ban the selling of tobacco in those businesses, particularly the
small ones, a key part of their trade would be wiped out, which could
increase the threat of bankruptcy. We should instead be tackling
persistent offenders over a short time frame. That is the essence of
our
amendments.</div>
					<a name="0711302000395"><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
(e) deals with notification periods for the premises involved. The
British Retail Consortium and the ACS are concerned because they think
that it is important to give proper notice. When enforcement is needed
and a prosecution is to take place, a 14-day period, in which the
retailer can put matters right, would be more appropriate than to delay
notification of enforcement. That would demonstrate that we are on the
side of responsible retailers as well as those that want to put their
house in
order.</div>
					<a name="0711302000396"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001085">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> The Opposition&#146;s amendments make some
useful points that are worth discussing in a helpful context. I cannot
accept all the amendments, but some raise points worthy of further
examination.</div>
					<a name="0711302000397"><div class="hs_Para">I shall
start with the negatives, so that I can end on a positive note.
Amendments (b) and (d) would reduce to three months the period prior to
an offence that may be considered by a court when deciding whether to
make an order, and amendments (a) and (c) would shorten the length of a
ban. Those would not be helpful and I cannot accept them.</div>
					<a name="0711302000398"><div class="hs_Para">There are differences and
similarities between alcohol and tobacco, but it is important to put
down markers to support positive retailers that follow the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column717" />Column number: 717</div>letter of the law and to crack down on those breaking
it. The hon. Gentleman will know that previous
legislation has examined the periods for alcohol, because it can cause
immediate and severe damage to individuals and is linked to antisocial
behaviour. Time frames for alcohol differ owing to its potentially
serious consequences for individuals and the community. I think that we
have got the right balance regarding the consideration period for
offences and for the length the
bans.</div>
					<a name="0711302000399"><div class="hs_Para">I cannot accept
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s case and I hope that my hon. Friends will
reject it, particularly because many local authorities undertake test
purchases of tobacco sales using young people once or twice a year
only. It is not practical, therefore, to carry out test purchases
within the three-month period that he suggested. Retailers that adopt
the legislation, work hard to enforce it and train their staff
effectively will not fall foul of the Bill or run the risk of the local
authority asking a magistrates court to impose an order. I am confident
that that includes the vast majority of retailers. We need to take
action against retailers that flout the law persistently by imposing
these fair and proportionate orders.</div>
					<a name="0711302000985"><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div>
					<a name="0711302000400"><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman makes a valid point about notification, and I am certainly
not opposed in principle to the concept of a notification requirement.
If he will let me, I shall be happy to take away that amendment today
to look at it in detail. I have sat in opposition, too, and although
good points are often made by the Opposition, the Government have to
consider their implications in a wider context before they can be
accepted. I am not opposed in principle to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
suggestion about notification. I would like to reflect on it and if it
is a practical, workable suggestion, I will certainly consider how we
can address it at a later stage. I cannot commit as yet to introducing
such an amendment at this stage, but I will certainly consider the
issue.</div>
					<a name="0711302000401"><div class="hs_Para">I turn to new
clause 51, tabled by the hon. Member for Kettering, to which the hon.
Member for Enfield, Southgate also referred. It would make it an
offence for a child to purchase tobacco or for an adult to buy tobacco
on behalf of a child. I recognise the good intention behind the new
clause, which tries to bring the legislation into line with what will
happen with alcohol. My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Ms
Butler) has tabled an early-day motion on this topic and has worked
very hard to get support for it. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for
Ealing, Southall has signed it. I have checked, and he is the only
Labour member of this Committee who has signed it so far. I know that
he, too, will feel strongly about this
matter.</div>
					<a name="0711302000402"><div class="hs_Para">There is merit
in looking at this issue again. I can give no commitments to introduce
any such measures, but I see the logic, particularly regarding adults
over the age of 18 who purchase cigarettes and other tobacco products
and give them to individuals under the age of 18. I should like to pray
in aid my own daughter, who is 17 but is in school with 18-year-olds.
She will not be 18 until next August, but she will have a whole year in
which other people are passing their 18th 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column718" />Column number: 718</div>birthdays. As it happens, my daughter does not smoke and I do not think
that her friends do, either. However, we are talking about a group of
friends who will work and mix together, and it would be quite possible
under the current provisions for an individual to purchase cigarettes,
even for their own year group, and spread them around the younger
members of that group, never mind adults
generally.</div>
					<a name="0711302000403"><div class="hs_Para">There is an
issue that needs to be examined and although I cannot commit to an
amendment, it is worthy of examination. I would take issue with the
criminalisation of young people under the age of 18 who may purchase
cigarettes. Again, I recognise that there is an anomaly regarding
alcohol and cigarettes, but I am not sure that I want to go down the
route of criminalising young people under the age of 18 who buy
cigarettes. However, I recognise that this is a difficult area and we
need to ensure that we put preventive measures in place.</div>
					<a name="0711302000404"><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the change in
legislation will also bring about a culture change, and that the
under-18s realise that buying cigarettes is not only illegal but bad
for them. That is why it is being made. It should set a benchmark for
retailers and for people over 18, so that they recognise that that is
the age of adulthood and that at that stage, people can make their free
decision. However, there needs to be a culture change generally to
reduce tobacco usage by the
under-18s.</div>
					<a name="0711302000405"><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment, which I believe would water
down the penalties and deterrents. I also ask him to withdraw his
amendment on notification, so that I can consider it outside Committee,
and his new clause 51. There are issues that I need to discuss with my
colleagues in the Department of Health and others. I also need to
examine the implications of his suggestions, and of those made by my
hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South and other colleagues who have
signed the early-day motion.</div>

context of those around her who could potentially purchase tobacco. His
daughter or her peers could also be behind the counter of a newsagent
in a part-time job and have to deal with the situation of a bunch of
their peers wanting to purchase cigarettes. Some of them would be 18
and some 17.</div>

The deterrence from enforcement should be for them, rather than the
onus being on the staff behind the counter&#151;who are often
part-time and young&#151;trying to enforce the new
limit.</div>
					<a name="0711302000411"><div class="hs_Para">A
wider concern is that it is important for the
Government to properly inform people about the changes. There should be
publicity at an early stage, before implementation, which makes it
clear to customers and retailers alike that there will be changes and
that there will be new sanctions. A concern has been expressed by those
organisations and by newsagents in my constituency about the complete
lack of information and publicity for the changes on 1 October, which
led to confusion and added pressure on small retailers. There must be
proper communication of public information by the Government at an
early stage.</div>
					<a name="0711302000412"><div class="hs_Para">I will
explain briefly another wider concern that was
expressed to me this week by the British Retail
Consortium. It concerns the word &#147;proportionate&#148;, which I
have mentioned a lot. While retailers want to support the Government in
introducing tough penalties for tobacco and alcohol sales to those who
are under-age, they are also concerned that there should be
proportionality in the way that criminal offences are followed up and
implemented on the ground. They have expressed concerns about
shoplifting. There are increasing pressures on small shops from
shoplifting day in and day out. There are often persistent shoplifters.
The retailers complain to the police, but it is not followed through.
It is thought of by some as a victimless crime, not least by the
offenders. We know that that is not the
case.</div>
					<a name="0711302000413"><div class="hs_Para">It is important
that there is effective implementation. Retailers want to be on the
side of supporting new legislation that stops the persistent sale of
tobacco and alcohol to those who are under-age, but they also want
support from the police to ensure that when they report offences, there
is proper follow-through. It is important that that message gets across
to retailers on the
streets.</div>

						</b> The amendments introduced by new schedule 10 are
mainly to the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, with corresponding changes to
the legislation for Northern Ireland. They are minor and technical
amendments to various procedures affecting appeals. The changes have
been formulated at the request of the senior judiciary and in
consultation with it. Their aim is to assist the efficient functioning
of the Court of Appeal criminal division, and to resolve anomalies and
minor difficulties to which the existing provisions have given
rise.</div>
					<a name="0711302000439"><div class="hs_Para">In summary, the
changes will impose a time limit on the trial judge&#146;s power to
grant a certificate of fitness for appeal and empower the Court of
Appeal, when it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column722" />Column number: 722</div>quashes a conviction, to resentence the appellant for any other offence
for which he was sentenced at the same time by the court below. They
will transfer to the Court of Appeal certain powers relating to interim
hospital orders that are currently exercised by the courts below, and
allow a single judge to exercise some of those powers. They will extend
the powers of the Court of Appeal to compel the production of documents
and the attendance of witnesses; allow a single judge to exercise the
power to give leave to appeal in certain interlocutory appeals; and
allow a single judge to issue directions that cannot be appealed to a
full Court of Appeal. They will ensure that, when the prosecution
appeals successfully to the House of Lords, the offender can be
compelled to serve out any remainder of his sentence unless the court
below has made an order to the contrary, and they will extend the time
during which a sentence imposed by the Crown court can be altered by
that court.</div>

							<a name="0711302001094">Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> This is another group of important amendments to
improve the protection of our children. The Sexual Offences Act 2003,
introduced in May 2004, provided a new and comprehensive legislative
framework for sexual offences. It has undoubtedly provided law
enforcement agencies with more effective tools for tackling sex
offenders, but improvements can be
made.</div>
					<a name="0711302000451"><div class="hs_Para">The Sexual
Offences Act allows for the prosecution of UK citizens and residents
for sex offences against children that are committed abroad. We are
seeking to strengthen those provisions for UK nationals by removing the
condition that the act must be criminalised in the country where it was
committed. As hon. Members will know, the condition is known as dual
criminality. At present, the extra-territorial provisions extend only
to offences against children under the age of 16, even when the UK
offence applies to victims under 18. New clause 35 extends the relevant
age for the provisions to under 18.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="0711302000452"><div class="hs_Para">In drafting the
new clause, it was felt appropriate to redraft much of the section to
make the drafting consistent with other provisions relating to
extra-territorial prosecutions. Removing dual criminality and extending
the relevant age will help to implement some of the Council of Europe
convention on the protection of children against sexual exploitation
and abuse. I am pleased that this change to the law will allow us to
sign and ratify that convention. However, it is a significant change in
its own right; it will mean that British nationals who travel abroad to
exploit children will not be able to evade justice by targeting certain
countries whose laws offer less protection to children. It will act as
a significant deterrent for British offenders who contemplate
travelling abroad for the purposes of sexually exploiting
children.</div>

							<a name="0711302001095">Mr.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001096">Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> That is a very good question. If I do not have the
list of those countries in the next few minutes, I will write to the
Committee with the information. I do not want to speculate but the hon.
Gentleman, like me, could probably think of a few countries that would
fall into that category. However, I would rather be certain of my facts
than say something
inaccurate.</div>
					<a name="0711302000455"><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal will act as a significant deterrent for British offenders who
contemplate travelling abroad for the purposes of sexually exploiting
children. They will know that they will not be able to take refuge from
British laws and British justice.</div>
					<a name="0711302000456"><div class="hs_Para">The Council of Europe convention
is the first international instrument that obliges states to remove the
requirement of dual criminality in relation to the extra-territorial
prosecution of certain sex offences 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column724" />Column number: 724</div>against children. However, removing that requirement is also included as
an optional measure in the protocol to the United Nations convention on
the rights of the child on the sale of children, child prostitution and
child pornography and the EU framework decision on combating the sexual
exploitation of children and child
pornography.</div>
					<a name="0711302000457"><div class="hs_Para">Removing
dual criminality has been identified by the G8 as an element of good
practice in combating travelling sex offenders, a practice that all
hon. Members deplore. The change in the law is supported by the
Association of Chief Police Officers, the Child Exploitation and Online
Protection Centre and several children&#146;s organisations. We are
grateful for their support for the change and recognise the
international consensus.</div>
					<a name="0711302000458"><div class="hs_Para">We are proud to join other
countries in taking steps to remove dual criminality for UK nationals.
We want to take responsibility, when necessary, for those of our
citizens who travel abroad to exploit children and the amendment will
be a significant UK contribution to the fight against travelling sex
offenders.</div>
					<a name="0711302000459"><div class="hs_Para">In respect
of new schedule 3, in reviewing the implementation of the 2003 Act we
have also identified how the offence of meeting a child following
sexual grooming created by section 15 could be strengthened in order to
allow police to apprehend offenders at an earlier stage in the process
of grooming. The primary aim of the offence is the protection of
children and that is what underpins new schedule 3.</div>
					<a name="0711302000460"><div class="hs_Para">Section 15 makes it an offence
for a person aged 18 or over to meet intentionally or to travel with
the intention of meeting a child under the age of 16 in any part of the
world if he has met or communicated with that child on at least two
prior occasions and intends to commit a relevant offence against that
child either at the time of the meeting or on a subsequent occasion.
Relevant offences are offences under part 1 of the Sexual Offences Act
2003.</div>
					<a name="0711302000461"><div class="hs_Para">The amendment to
section 15(1)(a) of the 2003 Act will make it an offence to arrange to
meet a child, having met or communicated on at least two earlier
occasions, if at the time of that meeting he intends to commit a
relevant offence. In addition, an offence will have been committed if
an adult invites a child to his house and the child takes steps to
travel there following two earlier communications. That partly
replicates the equivalent Scottish offence. That will ensure that the
police are able to intervene in certain cases where a child has
travelled to meet an offender who is waiting for them at home without
the meeting actually taking place.</div>
					<a name="0711302000462"><div class="hs_Para">If an offender travels to meet a
child, having communicated with that child on two previous occasions,
he has committed an offence and can be apprehended. However, if he
invites the child to his home, he does not commit an offence until he
has actually met the child. In our view, it is not desirable to allow
events to go that far, particularly when we bear it in mind that the
offender might be situated abroad. New schedule 3 would allow police to
intervene at an earlier stage and apprehend an offender once a meeting
had been arranged if that arrangement followed two earlier
communications and the offender intends to commit a sexual offence with
the child at that meeting. That proposal is supported by
ACPO.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column725" />Column number: 725</div>
					<a name="0711302000463"><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 2 of new schedule 3
will create an offence when an adoptive parent, but not other members
of the adopted family, has sex with their adopted child when they are
over the age of 18. That offence will apply to both the adoptive parent
and the adoptive child once they are over 18. We think that that will
further strengthen our laws and help to combat the so-called trade of
sex tourism, which we all deplore. It is a despicable act. By
strengthening the law in this way, we look to ensure that many more of
those who seek to abuse children will be captured and put where they
need to be&#151;in
prison.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001099">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 199 to 201 essentially tidy up
the wording of the Bill to reflect the substantive amendment of new
clause 26, which deals with extradition. For example, amendment No. 200
deals with a long title.</div>
					<a name="0711302000474"><div class="hs_Para">The Committee will perhaps
remember that a great deal of heat was generated in a previous sitting,
as well as a certain amount of light, when amendments were made to the
Extradition Act 2003 that related to the extradition of people who had
allegedly committed offences in the United States but who had little
connection with the US. Those amendments render them liable for
extradition to the US from the UK.</div>
					<a name="0711302000475"><div class="hs_Para">It is coincidental, but I
understand from today&#146;s news that the NatWest three have pleaded
guilty to a single count that relates to a number of counts alleged
against them for various forms of dishonest financial
activity.</div>
				
					<a name="0711302000476"><div class="hs_Para">I
do not intend to say anything at all about that case, although it does
illustrate the principles that we should think about today. I will not
say anything about it because we do not know why the defendants pleaded
guilty on that count, although we could guess. At this stage, I do not
want either to discuss the relative merits or demerits of the way in
which fraud and white-collar crime are dealt with by the British
jurisdiction and either the United States or the Texan jurisdiction.
Suffice to say that in the United States, following the collapse of
Enron and the resulting fallout, the courts are much more severe in
their prison sentencing than I suspect that British courts would be in
similar circumstances.</div>
					<a name="0711302000477"><div class="hs_Para">What I want is to do is ask the
Committee to revisit the question of forum. I do not wish to discuss
the different tests that apply in Britain and the United 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column727" />Column number: 727</div>States. From my memory of speaking in the debates on extradition
relating to the 2006 Act, my understanding is that, in order to
establish the basis of application for extradition, in the United
States it is simply necessary to assert that a crime has been
committed, whereas in the United Kingdom one needs to overcome the
higher hurdle of establishing that there is an arguable case, which is
fit to go to the jury. However, that is not part of this discussion
which relates to the issue of forum. I hope that anybody who has taken
the trouble to look at new clause 26 will see that the arguments make
themselves off the face of the page; however, I will briefly recite my
arguments in respect of the new clause.</div>
					<a name="0711302000478"><div class="hs_Para">On page 723 of the amendment
paper, it can be seen that we wish to amend the law so that a British
judge considering an extradition application to remove a person in this
country who is suspected of a crime in another jurisdiction should take
into account that factors that we have set out. I do not need to
discuss whether it is a category 1 or 2 country&#151;the principles
are the same. We propose that a person&#146;s extradition to either
category of territory should be barred by reason of forum if, and only
if, it appears
that,</div>
					<a name="0711302000960"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) a
significant part of the conduct alleged to constitute the extradition
offence is conducted in the United Kingdom,
and</div>
					<a name="0711302000961"><div class="hs_brev">(b) in view of that
and all the other circumstances, it would not be in the interests of
justice for the person to be tried for the offence in the requesting
territory.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000479"><div class="hs_Para">In
support of subsection (1)(b) of proposed new section 83A to the
Extradition Act 2003, subsection (2) says that,</div>
					<a name="0711302000962"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the judge must take into account
whether the relevant prosecution authorities in the United Kingdom have
decided not to take proceedings against the person in respect of the
conduct in question.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000480"><div class="hs_Para">I said that I would not get
involved with the NatWest three, but let me raise one point. There will
be cases, particularly in the financial services industry where
communications take place electronically. It may be
that a number of financial service houses in this
country use American e-mail servers. Although the alleged fraud may
take place in this country&#151;it may be planned and executed
here&#151;and the victim may be an individual or a corporation wholly
or largely resident in this country, the mere fact that the electronic
signals go via an American internet server means that the United
States, either federally or by means of state jurisdictions, can claim
jurisdiction over the alleged criminality.</div>
					<a name="0711302000987"><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div>
					<a name="0711302000481"><div class="hs_Para">That
brings with it tremendous worries. I suggest that the United Kingdom
should not release defendants in those circumstances where there is
only a flimsy or tangential relationship between the claimant country
and the UK. That must be reinforced, surely, if the prosecuting
authorities in this country, or in Scotland and Northern Ireland, have
not taken any steps to launch prosecution proceedings themselves, or
indeed have considered them and have made a positive decision not to
prosecute, particularly where the victim of the alleged fraud has made
a positive decision not to complain or not to complain to the level of
inviting the police or the Serious Fraud Office or any of the other
prosecuting authorities&#151;HMRC, perhaps&#151;to do anything
about it.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column728" />Column number: 728</div>
					<a name="0711302000482"><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that
it is a view widely held on the Opposition Benches, if not completely
on the Government Benches, that our signing of the extradition
agreement with the United States, which led to the amendments to the
Extradition Act 2003, did not produce an even bargain. I suggest that a
number of British citizens or residents of the United Kingdom have
been, or could be, gravely disadvantaged by the current extradition
arrangements. It therefore seems that we should do what the Irish and a
number of other European jurisdictions have done, and make provision to
enter into the judge&#146;s considerations the issue of forums, as
described in the new clause.</div>
					<a name="0711302000483"><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have painted the
case sufficiently clearly for the Government to be able to explain why
they should not accept it. If I may say so, on the last occasion that I
discussed this in the days of the old Home Office, the then
Under-Secretary, who is no longer in that post, did not respond
terribly effectively on behalf of the Government. I look forward to
hearing whichever of the Ministers it is who has the grave and weighty
duty to reply to this debate doing so rather more
effectively.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001100">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I have debated matters relating to our
extraordinarily one-sided extradition agreement with the United States
more often than I care to think of over the last few years. As it
happens, I was speaking from this Bench&#151;literally this Bench, I
think&#151;when the matter was first debated by a Statutory
Instrument Committee, when my hon. Friend the Member for Southport (Dr.
Pugh) and I were the only ones to oppose the initial statutory
instrument that brought into effect the treaty, after it had been
signed. We went on to encourage our right hon. and hon. Friends to
oppose it as well, when it was put before the House, so we have a
unique position of opposition in that respect.
</div>
					<a name="0711302000485"><div class="hs_Para">I have some sympathy
for those who, at the first instance, took the words of the Government
at face value because they were told by the then Minster that it was a
necessary defence against terrorism; that it would only be used for
terrorist offences; that it certainly would not apply to white-collar
offences, and that in any case it was a balanced agreement.
Transparently, it was not. Since then, what has been elucidated on the
several occasions that we have discussed the matter is that we are
unique as a nation in accepting such an unbalanced position. The other
states that have a similar treaty obligation in terms of the evidential
requirement for extradition have safeguards: for example, France has
constitutional safeguards that it will never extradite a French
citizen&#151;a fairly convincing safeguard&#151;and as the hon. and
learned Member for Harborough said, the Republic of Ireland has a forum
provision, as proposed in new clause 26, to which my hon. Friends and I
have added our names.</div>
					<a name="0711302000486"><div class="hs_Para">The issue is relevant this week
because of the guilty plea of the NatWest three. It is not for us in
the Committee to debate the whys and wherefores of that case, other
than to say that the current position is a result of plea bargaining.
One may be reasonably well assured that, if the guilty plea had not
been entered on that one count and they had been found guilty of the
several other counts on which they were arraigned before the court in
Texas, they would have been given substantial jail sentences.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column729" />Column number: 729</div>
					<a name="0711302000487"><div class="hs_Para">The key issue is that not only do
we have a one-sided treaty with the United States,
whereby we are required to show a different standard of proof for the
extradition of United States citizens to the UK from that which is
required for the extradition of UK citizens to the United States, but
the United States is unique in its federal and state jurisdictions in
assuming a high degree of extraterritorial&#151;indeed,
universal&#151;jurisdiction on many matters. That has enormous
consequences for our sovereignty of jurisdiction, because, in effect,
the United States judicial authorities can extradite British citizens
to an American court to stand trial for offences that have no
geographical connection with the United States. A person who is
extradited does not need ever to have visited the United States or to
have had direct business dealings with a person there to be subject to
an extradition request. It is very difficult for the authorities in
this country to refuse a request, because the terms of evidential proof
are little more than an identity assessment and the fact that a law
enforcement officer&#151;perhaps a sheriff&#151;has asked for
extradition. That puts British citizens in a very difficult
position.</div>
					<a name="0711302000488"><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Member for Harborough, in his new clause, has quite rightly
stated that it would apply not to a particular country but to any
country. However, it would apply particularly to the United States
because of that assumed universal jurisdiction, which is the norm for
so many of their offences and
jurisdictions.</div>
					<a name="0711302000489"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001101">Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I hesitate to dip into these waters, but does the
hon. Gentleman think that the evidential test is an absolute principle
for extradition? I have started to examine different extradition
treaties and arrangements, and there is considerable variation. In the
1972 treaty, which preceded the current treaty, we had probable cause
and the US had prima facie, so although I take the point that he tries
to make, one can argue that there never has been absolute parity.
Surely the issue is about the process used to ensure that people
receive fair and due process.</div>
					<a name="0711302000490"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001102">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The Minister makes a fair point that has been made
many times. In return, I have many times said, no, there is not
absolute parity in many of our arrangements. However, it does not
prevent me from stating that the negative parity we now have with the
United States is a singular disparity&#151;one that I do not accept.
It is quite wrong. If the claim of extraterritorial jurisdiction did
not exist, it would be bad enough. If that claim did not exist, we
would be dealing with offences committed in the territory of the United
States or one of its dependencies, or against a US person&#151;an
individual or company. But we are not. It is the combination of the two
makes us uniquely vulnerable now, in comparison with any other country
in the world. Not only are we uniquely vulnerable to extradition to the
United States, but the fact that it is not reciprocated simply adds
insult to injury. That is why so many of us are convinced that the
arrangement needs to be
changed.</div>
					<a name="0711302000491"><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions proposed by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough,
which I do not need to spell out again as he has already done so,
provide a safeguard 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column730" />Column number: 730</div>against the capricious use of the extradition powers in circumstances
where a British court would not convict, or where the British legal
authorities would not indict. That seems a sensible precaution, which
simply avoids any abuse within the American jurisdiction of the
arrangement.</div>
					<a name="0711302000492"><div class="hs_Para">I think
that we should renegotiate the treaty and put safeguards into it, but
that is not a matter for this Committee. The new clause is a matter for
this Committee, because it provides an essential safeguard that is
within our powers. Accepting the new clause would bring us into at
least the same sort of relationship that other countries that have
agreed bilateral arrangements with the United States on non-reciprocal
evidential tests have achieved for their own jurisdictions. It is right
that we should do so for the protection of the British citizen and of
the British judicial system which, at the moment, is open to predation
by the
Americans.</div>

							<a name="0711302001103">Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I thank Opposition Members again for the measured
way in which they have spoken to their amendments. It appears to me, as
someone who is not legally trained, that there are different opinions
on this serious matter. That is why I made the point about absolute
principle. I appreciate the measured way in which the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome responded to me and accepted that there is a debate.
If you look at the extradition treaties that people have negotiated
between each other, across the world, there is not absolute parity in
the evidential test in all the
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="0711302000494"><div class="hs_Para">Even
within the legal profession, there are different opinions. When I
re-read the House of Lords debate, I also re-read some of the remarks
made during the debate in the House of Commons. It was interesting to
see what some of the Law Lords had said. In respect of amendments
tabled on the need for a judge to determine in which jurisdiction the
prosecution should take place, I found that, rather than taking the
same view as the Government&#151;that it is a matter for the
prosecution authorities to determine, based on where the best chances
of successful prosecution can be had&#151;Lord Dilhorne, a
distinguished judge,
stated:</div>
					<a name="0711302000495"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
judge must keep out of this area. He should not have or appear to have
any responsibility for the institution of
prosecution.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000496"><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that that is not a universal view. People could quote another
distinguished Law Lord from <i class="I">Hansard</i> expressing a completely
different
view.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="0711302000499"><div class="hs_Para">I come to the
matter as a non-lawyer. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, and the
hon. and learned Member for Harborough, are trying to ensure that the
process is fair, that it does not disadvantage anyone and that justice
is seen to be done. I decided to look at the extradition
process&#151;what somebody would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column731" />Column number: 731</div>have to go through before they were extradited, notwithstanding the
forum question. It seemed to me to be a fair process in which the
interests of justice are served. Prosecutors have to decide whether or
not to support an extradition, and the requesting authority has to make
a request to us. It is a considerable process and, if the Committee
does not mind, I shall run through
it.</div>
					<a name="0711302000500"><div class="hs_Para">The
CPS acts as the representative authority for the
requesting territory. All extradition cases are considered at Bow
Street magistrates court, which may make a provisional arrest. There is
an initial hearing in front of a district judge, who must inform the
person about the content of the extradition request, explain what is
going on and say whether or not they will grant bail&#151;all the
various things that one would expect due process to include. The
district judge can discharge the person if the certified request is not
received by the court within the required time. Then there is an
extradition hearing. Everything that the district judge must do in that
hearing is laid out: the judge decides whether the documentation is in
order and the individual is the person who is named; he also examines
the credibility of the offence and whether any of the bars to
extradition apply. The bars listed in the Extradition Act 2003 include
dual criminality, problems with evidence, requests made for improper
reason, double jeopardy, injustice due to ill health or passage of
time, and human
rights.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001106">Mr.

						</b> The one thing that the district judge cannot take
into account is the issue of forum, as we have outlined in our new
clause.</div>
					<a name="0711302000502"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001107">Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> What I am saying to the hon. and learned Gentleman
is that, in our view, the current process is fair and reasonable. It is
for the prosecuting authorities to determine in which jurisdiction
there is the best chance of a successful prosecution. Subject to that,
however, the actual process by which someone is removed from this
country and extradited to, for example, the United States is quite a
formal process in which due process of law can take place. There is a
hearing and then a decision, after which anyone subject to extradition
can appeal. Appeals against the decisions of the district judge or the
Home Secretary go to the administrative court. Notice of appeals must
be given within 14
days.</div>
					<a name="0711302000503"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001108">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> That is the point. The appeal is against the
procedure&#151;it is based on the procedural elements being
incorrect. For example, a person has been incorrectly named, the
indictment has been incorrectly filled, or something along those lines.
It is no longer the evidence that is tested to see whether there is
prima facie
case.</div>
					<a name="0711302000504"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001109">Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The court would have to determine some of the
points raised by the Gentleman; otherwise, it would contravene
convention rights within Human Rights Act 1998. That is another thing
that the court here explicitly has to do. Of course, on a point of law,
the appeal can ultimately go to the House of
Lords.</div>
					<a name="0711302000505"><div class="hs_Para">In respect of
the issue of forum, the Government&#146;s view is that we do not wish
to blur the distinctions between the judges and the independent
prosecuting authorities. It is for the prosecution to determine the
appropriate jurisdiction. Alongside that, there is a due 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column732" />Column number: 732</div>process of extradition that protects the rights of the individual in the
way that I have briefly outlined. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw
his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0711302000506"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001110">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> The Minister did not utter a single untruth in
his argument. He did not say anything that was false, and he correctly
stated what happens. But what does not happen is that the judge takes
into account the question whether the significant part of the conduct
that constitutes the extradition offence is committed in the United
Kingdom. He does not take into account whether the prosecution, let
alone the victim, had done anything about it. Everything that the hon.
Gentleman said is perfectly true. Yes, if people are subject to an
extradition request from another territory they go through that
process. The judge considers the assertions that are made against the
defendants and if they come within the Extradition Act 2003, off they
go and there is not much they can do about it, as the NatWest three
would be the first to tell him if they were here to do
so.</div>
					<a name="0711302000507"><div class="hs_Para">What we are
complaining about is that, unlike the Republic of Ireland and some
other perfectly respectable jurisdictions in the industrialised world,
we do not pay any attention to the flimsy connection between the other
territory and this one in relation to the facts of the crime. When
debating whether the British courts should try a civil or a criminal
case here when some other more convenient forum is available, we do the
reverse of current process: we look at the facts of the civil dispute
or the crime and ask if it has anything to do with us or very little to
do with us. If it has nothing or very little to do with us, our courts
do not permit the matter to be litigated or prosecuted in our courts,
civil or criminal. My point is that it is not fair to impose a burden
upon citizens in respect of an offence if there is very little
connection with the requesting territory.</div>
					<a name="0711302000508"><div class="hs_Para">The Minister dealt with all
sorts of points, but not with my arguments, which were supported by the
hon. Gentleman. Unless he can persuade me that he will change his
mind&#151;I am happy to take an intervention&#151;I regret that I
will press the new clause to a Division.</div>

							<a name="0711302001134">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> As before, amendment No. 18 is not the central
proposal in the group. New clauses 2 and 3 contain the guts of our
debate. I can describe the issue via new clause 2 because new clause 3
is in exactly the same terms, only extending the law to Northern
Ireland as well as England and Wales, which are covered by new clause
2.</div>
					<a name="0711302000549"><div class="hs_Para">As you will know,
Sir Nicholas, self-defence by householders has been an issue of some
controversy for the past half dozen years or so. At least three
Conservative Back Benchers have introduced private Member&#146;s
Bills in this regard. I make no secret of the fact that new clauses 2
and 3 are stolen from the private Member&#146;s Bill introduced by my
hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh). There would be
no point in doing otherwise, because everybody knows about it. It is
part of the history of this
legislation.</div>
					<a name="0711302000550"><div class="hs_Para">I have no
doubt that the Minister will be well prepared to deal with the
arguments that I shall make. I hope that I am not breaching any
confidence, but I want also to place it on the record that the
Secretary of State for Justice and his Ministers very kindly hosted a
meeting attended by my hon. Friends the Members for Enfield, Southgate
and for Arundel and South Downs 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column736" />Column number: 736</div>(Nick Herbert) and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome and perhaps
others&#151;I do not remember. At any event, we had a meeting at the
Department to discuss this question. I know that, following their
consideration, the Government intend to table some form of provision on
Report or later, but that should not inhibit us from having a brief
discussion about the issue now, because we do not often have the chance
to do
so.</div>
				
					<a name="0711302000989"><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div>
					<a name="0711302000551"><div class="hs_Para">The current law
of self-defence is governed by section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967,
which says:</div>
					<a name="0711302000963"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the
prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest
of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at
large.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000552"><div class="hs_Para">In 2005 the Home
Office, the Crown Prosecution Service and the Association of Chief
Police Officers came to the conclusion that the public perhaps did not
fully understand the law of self-defence. ACPO and the CPS then
produced a leaflet called &#147;Householders and the use of force
against intruders&#148;, which endeavoured to explain the law of
self-defence, particularly in relation to householders. It asked and
attempted to answer the following
questions:</div>
					<a name="0711302000964"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;What
is the purpose of this statement? Does the law protect me? What is
reasonable force? Do I have to wait to be attacked? What if the
intruder dies? What if I chase them as they run off? Will you believe
the intruder rather than me? How would the police and CPS handle the
investigation and treat
me?&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000553"><div class="hs_Para">The first
time that I ever saw that leaflet was in the Department when I went to
the meeting with the Secretary of State and his Ministers and
officials. Perhaps I just do not go to the right places to find these
leaflets. It seemed to be a sensible leaflet in that it tried to
provide some form of reassurance to those who were fearful that they
would get into trouble if they hurt someone who invaded their property
with a view to committing a
crime.</div>
					<a name="0711302000554"><div class="hs_Para">Since then the
Secretary of State has said that he wanted to review the issue and that
review is ongoing. It will result perhaps in some provision coming
forward on Report or in the other place. I hope that I am not breaching
a confidence but I think that the Government are considering three
options. The first is to do nothing, the second is to clarify the
existing law, and the third is to legislate to do something more. I
want to try to persuade the Government that the do nothing option is
not an option. The clarification option is a possibility so long as the
clarification goes beyond what the ACPO-CPS leaflet does and is done in
a more public fashion. The third option may be the only way forward in
that it creates a degree of publicity about what the Government are
doing beyond the simple issuing of guidance and leaflets. Perhaps I am
looking for a combination of options two and
three.</div>
					<a name="0711302000555"><div class="hs_Para">We are at odds
with the Government, as are Back Benchers, over the question of what is
the appropriate level of force that a householder can use. There is
also a less serious dispute about whether any advance in the law should
only cover householders or should also cover people who are defending
themselves, others or their property outside a building. I do not think
that that dispute between the Government and the Opposition will last;
there is clearly a way through that. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column737" />Column number: 737</div>When a person is defending himself inside his building, other factors
will impinge on his mind. Equally, why should not a person defending
himself from an attack on the street have the same protection, or at
least as adequate protection, as I seek for a
householder?</div>
					<a name="0711302000556"><div class="hs_Para">New clause
2(2)(1A) refers to a person
who</div>
					<a name="0711302000965"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;uses force in the
prevention of crime or in the defence of persons or property on another
who is in any building or part of a building having entered as a
trespasser or is attempting so to enter&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0711302000557"><div class="hs_Para">I am not going to go to the cross
demanding that the law should be as that proposes and nothing else. If
we can devise a form of words or a new level of clarity that covers
people in public places as well as in buildings, I would applaud
that.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001135">Ms
Keeble:
						</b> Will the hon. Gentleman say a bit more about
public places? One of the differences is that a person who defend
themselves in a public place might put another person at risk, perhaps
by hurling a brick at someone. Does he think that the same protection
should apply in all circumstances? Should not the person in the public
place also have regard for the safety of others in that
place?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001136">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> Essentially, we are looking at a subjective
appreciation of what is going on. Whether a person defends themselves
when attacked in their own house late at night when it is dark or out
in the street, the court would look at what was going through their
mind at the time. I hope that this will not be thought too
self-regarding, but I would like to read out a
summing-up.</div>

Garnier:
						</b> It is mine. What it says is not original to me,
but is borrowed from the Judicial Studies Board&#146;s guidelines. It
might help the hon. Member for Northampton, North. It sets out what a
jury should consider when dealing with a case of self-defence. This
very learned judge said to the
jury:</div>
					<a name="0711302000966"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The law
in relation to self defence is that a person who is attacked or
believes that he is about to be attacked may use such force as is
reasonably necessary to defend himself. If that is the case he is
acting in lawful self defence and is entitled to be found not guilty.
It is for the prosecution to make you sure that the defendant was not
acting in lawful self defence, not for him to prove that he was. A
person only acts in lawful self defence if in all the circumstances he
believes that it is necessary for him to defend himself and if the
amount of force which he uses in doing so is reasonable. So there are
two main questions you have to consider: Did the defendant honestly
believe or may he honestly have believed that it was necessary to
defend himself? You may think it self evident that a person who is the
aggressor does not act in self defence and if you are sure that he did
not honestly believe it was necessary to defend himself then self
defence does not arise in this case and, so long as you find that he
assaulted&#148;</div>

victim</div>
					<a name="0711302000967"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and caused the
injuries he sustained, he will be guilty of unlawful wounding. But if
you decide that he was or may have been acting in that belief you must
consider the second question: Taking the circumstances and the danger
as the defendant honestly believed them to be, was the amount of force
he used reasonable?</div>
					<a name="0711302000968"><div class="hs_brev">Force used in self defence is
unreasonable and unlawful if it is out of all proportion to the nature
of the attack, or is in excess of what is really required of the
defendant to defend himself. When deciding whether or not the force
used by&#148;</div>

you may want to think about the following: what was the nature of the
attack that you find was being made on him by&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000564"><div class="hs_Para">the victim.</div>
					<a name="0711302000970"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is not in dispute
that&#148;</div>

					<a name="0711302000972"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;having to repel a larger attack
but remember that a person who is defending himself cannot be expected
in the heat of the moment to weigh precisely the exact amount of
defensive action which is necessary. If you conclude that the defendant
did no more that he honestly and instinctively thought was necessary to
defend himself you may think that would be strong evidence that the
amount of force used by him was reasonable. If you are sure that the
force used by the defendant was unreasonable, he cannot have been
acting in lawful self defence and he is guilty of unlawful wounding,
but if the force used was or may have been reasonable then he is not
guilty.&#148;</div>

I have set out the principles that a jury must examine when considering
whether someone has a defence of self-defence in a given set of
circumstances. The assault case in which I was involved happened in a
public place, but matters would have applied equally had it happened in
a private place. We need not get into the detail about what sort of
action the householder or the person attacked in the street takes.
Clearly, if someone comes at us with a feather duster and we shoot him
dead, that would be a disproportionate
response.</div>

could have an interesting discussion about the matter for some time,
but I do not want to delay the proceedings any more than the hon.
Member for Northampton, North does. Perhaps she will let me finish my
point and she can then respond if she so wishes. However, she has
succeeded in making me lose the thread of my argument, which is a
considerable
achievement.</div>
					<a name="0711302000575"><div class="hs_Para">Although
the summing-up that I gave as an example was quite clear, it must be
said in complicated language. It is full of double negatives, and
language such as &#147;If this or that, if not this or that&#148;.
The jury 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column739" />Column number: 739</div>must think carefully about the issues involved. I accept that, in a
sense, that does not matter as it is what juries must do, but the use
of &#147;reasonable&#148; can sometimes lead members of the jury
astray and to wonder, &#147;Is this what I would have done? Is this
what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances?&#148;
If we put the adverb &#147;grossly&#148; in front of the adjective
&#147;disproportionate&#148;, we would have a set of circumstances
that the jury would understand more clearly. That is the point of the
new clause. I want to afford clear protection to those who are
attacked, either in their house or in a building, as we have proposed
under the new clause. However, I look forward to that provision being
extended to incidents that happen in public places
too.</div>
					<a name="0711302000576"><div class="hs_Para">Repetition
sometimes, but not often, makes a bad point better. It sometimes makes
a good point better. I hope that I have said enough for the Minister to
have understood my argument and, albeit that this is not a day for
voting on the issue, for her to say when she returns to the Bill on
Report, &#147;Yes, we understand what you are about. We think that
the householders of this country need to have greater security by
knowing that they can do quite a lot to defend themselves and, even
though they might cause quite serious harm to the victim who invades
their space, bodies or privacy, they can be reassured that the
Government and Parliament, as a whole, are on their
side.&#148;</div>

							<a name="0711302001145">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I find myself in a degree of difficulty with this
subject, which I have now debated several times in the past few years.
I have the greatest of sympathy with those who want to ensure that
householders, or those who intervene to defend themselves or others in
the street in the courageous way that our derring-do Lord Chancellor so
frequently exhibits, are protected under law and do not find themselves
on the wrong side of the law when doing their civic duty and their
personal duty to protect themselves, their loved ones and their
possessions. However, I have also always taken the view that there is
no deficiency in the law&#151;that the law, if properly interpreted,
provides a clear view that there is no problem with protecting oneself
in a reasonable, proportionate way. I therefore find myself arguing for
the principle, but having difficulty seeing why the law needs to be
changed.</div>
					<a name="0711302000578"><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
this all arose from the wretched Tony Martin case&#151;a very
difficult case. I have yet to hear any commentator who actually
believes that under any change that we are likely to make in the law,
Tony Martin would have been anything other than guilty of a serious
offence for the way in which he conducted himself on that day. In a
way, we should rule out from our consideration the circumstances of
Tony Martin and think about a more reasonable householder trying to
protect their property or their family.</div>
					<a name="0711302000579"><div class="hs_Para">I do not see a need for the
change in the law, but nor do I have a problem if the law is changed,
because it would simply be a different way of expressing the same view
in law. This is where I think the deficiency is: whether we have the
law as it is, or the law as it might be, or whether we have a
leaflet&#151;I agree with the hon. and learned Member for Harborough
that it is an excellent leaflet; I wonder how many people have read 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column740" />Column number: 740</div>it, but it sets out matters clearly&#151;none of
that will make the slightest difference if PC Plod does not understand,
when arriving at an incident, what he is supposed to do. He might take
the erroneous view, which happens far too often, that when a burglar
says, &#147;&#146;E &#146;it me over the &#146;ead,
Officer&#148;, it is his job to arrest the householder and not the
burglar. It is still his job to arrest the burglar unless there is very
clear and disproportionate action on the part of the householder. Far
too often, we hear reports, which are more than anecdotal, of people
who have taken steps to protect themselves or their property and find
themselves subject to intensive questioning, rather than congratulated
on having foiled an attempted crime. That is wrong, but the fault lies
with the investigating officers and occasionally, the prosecuting
authorities, rather than in the letter of the law, because it is rare
for the matter to go to a court and a case to be found against the
individual.</div>
					<a name="0711302000580"><div class="hs_Para">I am
perfectly happy for the Lord Chancellor to decide that, contrary to the
position that the Government have taken for the past six years, they
now want to change the law. I understand a sense of pique on the part
of Conservative colleagues who, having repeatedly proposed a change in
the law, only to be told that it was unnecessary, are now told by the
Lord Chancellor that perhaps it is necessary after all. At the end of
the day, whether we change the law or not&#151;I take a ruthlessly
agnostic view at the moment&#151;the most important thing is to get
it into the heads of our police officers across the country, not just
chief constables but policemen on the beat, what the appropriate
reaction is when they arrive at an incident and they find that there
has been an attempt to protect the property of the
individual.</div>

							<a name="0711302001146">Maria
Eagle:
						</b> We have had a short, sharp and high-quality debate;
I will seek to emulate that brevity and quality while making the points
that need to be made. I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for
Harborough for tabling the amendments, and for indicating, when he
spoke to new clauses 2 and 3, that he is not going to die in a ditch on
restricting the provision to buildings and households in the way that
it is currently set out. That enables me to tear up at least half of my
speech, which I am happy to do, because there are problems with that
approach.</div>
					<a name="0711302000582"><div class="hs_Para">My right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State indicated on Second Reading that he
intends to make changes, because he believes that it is necessary to do
so. As part of the Department&#146;s consideration we have, as the
hon. and learned Gentleman indicated, sought to communicate our views
and to invite interested hon. Members from all parties to share their
thinking with us. That will continue between now and when the
Government table their new clauses on the issue, which will be on
Report, I hope. Further meetings are planned between myself, officials
and hon. Members who have expressed an interest in the
matter.</div>
					<a name="0711302000583"><div class="hs_Para">Given
what the hon. and learned Gentleman said about keeping the issue of
householders at the forefront of his mind, I suspect that the matter
will come down to the definitions of grossly disproportionate,
disproportionate and reasonable. It is worth saying something about
that. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is quite right to
say&#151;I think that any lawyer, including the hon. and learned
Member for Harborough, would accept 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column741" />Column number: 741</div>this&#151;that &#147;reasonable&#148; is an incredibly useful
concept. It is well known in law that it is extremely flexible, and it
is well understood by lawyers and by courts, although perhaps not quite
so well by members of the public. It contains the flexibility that
allows it to be applied in any number of circumstances, and that is its
great strength.</div>
					<a name="0711302000584"><div class="hs_Para">It is
undoubtedly the case, as the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk
(Mr. Bellingham) said in 2003 when he first introduced his
Bill, that if there is even the slightest confusion as to the law, it
is unreasonable to expect a householder, during a few fearful seconds
at the top of the stairs in the dark, when he is being menaced and
perhaps threatened with a weapon in his own home, to guess what
&#147;reasonable&#148; is. That is of course the mystery that we
seek to put right, and there is widespread agreement on that. Even the
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, who is determinedly agnostic about
whether the law needs to be changed in any way has acknowledged that
that is the case.</div>
					<a name="0711302000585"><div class="hs_Para">The
problem that we are left with and which we will be working on, is that
of whether the test of &#147;grossly disproportionate&#148; is the
correct one. There are legal and human rights issues about which I can
say a word or two, based on some real concerns. One of the reasons for
the desirability of action on the test for self-defence is that, as the
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk put it, no one expects a person in
such a situation to be able to respond with total legal
knowledge.</div>
					<a name="0711302000586"><div class="hs_Para">Under the
new clause, the person using the force would be deprived of the defence
only if the degree of force used was grossly disproportionate, and if
that was, or ought to have been, apparent to him. Therefore,
he would be entitled to use force that was
disproportionate, but not grossly so. He would still have to make a
distinction between what was disproportionate and what was grossly
disproportionate. It lowers the threshold with regard to the point at
which he must make a judgment, but it does not remove that judgment
altogether.</div>
					<a name="0711302000587"><div class="hs_Para">The
argument is supported on the legal and human rights side, by the
incompatibility of the term &#147;grossly disproportionate&#148;
with the European convention on human rights. The Joint Committee on
Human Rights has previously considered two similar provisions
incompatible&#151;<i class="I">[</i>

Eagle:
						</b> When the Committee suspended, I was discussing
the compatibility, or I would say incompatibility,
with the European convention on human rights of the proposal from hon.
and learned Member for Harborough to adopt &#147;grossly
disproportionate&#148; as the test. I was just making the point that
the Joint Committee on  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column742" />Column number: 742</div>Human Rights has previously considered two very similar provisions to be
incompatible with the convention rights. I was speculating on the
likelihood that the Joint Committee would do the same in respect of the
two new clauses in this group.</div>
					<a name="0711302000592"><div class="hs_Para">The Joint
Committee on Human Rights previously objected to a similar provision on
grounds relating to the state&#146;s duty to protect the right to
life, which encompasses both obligations relating to the circumstances
in which the taking of life by the state can be permitted and the need
to have adequate law in place to protect against the taking of life by
private citizens. The Joint Committee&#146;s reading of a provision
allowing force just short of grossly disproportionate to be used would
undoubtedly be negative. Were the new clauses to be added to the Bill,
it would not be possible for my ministerial colleague, Lord Hunt of
Kings Heath, to sign a section 19 certificate on the introduction of
the Bill in the other place. As I assured the hon. and learned
Gentleman earlier, Ministers consider that declaration seriously before
they put their name to it. So that is the concern that we have about
the wording that he
proposes.</div>
					<a name="0711302000593"><div class="hs_Para">As the
Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor said on Second
Reading, we aim to introduce proposals on self-defence, hopefully on
Report. The Government&#146;s approach to resolving the issue of
public confusion is to make a change that is designed to clarify and
reinforce the position on self-defence by building on case law. It will
articulate the state&#146;s responsibility to stand by those who were
acting in good faith when using force in self-defence. That protection
will be extended to all such individuals, whether acting in a
professional capacity or not, on public or private land, defending
themselves or others, or acting to prevent crime. We believe that it is
essential that there be one test and one set of considerations used to
assess the appropriateness of all such
acts.</div>
					<a name="0711302000594"><div class="hs_Para">I am perfectly
happy to continue these discussions, but as the hon. and learned Member
for Harborough said, there have been discussions between all parties in
respect of this issue. I am happy to continue discussing it until we
have to table our amendments, to see if we can come to an agreement. On
that basis and in the spirit of trying to come to an agreement
together, I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will feel able to
withdraw his
amendment.</div>

							<a name="0711302001149">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I am willing to do so because I know that this is
an ongoing process, but I think it important that we do not lose sight
of this issue. I do not know when the Report stage will be, but between

some proposals in draft that they would be happy to share with the
Opposition
parties.</div>

							<a name="0711302001155">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="0711302000626"><div class="hs_Para">The
Serious Fraud Office has compulsory powers under section 2 of the
Criminal Justice Act 1987 to compel the disclosure of evidence that may
be relevant to a current investigation into serious or complex fraud.
The new clause would introduce a new section 2A into the 1987 Act,
which would allow the director of the Serious Fraud Office to approve
the use of section 2 powers at the vetting stage in cases where it
appears that there may have been a corruption offence involving a
foreign official. In practice, the provision will be useful in allowing
the Serious Fraud Office to compel British companies involved to
provide evidence about possible corruption abroad, as long as the
material is in the United Kingdom.</div>
					<a name="0711302000627"><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Committee recognises that the Government are committed to tackling
the corruption of foreign officials involving British companies.
Corruption abroad is particularly hard to investigate. In domestic
cases, the Serious Fraud Office often receives information on serious
corruption or bribery from the police or from a domestic regulator.
Documentary evidence and witnesses are often available in the United
Kingdom.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column748" />Column number: 748</div>The information therefore allows the Serious Fraud Office to go through
a vetting process to decide whether the case justifies setting up what
will often be a multi-million pound investigation. Once an
investigation is set up, the Serious Fraud Office has powers to demand
relevant material such as documentary evidence and to interview
witnesses under section 2 of the 1987 Act.</div>
					<a name="0711302000628"><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately, in cases of
foreign corruption, it is much more difficult to gather information.
Witnesses may be thousands of miles away and reluctant to come forward.
Corrupt companies rarely co-operate, and the foreign jurisdiction is
often unable or unwilling to provide information. The effect is that
cases cannot go beyond the vetting stage because the Serious Fraud
Office does not have enough information to decide whether a serious or
complex fraud justifies the formal investigation to which it would have
to be committed. I do not think&#151;and I am sure that the Committee
would share my view&#151;that that is
acceptable.</div>
					<a name="0711302000993"><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div>
					<a name="0711302000629"><div class="hs_Para">We must deal
with foreign corruption as well as corruption at
home. Organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development have expressed concern about the UK&#146;s record on
investigating and prosecuting cases involving foreign officials. The
new clause would extend the SFO&#146;s compulsory powers to demand
relevant material at the vetting stage. Those powers will allow the SFO
to demand from companies financial information relating to suspect
financial transactions, as long as that information is in the UK, and
to free professional witnesses from confidentiality obligations. The
proposals will help the Serious Fraud Office to tackle corruption
abroad, and I commend them to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="0711302000630"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001156">Mr.
Heath:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>An awful lot could be said about the new
clause, but the Committee will be pleased to hear that I do not intend
to say much. It should not be possible for investigations to be stopped
by anyone so minor as a company official or even an officer of the
state. That there is every capacity for princes of a realm or kings to
intervene to stop appropriate bribery and corruption investigations in
their tracks is only too evident to those who have seen the recent
history of this country. It is shameful that we are not better equipped
to deal with bribery and corruption in relation to British companies
operating abroad.</div>
					<a name="0711302000631"><div class="hs_Para">I
say to the Minister that this is a positive move and I support it.
However, he knows that his hon. Friend the Member for City of York
(Hugh Bayley) introduced a Corruption Bill two years ago. He may know
that I, too, proposed a Corruption Bill, which passed through all its
stages in the House of Lords but was not given a hearing of any kind in
this House in the last Session of Parliament. Both of those Bills would
have introduced the changes necessary for us to comply with our
international obligations and to correct the deficiencies, which he
correctly stated have been pointed out by the
OECD.</div>
					<a name="0711302000632"><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary of
State for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, in his
former capacity as Secretary of State for International Development and
anti-corruption tsar, as I believe he then was, stated categorically
that it was necessary for Britain to adopt such measures and to get our
law into 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column749" />Column number: 749</div>shape. However, such measures are still not being introduced. No Bill is
anticipated in this Session of Parliament. Is it not time that we did
something about our deplorable international record on dealing with
bribery and corruption involving British
companies?</div>
					<a name="0711302000633"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001157">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I think that this
Government have had more tsars than the Romanovs. I sat on the Joint
Committee that scrutinised the draft Corruption Bill, chaired by a
retired Law Lord whose name escapes me. That Bill, which was advanced
by the Law Commission and adopted by the Home Office and by the
Government as a whole, did not go anywhere. In the light of new clause
32, can the Minister tell us where it has
gone?</div>
					<a name="0711302000634"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001158">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> The hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome and the hon. and learned Member for Harborough are correct. In
March this year, my right hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts
(John Reid), then Home Secretary, announced the next steps arising from
the Government&#146;s consultation on the reform of law on bribery
and corruption. As the hon. and learned Gentleman said, the Law
Commission was asked to undertake a thorough review of the legislation
with a view to a fundamental reform. The commission is expected to
produce a consultation paper later in the year and a draft Bill for
autumn 2008. We intend to introduce proposals for legislation to reform
the law as soon as possible&#151;once the Law Commission has
reported.</div>
					<a name="0711302000635"><div class="hs_Para">I realise
that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome and the hon. and learned
Member for Harborough may view that as slightly longer grass than they
would wish, but I point out that the Bill promoted by my hon. Friend
the Member for City of York failed because of an absence of consensus
on what might constitute new specific offences. The subject is complex,
but we are confident that the Law Commission is taking on board the
views of a wide cross-section of interested parties to produce what I
hope will be a simpler and much more workable Bill.</div>
					<a name="0711302000636"><div class="hs_Para">In the interim, we propose to
introduce a specific measure upon which we have previously consulted,
namely extending the SFO&#146;s investigatory powers to the vetting
stage in any cases involving allegations of bribery or corruption of
overseas officials, officers or their agents. I hope that hon. Members
accept it as a positive step and understand that there will be a need
for wider discussion of the draft Bill following the
commission&#146;s report in the new year. I commend the new clause to
the Committee.</div>

							<a name="0711302001186">Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I hope that I can persuade the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw his amendment, because it is unnecessary. Football banning
orders have been incredibly successful in reducing football-related
violence here and abroad. The police already possess extensive and
specific powers during a football control period, which commences five
days before an overseas match or tournament. Banned individuals are
required by the enforcing authority to report to a designated police
station five days before an overseas match or tournament to surrender
their passport and to report to a designated police station on match
days.</div>
					<a name="0711302000723"><div class="hs_Para">If an officer has
reasonable grounds for believing that a person has breached, or is
about to breach, the terms of a football banning order, they can arrest
them without warrant. Breaches of football banning orders are already
offences. Under section 14J(1)(b) of the Football Spectators Act 1989,
a breach of any requirement by the enforcing authority to surrender a
passport during the control period is an offence. In those
circumstances, under section 42 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984, summary arrest might be necessary in order to ascertain the
identity of the person in question or to prevent that person from
causing physical injury or loss or damage to property.</div>
					<a name="0711302000724"><div class="hs_Para">The new clause misunderstands
the primary purpose of police ports operations. It is extremely rare
for an individual subject to a football banning order to try and travel
to an overseas tournament, because they do not have their passport.
Just two people attempted to breach an order during the 2006 World cup.
The police ports operation enables the police to identify known
individuals whom they believe will cause violence, at which point they
can prevent them from travelling and subject them to the courts and an
almost instantaneous football banning order, which would require them
to give up their passport. I hope that with that reassurance, the hon.
Gentleman will recognise that significant powers are available to the
police and that his new clause is
unnecessary.</div>

Garnier:
						</b> We probably do not need this new clause, but it
provides me with an opportunity to mention a matter of pretty
widespread concern, namely the way in which we deal with teenage
offenders. I do not want to say too much about this because we have
discussed it before. I do not know whether the Minister knows this, but
I regret to say that this morning a 15-year-old boy hanged himself at
Lancaster Farms young offenders institution. He was the 30th boy of
that, or that sort of age, to have died in custody since 1990 or it may
even be since 2000. In any event, it is an appalling tragedy,
irrespective of what caused that youngster to be in custody in the
first place. It gives us a good reason to think carefully about how we
incarcerate youngsters, while at the same time bearing in mind the need
to protect the public from criminal activity. I do not need to say any
more. I am sure that the Minister will have plenty to
say.</div>
					<a name="0711302000733"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001192">Ms
Keeble:
						</b> I also wanted to pick up on the
same point either on this or a later new clause. It concerns the
appropriate sentences and the provision of facilities for young
offenders. The young person concerned had a sentence of only one month
and 14 days and had been taken back to prison because of a breach of
his licence. That such a short custodial sentence should result in the
loss of life makes one wonder about sentencing policies, whether the
alternatives to custody are sufficient and appropriate and exactly what
we are doing with these young people. I was closely involved in an
earlier case in which the death, sadly, was not suicide. If we are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column779" />Column number: 779</div>sending young people to custodial institutions that are unable to ensure
their safety for quite short periods of time, there must be general
questioning of the type of sentence and the type of security that we
provide for them. The loss of this young boy&#151;the 30th since
1990&#151;is completely
disproportionate.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001193">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> May I confirm to the Committee
that Liam McManus was found dead in his cell at 7.45 this morning at
Lancaster Farms. Liam, as my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton,
North and the hon. and learned Member for Harborough have confirmed,
entered the institution on 8 November and was sentenced to one month
and 14 days following an earlier breach of his licence. He had not been
identified as being at risk of self-harm and he was indeed in a single
cell at the time of his death. Obviously, I regret Liam&#146;s death
and express my condolences to his family, who, I believe, are from the
St. Helens area of the north-west of England. As is normal in these
cases, the prison and probation ombudsman will be investigating and it
would be inappropriate of me to prejudge that investigation still
further, apart from giving the Committee the broad facts of
Liam&#146;s death this
morning.</div>
					<a name="0711302000735"><div class="hs_Para">Obviously
I remain concerned in general terms about the potential for self-harm,
not just in young people&#146;s institutions, secure training centres
and elsewhere, but in the adult prison estate as well. My hon. Friend
the Under-Secretary of State for Justice deals very closely with a
suicide prevention group and is doing considerable work in the
Department with such groups to try to reduce self-harm.</div>
					<a name="0711302000736"><div class="hs_Para">The Committee will understand
that it is in nobody&#146;s interests not to take adequate steps to
prevent such self-harm. If there are lessons to be learned from the
incident this morning and from other incidents, we will obviously seek
to learn from them. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North
and the hon. and learned Member for Harborough will know that, in
general terms, we have established a review of some aspects of the
juvenile estate in terms of restraint at the moment. I am happy to
receive representations from Members on any issues that they feel can
be improved.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001194">Ms
Keeble:
						</b> Can my right hon. Friend say something about the
assessment of whether somebody is considered a suicide risk? I have
written to him about the case of another of my constituents, a young
man whose mother fears for his mental health, even though the
institution where he is being held says that he is doing fine. I am
concerned about such discrepancies and about the robustness of the
assessments that are undertaken. I have written to my right hon. Friend
about this case. Could he just double-check who conducted the
assessment and ensure that it is
accurate?</div>
					<a name="0711302000738"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001195">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I will certainly look at the case that my hon.
Friend has referred to me. There is a professional judgment to be made
about the potential for self-harm of any individual who enters the
prison system, young offenders institutions or secure training
centres.</div>
					<a name="0711302000739"><div class="hs_Para">In the case of
Liam McManus, once again I do not wish to prejudge the prison and
probation ombudsman&#146;s report but my initial understanding is
that he was not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column780" />Column number: 780</div>identified as being at possible risk of self-harm. The ombudsman will
investigate this case and make a report, as he does on every
self-inflicted death. Obviously that report will be published and
Members, including the Member of Parliament for Liam&#146;s
constituency, can comment on it then.</div>
					<a name="0711302000740"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001196">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> May I make one request in relation to this tragic
case? The coroner&#146;s inquest into the suicide in 2005 of Gareth
Price at the same young offenders institution, which I visited in
October this year, only began earlier this month. Therefore, nearly two
years have elapsed between the death and the beginning of the
coroner&#146;s hearing. There may be all sorts of good reasons for
that delay in coroner&#146;s proceedings, but it is one of
the things that families of the deceased worry most
about. If there is anything that the Minister or his officials can do
to ensure that the necessary inquest that will follow today&#146;s
sad news can be expedited, I am sure that the young man&#146;s family
will be greatly
assisted.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001197">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> Again, it is in everybody&#146;s interests that
such inquests take place as quickly as possible. The hon. and learned
Gentleman will know that the inquest into Gareth Price, who was aged 16
and found dead in similar circumstances in Lancaster Farms young
offenders institution in January 2005, opened on 5 November 2007 at
Lancaster shire hall. Sadly, his was not the last such death; the last
death on the under-18 estate was that of Sam Elphick, who died at
Hindley Green young offenders institution near Wigan on 15 September
2005. Every such death is a tragedy and obviously we wish to see that
the lessons are learned from them. I assure the hon. and learned
Gentleman and my hon. Friend that we will consider the prison and
probation service ombudsman&#146;s report into that case and learn
whatever lessons we can to prevent such incidents in the
future.</div>
					<a name="0711302000742"><div class="hs_Para">I am not able
to accept the new clause that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome so
ably introduced. It would have a direct impact on the ability of the
courts to use attendance centres as a requirement under the adult
community order and as an option for dealing with adult violent
offenders. It might lead to greater use of custody, it would damage the
viability of attendance centres, and its approach to the Secretary of
State and the Youth Justice Board would not be helpful. Having said all
that, I should like to tell the hon. Gentleman that a review is ongoing
into the use of attendance centres, and we are examining where they
should sit within the youth justice system, with regard to youth
offending services and adult offender management. I hope that he will
allow me to receive the review and make recommendations in due course
to the House.</div>
					<a name="0711302000743"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001198">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> My brevity in introducing the new clause was
because I felt that we had dealt with many of its issues during the
early aspects of the Bill. The response that the Minister has just
given, however, suggests that, although the new clause would be a
terribly bad idea and a disaster for the entire system, the ongoing
review may actually recommend it as the right way forward, in which
case his view will reverse. So be it. It was worth putting the new
clause before the Committee.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column781" />Column number: 781</div>
					<a name="0711302000744"><div class="hs_Para">I cannot but refer to the point
that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough made, and which I
intended to make under new clause 57, standing in my name, which deals
with the custody of young offenders rather than with the provision of
attendance centres. The situation under discussion is tragic. We had
for the most part yesterday on the Floor of the House a good and
reasoned debate about the prisons estate, the way in which we deal with
young offenders and the fact that far too many young people serve
custodial sentences. It is extraordinary that this country feels the
need to imprison so many more young people than any comparable
country&#151;comparable, because there are other countries that
imprison more. It is sad, too. It suggests a societal breakdown that we
ought to regret deeply.</div>
					<a name="0711302000745"><div class="hs_Para">It is even more regrettable when
a young person is put into a prison environment and they take their own
life. It happens far too often, and every incident should be a scar on
our collective conscience. We will deal with those issues later, when I
shall have more to say about the later new clauses. At this point,

					<a name="0711302000749"><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
replicates a similar clause that was introduced during the passage of
the Legal Services Act 2007, for which I was a Committee member. It was
buried deep within the recesses of that legislation, and it did not
receive the light that it deserved in order to allow proper
consideration of whether legal executives should be protected by way of
their title. The point of this new clause is that all users of legal
services should be clear that anyone who claims to be a legal executive
is in fact professionally qualified, able to exercise such rights as
are granted to fellows, and subject to regulation. The reason for
including the definition that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column782" />Column number: 782</div>
					</div>
					<a name="0711302000974"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;legal
executive&#146; means a Fellow of the Institute of Legal
Executives&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000750"><div class="hs_Para">is that the
Institute of Legal Executives&#146; membership restricts the use of
the term &#147;legal executive&#148; to fellows of ILEX. All
members of ILEX&#151;there are 23,000&#151;recognise that the 7,000
who are fellows are properly entitled to call themselves legal
executives but others are not. That is a condition of
membership.</div>
					<a name="0711302000751"><div class="hs_Para">ILEX
members&#146; concern is that non-members, who are not constrained by
ILEX regulation, should not hold themselves out as legal executives.
There are examples of that happening in a wide variety of legal areas
in which legal executives involve themselves. Proper regulation and
protection of the title of legal executive under statute is in the
public interest, given that legal executives involve themselves in
immigration advice, claims management services and many other areas,
such as unopposed applications in county court proceedings. They also
act as commissioners for oaths.
</div>
					<a name="0711302000752"><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish to go
through the debates on the Legal Services Bill, which took up a good
deal of time, but it is important, particularly given the extension of
services and the opportunity to manage and partner in the matter of
legal services, that the term &#147;legal executive&#148; should be
clarified. It is in consumers&#146; interests to be properly assured
that those providing legal services are competent and regulated. The
new clause would provide such protection, which currently covers other
persons who provide legal services but not legal
executives.</div>
					<a name="0711302000753"><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important to focus the term on fellows of the Institute of Legal
Executives. In discussions of the Legal Services Bill, concern was
expressed that protecting the title of legal executive could cause
other grades of ILEX member to become liable to prosecution. However,
given that ILEX membership restricts the use of the title to fellows,
the new clause would provide a focused way to deal with a problem that
could arise increasingly as legal services are extended to many areas.
Perhaps it would be more appropriate to deal with the matter through
regulatory provisions in the Legal Services Bill, but this is an
opportunity that ILEX, perhaps not surprisingly, says is not to be
missed.</div>

take consumer protection seriously, as the hon. Member for Enfield,
Southgate will be aware, having sat through proceedings on the Legal
Services Bill, now an Act&#151;it is a key principle of that
legislation. I recognise fully the advantages of ensuring that
consumers are clear who can use the title of legal executive. Making it
an offence to pretend to be a legal executive is one way to achieve
that.</div>
					<a name="0711302000759"><div class="hs_Para">The Legal
Services Act 2007 already takes steps to protect consumers by ensuring
that only qualified individuals who comply with an appropriate
regulatory regime can provide legal services. It is therefore an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column783" />Column number: 783</div>offence for unqualified persons to carry on reserved legal activities or
pretend to be entitled to do so. In addition, the titles of solicitor
and barrister are specifically
protected.</div>
					<a name="0711302000760"><div class="hs_Para">Following
debate on the Legal Services Bill in the other place, the Government
were persuaded of the need for an offence of pretending to be a
barrister and introduced an amendment to that effect. The argument for
protecting a professional title and creating a new offence must be
considered case by case, as not all professional titles are protected
in statute. It is sensible to consider in each case whether such
protection is
needed.</div>
					<a name="0711302000761"><div class="hs_Para">The Institute
of Legal Executives has approached the Department to discuss the issue.
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon.
Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice), has written to the noble
Lord Hunt of Wirral stating her views. Although the Government accept
the rationale behind the new clause, we have yet to be persuaded that
the title of legal executive should be protected or that the new clause
is as technically perfect as it needs to be, although that is a minor
point. I am perfectly happy to discuss their concerns further with the
hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate and the Institute for Legal
Executives. We do not know whether the institute has yet consulted with
its members or with consumers, and would be interested to hear what
they have to say before considering fully whether such a measure is the
right way forward. However, the Government are happy to continue those
discussions with ILEX and with other relevant stakeholders and
interested parties, and examine whether further protection is required.
At this stage, however, we are not ready to concur, so I hope that the
hon. Gentleman will not seek to press his new
clause.</div>

point that parties such as ILEX wish to make, which is a good one, is
that, of the various types of legal practitioner referred to in the
Act, legal executives constitute the only established professional
group that does not have statutory protection. They believe that it
should be clear that their powers are exercised in accordance with the
wishes of Parliament and that individuals who rightly claim to be legal
executives should be given appropriate protection. However, I welcome

						</b> There is not very long to go now,
Sir Nicholas.</div>
					<a name="0711302000773"><div class="hs_Para">The new clauses bring us back to
some of the issues that we discussed in relation to part 1 of the Bill.
It is a strange aspect of our proceedings that we reach the end and yet
seem to be discussing things that we have already discussed, but that
does not make the points that are encompassed in the new clauses any
the less 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column786" />Column number: 786</div>important. I was very brief in my remarks on the previous proposal, so I
want to spend a little longer on the present
group.</div>
					<a name="0711302000774"><div class="hs_Para">New clause 53
deals with the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and I do not think
that I need to spend long on it. It would invoke the Act for a young
person who was convicted of a less serious crime at the point when they
reached their 18th birthday. In other words, it would mean that young
people would start with a clean sheet when they reached the age of
majority, unless they had been convicted of a serious or persistent
crime. It would work on the basis that children should be treated as
children and on an acceptance of the idea that children, like adults,
might make mistakes. We would be expressing the hope that the sentence
imposed had had the desired effect and that children should start their
adult life with a clean sheet.</div>
					<a name="0711302000775"><div class="hs_Para">The point is quite an important
one. I accept that if someone has a string of convictions, or is guilty
of a serious crime, the position would be different. Nevertheless, it
seems to me to be appropriate to take cognizance of the fact that
things that we do as children should not saddle us for a prolonged
period of time&#151;certainly not in those crucial years on reaching
majority when one is beginning to start to seek a first job, or a place
in further education, when there is a risk of serious prejudice to the
rest of the person&#146;s life.</div>
					<a name="0711302000776"><div class="hs_Para">New clause 54 addresses an issue
that we have certainly already discussed: that at the moment a court
cannot impose a conditional discharge of a youth conditional caution.
The same applies to final warnings. It seems reasonable that a court
should have full discretion to apply a disposal that seems appropriate
under all the circumstances and after consideration of the individual
case, but at the moment the law prohibits that. It seems to me that
there is no obvious reason why the court should not have the option of
a conditional discharge, if that is the right way of dealing with an
offender at that
point.</div>
				
					<a name="0711302000996"><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div>
					<a name="0711302000777"><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
new clause 58 is to ensure that when an offender is under 18 and is to
be given a custodial sentence, appropriate local authority provision to
meet the needs of the offender is considered by the local authorities
and the courts. That would prevent courts from sentencing children and
young people to custody if it appeared that further service provision
could avoid custody. We come directly back to the point that we were
discussing on the previous amendment: whether there are ways of
preventing children and young people from being put into custody, which
we all say that we want to avoid. I accept at face value what the
Government are saying on this issue, in terms of their earlier
provisions within the Bill&#151;part of its objective is to divert
young people away from a custodial sentence.</div>
					<a name="0711302000778"><div class="hs_Para">The new clause would ensure that
alternatives to the custodial sentence are applied, even at the point
at which the court has decided that perhaps a custodial sentence is
justified, and it would cause the court to determine whether it is
justified for the punishment of the offender or for the protection of
the public. If it is for the protection of the public and that is the
only disposal that provides for that, there should be no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column787" />Column number: 787</div>question. But if we are talking about a custodial sentence for the
purpose of punishment there may be alternatives that are more suitable,
which will have a better effect on the recidivism of the offender. To
enable the local authorities, the Secretary of State and others to step
back and take an overview of the needs of the particular individual is
no bad thing.</div>
					<a name="0711302000779"><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 57 is perhaps the most important of the clauses within this
group of amendments, so I would like to take a little time with it. It
would introduce a statutory custody threshold that must be tested
before any young person is sentenced to custody, ensuring that it is a
matter of last resort, and that it is being used for public protection.
I made some reference to this in the discussion on earlier provisions,
but we have an extraordinarily large number of children and young
people in prison in this country. I will give the Committee some
figures. For every 100,000 children in the population of England and
Wales, about 23 are in custody. The equivalent figure in France is six;
in Spain it is two; in Finland it is 0.2. The number of 15 to
17-year-olds in prison increased by 98.6 per cent. in 10 years, between
1995 and 2005, from 1,675 to 2,326. We should be very concerned about
that.</div>
					<a name="0711302000780"><div class="hs_Para">We should also
be concerned about the sort of young person who is in
prison. We often talk about the underachievement, in academic terms, of
adult prisoners, but we should recognise the difficulty for young
people as well. Nearly half of the children in custody had literacy and
numeracy levels lower than an average 11-year-old; over half of them
had a history of being in care or social services involvement; 40 per
cent of girls and 25 per cent. of boys reported suffering violence at
home. One in three girls and one in 20 boys reported sexual abuse; 40
per cent. of boys and 67 per cent. of girls had serious mental health
problems and over half reported dependence on a drug in the year prior
to imprisonment.</div>
					<a name="0711302000781"><div class="hs_Para">We must then
look at what is happening to young people within the prison system. I
know that there have been strenuous efforts to improve that. The
Minister talked about processes of restraint and the things that
happen. However, we should recognise that the inspections and
considerations that review the treatment of young offenders in prison
suggest that, even with the best will in the world, there are still
serious weaknesses. That is not intended as an attack on prison
staff&#151;far from it.</div>
					<a name="0711302000782"><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, my noble Friend Lord
Carlile of Berriew, whose arguments in his role as independent assessor
are often supported by the Government, in his 2006 inquiry said
that</div>
					<a name="0711302000975"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;some treatment of
children in custody would, in any other circumstances, trigger a child
protection investigation and could even result in criminal
charges.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000783"><div class="hs_Para">That is quite
serious stuff from a respected colleague. When we look at the utility
of keeping those young people in custody, we will see that we are
spending an enormous amount of money on custody&#151;&#163;280
million a year from the Youth Justice Board. However, we know that 76
per cent. of those who are discharged from custody reoffend within one
year. In other words, it is a revolving door. With regard to
discouraging reoffending, we are paying for no discernible
effect.</div>
					<a name="0711302000784"><div class="hs_Para">It seems to me
that some of the other disposals are so much more effective for that
age group. Some of them have been brought forward by the Government in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column788" />Column number: 788</div>the Bill, and I applaud that. That was discussed at length earlier and
we have said that we think it is of value. Having a higher threshold
before sending people into custody, or at least a higher level of
consideration, must be a good thing per se. It is beneficial in terms
of effectiveness, budget and, most importantly, the effect that it has
on those young people, so that we do not have another Liam in our
prison estate. That is what this section of the Bill is about and that
is why the new clause is a serious
issue.</div>
					<a name="0711302000785"><div class="hs_Para">Having a custody
threshold for young people is not a new idea. We used to have it in
English statute law, in section 14 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982. It
was inserted into the 1982 Act against the wishes of the Conservative
Government by a noble Lady on the Labour Benches. The Government
resisted it and later applauded it as a necessary and valuable addition
to the Act.</div>
					<a name="0711302000786"><div class="hs_Para">However, that provision was
repealed by the Criminal Justice Act 1991. It set a custody threshold
for people under the age of 21. Now the operative age would be 18.
There is clear evidence that it had a significant effect on the number
of young people who were sent into custody while it was in operation.
The Government ought to think seriously about whether that would be a
useful addition for reminding the courts of the seriousness of reducing
a young person to a custodial
sentence.</div>
					<a name="0711302000787"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001210">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I thank the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome for
bringing forward his proposals. This is a useful discussion. He will
know that we had a long discussion in relation to part 1 of the Bill
about the use of custody and our wish to see other out-of-court
disposals that will result in a reduction in custody and give further
opportunities through the youth reoffending order to ensure that we do
not put individuals in custody. He has raised a number of points with
regard to the clauses. It might be helpful if I tried to address some
of the points that he has brought forward.</div>
					<a name="0711302000788"><div class="hs_Para">As for new clause 53, I accept
that it is helpful to ensure that young adults are moved away from
offending and are helped into employment. One of our big objectives
through work with the Corporate Alliance for Reducing Re-offending is
to look at how we can help the employment of offenders. That is key to
getting individuals who are leaving the custodial estate at the age of
18 into employment. Indeed, we are gearing some of the training
programmes and work in the estate to secure employment and skill levels
that are consummate to the job market
outside.</div>
					<a name="0711302000789"><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman will know that, in 2002 and during the past couple of years,
we have been looking at the document entitled &#147;Breaking the
cycle: Taking stock of progress and priorities for the future&#148;.
It reports on how to support individuals to get back into employment as
well as on the several changes that have been made. Since that report,
the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, which followed the Bichard
report, has come into play. It means that we need to look into how and
when, and under what circumstances, we consider the employment of
ex-offenders in many areas of employment. The Bichard report has put
into the pot some significant new areas for discussion following our
original &#147;Breaking the cycle&#148; report.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column789" />Column number: 789</div>
					<a name="0711302000790"><div class="hs_Para">We are re-examining whether we
need to update the policy proposals in &#147;Breaking the
cycle&#148;, and whether we need to look at new arrangements under
the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 not only for young people, but
adults. I ask the hon. Gentleman to reflect on the fact that his new
clause is serious and would have a major impact on the employment
prospects of young people and pose a risk element for employers and the
public at large. I ask him to withdraw it because such issues need full
examination in the light of our original objectives in &#147;Breaking
the cycle&#148; and our current thinking into how ex-offenders, both
young and over the age of 18, can be employed in the community at
large.</div>
					<a name="0711302000791"><div class="hs_Para">I am keen to
ensure that young people and adult prisoners are given fair
opportunities to get back into the employment market. As the hon. and
learned Member for Harborough and the hon. Gentleman will agree and as
our debate on prisons highlighted, there is an element of consensus
that employment skills, raising those skills and employability are the
key drivers of the prevention of re-offending in respect of people
throughout the criminal justice system. However, the new clause is a
step too far, given the stage that we have reached in our consideration
of such matters.</div>
					<a name="0711302000792"><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 57 would place unacceptable restrictions on custody for
under-18s. I share the objective of the hon. Gentleman to reduce the
level of custody of under-18s in our estate, but we need to examine it
in terms of preventive measures, interventions and the work of the
Youth Justice Board rather than take a blanket approach that would
include the removal and restriction of the court&#146;s ability to
use custody for some of the most serious offences,
including&#151;under the new clause&#151;the removal of the
mandatory life sentence equivalent for murder. It is a serious
matter.</div>
					<a name="0711302000793"><div class="hs_Para">I share the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s objective. I am happy to discuss with him
outside Committee how we can reach a satisfactory conclusion, but the
ability to be able to set the custody threshold at the level sought by
the new clause would be difficult for both the public and the community
at large to accept. It would place the public at significant risk and
have the impact of examining sentences that would not be in agreement
with the public&#146;s expectations in the current
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="0711302000997"><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div>
					<a name="0711302000794"><div class="hs_Para">New clause 58
would place additional duties and requirements on the courts and local
authorities to consider prior to the court being able to impose
custodial sentences on a young person. I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will accept that it would duplicate existing safeguards and provisions
in respect of information about the young offender, and would impose
additional bureaucracy and cost, particularly on local authorities, for
little extra gain. Safeguards exist in respect of the court&#146;s
duty towards the offender, and I am satisfied that the information that
is available to it under the current arrangements enables it to make
the appropriate sentencing
decisions.</div>
					<a name="0711302000795"><div class="hs_Para">Finally, in
relation to new clause 54, section 66(4) of the Crime and Disorder Act
1998 is designed to ensure that those who continue to offend, despite
out of court 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column790" />Column number: 790</div>intervention, can expect significant punishment, as we stated in the
White Paper &#147;No More Excuses&#148;. A young offender will
already have a number of out of court disposals which were conditional
in some way, so another conditional one would be inappropriate. To
continue to use conditional disposals for a young person who, when
before the court, continues to offend despite previous interventions,
risks undermining community confidence in the criminal justice system
and undermining the potential intervention that custody might bring to
prevent the young offender from further
offending.</div>
					<a name="0711302000796"><div class="hs_Para">I accept
that there is a real challenge for all hon. Members, inside and outside
the Committee, to look at what we should do to tackle the level of
reoffending mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. It is not acceptable to me
or the Government to find that we have in the region of 75 per cent.
reoffending rates from those leaving custody. Something is not working
if that is the case. The solutions that the hon. Gentleman has brought
forward today, while raising the issue, would add to some of the
problems and would not necessarily stop the reoffending. They would
also cause some difficulties in public
perception.</div>
					<a name="0711302000797"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001211">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> We all know the 75 per cent. statistic. However,
the Minister says that that is the reoffending rate, but it is the
reconviction rate. The reoffending rate may be a lot
higher.</div>
					<a name="0711302000798"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001212">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> Indeed, that is for reconviction. Neither I, nor
the hon. Gentleman know how much reoffending goes on that is not
caught. Reconviction is at a very high level. I am not proud of that
fact. It is something that we should address in detail. It is an issue
that is of great importance and the hon. Gentleman is right to raise
it. I ask him to withdraw the motion on the basis that we will examine
how we can affect employability and will look at questions about the
Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 as part of the &#147;Breaking
the Cycle&#148; review that we are undertaking. I do not think that
the public or the Committee would accept that there is not still a role
for custody for individuals in the community who commit very serious
offences.</div>
				
					<a name="0711302000799"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001213">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> That is precisely what I did not say in the new
clause, which would make it very clear that custody is for those who
present a threat to the protection of the public. I have no difficulty
with that at
all.</div>
					<a name="0711302000800"><div class="hs_Para">Having said that,
I am grateful to the Minister for the way that he approached his
response. I did not expect a meeting of minds on every issue. Why
should there be? However, I do think that we can discuss matters in an
intelligent and sensible way. I think that we did that yesterday, with
the possible exception of a couple of speeches at the
beginning.</div>
					<a name="0711302000801"><div class="hs_Para">

Heath:
						</b> Not by anybody in this room. We had a very sensible
debate yesterday. There is more that we share in terms of penal policy
than that which separates us. We are all seeking the same objectives. I
am pleased with what the Minister said about the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column791" />Column number: 791</div>rehabilitation of offenders. It is high time that we looked at that
again to see how we can improve things. It is not just a case of wiping
the slate clean. As the Minister knows, we need to come to terms with a
whole range of issues associated with transition, and I look forward to
talking with him further about
those.</div>
					<a name="0711302000803"><div class="hs_Para">At some point,
we must accept that the custody system does not do what we pay it to
do. We pay enormous amounts of money for it. There must be better
alternatives. We should recognise the damage that it potentially does
to young people. In that age group, only those who must be shut
away&#151;because it is only by shutting them away that we can
protect the public&#151;should be given standard custodial sentences.
I do not dispute that there may be other secure sentencing
possibilities that we should use instead, but it seems futile to spend
an enormous amount of money on a system that has a virtually 100 per
cent. reoffending rate. Nobody would plan a public policy with that
little effect, but still we carry on with it and expand it in
increasing numbers. However, the hour is late and it is time we moved
on. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

Heath:
						</b> I promise that this will be the last group that I
speak to.</div>
					<a name="0711302000810"><div class="hs_Para">The
two new clauses deal with antisocial behaviour orders
and their application to young people. We have been reminded on several
occasions that it was not the original intention for ASBOs, but they
have become principally a disposal for young people rather than adults,
which is perhaps perverse. New clause 55 deals with something that I do
not expect Ministers to agree with me about, because they have
disagreed on the last two occasions that we have debated the
matter&#151;in the context of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 and
the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. However, that will not
stop me from raising the issue again.</div>
					<a name="0711302000811"><div class="hs_Para">In the case of criminal
offences, we have a reporting restriction for children. It has been
there for 70 years, it is an important part of our criminal justice
system, but yet it does not apply to ASBOs, either when they are made,
or when they are breached. These children, when brought before a court,
can have their faces spread all over every newspaper and even on a
notice board in a supermarket. Yet if they commit a more serious crime
and are given a criminal sentence ab initio, that will not happen. It
seems perverse that we deal with such matters in different ways, and a
variety of people have brought attention to the subject.</div>
					<a name="0711302000812"><div class="hs_Para">I do not expect the Committee to
be hugely swayed by the opinion of Alvaro Gil-Robles, the Human Rights
Commissioner of the Council of Europe, although he is an estimable
gentleman and a colleague of mine on the Parliamentary Assembly of the
Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. He specifically
raised the issue, saying that it
is,</div>
					<a name="0711302000813"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;entirely
disproportionate to aggressively inform members of the community who
have no knowledge of the offending behaviour, and who are not affected
by it, of the application of ASBOs. It seems to me that they have no
business and no need to know.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711302000814"><div class="hs_Para">That is his view, and it is perfectly
proper for the Government and the Committee to take a different view.
However, I think that it is disproportionate and that it is in stark
distinction to the way that we deal with real criminal offences, as
opposed to those that fall below the criminal standard of proof. It
seems extraordinary that we make that division in the case of children.
In the case of adults, I have no problem. If adults commit antisocial
behaviour, naming and shaming them is all part of the process, but I am
not sure that that is the right way for civilised society to deal with
young people and children as young as 10.</div>
					<a name="0711302000815"><div class="hs_Para">New clause 56 deals with the
period of an ASBO, and seeks to extend the discretion of the court when
dealing with a person aged under 18, so that the minimum period can be
reduced to three months. That would enable a short, objective lesson in
the form of an ASBO to be given to a child, without it necessarily
extending to the two-year minimum period. That, too, seems a sensible
discretion to leave the court when it deals with a very young
offender&#151;I suppose that we call them offenders when we are
talking about ASBOs. It is a moot point whether they are offenders or
potential offenders when such a civil remedy is applied. In any case,
the courts should have the discretion to do what they see fit in the
case of a young person, and a three-month minimum period for the order
would be appropriate.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column793" />Column number: 793</div>
					<a name="0711302000816"><div class="hs_Para">The second part of the new clause
deals with what happens in the event of a breach. Again, we return to
the matter of custody. Is that really the answer for a breach of an
ASBO if it has not been established as necessary for the protection of
the public from harm? I doubt it, and if a young person is in breach of
an ASBO, better and more appropriate disposals should be available to
the court and used rather than sending a young person into custody,
where we know what will happen&#151;we have just discussed it. They
go in, come out and commit an offence. That is not a sensible way to
deal with someone who persistently causes problems through antisocial
behaviour.</div>
					<a name="0711302000817"><div class="hs_Para">I
am not arguing against ASBOs; as the Under-Secretary of State for the
Home Department knows, we have always been open to the view that they
can work under certain circumstances. Right from the start, we did not
oppose them. However, the way in which they are used has always been
open to question, and we have always wanted to engage in discussion
with the Government on how they can best be
used.</div>
					<a name="0711302000818"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001220">Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I have a couple of brief comments on the new
clauses. The context of the debates that we have had in the past hour
or so is that none of us wants to see our young people in prison for
the sad reasons that we have heard about. We want them to be diverted
from antisocial and criminal behaviour. We must consider how we can
effectively do that and what to do to ensure that we achieve it. If we
really mean that, every single one of us in the room has a lot of work
to do.</div>
					<a name="0711302000819"><div class="hs_Para">Out there,
diversion and community punishment, and working with young people who
commit offences instead of imprisoning them&#151;restorative justice
and so on&#151;is a big matter for argument and a debate that needs
to be won. The terms of trade are changing, and the debates that we
have had in the Committee and elsewhere in Parliament show that
parliamentary opinion, and perhaps some parts of public opinion to an
extent, are moving. The work of my two ministerial colleagues in the
Ministry of Justice has helped to shape that debate and move it
forward.</div>
					<a name="0711302000820"><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0711302001221">
							<b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): My hon.
Friend is absolutely correct, and it is good to see some movement in
the direction of saying that laws ought to prevent what they forbid,
which is precisely what the ASBO is designed to do. It is a measure of
prevention, not
punishment.</div>
				
					<a name="0711302000998"><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30

							<a name="0711302001222">Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> That is an excellent point, and I thank my right
hon. Friend for it. That is the whole purpose of the civil
order&#151;not to punish, but to prevent.</div>
					<a name="0711302000822"><div class="hs_Para">After that brief introduction, I
shall respond briefly to the comments made by the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome. There is almost a contradiction between what I said
a moment ago and what I am about to say, in that I do believe that the
courts need discretion in some of the cases referred to by the hon.
Gentleman. For example, in respect of reporting restrictions when
antisocial behaviour orders are given, it is not automatic that the
court should publicise the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column794" />Column number: 794</div>names&#151;it does not have to name and shame. The court has the power
to say, &#147;We do not think it appropriate in these circumstances
for the name of that young person to be given, for the following
reasons.&#148; The courts would no doubt take factors such as
vulnerability into account. However, in some circumstances, for the
prevention of harm in communities, including the prevention of harm to
other young people&#151;young people are, by and large, the victims
of crime&#151;naming may sometimes be necessary. I ask the hon.
Gentleman to reflect on that
point.</div>
					<a name="0711302000823"><div class="hs_Para">On
reducing the minimum duration of antisocial behaviour orders from two
years to three months, the Committee will know that the Government have
moved some way toward the sorts of issues that the hon. Gentleman
raised. The Bill now allows for an annual review. Although it does not
go fully to the three months&#146; duration wished for, it has
started to move towards it. Where there was an expectation that a
review would be held, we have made an annual review a statutory
requirement&#151;a statutory duty. Again, progress has been
made.</div>
					<a name="0711302000824"><div class="hs_Para">One of the most
difficult questions, particularly in the context of today&#146;s
debate, is that of not having the option of custody for breach of
ASBOs. I do not particularly want young people to be put in prison, nor
do I want them to be imprisoned for breach of an ASBO, but I believe
that that must be an option. Let me cite a study that shows how
difficult the subject can be. The Youth Justice Board conducted a study
in December 2004&#151;admittedly, a couple of years ago&#151;in
which it considered 43 young people who had received custody for breach
of ASBOs. Between them, those young people had committed a total of
1,779 offences. Ministers receive briefings all the time, but when I
read that I was astonished and shocked.</div>
					<a name="0711302000825"><div class="hs_Para">When I say that custody is
available as a sanction for breach of an ASBO, hon. Members often say,
&#147;Yes, but there has to be a lot of other offences before it
happens.&#148; I was shocked at that figure. It suggests that many of
the interventions that my hon. Friends are trying to introduce earlier
in the process need to be considered in order to discover what works.
However, there is a problem: what do you do with people who have
committed so many offences, when every other alternative has no doubt
been tried by the police, the youth offending teams and others? It
seems to me that, in those circumstances, we are left with no
choice.</div>
					<a name="0711302000826"><div class="hs_Para">The question
then is what sort of environment are those young people being sent to
if they breach their ASBO and are sent into custody? Again, the debate
has moved on; we are moving away from saying that they should just be
locked up and given bread and water. There is a growing mature opinion
says that if people&#151; particularly the
young&#151;breach their ASBOs, there must be a better option than the
traditional type of environment. Although it might have to be a secure
environment, perhaps it could have a better rehabilitative element that
would command public confidence.</div>
					<a name="0711302000827"><div class="hs_Para">Although I understand the
principles and substance of the points set out by the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome, I believe that the custody option should be
available as the last resort for those who breach an ASBO. We have
tried to move some way towards a minimum term in the annual review that
we have introduced in this Bill. With those comments, will the hon.
Gentleman consider withdrawing his new clauses?</div>

almost a coda to what we started a long time ago. I hope that he and
his colleagues are right about the alternative structures that will be
put in place if the Bill is enacted and that they will be effective in
doing what we as a Committee all want them to do.
</div>
					<a name="0711302000829"><div class="hs_Para">I do
not agree with the Government about reporting restrictions, but the
Minister knows that. I accept what he said about the minimum period.
However, I do not think that people should be given a custodial
sentence for breach of ASBOs. They should be given a custodial sentence
if that is necessary for the protection of the public as a result of
the offences that they have committed. It is a subtle but real
difference. Again, we must agree to differ on that. Having said that, I
am grateful to the Minister for responding to the points that I have
made and I seek leave to withdraw the new
clause.</div>

							<a name="0711302001224">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. We
potentially have twenty-one minutes left to us. May I thank you and
your co-Chairmen, Mr. O&#146;Hara and Mr. Cook,
for your diligence, charm, wit and efficiency in managing the
Committee? This is an unusual type of early release for the Committee,
but I am certainly glad that we have managed to get it because I can
now get my train to north Wales with some ease.</div>
					<a name="0711302000855"><div class="hs_Para">On behalf of the whole
Committee, may I thank the badge messengers, Mr. Sandall,
our Clerk, <i class="I">Hansard, </i>and our colleagues from the police. All have
provided a particularly efficient service, especially given the number
of amendments that have been tabled by the Government and by Opposition
Members.</div>
					<a name="0711302000856"><div class="hs_Para">I particularly
thank the Opposition Front Benchers&#151;the hon. and learned Member
for Harborough and the hon. Members for Enfield, Southgate, for
Somerton and Frome and for Cambridge&#151;for their diligence in
testing the Government. I hope that they have found it not an
unfruitful exercise. My hon. Friends the Under-Secretaries of State for
the Home Department and for Justice and I have agreed to examine a
number of the amendments that they have proposed. I also thank my two
ministerial colleagues for their sterling support in this work, and my
hon. Friend the Member for Tooting and his Opposition counterpart, the
hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, for their work in the usual
channels.</div>
					<a name="0711302000857"><div class="hs_Para">I
particularly thank my hon. Friends the Members for Sedgefield and for
Ealing, Southall for their commitment to the Bill. They won very hard
fought by-elections during the summer. I am sure that they looked
forward to spending forty-eight and a half hours in Committee in 16
sittings spread over two parliamentary Sessions, given that the Bill
was carried over and has been in Committee since 16 October. I am sure
that they dreamed of this day when they were tramping the streets of
Trimdon and Ealing. I wish them well and thank them for their support.
I also thank my hon. Friends who are not present for their commitment
to the Bill and I thank Opposition Members whose contributions tested
us in debate.</div>
					<a name="0711302000858"><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I want to thank the most important people in the room: the officials
who have backed up the ministerial team; they have been superb. Hon.
Members will have seen a constant stream of them coming through the
Committee to support all three of us. They have done a sterling job.
Perhaps I will give them tomorrow off before we start preparing the
Bill for Report and for consideration in another place. I wish them a
happy Christmas and new year.</div>
					<a name="0711302000859"><div class="hs_Para">I conclude by wishing you, Sir
Nicholas, a very happy Christmas and a positive new
year.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001225">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> Further to that point of order, Sir Nicholas. I
join the Minister in thanking you and your two co-Chairmen.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column814" />Column number: 814</div>
					<a name="0711302000861"><div class="hs_Para">This comes with even greater
heartfelt sincerity from the Opposition, as we do not have the benefit
of the officials, whom I cannot see, but I know they exist somewhere in
the background&#151;I occasionally see a note being passed although I
cannot see where it has come from&#151;but I thank Mr.
Sandall and his colleagues in the Public Bill Office, because without
the assistance of the Clerk&#146;s Department, running a Committee in
opposition would be, not difficult, but impossible.</div>
					<a name="0711302000862"><div class="hs_Para">I also thank the <i class="I">Hansard
</i>reporters for their forbearance, their speed and their accuracy,
and the police officers and the doorkeepers. As usual they have kept us
in order and kept the show on the road. I am grateful to all of
them.</div>
					<a name="0711302000863"><div class="hs_Para">It is fair to
say that this has been an unhappy Bill, but not an unhappy Committee. I
believe that there were 85 new clauses proposed for a Bill that already
had 128 clauses, and 11 new schedules to add to the 23 that are already
there. There must have been about 400 amendments on the amendment
paper, the vast majority of which were tabled by the Government. The
Bill has its genesis in two separate Departments and as a consequence,
it is not the most coherent of measures. I described it on Second
Reading as something of a plum-duff. The Minister of State thought that
was jolly unfair and he complained that he had never had
plum-duff.</div>
					<a name="0711302000999"><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div>
					<a name="0711302000864"><div class="hs_Para">I owe a huge
debt of gratitude for their assistance to my hon.
Friends the Members for Enfield, Southgate, for Ruislip-Northwood, for
Kettering and for Broxbourne, as well as my colleagues on the Liberal
Democrat Benches. We all wish that the Minister had had an opportunity
to have plum-duff, as he would then have understood the accuracy of my
analogy. I promised myself that I would make a plum-duff pudding for
the Minister of State before the end of the Committee, but, sadly, I
have not had time. Instead, I have been to the House of Commons shop
and bought him a House of Commons whisky cake. It is full of nuts. I
shall give it to him when the Committee is over. I want him to take it
home, chew on it, enjoy every tasty morsel and understand that although
it is not quite as good as a plum duff, it is as full of separate
ingredients as a plum-duff might
be.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001227">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I am not quite sure about the etiquette for
passing Christmas puddings across the Committee Room. The Minister will
see that it is full of nuts, but if he delves in there, something
edible might emerge. In the same way, when we delved into this Bill,
one or two ideas emerged that are quite good, but it is held together
with an awful lot of extraneous and not terribly helpful
material.</div>

again.</div>

too, thank you and your co-Chairmen for your never-ending diligence in
getting my constituency pronounced correctly. It is
appreciated.</div>
					<a name="0711302000870"><div class="hs_Para">I
associate myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge with the
thanks that have already been given to everyone involved with the
Committee. It would be otiose&#151;to use the Under-Secretary of
State for Justice&#146;s and my favourite word&#151;to repeat those
thanks. These mini-Oscar ceremonies at the end of Committees can become
very long&#151;and now we are expected to give gifts. I feel
hopelessly under-prepared for the
occasion.</div>
					<a name="0711302000871"><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
and learned Gentleman said, this has been a good Committee on a mixed
Bill, which has both its good parts and some elements that we shall
continue to probe and oppose. My one parting shot is that there were
times when we had to sit late to get through the business under an
artificially truncated timetable. I hope that we will have sufficiently
long on Report to do justice to the Bill, which is very long and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column816" />Column number: 816</div>has lots of disparate parts that we still need to consider in depth.
That, if I may say so through you, Sir Nicholas, will require at least
two days, but I shall make that point elsewhere. Thank you, very
much.</div>
					<a name="0711302000872"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711302001231">The
Chairman:
						</b> This has been an excellent Committee. I am not
allowed to comment on the Bill&#151;I am totally impartial&#151;but
I want to thank in particular the Ministers and Opposition spokesmen
for their tireless work and the tremendous amount of research and
preparation that they have put into the Bill.</div>
					<a name="0711302000873"><div class="hs_Para">I thank all members of the
Committee, and welcome in particular the new Members from Sedgefield,
the former Prime Minister&#146;s constituency, and Ealing, Southall.
I hope that you have learned quite a lot from the Committee. I thank
also my Clerk and all the Clerks who have helped, as well as
<i class="I">Hansard</i>, the police and the doorkeepers. It has been a very well
run Committee.</div>
					<a name="0711302000874"><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
