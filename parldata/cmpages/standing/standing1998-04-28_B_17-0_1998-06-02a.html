<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> As the Committee will have gathered from our debates this morning, the sentencing advisory panel will make proposals to the Court of Appeal on sentencing guidelines. After consultation with the Secretary of State and the Lord Chief Justice, the Lord Chancellor will appoint the members of the panel. Opposition Members wish to include in the Bill some provisions regarding the membership of the panel. That is no reflection on the role of the Lord Chancellor.
<P>
In the past, membership of similar bodies has sometimes been perceived by the public as comprising the great and the good. Many distinguished and eminent figures have fallen into the trap of choosing that form of membership and it has happened under Governments of all political complexions. Conservative Members do not suggest for a moment that our present Lord Chancellor would fall into such a trap.
<P>
We do not allege that the panel would exclusively comprise the great and the good. We want to ensure that some thought is given to the position of ordinary victims of crime and others who might not necessarily be included in the ranks of the great and the good.
<P>
Amendment No. 230 would give the victims of crime a voice on the sentencing advisory panel; the panel would also include a judge, a police officer, a magistrate and a small business man. We feel especially strongly that if the Government set up such bodies, they should include victims; they should have a say in these matters. The amendment explores the membership of the sentencing advisory panel and we should like to hear some encouraging words from the Minister on that subject.
<P>
Amendment No. 303 refers to the guidelines for magistrates, which have achieved greater prominence in recent years. Where do such guidelines fit into the framework of guidelines described in clauses 75 and 76? The amendment would require the sentencing advisory panel to act in co-operation with the Magistrates Association. We wish to explore those issues through the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 306 relates to the consultations to be carried out by the sentencing advisory panel before it fulfils its functions. Again, it is important that the panel should consult the victims of crime, and we await the Minister's comments on that matter.
<P>
Amendment No. 288 is a technical amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that we have not yet reached amendment No. 288.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was getting ahead of myself, Mrs. Michie, as you have correctly reminded me. It was the excitement of talking about the technical nature of the amendment. I will spare the Committee a further preview of the amendment and give hon. Members something to look forward to later in the afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The amendments relate to the composition of the sentencing advisory panel and seek out the Government's intentions regarding that matter. I am happy to give the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) a positive response.
<P>
We should certainly consider the victims of crime and other people with an interest in the success of the criminal justice system. The purpose of the advisory panel is to enable the criminal justice system to become more effective in its sentencing practice.
<P>
Amendment No. 230, which would establish in statute the categories of people who could become members of the sentencing advisory panel established in clause 76, is identical to an amendment tabled in another place. It raises questions about who will be on the sentencing advisory panel and seeks to ensure that certain interest groups are represented.
<P>
We are keen to hear views about who should be on the panel and agree with some of the ideas in the amendment. However, we would resist attempts to adopt the prescriptive approach set out in the amendment. The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) rightly said that appointments to the panel will be decided by my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor in consultation with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and the Lord Chief Justice. Some discussions have taken place, but no final decision has yet been taken. We are happy to take note of views expressed in Committee.
<P>
It may be helpful if I outline the role of the panel and how it will work, as that will inform any decision on membership. The panel is intended to provide informed, well-researched and objective advice to the Court of Appeal. It must be independent, but it must be capable of reflecting the view of a wide range of interested parties and of acting as a conduit for those views to the Court of Appeal.
[Mr. Michael]
<P>
The panel must not be seen to be dominated by any particular sectional interests. It has been set up to promote consistency in sentencing by providing the Court of Appeal with additional tools which will assist in the framing or revision of guidelines. That information and advice will not change the Court of Appeal's responsibility for the guidelines.
<P>
The panel must have the right mix of coal-face experience and broad-based knowledge of the criminal justice system. It should not be too big and unwieldy, so we do not want to identify interest groups that must serve on it by law. We will look for up to a dozen people with an appropriate range of experience and who are able to make a positive contribution to the advisory process. Clearly, that limits the range of people and groups that may be represented on the panel itself. However, the panel will consult those whose interests are not directly represented to ensure that they have every opportunity to feed in their views.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will accept that victims' interests are represented by a wide variety of organisations. Some of those organisations represent victims with specific experiences of crime, and they can contribute expertise in certain areas of crime, even though they do not have knowledge of the entire range. Members of the panel do not have to be representatives or delegates of a particular interest group, but will contribute by drawing on their own experience by acting as a team in assisting the Court of Appeal.
<P>
The panel may wish to commission research when the question of making a new guideline is raised by the Court of Appeal, the Home Secretary or by the panel itself. The panel must then consider the views of other people or bodies, as determined by the Lord Chancellor and other bodies that are deemed appropriate by the panel. When those views are obtained and the research is complete, the panel will digest all the information and formulate its own advice which will then be passed to the Court of Appeal.
<P>
Appointments to the panel will not be made until the Bill is enacted. I assure the Committee that they will be open and fair. Our ideas on the composition of the panel are already taking shape. Our view is that contributors should include sentencers a judge and a magistrate sentence providers such as people with experience of the Prison Service and probation service, people who are wholly independent of the criminal justice system, and those with academic or research experience.
<P>
The Government have already demonstrated their sensitivity to victims of crime and we will seek to reflect that dimension in the composition of the panel. However, it would be unfortunate if we were too prescriptive about membership and were prevented from appointing suitable candidates simply because they did not fit some pre-determined category.
<P>
Amendment No. 306 would require the sentencing advisory panel to obtain and consider the views of victims of particular offences. It is unnecessary because the essence of our approach is that the views and experience of victims will be taken into consideration by the panel. I hope that that offers the specific reassurance that the hon. Member for Hertsmere requested.
<P>
The panel will consult a wide range of bodies and people. For example, the police are not specifically mentioned, but the panel will need to consult police representatives. If one group is singled out in the legislation, that might cast doubt on the position of others. As I have already said, victims' views are important and I can assure the Committee that their voice will be heard by the panel, but that does not need to be spelt out in the Bill.
<P>
The panel will not necessarily speak to the particular victim of a particular offence some victims would not want to do that, and we would not want them to be forced to do so, by putting a requirement on the statute book. Victims' views will be represented and there is no reason why individual victims should not write directly to the panel.
<P>
Amendment No. 303 would require the sentencing advisory panel to act in co-operation with the Magistrates Association. It is again unnecessary for the provision to be built into the Bill. As a former member of the Magistrates Association, I should like to make it clear that I fully support the principle behind the amendment. The association already plays an important role by providing sentencing guidelines for its members. The hon. Member for Hertsmere mentioned the relationship between those guidelines and the advice given by the panel. Once the sentencing advisory panel is established, there will be co-operation between the two bodies: that is essential.
<P>
Apart from the fact that the Magistrates Association is a non-statutory body, the amendment itself is vague. What exactly does it mean when it refers to acting in co-operation with the Magistrates Association? Does it mean that the panel must agree its advice with the Magistrates Association or is it that it must consult the Magistrates Association?
<P>
It is clear what co-operation means an exchange of views and the development of a good relationship. We can all agree that that should happen, but it is less easy to put it in legal terms and embody it in the Bill. The amendment does not have the clarity necessary for such a provision to be put in the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I take the Minister's point about the technical nature of the amendment. I was trying to highlight the relationship between the guidelines laid down by the Magistrates Association and those laid down by the Court of Appeal to guide the Crown court and other courts. I was suggesting that there should be co-operation so that the two sets of guidelines areco-ordinated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about the need for good communication and understanding of the principles underlying decisions. The Magistrates Association should listen to what is said in the process undertaken by the panel and the Court of Appeal.
<P>
Clause 75(8) makes it clear that the focus of these provisions will be indictable offences offences triable in the Crown court only or either-way offences that can be tried in the Crown court or Magistrates courts. The guidelines will not cover summary only offences, which form the main business of magistrates courts. These are, of course, dealt with by the separate guidelines that the Magistrates Association produces.
<P>
Guidelines made by the Court of Appeal should be comprehensive and cover less serious examples of offences which might well be dealt with in magistrates courts. Existing sentencing guidelines from the Court of Appeal already cover offences that are dealt with in the magistrates court. It is not, then, a new principle.
<P>
Where an offence is triable either way, the Court of Appeal's sentencing guidelines will interact with the magistrates' sentencing guidelines just as they do at present. For example, the Court of Appeal's sentencing guideline for possession of drugs in the case of R v. Aramah is also covered by Magistrates Association sentencing guidelines on possession of drugs, which demonstrates that there is a sensible relationship between the two. I agree with the hon. Gentleman in seeking coherence between the decisions of the Court of Appeal and those of the Magistrates Association. I also agree that the panel should listen to the experience of magistrates as well as other sentencers.
<P>
There clearly needs to be co-operation between the sentencing advisory panel and the Magistrates Association in these matters, but it is difficult to frame statutory responsibilities around a non-statutory body. I hope that I have made it clear that our expectations mirror the hon. Gentleman's intentions in the amendment. Fruitful discussions can be anticipated between the two bodies, and the Magistrates Association is likely to be one of the bodies that the panel must consult.
<P>
I have explained the intended workings and the intended composition of the panel. I hope that that explanation covers the points the hon. Gentleman has raised on these probing amendments and that we are able to agree a way forward without the need to divide the Committee.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his courteous response. It did not surprise me to learn that he has found the amendments relating to the membership of the sentencing advisory panel to be too prescriptive. I have heard that argument before.
<P>
I do not want to say anything untoward about the great and the good because we recognise the need for distinguished and eminent people of great experience to be on such bodies. However, we hope that someone will be on the sentencing advisory panel to speak on behalf of the victims and the man in the street who suffer the burden of everyday crime.
<P>
I accept the Minister's assurance about consultation with victims' groups. I am also reassured by what he told me courteously about the Magistrates Association guidelines. We seek co-ordination and coherence and we teased out of the Government the fact that they share that aim. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 288, in page 61, line 24, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"but the court need not wait for the Panel to carry out its duties under subsection (4) below before determining the appeal of which it is seized".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment reflects a concern that was brought to my attention by David Thomas, who is worried about how the provisions will work in practice. He has written to me and his views lie behind the amendment. His letter states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I am also concerned about the obligation of the court to notify the Sentencing Advisory Panel of its intention to frame or revise guidelines (Clause 76(2)). It is not clear to me whether Clause 76 requires the Court of Appeal, having notified the Sentencing Panel, to wait till it hears from the Sentencing Panel before it promulgates the guideline. It is clear that the Sentencing Panel will require some considerable time to report back to the Court of Appeal if it is to obtain and consider the views of other bodies in accordance with Clause 76(4). I would suggest that Clause 76 be amended by the addition of a further clause making it clear that the Court of Appeal is not obliged to wait for the report from the Sentencing Advisory Panel before proceeding with the guideline. Otherwise the process will be stultified."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
David Thomas is worried about how the Court of Appeal will deal with a case while it is waiting for the sentencing advisory panel to carry out its functions. He makes an important practical point that our amendment is designed to reflect. If the Minister accepts the force of that point but is unable to accept the amendment for any technical reason, I hope that he will consider the matter and bring it back at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point and the fact that the amendment was prompted by the concern that the existence of the sentencing advisory panel could lead to delays in dealing with cases. I can do better than the hon. Gentleman asks by satisfying him that such concerns have already been taken care of.
<P>
Under clause 75, the Court of Appeal may decide, as a result of a case that is before it, to frame or revise guidelines. Ideally, those guidelines would be included in the court's judgment. That would provide clarity. We are, however, anxious to avoid unnecessary delays and are seized of the point that the hon. Gentleman makes. Clause 75(5) therefore specifically provides that the court shall include the guidelines in the judgment relating to the case where practicable. Where that would result in unnecessary and unacceptable delay, the court would be required instead, under clause 75(6), to include the guidelines in the next appropriate judgment. There would thus be no obligation on the Court of Appeal to await the receipt of advice from the panel.
<P>
The Lord Chief Justice initially expressed concern about how the provisions would work and, following consultation with them, they were amended in another place to deal with the point in question. We do not want the Bill to cause delays in the criminal justice system. Members of the Committee will know that we have already acted to reduce delays in accordance with the Narey report and that we intend to do more towards that aim. In the light of my comments, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that his point has been dealt with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister will understand our motivation for tabling the amendment the technical nature of the matter and the desire to avoid delay and[Mr. Clappison]
complication. As the Minister has said that the Lord Chief Justice was thinking along the same lines, I hope that the Government will be alive to any similar concerns that are brought before them in future. However, for the time being, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 301, in page 61, line 25, leave out from "time" to "propose" in line 26.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to explore the Secretary of State's relationship to the sentencing advisory panel. There is some innovation in the setting up of the panel, and we cannot let it pass by without some exploration of its possible implications.
<P>
We apprehend from the Bill that the sentencing advisory panel could decide of its own accord to propose to the Court of Appeal that guidelines for sentencing should be framed. However, it appears that it could also be directed by the Secretary of State to do so. That would seem to give the Secretary of State a formal role in instigating sentencing guidelines for a particular category of offence, via the sentencing advisory panel. The link might be indirect, but it would be a link none the less. We do not think that we should just allow it to pass without more detailed investigation. The Secretary of State would enter new territory by the measure, and we should like to know how the present Secretary of State proposes to approach the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> If the hon. Gentleman sought to press the amendment, I should have to oppose it robustly. However, judging by his remarks, I think that I can satisfy him as to our intentions.
<P>
The amendment would take away the Home Secretary's power to make a direction to the sentencing advisory panel. The Government are committed to ensuring an effective sentencing system for all the main offences, and clause 76 gives the Home Secretary the power to ensure that the Court of Appeal considers the main offences, over time. It is an important new power, which the Home Secretary would be likely to use if there were a gap in the process of considering all the main offences perhaps because no appeal had arisen on the relevant area of law or if there were concern about a particular offence or type of offence.
<P>
If public concern had arisen about an offence, it would be entirely appropriate for the Home Secretary, who has a responsibility to ensure public confidence in the criminal justice system, to be able to direct the panel to consider the matter. A public interest factor is clearly involved.
<P>
The Home Secretary would not be able to interfere with the contents of the sentencing advisory panel's advice. Once directed to consider a matter, it would be for the panel to reach conclusions and offer advice. After it had made its proposal, it would be entirely a matter for the Court of Appeal to decide whether to produce or revise guidelines. It would not be under direction to do so. The Court of Appeal would be able to reject a proposal from the panel, whether or not it was based on a direction from the Home Secretary. The Lord Chief Justice is also content that these provisions will not affect the independence of the judiciary. Indeed, the power may be positively helpful.
<P>
At present, if there is public concern about an offence, the Court of Appeal must wait for an appropriate appeal to come before it before considering issuing guidelines. Under these provisions, the Home Secretary will be able to ensure that the Court of Appeal has advice to consider before it is seized of an appeal. The court will then be able to promulgate guidelines at the next appropriate opportunity. I hope that having been given that explanation the hon. Gentleman will understand the intentions behind the provision and will agree to withdraw his amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I heard what the Minister said and I am grateful for his courteous response. I am reassured by what he said about the Lord Chief Justice too, but I am still not entirely convinced. Once again I have lurking doubt. It is a lurking, lurking doubt in this case. What the Minister has said is all very well: there may be such a gap in the sentencing scenario for particular offences that have come to be of public concern, but we are setting up a sentencing advisory panel. Is it not incumbent on that panel to consider these matters and to make such recommendations?
<P>
Is this not going a stage further? We have the sentencing advisory panel, and the Secretary of State can get involved and give it directions. According to subsection (3):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Panel may at any time, and shall"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I stress that word 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if directed to do so by the Secretary of State, propose to the Court that guidelines be framed or revised under section 75".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If we are setting up a sentencing advisory panel to carry out such a function and to occupy such a place, why not leave it to that panel?
<P>
I do not argue that robustly but I am looking for an explanation of why it is not being left to the panel and why the Secretary of State is being given this indirect link into the sentencing system through the sentencing advisory panel. We thought that it was a new development and we could not let it pass without exploring it a little further. In all the circumstances, particularly bearing in mind the views of the Lord Chief Justice, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): I am not entirely convinced that the clause is necessary. I understand the sentiments behind setting up a sentencing advisory panel, but I fear that it is one more example of potential extra paperwork, bureaucracy and cost. I hope that the Minister can help us on that point.
<P>
The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Lord Chancellor may pay to any member of the Panel such remuneration as he may determine."
<P></font></ul>
Has thought been given to the duration of appointments to the panel? Is a person likely to be appointed for a period of five years, for example, as if often the case with other similar panels? Will there be a guaranteed number of meetings per year? The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, for example, meets automatically for 20 to 40 days a year. Will there be a daily fee and is it likely to be approximately &#163;200 or &#163;300? Some of those who are likely to serve on the panel already receive full-time salaries. The fees for a police officer or a circuit or High Court judge must be different from those of, for example, a magistrate.
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The panel will be able to commission research. Will that lead to problems with money, bureaucracy and paperwork? It is possible to get bogged down, and I do not want that to happen to the panel.
<P>
I would be interested to know who thought of the sentencing advisory panel. I am not against it in principle, but although I do not have a lurking doubt, like that of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, I have a nagging doubt about the need for it. The Magistrates Association currently devises its own guidelines. It probably formulates them through discussion and by taking advice. The Minister will know more about that than me from his experience of sitting on the Bench. I believe that it is open to the Magistrates Association to take advice from whom it thinks fit when setting out guidelines.
<P>
However, the sentencing policy for indictable or either-way offences, which we are considering, is formulated by the Court of Appeal. I am not sure about its current method of doing that. Aramah was a drugs case; there is also a big case on theft in breach of trust. The Court of Appeal is considering the scale of sentences for theft of money in breach of trust.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be interesting to consult the Liberal Democrats, who are not present at this afternoon's debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Their absence is disappointing because their presence contributes greatly to our proceedings. I cannot express to you, Mrs. Michie, how much we miss them.
<P>
The Court of Appeal probably takes soundings, but I am not sure. I am genuinely not wasting time. I do not believe that it receives official advice on sentencing, but perhaps it needs such guidance. I wonder whether the Court of Appeal has said that it would welcome such advice. My only anxieties about the panel are its expense and whether it is necessary, but if the Court of Appeal would welcome it, I shall give it reasonably whole-hearted support.
<P>
I support the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere about representation on the panel. Victims are important, and the Minister gave a helpful reply to that point earlier.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will forgive me for raising general anxieties; he will know how to tackle them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> We have reasonably whole-hearted support, qualified by lurking doubts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Nagging doubts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Nagging doubts. The lurking doubts of the hon. Member for Hertsmere are obviously different.
<P>
We began our consideration of the Bill with clause 1, which provided for establishing a standing advisory council on criminal justice and the penal system. We have covered much ground since then, and I am delighted about it. During the debates in another place, it was suggested that advisory systems were needed. However, the Government argued that there would be duplication if such systems were additional to the advisory panel, which has been carefully slotted into place and has clear responsibilities. At that time, we said that we would discuss the need for advisory systems because there were such strong views on the matter. We agreed with Opposition Members that the deletion of clause 1 was correct, but we also believed that there was a need for advisory systems.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) mentioned informal systems of obtaining advice and speculated about how the Court of Appeal takes its decisions. If he is unable to answer that question, I am sure that I could not give any authoritative information to the Committee on the matter.
<P>
The clause will ensure that advice is given in an open and transparent way. Those who wish to contribute to the thinking of the Court of Appeal when it decides on the guidelines will have the opportunity to do so. They will be able to write to the panel to give their views. The hon. Member for Hertsmere spoke of victims' organisations. They, too, will know where to send their opinions about these matters.
<P>
I ask the hon. Member for Woking to cast aside his nagging doubt and to welcome the creation of a structure for the provision of advice, that will draw on the experience of those who have an interest in the effectiveness of the criminal justice system. It will allow different forms of research to be brought together and presented to the Court of Appeal. The Court will therefore use not only its own experience of considering the cases that have come before it, but will also be able to take wider evidence from the criminal justice system and from the public, in an ordered and sensible way. That evidence will be transmitted through a small group of people, who will develop experience and consistency as they undertake their task.
<P>
I will now turn to the other issues raised by the hon. Member for Woking. The Lord Chancellor will determine the level of remuneration and, in doing so, he will take account of the burdens imposed on those individuals compared to others who undertake tasks in the public sector.
<P>
The Government have not yet decided about the duration of appointments, but we would expect that members of the panel would be appointed for about five years, with the possibility of an extension. That would enable them to build up some experience. I am not announcing that as a decision, but our thinking is on those general lines. We would expect the members to receive a fee.
<P>
The panel will decide about the number of meetings, depending on how many guidelines it produces and the amount of business that is stimulated, whether at the request of the Home Secretary or through other means of triggering consideration.
[Mr. Michael]
<P>
I hope that I have said enough to persuade the hon. Member for Woking that the decisions will be in good hands. The clause is part of a sensible and coherent approach for the achievement of effective guidelines to give greater consistency in the judicial system.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 220, in page 76, line 24, leave out "or a prison".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 221, in page 76, line 25, leave out "or (c).".

No. 222, in page 76, line 42, leave out from "applies" to end of line 44.

No. 223, in page 77, line 16, leave out "or prison".
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We come to the subject of the remand of 15 and 16-year-olds to prisons and the associated subject of local authority secure accommodation that were touched upon this morning.
<P>
The Committee will be pleased to learn that this is not an issue about which I have a lurking or nagging doubt, or any doubt at all. It is beyond doubt that the Government have been guilty of a breach of promise. I am sorry to introduce a discordant note into the Committee, but the history of the subject shows that that is the only conclusion that anyone can reasonably reach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister may want to save his ammunition for later, but I shall give way now.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I was going to suggest to the hon. Gentleman that he consider the evidence that he has already received and think about his use of the word "reasonably". He is wrong. If he wants to engage in battle, he will be unwise. However, I shall be happy for him to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Let us hear the evidence first. I acquit the Minister of responsibility, because I know his views on the matter. He is being forced to see through a breach of promise against his better nature and his better judgment. However, I hope that he and Labour Members will listen to the evidence and that they are interested in the welfare of the 16-year-olds in adult prisons. If they want to contradict any of the facts that I shall assert most of them come from Government written answers I shall be happy to listen to them.
<P>
The provision relates to 15 and 16-year-olds who courts decide need to be held in secure conditions. At present, they are held in secure conditions in a number of different settings. Clause 90 would allow 15 and 16-year-olds to continue to be remanded to adult prisons subject to screening for physical or emotional immaturity or a propensity to self-harm. The amendments would prevent the continuation of such remand.
<P>
It is reasonable to point out that many people have commented that the remand of 15 and 16-year-old boys to adult prisons is a practice that should be ended. In 1991, the previous Government committed themselves to ending the practice and the Criminal Justice Act 1991 created the legislative framework to do that. In order to fulfil that objective, alternative provision was needed for 15 and 16-year-old boys so that they could be held in secure conditions other than in adult prisons. Therefore, the previous Government committed themselves to an expansion of local authority secure accommodation with places for an additional 170 young people. That programme was undertaken in 1991.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I know what the Minister is going to say, and I shall come to the figures shortly. The Minister may be wise to hear the rest of my speech before he intervenes. I shall give way later.
<P>
During the previous Parliament, the then Labour Opposition criticised the length of time that it took to provide alternative places. No less a person than the present Prime Minister, when he was shadow Home Secretary, made that criticism and called for more local authority secure accommodation. At that time, the Labour party's submission to the inquiry of the Select Committee on Home Affairs on juvenile offending described the remand of 15 and 16-year-olds to adult prisons as a scandal. The Labour party in opposition claimed that the cash to provide the additional places needed to make up the immediate shortfall had not been forthcoming in the two years since the Home Secretary's announcement in February 1991 that places would be provided to end the scandal of young people being held in adult prison accommodation. It said that the Government had not yet enacted the provisions of the 1991 Act to allow 15 and 16-year-olds to be remanded by the courts to secure accommodation because the places simply did not exist.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Against the background of all that the Labour party said when in opposition, we were somewhat surprised to find that the Government are legislating in the Bill for the continued remand of 15 and 16-year-olds to adult prisons. We note that that is to be subject to a screening for vulnerability. That is not a sufficient safeguard and certainly is not foolproof. Those I have spoken to in the Prison Service tell me that it is difficult to predict how 15 and 16-year-olds will react to custody in prison. That is borne out by the statistics provided in written answers about 15 and 16-year-olds who have been involved in incidents of self-harm. Only in a minority of cases where self-harm has taken place has the young person been assessed as being at risk.
<P>
It is also true that 15 and 16-year-olds are generally held within separate accommodation in adult prisons, but it is simply not desirable for them to be held in such conditions at all. They are held within the culture and setting of an adult prison in a variety of prisons up and down the country: new prisons such as Doncaster and Parc and older prisons such as Hull. In Hull prison for example, 15 and 16-year-olds are kept in the oldest part of the prison in accommodation designed for Victorian prisoners.
<P>
I have visited Hull prison and I pay tribute to the staff there and the work that they have done with those young people, their feelings about them being in the prison and the lengths that they go to look after them. It is fair to say that the staff at every level would be the first to admit that prison was the wrong place for 15 and 16-year-old boys. That is the practice which the clause will allow to continue and the amendment is designed to prevent.
<P>
The Government say that they want to end prison remands for 15 and 16-year-olds as soon as is practicable. However, their record on the provision of the alternative places which are needed in local authority secure accommodation does not inspire great confidence. We touched on that this morning. The previous Government promised 170 new places in local authority secure accommodation: 160 are now available. That is some time after they were first promised. They are now available and I understand that the remaining 10 places will become available later this summer.
<P>
We learnt this morning that, after all that they said about local authority secure accommodation in the course of the previous Parliament and the weight they placed on it as the alternative to sending 15 and 16-year-olds to adult prisons, the Government have provided just six new places in two settings: one in Oxfordshire and one on Merseyside. That information is set out in answers provided to me by the Government. I shall give way to the Minister if he wants to do better than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am happy to respond to the hon. Gentleman. The original promise was 171. It was revised to 170 as a result of painstaking research by the then Ministers. That figure is well out of date as a result of trends under the previous Government. The hon. gentleman should not mock the provision that has been made by this Government. We have brought a number of places on stream, including an additional six over and above those allowed by the previous Government. They made their original promise in 1991. Nearly eight years pass before we reach the numbers that they provided for without any allowance being made for the increase in needs in the interim. What happened to that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I can understand that if the Government are providing only six places, every one will be argued about. The difference between 171 and 170 would be very significant given that Government record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am pointing out to the hon. Gentleman something that he does not seem to understand: it was the Conservative Government who made changes of one, here and there. I repeat that this Government are not making six additional places available; they are making available six places more than were allowed for in the plans of the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is all very well and good. The Government knew precisely, when they were in opposition, that the figure provided by the then Government was 170, revised down from 171. They knew that all along because it was announced in 1991. As the Minister will remember, his colleague, the Prime Minister, made a great song and dance about the matter on the Floor of the House of Commons, and criticised the then Government, fairly or unfairly, for the length of time they were taking to provide the 170 places. The Labour party made it clear in the document from which I have quoted that it would provide extra secure accommodation, in addition to the places that were already being provided, to make up for what it perceived as a shortfall.
<P>
Against the background of the 170 places provided by the previous Government, the six places provided by the present Government who regarded the matter as so important in opposition are rather surprising. I do not know why they will not provide more places. A large number would not be needed. The number of 15 and 16-year-olds held in adult prisons is in the low hundreds. It would not need a vast effort by the Government to provide the necessary places.
<P>
Interestingly, many of the young people concerned are on remand, the court having decided that they need to be held in secure conditions. Eventually, many of them are, according to figures provided to me in written answers, found not guilty, or given non-custodial sentences. However, they go through the initial experience of an adult prison.
<P>
That is not good enough. The Labour party, having criticised the previous Government for doing too little and taking too long about it, and having made such a highlight of the issue, is doing much less, on any view, now that it is in government. Our argument about a broken promise is sustained by the figures. I look to the Minister to tell us this afternoon that the Government will put more effort into providing secure accommodation the need for which is widely recognised and improve on the pitiful record of six new places, which is all that they plan for. They have no defence against the charge of breaking a promise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The clause troubles me. It means, I think, that 15 and 16-year-olds can be remanded into adult prisons. It can be argued that that is wrong in principle, and that in such conditions young boys, which is what they are, can be subject to bullying, self-harm, suicide and depression not to mention the fact that the surroundings confirm, rather than divert from, criminal behaviour. Certainty that 15 and 16-year-olds would be kept in an area that was utterly separate from the mainstream prison might provide some relief. I suspect that the real problem, faced by the previous and present Governments, is lack of resources to provide appropriate secure places for youngsters.
<P>
I recently read an article in the Daily Mail by James Clark, the home affairs reporter. The Committee may be interested because it dealt with youngsters granted bail[Mr. Malins]
by the courts who subsequently committed crimes while they were on bail. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"One in four defendants granted bail by the courts committed crimes while free, it emerged yesterday. For juveniles, the proportion was one in three, according to the latest Home Office research. While many of the offences committed by the adults involved drugs, the youngsters turned mainly to vehicle crime and shoplifting."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Now we come to the interesting part:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The figures show that 42 per cent. of male offenders aged 14 or under who cannot be remanded to be held in secure accommodation carried out more crimes while on bail. Of those youngsters who were bailed into local authority care, 58 per cent. committed offences while the proportion for those who were allowed to return to their own homes was 38 per cent."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not know whether all the figures are accurate but they show that it is possible to be hammered both ways. Much crime is doubtless committed by those released on bail, yet the contrary argument is that there should be a strong presumption in favour of bail. I quote those figures for the Committee but the Minister already knows about them because the article continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Criminal Policy Minister Alun Michael said the Government was `determined to confront' the problem".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman knows about them as well as I do. It is difficult because part of me accepts the force of the article but I am not happy at the prospect of 15 and 16-year-olds being chucked in with hard-line, grown-up criminals. I am sure that the Minister recognises the dilemma as well, and I hope that he will reassure me that that is not what he wants.
<P>
That is one important side of my argument. The contrary side is, as I have said, that a great deal of crime is committed by people out on bail. We have had time in Committee to focus our attention on young people committing crime, and a variety of views has been expressed about how best to deal with the problems. I am sure that the Committee could unite in the general hope that, as far as practicable, 15 and 16-year-olds should be kept entirely separate from and preferably in a different building from the mainstream criminal fraternity.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I read recently about an American scheme that intentionally put 15 and 16-year-olds not just in adult prisons but in the toughest adult prisons. The thinking behind it was to shock the youngsters at an early stage of their offending behaviour about the likely end-result if that behaviour continued. The idea was that our system of gradually escalating justice the system enjoyed by us and by the American was not working.
<P>
We previously debated the circumstances in which a young offender might commit offences, be cautioned or repeat cautioned, be fined and, far down the track, end up in some sort of secure accommodation. If such a young offender had been confronted early on with the end-result of his behaviour, it might have had a salutary effect. I am not saying that that is a good idea but I raise the matter because everyone in Committee seems to assume I largely share the view that it is wrong for 15 and 16-year-olds to be put in adult prisons.
<P>
As we are debating it now, has the Minister done any research on the issue? It would be useful to have more specific information from the Minister, who has the benefit of advice from officials, about the offending behaviour and likely reoffending behaviour of 15 and 16-year-olds. Would they be less likely to reoffend if they were kept for a time in an adult prison? What would be the extent of their contact with older prisoners? The instant judgment is that it would be disastrous because the young offenders would learn the ways of criminals, but I would be interested to hear whether the Minister has any views on the subject.
<P>
I should also like to explore with the Minister the question of the famous six it is no longer the famous five but the famous six. We could have an interesting and amusing debate about that. Given the rhetoric of the Labour party in the previous Parliament, it would be surprising if we were not to make much of the miserable figure of six places.
<P>
Those of us who take an interest in criminal justice know that the Home Secretary and the Minister are not free agents, and have a monthly battle with the Treasury to fulfil their objectives.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Woking said that society pays the price for young offenders who shoplift and steal vehicles while on bail. However, in an ideal world in which the Home Secretary could do what he wanted and in which he could provide the accommodation that he wishes to provide, how many places would be needed? What is the Government's programme for achieving that objective?
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): We are disappointed that the Government missed the opportunity to end the remanding of 15 and 16-year-olds to Prison Service accommodation in the Bill. Do the Government intend to follow up the chief inspector's thematic review, in which he recommended that 18-year-olds should be taken out of the prison establishment altogether?
<P>
I turn to the provision of extra places. There is a secure remand centre in my constituency. I do not wish to break up our alliance with the Conservatives in opposing the Government on this matter, but resistance to the building of that institution was led by Conservative councillors, who adopted a NIMBY attitude.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Liberal Democrats never do that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> No, never. In Hallam we stuck our necks out and we were roasted for saying that secure accommodation was needed. Our opponents may say that that is a rare exception to the NIMBY rule which is frequently adopted.
<P>
We need public acceptance for the building of secure accommodation, as well as Government resources. In Hallam fears were whipped up that youngsters would maraud through the countryside as a result of the building of the very type of institution that is needed to stop them doing that. How do the Government intend to overcome such problems, which will occur wherever the necessary accommodation is built?
<P>
We hope that local authority remand accommodation will be built. Will the Government give a clear indication that they will do all that they can to minimise the use of Prison Service accommodation for 15 and 16-year-olds, even if the power to use that accommodation remains in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall clarify what the Bill does. It breaks the logjam that has been in existence for more than seven years. In the years leading up to the debates on what was to become the Criminal Justice Act 1991, some of us drew attention to the scandalous remand of 15 and 16-year-old youngsters into adult prison accommodation. I repeat that that is a long-standing scandal.
<P>
Another scandal was the remand of young offenders to inappropriate and insecure local authority accommodation, where they disrupted the lives of vulnerable youngsters. Those offenders would often return to the community to commit many other offences. The previous Government made no attempt during its 18 years in power to address that problem.
<P>
In 1991 the Conservative Government listened to comments made by children's organisations, penal reformers and Opposition Members. On 15 February 1991, when the Criminal Justice Bill was being debated in Committee, the then Minister, John Patten, now Lord Patten, promised me that places would be provided. He said that an amendment would be introduced on Report to end the holding of 15 and 16-year-olds in prison accommodation.
<P>
However, the amendment was an all-or-nothing provision. The holding of 15 and 16-year-olds would either have ended, root and branch, or it would have continued. The practice could not have partly ended the aspiration of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) is one that is shared by the Government. Under the amendment, we could not have moved towards that aspiration.
<P>
The amendment was a useless gesture and each year, on the anniversary of the promise given to me, I asked questions about how far the Government had gone towards meeting their promise. For a number of years, the answer was that they had done absolutely nothing. The promise had been made by Home Office Ministers, but they had not discussed the matter with their colleagues at the Department of Health, who were responsible for the provision of secure places. Nothing happened. We had a clause that was absolutely useless.
<P>
I should like to correct the misapprehension of the hon. Member for Hallam and of other hon. Members that the Bill does not move matters forward. It does. It breaks the logjam by creating a situation in which vulnerable 15 or 16-year-olds, or vulnerable young women, can progressively be taken out of adult prison accommodation as places become available. That is a step forward.
<P>
In 1991, the previous Government found that about 171 places were necessary to meet the requirement for secure places. Through a curious calculation, they rounded that figure down to 170. That is why I was amused when the hon. Member for Hertsmere said that a change of one is not significant, but that a change of six is significant. Those six places are in addition to the places for which financial provision had been made before the general election.
<P>
The requiremnt for places has risen considerably, and in response to the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), I should like to point out that there has been some variation in the numbers required. On some occasions about 250 or 260 places were required; on other occasions as many as 300 youngsters were held in prison accommodation. That is a much higher number of places than was provided by the previous Government. They calculated that the number was 171; they eventually put matters in train a considerable time after the promise had been made and then went to sleep. The previous Government did not check whether the number of places provided would enable the implementation of the requirements of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. It was clearly not sufficient to do so.
<P>
When we came into office, we considered how we might improve matters. One way was by moving progressively, to ensure that the more vulnerable youngsters have the first priority to be taken out of prison accommodation, and to give courts the discretion not to place them in such accommodation in future.
<P>
A second improvement was to re-order the secure estate. We considered the best use of places, not only in local authority accommodation, but in youth offender institutions and a variety of other institutions. The importance of changes to the regimes in such institutions should not be underestimated. The Minister with responsibility for prisons, my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Ms Quin) has paid considerable attention to that matter. We want provisions that are effective, flexible and appropriate to the age and development of the youngsters.
<P>
The Government want to ensure that if youngsters have to be held in secure accommodation, in their interests and in those of the wider public they should be held under the most appropriate arrangements. Our proposals must be viewed in the round. We support earlier, more effective intervention to reduce the use of secure accommodation for juveniles, not simply by reducing numbers but by reducing serious offending through nipping things in the bud. That would remove the need for placing young people in secure accommodation. However, that aim cannot be achieved overnight. It requires measures, procedures and orders. We must tackle reparation, and ensure that offenders are confronted earlier with the consequences of their behaviour for their victims and for the wider community, and that they are offered ways out of offending behaviour, which is likely to ruin their lives as well as those of others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Have the Governmnt carried out modelling on the impact of other changes in the Bill on the future requirements for secure places for youngsters? When the previous Government introduced the Crime (Sentences) Bill, they provided wonderful figures to show how the measure would reduce the prison population. Have the Government undertaken similar research?

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The youth justice task force is carrying on with its work, and we look to the youth justice board to continue it. That is one reason for bringing forward its establishment. Provided that the House of Commons agrees, and that the Bill receives Royal Assent, the youth justice board will begin that work in the autumn.[Mr. Michael]
If I tried to respond more fully to the question of the hon. Member for Hallam, I would provide only imprecise figures. I accept his point: each measure must affect the offending behaviour of young people, and reduce the numbers who reach the stage of being placed in secure accommodation. That is our aspiration. The Bill introduces a measure of flexibility that will allow intervention to be targeted to achieve that. However, all members of the Committee know that, on some occasions, the use of secure accommodation is necessary for the young person's protection, and to protect the public from serious harm.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere seemed to castigate the Government for the failure to tackle crime properly in the past 18 years, and the problem of secure places. He suggested that we should have dealt with that in our first few months in office. Such cheek is breathtaking. We are tackling those issues and developing effective youth justice policies, which will deal with the sort of young offender that we have been discussing. The hon. Gentleman's call for speedier action and an end to the holding of 15 and 16-year-olds in prison is as meaningless as a particular section in the 1991 Act that achieved no results.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will the Minister share with the Committee his estimate of when the practice of placing 15 and 16-year-olds in adult prisons will end? He must have a timetable in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> No, I will not. It depends on several factors, including the speed with which we are able to implement the more flexible system of disposals, and the speed with which the youth justice board is able to do its work. It also depends on how quickly we are able to intervene in the behaviour of youngsters for whom secure disposal and remand is needed. The number of those youngsters is growing. After a general election, it takes time to turn things around.
<P>
My colleagues, those who work in the youth justice system and I will take responsibility for making sure that we have a clear target of reducing offending and reoffending by youngsters, and of making the system workable by intervening and getting youngsters to court more quickly. When it is necessary to intervene in a youngster's life by sentencing him to secure accommodation, we shall do so more quickly and not allow him to continue offending. The hon. Gentleman made the point about youngsters continuing to commit offences while on bail. We do them no favours by allowing them to do that.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The provisions in the Bill to avoid delays in sentencing and the House of Lords decision on R v. Khan are all relevant. They are part of a big picture that shows how we approach the need to reform the youth justice system. We shall allow appropriate action at the appropriate time, and it will be much more speedy. That will help to stop youngsters from becoming involved in offending, and it will nip things in the bud if they start to offend.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking was absent from the House of Commons during the terminal decline of the previous Government. However, he was here in 1991 when a Home Office Minister offered to deal with such issues, but then failed to will the means. I accept the hon. Gentleman's concern, which is shared by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, that we should not put 15 and 16-year-olds in prison accommodation, and that we should move to the position where we do not need to do that.
<P>
That aim can be achieved in a variety of ways. It can be achieved partly by the provision of additional secure places. Conservatives Members may mock, but this Government's provision in very short order of an additional six places over and above those already planned is a small, but significant contribution.
<P>
Other contributions can be made by reducing the need to send youngsters into secure accommodation. That can be done by early intervention and by making more effective the way in which we deal with the needs of young people. On some occasions they have to be dealt with by punishment and on others by clear warnings, intervention or by dealing with their education or employment problems. Those measures are tied together and need to be dealt with comprehensively. However, turning off the taps and taking the plug out are both ways of reducing the amount of water in the bath. We first have to deal with the rising level of water in the bath before we can achieve the outcome that we all want.
<P>
The hon Member for Gainsborough made serious points about the dangers of what he described as gradually escalating justice. I agree with some of the points that he made. Youngsters sometimes reach the point of being held securely rather too late for it to do any good. I have worked with young offenders who came out of the old detention regime and with ex-prisoners who have worked as volunteers. When such people come out of secure accommodation, they realise the damage that has been done to their families and that they have an opportunity that they can grasp. Seizing their motivation at that point may mean that their experience inside a secure unit can lead to positive developments in future. The regime inside needs to be appropriate and it must prepare for a seamless way of dealing with them when they come out. The new system of orders will help us to achieve that.
<P>
We must consider new ways of confronting youngsters with their behaviour and examine what works. We do not want to introduce elements that shock just for the sake of it. However, when such measures are successful in making youngsters think about their behaviour, they need to be taken on board. For example, not long ago, I saw primary school children in Holland confronted with a prisoner. He was an ex-drug offender who spoke about how his life had been ruined by a series of choices that he made. He told the youngsters that they had an opportunity to avoid going down the same path. There is more than one way of discouraging youngsters from a life of crime.
<P>
We will take no lessons from the Conservative party. I congratulate the hon. Member for Hertsmere on trying to defend the previous Government's awful record. He has demonstrated his loyalty and it would be sensible if he now withdrew quietly from the field and stopped trying to sustain the unsustainable as he did at the start of this debate. We had expected some praise for making good use of the available places, for seeking to improve regimes in youth offenders' institutions and for accelerating the programme that we inherited from the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister has dealt with the question of how many places are needed in a roundabout way. I should like to tie him down more precisely. Assuming the resources were available from the Treasury to the Home Office, how many places are needed right now? He has provided six; how many more would he like to provide?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman did not quite understand what I said earlier. The number held in prison accommodation has varied over the past few years. We are carefully monitoring how disposals arise, but we are talking about anything between 250 and 300 on most occasions, though it has gone higher or lower at different times. The key question is how we can arrange approprate disposals, including remands, of youngsters in this age group as a result of the more flexible systems that we want to introduce through the Bill and through intervention to reduce numbers over time.
<P>
Stating that we have a target would be to accept that the numbers will either remain stable or continue to increase. However, we are introducing a paradigm shift in dealing with youth offending, which includes appropriate disposals to secure accommodation of youngsters when needed but which is part of a continuum.
<P>
As I have already said, the previous Government made a commitment to end prison remands, but the legislation that they produced was defective. We are now introducing legislation that moves towards that commitment of 1991 but, in the short term, we are taking practical steps by moving vulnerable young people out of prison accommodation and moving forward progressively. How soon can we move 15 and 16-year-olds out of adult prison accommodation? The answer is as quickly as possible. Demand from that group would significantly outstrip the capacity of local authority secure estate, even when the present building programme has been completed. Our policy is to make the most effective use of the planned accommodation that we inherited and to give the courts the range of remand power they need.
<P>
The Bill will give the courts the power to remand 12 to 14-year-olds, 15 and 16-year-old girls and vulnerable 15 and 16-year-old boys directly to local authority secure accommodation if a place has been identified in advance. Existing arrangements for the remaining 15 and 16-year-olds will continue for the time being, but we wish to move to a position whereby the practice of prison remands for such boys is no longer necessary. That is our objective. We are tackling a problem that has been neglected for more than a decade and we have every intention of continuing to tackle it progressively.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere acknowledged that my record of interest in and concern with these issues goes back long before I entered Parliament. Over the past few months, we have discussed problems with organisations such as the Children's Society and we share the concerns expressed by the right hon. Member for Fareham (Sir P. Lloyd), whom I met recently.
<P>
Our main purpose here is to replace the inflexible provision in the 1991 Act which required an all-or-nothing approach with something that will work. The amendment is a wrecking amendment. It would be like the provisions of the 1991 Act on the statute book but incapable of being implemented. Instead, we are offering a grown-up approach establishing the practical steps that need to be taken over time to implement a principle that cannot be acted on overnight.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a good debate and I congratulate the Minister on a fair response and on putting his case as high as he could in all the circumstances. There still remains a great deal to be desired. [Interruption.] There has never been a lurking doubt about this. The Government have failed to honour an implied commitment that they gave. My conviction remains as firm now as it did before the debate.
<P>
We need to remember that we are talking about 15 and 16-year-old boys. Sadly, such boys sometimes need to be held in secure accommodation because they cannot safely be admitted to bail. The issue at stake is which secure conditions they should be held in. They can be held in local authority secure accommodation; they can be held in remand centres which have not been mentioned so far, except by the hon. Member for Hallam. I think he was confusing remand centres with local authority secure accommodation. I suggest that local authority secure accommodation is better than remand centres.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Just to clarify the point I was referring to a local authority secure accommodation facility which was specifically set up to take youngsters on remand, rather than a remand centre as such.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. I think he referred earlier to a remand centre but I take it that he meant local authority secure accommodation. I can set his mind at rest a little. Of the list of places where local authority secure accommodation has been provided with extra places from the 170 place plan, at least one is an existing site. In many, if not most of those cases, I suspect the local authority secure accommodation has simply been built onto existing accommodation. It is not a question of providing entirely new accommodation.
<P>
I cannot give an authoritative verdict but I can assist my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough who asked how many places would be needed. That is an interesting point. The Minister was quite right in his general remarks about this. According to latest answer that I was given by the Home Office in January, 75 15-year-olds and 173 16-year-old boys are held in adult prisons, making a total of 248. We are not talking about thousands of young people and thousands of extra places needed to hold them. We are talking about a figure in the low hundreds which may have varied upwards or downwards. They are held in remand centres, local authority secure accommodation or adult prisons.
<P>
Remand centres such as Feltham, where a number of 15 and 16-year-olds are held, are not always ideal, but[Mr. Clappison]
we are not not talking about them. We are talking about the 15 and 16-year-olds who are held in adult prisons such as those in Cardiff, Chelmsford, Doncaster, Dorchester, Exeter, Gloucester and Hull in different types of prison accommodation, but it is prison accommodation for adult prisoners.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Woking talked about these youngsters being held in separate accommodation. The Minister did not mention that but that is generally the case and he could have made the point had he wanted to. They are usually held in these adult prisons in a wing on their own. The important point is that it is accommodation within an adult prison and within the culture and setting of an adult prison. The prison officers who work with them will rotate between working with adults and these young people. To be fair to the prison officers to whom I have spoken when I have visited, they are usually the first to say that 15 and 16-year-olds should not be kept in such accommodation. Some of those in Hull felt so strongly about the matter that they had gone down the road to look at the local authority secure accommodation, at a place called, I think, Sutton house. They thought that it was a far better place at which to hold 15 and 16-year-olds. Sadly, not enough places were available, so young people of that age continue to be held in Hull prison, which is not the best way to rehabilitate them.
<P>

</P>
<P>
An adult prison cannot be as well equipped as local authority secure accommodation, not just for holding young offenders in secure conditions but for dealing with their problems and trying to rehabilitate them. We agree that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"When juveniles do need to be detained the secure accommodation system has advantages over any new order proposed by the Government. It offers flexibility since it can be used for a variety of offenders, both sentences and on remand. It is designed as a local provision, and when adequately resourced will not result in young people being removed to institutions miles from their home, as is likely under the Government's proposals. In addition the educational provision is likely to be higher in secure units which form part of much larger complexes."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those sensible views were all put forward in the Labour party submission to the 1993 Home Affairs Select Committee report. The party went on to castigate the then Government, not for enacting the 1991 legislation but for failing to bring about its objective. The submission stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Government has not yet enacted the provisions of the 1991 Act to allow 15 and 16-year-olds to be remanded by the courts to secure accommodation because the places simply do not exist."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The then Opposition's view throughout the relevant period was that secure local authority accommodation was needed as an alternative. I shall not repeat the arguments. We are surprised that it simply has not been provided by the Government.
<P>
In many ways the most alarming aspect of the issue is not that 15 and 16-year-olds will continue to be remanded to prison accommodation, which is the reality the way is being paved for continuing that, not ending it, with the bolt-on extra of screening for vulnerability. It will happen for many years, at the present rate of progress, in providing local authority secure accommodation. That is bad enough, but something else is more alarming.
<P>
When in opposition, the Labour party set great store by the issue; it campaigned at the highest levels and made promises about it. It does not require many extra resources to put right as we have said, the number of places needed is in the low hundreds but the Government have not been prepared to stump up the cash. We think that that bodes ill for all the Government's other fine intentions and promises about how they will tackle crime. A previously high priority has been shot down because of a shortage of resources. We cannot let the matter pass without registering our discontent about the Government's approach to the issue, and setting an example. We shall press the matter to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 212, in page 77, line 40, at end add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(8) The Secretary of State shall each year following the coming into effect of this Act report to Parliament on the accommodation of 
<P>
(a) children and young persons aged under 17 years on remand and commital, and
<P>
(b) young offenders aged under 17 years,
<P>
held in secure conditions whether in local authority secure accommodation, remand centre, young offender institution, prison or otherwise.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Without going over old ground, and given the Government's statements about their intention to end the remands, I hope that they will agree that the Secretary of State should make an annual report to Parliament on the accommodation of offenders aged under 17, and on children and young persons held on remand and committal. That will give hon. Members an idea of how well the Government are dealing with these matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The amendment is sensible. It would ensure that hon. Members had some feedback and we would not have to ask questions continually about these matters. We would have a thorough report, rather than having to bash away as the Minister did when he was in opposition to try to extract facts and figures.
<P>
Turning to the clause stand part debate, will the Minister give the Committee his views on the recommendations of the chief inspector of prisons in his thematic report on young prisoners? The chief inspector recommended that an independent chief inspector should be appointed to monitor the treatment of children throughout the youth justice system, and that the Prison Service should relinquish responsibility for all children under the age of 18.
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members hope that the clause is only a holding position and that the Government will go further along the lines suggested by the chief inspector. A formal system should be set up that will have responsibility for all the prisons that hold under 18-year-olds, for all the remand centres and for all the local authority secure accommodation. There should be a co-ordinated system, with a single responsible person, rather than a disparate set of people who operate different regimes in different areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I should let my heart soften so that the hon. Member for Hallam will not have to do the hard work of remembering to ask questions each year. I should also let the amendment pass so that we could enjoy the embarrassment of the Conservative spokesman whoever that might be in a few years' time as he saw the Government's success in tackling problems. However, there are already enough arrangements to deal with these issues of reporting.
<P>
It is right that appropriate information about the holding of children and young persons in secure conditions should be readily available to Parliament and the public. However, it is not appropriate to include provisions on such matters in the Bill. Incidentally, when such provisions were proposed by the Labour Opposition, the previous Government did not accept them either. Some things do not change.
<P>
The youth justice board will be in place from October 1998. Under clause 38(5), it will monitor the performance and operation of the whole youth justice system, including the provision of secure accommodation for juveniles. The board will also help to draw up national standards for such accommodation and the regimes provided there. It will monitor the extent to which the standards are met.
<P>
The Government are introducing radical changes, and that was not made sufficiently clear in our earlier debate. The board will be able to report to the Secretary of State at any time and, under paragraph (8) of schedule 2, will be required to submit an annual report to the Secretary of State on the discharge of its functions. The report will be laid before Parliament and published. Through that report the board will be able to draw the attention of the Home Secretary and Parliament to issues relating to the provision and standard of juvenile secure accommodation. Such oversight is an important part of our package of measures.
<P>
The Prison Service already publishes an annual report on its work, which routinely comments on prisoner conditions and regimes. It includes comprehensive information on the performance of establishments holding juveniles and relates that to the Prison Service's key performance indicators.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam referred to the report of Her Majesty's inspectorate of prisons and to the thematic report on young prisoners. That reviewed the conditions for the treatment of young prisoners aged between 15 and 21 held in Prison Service accommodation. We take that report seriously and I referred earlier to the work that my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office with responsibility for prisons has done to improve conditions and to respond to the points made in the report.
<P>
The Department of Health publishes annual statistics on local authority secure units, including details on age, gender and the length of stay. The reports that I have mentioned do not cover the factual information that Ministers provide in response to questions. Therefore, it would be redundant to include a further element of annual reporting in the Bill.
<P>
We are introducing a system that will provide greater scrutiny of the way in which young people are dealt with. It will provide not only statistics, but information on the regimes, the quality of supervision and the opportunities that youngsters are given.
<P>
We do not like having 15 and 16-year-old boys on remand in prison. I am confident that we are tackling the issue when the previous Government put in place legislation that not only failed to tackle the issue, but prevented us from tackling the problems progressively as we go on. It is part of the job description of an Opposition spokesman to be cynical about a Government's intentions, but I assure Conservative Members that it is our intention to tackle the problem of the holding of 15 and 16-year-olds in adult prisons. The Bill will give us the vehicle to do that. It is not an obstacle and does not renege on the undertakings that we called for and that were given in the 1991 Act. The Bill moves forward from seven years of failure to meet commitments progressively over a period.
<P>
We are working to end the practice of remand for 15 and 16-year-olds in adults' prisons as soon as possible. In the meantime, however, we must have arrangements that will deal with those boys who, for their own good and that of public, need to be remanded to secure accommodation in the Prison Service. The clause makes allowance for that while introducing procedural requirements and other safeguards, including the definition of vulnerability.
<P>
It is important that any available space in local authority secure accommodation is used to best effect. When there is not sufficient space for all the youngsters in the age group, it should be used only by the most vulnerable of them.
<P>
The definition of vulnerability that we have used is based on a young person's physical or emotional immaturity or on his propensity to harm himself. The issue of self-harm was very much the trigger for most of the concerns about 15 and 16-year-olds that have been raised since the late 1980s and early 1990s. The court will apply the definition to those cases that meet the secure remand criteria and where a place has been identified in advance by the local authority. The inclusion of vulnerable 15 and 16-year-old boys within the court order remand category will provide a useful safeguard in existing circumstances.
<P>
I commend the clause to the Committee. We shall make progress if we allow it to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister's response and I was not entirely surprised by parts of it. Whether or not there are annual reports, we will be watching the Government's performance closely. We will have no hesitation about asking questions and holding the Government to account. We will watch what happens in the months and years to come. However, we covered the ground thoroughly in the earlier debate, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
