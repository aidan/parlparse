<H4><center>Meaning of ``worker'', ``employee'' etc</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry):</B> I have a sense that some debates of substance are yet to come. I do not, therefore, want to detain the Committee on comparatively minor matters, particularly those that we have rehearsed on earlier clauses. I have, however, already warned the Committee that Conservative Members are concerned--as I think the Minister is--that we should get the definitions absolutely right.
<P>
I want to hold the Committee up for a second on the clause, which extends the concept of an employee to include, for example, home workers and agency workers. It also retrospectively extends the period of employment. A person's employment may have ceased in the context of a dispute with his employer or simply because he has moved on to something else.
<P>
Under subsection (1), a person may still be deemed to be an employee
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where the employment has ceased''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That the provision is not objectionable in principle. It is clearly right that the Bill should operate fairly. People should be paid fairly and get the right amounts for the relevant pay reference periods, even if those have ended. That may mean going back beyond the end of the contract of employment to consider what happened in the past.
<P>
That situation would materially affect matters in two ways. First, will the Minister say a word or two about the relationship between the provisions and the Employment Rights Act 1996, which he is fond of citing? It would be fair to say that that was a reasonably constructive piece of legislation by the Conservative Government, which consolidates and codifies general practice. The present provisions probably go a little further. Will the Minister say why?
<P>
Secondly, I have a slight concern about the way in which the provision will work in practice. We are all more or less familiar with the fact that a complaint to an industrial tribunal--or employment tribunal as we must begin to call it--should be made within three months of the dispute arising. Usually, but not always, the claim will be for unfair dismissal. That is, however, not the only procedure available under the Bill; there is also the possibility of recourse to the civil courts.
<P>
As I understand it, the clause would take the ex-employer's liability back as far as the employment tribunal could strike, which would mean three months, although that period could be extended if there was good reason to do so. The employee could, for example, have been taken ill or have had to leave the country unaccountably. There might even be good reasons for believing that he did not know about his rights. That is a matter for the tribunal, and I have no complaint about that in principle.
<P>
In relation to the courts, and as I understand the usual statute of limitations, one could go back six years. We raised that matter earlier, but I am not sure that we got a satisfactory answer. I would have to check my wages book just to work out who I employed six years ago. If I had employed somebody then, however, the issue would not be alleged unfair dismissal, but the failure to pay the national minimum wage, expressed on an hourly rate, for the appropriate pay reference period. That will have a bearing on the need for employers to keep records for that period, records which are bound to suffer attrition and natural wear and tear and may not be readily available. In accountancy terms, employers--I am thinking not so much of small farm businesses or shops, but of medium-sized engineering firms with significant labour turnover--will have to account further back for what the insurance industry would call their long tail liabilities
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): The Chair may have noticed that I am somewhat preoccupied by how ``small'' and ``medium sized'' are defined. My hon. Friend was referring to a business that might be thought of as medium sized. Will he refresh my memory by telling me what he thinks is medium sized?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a frightfully helpful question: I have a feeling that one should not respond too avidly to temptation from one's Whip, however eloquent he might be. To use the phrase that a number of people have used but not always attributed to Clem Attlee, medium sized is what we feel it to be, as the elephant is what we know it to be. We could take a figure of 200 employees as a working definition. One would then expect a modest labour turnover of 10 per cent., or 20 employees, per annum. Those people may have been employed by that firm five or six years ago, and although there will not have been a complete labour turnover, half the labour force will have changed. If people start reopening liabilities going that far back, it will be difficult to keep track of them and to account for them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> My hon. Friend replied helpfully to a question that was not congenial. It was not the easiest question that I have asked him, but it was pertinent and he gave a good answer.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> I am getting so used to the double act that I thought that that was just the starting shot.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey (Eastleigh):</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is asking me to give way, but I have not yet started. I do not know on what point he will intervene, but I am in friendly mode so I will give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Perhaps the frustration is beginning to mount as the Committee proceeds and we are anxious to get on. I want to make a helpful intervention on the Minister before he has even begun. In responding to the comments of the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), will he consider that the existing law on companies' responsibilities to respond to the Inland Revenue in the course of their business would embrace the problems that might arise in relation to individual employees and whether they have been paid the going rate?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right--nothing in the clause is extraordinary or unprecedented. These methods are all tried and tested in statute. However, to clarify the meaning of the clause, especially for discussions that may occur in another place, I will put on record the reasoning behind it.
<P>
The clause aims to reflect the ever increasing complexity in working arrangements. Many are unconventional but that should not equate to being unequal, in this case in having the right to the national minimum wage. The purpose of the proposals is to ensure that however complex or unconventional their working arrangements, people should still be paid the minimum wage.
<P>
The clause defines ``employee'', ``contract of employment'', ``worker'', ``employer'', ``employment'' and ``employed''. With only two exceptions, which I will come to in a moment, those definitions follow previous employment legislation such as the Employment Rights Act 1996, as the hon. Member for Daventry asked me to confirm, and which, as he said, was a consolidating Act. It makes a clear legal distinction between an employee and a worker.
<P>
The term ``employee'' is relatively narrow. In legal terms, it covers people who work under a contract of employment. Such a contract is, in more legal language, a contract of service or of apprenticeship, whether express or implied, and whether oral or written. In practice, most people in work are employed under a contract of employment.
<P>
The term ``worker'' is wider. As well as covering employees who work under a contract of employment, it covers people who work under any other contract. I return to the legal language. The Bill states that the term applies if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the individual undertakes to do or perform personally any work or services for another party to the contract whose status is not by virtue of the contract that of a client or customer of any profession or business undertaking carried on by the individual''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although that is a legal mouthful and neither myself nor the hon. Member for Daventry are lawyers, we should be aware that a simple premise underlies that paragraph. It is intended to provide a wider definition and to cover people who work under contracts that are not contracts of employment, and under which they agree to work or to perform services personally. It does not apply when such people are genuinely in business on their own account--that is to say, when they are genuinely self-employed.
<P>
A plumber who is normally self-employed, for example, could agree to work for one person on a long-term job, without having a contract of employment. If the terms of the contract were in practice decided largely by that person, and the plumber was working only for that person and was not free to work for anyone else during the time involved, the plumber would be likely to have a worker's contract.
<P>
I offer that as an example to help the Committee. Obviously, if a case came to court, it would be treated on its merits, because each case is different. I shall not be tempted to speculate about fictitious cases. The general principle, which I outlined, is that a direct relationship that determines the outcome of work carried out comes under the definition of worker. A totally self-employed person, who has control over the situation, would not come under that definition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green (Ashford):</B> In giving his specific example, the Minister spoke of a long-term contract involving a plumber who is normally self-employed and doing one job that precludes him from doing any other job. Does any guidance exist as to what ``long-term'' means, or will that be decided in the courts on a case-by-case basis?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am quite sure that people will attempt from time to time to redefine these issues. One thing is sure: a method must be established to ensure that the labour market, organisations, companies and individuals are capable of upholding their basic employment rights.
<P>
On Tuesday, the Committee debated the construction industry, and how employees in it will secure entitlement to the national minimum wage. The Committee debated the same principle when discussing home workers and agency workers. The Government's position is clear. Workers will be deemed as workers for the purposes of the minimum wage unless it is proved otherwise, and it can be proved that a person is genuinely self-employed. That is a switch in the burden of proof. It is right to make that switch. It means that if an employer wishes to use self-employment to get round the minimum wage, he or she will have to prove that it is genuine. For the purposes of claiming the minimum wage, a person will be deemed to be an employee unless he or she is shown to be otherwise.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire):</B> The Minister will forgive me if I am slow in keeping up with him this morning. The Committee has debated this point before, but will the Minister remind me to what extent a person who is self-employed, and who has to demonstrate to the enforcement authorities that he or she does not qualify for the national minimum wage, will be able to rely on the fact that they are treated as self-employed for Inland Revenue purposes?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> There may be obvious situations in which that is the case. For the purposes of the Bill, we have made it clear that it has general application. We have changed the burden of proof and widened the definition to ensure that in contractual arrangements--myriad as they are in the labour market--from day one the burden of proof will be on the employer to decide if a person is genuinely self-employed if he is not entitled to the minimum wage. It is important that that change is made. In the labour market, many of the low-paid workers who work in grey areas of employment have no power base to help them determine their ability to claim the minimum wage. The law acts on their behalf in that sense. They are defined as workers from the outset unless they are proved to be genuinely self-employed.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> One of the concerns expressed on these Benches is about the position of the employer who thinks that he is concluding a perfectly reasonable arrangement which he regards as constituting self-employment, or engaging persons who are self-employed. We are anxious that people should not, when they are proceeding with good will, fall foul of the provisions. Is it in the Minister's mind that at least the Employment Service, or whichever body is operating the enforcement procedure, would be able to stand ready to give advice to an employer in advance? I am not talking about removing the legal process but at least that would provide some guidance as to whether an employer who had a particular set of arrangements might, in taking on persons who are genuinely self-employed, come within the terms that the Minister has described.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am absolutely certain that when the Bill is enacted a range of advice will be available to employers and employees, some of it provided by the Government and some by organisations representing employers. I am sure that there will be a queue a mile long of solicitors and special advisers offering their services at various rates of remuneration to ensure that no one wilfully falls foul of the legislation. I am certain that the overwhelming majority of employers will comply with the legislation and that only a small minority will wilfully take steps not to do so. That is why, in other debates, we set out the process concerning someone who wilfully refuses to meet his obligations in law.
<P>
The process is quite simple. With this definition, we are trying to ensure that there is a general application of the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way because he has had many interventions. It is conceivable that for tax purposes, an employee may want to regard himself as self-employed and the employer for his own--possibly nefarious--reasons may want to regard that person as self-employed and not an employee. Is the Minister saying that if both parties to the contract wish it not to be a contract of employment, the law will still make it a contract of employment?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It is quite clear. The tax definition is for tax purposes and the national minimum wage definition is for national minimum wage purposes. The two regimes are entirely separate, and there is nothing unusual about that. This process will ensure that bogus self-employment is not used as a way to prevent low-paid workers in grey areas of employment from claiming their right to a national minimum wage. That has been the position from the outset.
<P>
Genuinely self-employed people are not covered by the legislation, nor would they seek to be. But home workers and agency workers operate in grey areas; in the past and at present they are used in a way that denies them their employment entitlements. We intend that not to happen with the minimum wage. The Bill covers such workers under clauses 31 and 32. This clause takes a belt-and-braces approach to ensure that effectiveness of those clauses so that the complexity of people's employment relationships does not rule them out of entitlement to the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow (Buckingham):</B> I partly understand the Minister's argument, but perhaps I can put a counterpoint to him. I accept that an employer might bogusly classify someone as self-employed, and I accept that an employee might bogusly classify himself as self-employed, but surely the Minister is not arguing that the Inland Revenue would, in classifying someone as self-employed, be making a bogus decision?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No, but the hon. Gentleman's point is not very well made. He must have forgotten our previous discussion in which, to be fair to the Opposition, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) acknowledged that the previous Government and the current one took and continue to take considerable steps through the Inland Revenue and the Contributions Agency to tackle the threat of bogus self-employment and the problems associated with it. Other than the hon. Gentleman, I do not know anyone who would deny the existence of that threat.
<P>
The Bill will ensure that bogus self-employment is not used as a method, sophisticated or otherwise, of denying workers their entitlement to the national minimum wage. In all our previous discussions, the hon. Member for Buckingham and perhaps the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) tend to pursue their argument I such a way that its conclusion is almost a defence of the indefensible. They always defend those who want to be on the wrong side of the argument--that is, those who want to use bogus self-employment to undermine people's capacity to get their basic rights. The hon. Member for Buckingham always puts up obstacles but the clause is about removing obstacles to ensure workers a clear entitlement to the national minimum wage.
<P>
The hon. Member for Buckingham is bobbing up and down like a jack-in-the-box. If he could just hold his precociousness for a moment, perhaps I shall give way to him later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Can the Minister confirm that he is aware of some of the concerns that have been raised by home workers, whom he mentioned a moment ago?
<P>
To some extent, home workers see the Bill as uncharted territory, as they have developed a loose arrangement with their employers to earn money through home working. Does the Minister foresee that putting the onus on employers to register home workers will begin to alleviate fears of coercion or the loss of employment opportunities, which home workers expressed in response to the national minimum wage proposals? What guidelines will home workers' groups be given so that home workers may be brought into not just legitimate employment, but well organised and acceptable employment, with all the usual rights and duties, in terms of contributions to the state?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee that interventions should be short.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) makes a helpful intervention and his point is well made. That is why the Bill addresses the issue as it does. It is balanced to ensure that people who have no rights of recognition, who are rarely in trade unions and so are not represented, who are sometimes very isolated, and who are consequently unable to negotiate or bargain, are entitled to an absolute minimum, below which the employer cannot go.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the general uprating of the home worker, with which I have a great deal of sympathy. Home working is a legitimate area of the labour market. Many people, for care reasons, can get into only that area. That being the case, arrangements should not be exploitative. The Government are looking to enhance the role of home working. Everything that other workers get as a matter of course--training, for example--should be available. The Government have regular contact with home-working groups. This summer, we signalled our wish to work with home-working organisations and employers to make home working more attractive and less exploitative.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee that we have debated bogus self-employment and home working. The clause defines ``worker'' and ``employee''. It would be helpful if hon. Members kept to that agenda.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I stand corrected. I was responding to the hon. Member for Eastleigh.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked about the six-year-back-dated period. It is included in all employment legislation and is a straight lift from the 1996 Act whose provisions were also lifted from other legislation. For clarity, the process starts from the day that the minimum wage is put in place. It is not to do with the six years running up to the implementation of the minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am going to sit down. I apologise to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) for not allowing him to intervene on me. Mr. Atkinson is quite right: we have had enough discussion on the matter, but if the hon. Gentleman catches my eye later, I shall give way then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I would have intervened on a couple of points, but time did not permit. It is not fair to intervene on the Minister too many times.
<P>
If the Minister had made all things clear, the debate could have been modest, but that has not been the case. We are left with a couple of problems. First, if we are resting on the Employment Rights Act 1996 definition of ``worker'' and ``employee'', has sufficient time elapsed for us to see whether difficulties have arisen with that definition? The proxy is whether litigation has been brought in pursuance of the 1996 Act and whether we have further information about the boundaries between employment and self-employment and workers and non-workers.
<P>
Secondly, we have dealt with agency and home workers, but we were rightly brought to order when we touched upon the definition of ``worker'' or ``employee''. Conservative Members are trying to chase down--if they have already been offered to the Committee I did not hear them clearly expressed--the circumstances in which someone who is treated as genuinely self-employed by the Inland Revenue would no longer be so treated. By implication, if something is not genuine it must be bogus.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Inland Revenue treats people as self-employed in certain circumstances. If a person is not to be treated as self-employed under the national minimum wage definition, their self-employment, by extension of the language in the notes on clauses if not the Bill, would be treated as bogus. We have been put in considerable difficulty. A person cannot be self-employed on the one hand and not genuinely self-employed on the other. The two do not stand comfortably together. It is all very well for the Minister to say, ``There are definitions for tax purposes and definitions for national minimum wage purposes.'' Separate definitions might suit the Government but, just as in policy matters, they should speak with one voice. Businesses would find it difficult to reconcile themselves to the Government speaking with voices which are not consonant with one another.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> To take up the Minister's point, does not my hon. Friend think that the most likely immediate beneficiaries to the Bill will be the lawyers? If a person is defined as self-employed by one Government Department and not self-employed by another--both decisions are likely to be challenged in the courts--will not legal fees go through the roof?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The Minister may say that the definitions are to be treated separately, but litigants who are deemed to be self-employed for tax or national minimum wage purposes will not be barred from using them as evidence, cross-referring between the two jurisdictions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Did my hon. Friend notice the circularity of the Minister's poor response to me a few moments ago? He said that the Revenue inadvertently accepting bogus self-employment was a problem, but rushed proudly to tell us of the action that the Revenue is taking to ensure that it is not a problem. He really cannot have it both ways.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes. That point arose forcibly from the Minister's unfortunate response to my hon. Friend. Far from being unclear, my hon. Friend was absolutely clear. I put the point again to make it clearer: people may seek to establish their self-employment, and employers may characterise workers as self-employed for bogus reasons, but the Inland Revenue--I say this with confidence--does not judge someone to be self-employed for bogus reasons; rather it does so for good reaons and, as the Minister explained, off the back of a considerable enforcement procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Am I not right in saying that the Inland Revenue's conclusion would be testable through the general or special commissioners or the courts, if necessary? The burden of proof means that there would be a rigorous test of self-employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> That is true, but I am not an expert. The Committee will forgive me if I stray into error. The Inland Revenue's powers to examine the contractual or business relationship between an individual and a potential employer are probably greater than those that will be available to the enforcement authorities for the national minimum wage. In the latter case, the records kept and later examined by officers will relate to hours worked, pay given and pay reference periods, but not necessarily to all the circumstances relevant to establishing whether a person was genuinely self-employed.
<P>
I suspect that instead of treating self-employment for tax purposes as an issue separate from the definition of ``worker'' or ``employee'' for national minimum wage purposes, there would be an advantage in considering the potent issue of whether a person is treated as genuinely self-employed by the Inland Revenue when determining whether he qualifies for the national minimum wage. The Inland Revenue has a potentially stronger set of powers and enforcement procedures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Has my hon. Friend considered the possibility, which reinforces his point, that there will be two sets of enforcement officers, each visiting an individual and poking around in his books, coming to opposite conclusions and then having to fight in the courts about the status of that individual? Unless the Minister is clear about which jurisdiction rules, he will land himself in a minefield.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I will not labour that point further; it has been well made. Its importance is the greater when one considers that Ministers are of necessity--I will not argue that it is unnecessary in this clause--setting out to make the national minimum wage as inclusive and near universal as they can. The clause therefore treats as relevant not only written but oral contracts and not only those that are expressed but those that are implied.
<P>
Although it may be right that in the pursuit of universality all those forms of contract, howsoever established, are brought within the ambit of the clause, that makes clarity about the circumstances in which the national minimum wage provisions will apply all the more necessary for those who will be affected. It would be unsatisfactory if people with an oral, implied contract were suddenly treated as employed for the purposes of the national minimum wage, when previously they had considered themselves self-employed and had the freedom to decide whether to work for a particular individual. We must be cautious about pushing that too far.
<P>
If the Minister takes the opportunity to enlighten us further about the implementation of the Employment Rights Act 1996, we must treat that with some care. I suspect that the use of the definition in that Act will probably prove less significant in business terms than its use in the context of the national minimum wage. It will come as no surprise to the Committee that the extent to which any particular boundary in law is tested tends to be proportionate to the significance of a decision on whether one falls on either side of that boundary. We must be sure not only that the definition has proved robust up to now but that it is so robust that it can withstand the additional tension that will be brought to bear by those seeking to test it in future.
<P>
I know how keen the Minister is on plain English. Presumably, the Government, in setting out who would be affected by the Employment Rights Act 1996, sought to render into plainer English the sort of definitions that we are discussing under clause 51. Will the Minister give us some examples, because they might help us to keep up with him? I know that he does not want to give speculative examples. Indeed, it is difficult to render definitions in plain English by reference to such examples--one must use real-life ones. If the Minister has any literature in plain English on the 1996 Act, he might find that real examples form part of it. It would be helpful if he gave us a little more guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> On that last point, the hon. Gentleman was responsible in a previous career for millions of technical words and legislation and took great pride in complicating matters as much as possible for hon. Members on both sides of the House. He is a bit of a poacher turned gamekeeper.
<P>
Secondly, Opposition Members are either unaware of good business practice or have been generating a lot of hot air just for the sake of it. The tax regime considers income and measures something different from the Bill, which is a piece of employment legislation. Hon. Members should not confuse the two.
<P>
The Bill is drafted in the same way as all previous employment legislation, such as the Employment Rights Act 1996. For 18 years, the previous Government followed the same criteria. The Inland Revenue has no general definition of self-employment. It employs general criteria, and the tax inspector uses them to decide matters case by case. My colleague explained that in a previous debate. In terms of compliance with the law, we are following the same processing criteria that the previous Government used for 18 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does the Minister accept that there is a distinction in principle? He rightly says that the Government's proposals are keyed in to pre-existing employment legislation concepts. In the Bill, however, we are, for the first time in employment legislation, imparting a test of remuneration. I and my hon. Friends are concerned that the treatment of remuneration here and in the tax system should have a common basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I do not see that at all. Under the previous Government's Wages Act 1986, there had to be definitions to ensure that people were entitled to claim their remuneration. In the Bill, we have extended the definition to include agency workers and home working because of the nature of the labour market. We have done that to ensure that people in those grey areas can claim the national minimum wage. We have changed the burden of proof to allow individuals in the casualised and vulnerable areas of the labour market to claim the minimum wage--no more, no less. We will use those criteria. I hope that my hon. Friends will support the inclusion of the clause in the Bill.

<H4><center>Interpretation</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we have the clause stand part debate, there are several Government amendments to be made formally, because they have already been debated. We could save time by taking them together, if the Committee so wishes.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 150, in page 30, line 41, leave out `industrial' and insert `employment',

No. 151, in page 31, line 5, leave out

<P>
No. 55, in page 31, line 17, at end insert
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 152, in page 31, line 31, at end insert--
<P>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I suppose it would be almost unprecedented--although no doubt your Clerk could find a case, Mr. Atkinson--for an Opposition to vote against the interpretation clause. While interpretation is an important subject, I do not have the temerity to do that. I give notice to the Minister that unless we are particularly nettled, as we were after the exchanges on the previous clause, we do not intend to vote against the interpretation clause. I feel that I would be trespassing in deep waters if I were to do so.
<P>
I have just two points to draw to the Minister's attention. First, there is an important reference in the clause to ``notice'', meaning a notice in writing. I mention that because when a formal process that is likely to lead to penalties is initiated, it is an important principle of justice that an enforcement officer should be required to serve a notice in writing.
<P>
In my own business, a health and safety person has occasionally made several suggestions. I might have had a slight difference of opinion on the practicability of those suggestions--although not about the general issue of safety--but I have usually been able to conclude the matter by asking whether he or she intended to give me a formal notice. That has tended to send the issue away. It is not meant as a deterrent--if there was something wrong, I would not want it not to be brought to be my attention, but there might be a practical dispute about the terms.
<P>
While notice must be given in writing in the first stages of enforcement, the Minister should not take that as a signal that strenuous efforts should not be made to hold a dialogue in advance. He has established his bona fides in discussions on the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service and enforcement officers, and he has been fair to both sides of industry in saying that people will want the measure to work properly.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but we are talking about interpretation in a narrow sense. We dealt with the subject of enforcement notices under clause 17 when, presumably, a full debate was held. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would stick to the narrow point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I was indeed minded to do so, but I was just about to point out that not all contracts betweeen Government and employers need necessarily be in writing.
<P>
My second point is more directly germane to the clause and relates to instances where there is more than one employer. We debated on clause 35 the question of superior employers. I said then, and I repeat now, because I am still a little unhappy, that it is important to concert any enforcement or penalty procedure between the various levels of employer. I am not saying that the notices should necessarily be identical--indeed, I presume that it is envisaged that a separate notice would be served at each level at which the employment was deemed to be taking place and that they would obviously specify different persons as the employer in each case--but they need to be keyed in and at least reasonably consistent.
<P>
Moving on, I should like some clarification of subsection (3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any reference in this Act to doing work includes a reference to performing services; and ``work'' and other related expressions shall be construed accordingly.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not have a problem with that. It seems common sense. However, will the Minister say a little more about the distinction between work and services? As I understand it, that is nothing to do with questions in contract law about what is a contract of employment and what is a contract for services. They exercise large chunks of the explanatory comments on legislation and the operation of law, which is a substantive reason why the Minister has had to extend the Bill to include a large number of quasi-employments.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that it is not the same sort of definition and explain why it is necessary to specify ``services'' as well as ``work''? I suppose it is because persons perform services when they are retained to do something but are not actually doing it at that particular moment. I should be grateful for the Minister's clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> There are a number of definitions in this interpretation clause--civil proceedings, enforcement notices, Government Department, industrial tribunals, notice, pay reference periods, penalty notices, qualifying persons, the words ``prescribe'' and ``regulations''. But clause 52 risks being a Cinderella clause. Everyone focuses on what look like the substantive clauses that are the real substance, hinge, cause and operation of the Bill, but there is an important omission here which the Committee should address. There is no definition of ``service''--how a notice or a penalty notice shall effectively be served on the person on whom it should be served.
<P>
There are a number of ways in general procedure in the civil law--I exclude the criminal law for this purpose--in which a notice or a penalty notice can be served. There are the options of registered post, special delivery and recorded delivery as well as the general postal service commonly known as first-class and second-class post. One of course knows of due process being served if needs be by it being sent to the last known postal address of the intended recipient. That may not be very satisfactory, but for the purposes of moving on it may be effective. It does not mean that the person who should have received it has got it. There can therefore be a disconnection in that the next steps of process may proceed without the person who was supposed to be on the receiving end being aware of it. I have never regarded that as very satisfactory.
<P>
In many civil proceedings, if someone is determined not to be in receipt of a notice, the plaintiff, the complainant or representatives of the complainant--who might be legal representatives or some kind of bailiff--can effect service by going to the person and touching them with the process. I hesitate to demonstrate this, for the Committee's peace of mind, although it is tempting to reach as far as my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, to whom I give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I am glad that he has refrained from serving anything upon any part of my person. The Committee is indebted to my hon. Friend for his latest contribution. Will he confirm that in his judgement either registered post or recorded delivery is much to be preferred over reliance upon simple use of first-class mail, even though an additional cost will necessarily be entailed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. I live at a postal address in Westminster, and I find it increasingly frustrating that it is impossible for me to receive items of mail that have been dispatched within the boundaries of civilisation, in the borough of Solihull, on the morning following the day on which they were posted. Increasingly, such items do not arrive on the following morning.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The ingenuity that the hon. Gentleman has used to stay in order has so far been impressive. I hope that he takes my point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> The general point--
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point about the uncertainty that is caused by the lack of definition about how such important orders can be served. Does he agree that such uncertainty makes the cost of the measure increasingly difficult to predict? Without knowing what kind of enforcement mechanism will be in place, it is impossible for the Committee to estimate how much the public purse will be forced to disburse to enforce the legislation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Ashford is repeating the debate that took place on clause 19. The hon. Member for Solihull should not pursue that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I shall not, but I take note of my hon. Friend's point. I am bound to say that my own travails, even with first-class post, have obliged me to install in my office a machine that I think is called a facsimile, within the very royal Palace in which the Committee is sitting. A lot of such technology is new to me, but younger people than me could conceive that the postal service might be affected by the procedure that I believe to be called facsimile, especially if a way was produced of registering that the message had arrived at the other end. Things exist that are called the internet, e-mail--
<P>
<B>Mr. Clive Betts </B>(Sheffield, Attercliffe): Pigeons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> The Committee has had several historical lectures, not least from the Minister, who spoke of battles. The Committee should know that the Rothschild fortune was made largely because the family, standing by their column on the floor of the stock exchange, were aware of the outcome of the battle of Waterloo before anybody else because they had a pigeon service. They certainly did not have any of the fanciful things that I mentioned. They knew the result of the battle, and immediately started selling very large quantities of stock. The rest of the floor of the stock exchange, knowing that the Rothschilds must have known the result, and were selling heavily, also began selling heavily. They did so until the crucial moment at which the Rothschilds' wholesale started to buy back. The family profited enormously from the pigeon message service. I am not suggesting that anybody within the provenance of the clause should be served by a pigeon.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I let the hon. Gentleman continue because the Committee needs a bit of fun, and it enjoyed his story. He is, however, totally out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Even I knew that, and I shall resume my seat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> You, Mr. Atkinson, and the Minister will be relieved to know that I wish my hon. Friend to clarify only one point. I have no desire to speak about the Rothschilds or about pigeons.
<P>
On Tuesday, and again this morning, the Minister accused me of having a mean-spirited approach to the Bill. I thank him for that accusation. It is tremendously helpful to me to be accused from the Government Benches of defending the wilder parts of capitalism red in tooth and claw. The accusation makes me stand in enormous credit with several of my hon. Friends, including, I suspect, my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, who might at at times regard me as being unduly sensitive on certain issues. I want first to place on record my thanks to the Minister for that remark.
<P>
I should like the Minister to clarify one point--I promise not to mention Arthur Daley if he does not--relating to subsection (2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any reference . . . to a person being remunerated for a pay reference period is a reference to the person being remunerated by his employer''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We discussed on previous clauses the confusions that can arise about who is the employer in certain circumstances, and reference was made to the construction industry, where there is often a hierarchy of employers.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am confused as to how the interpretation clause will allow a clear interpretation. Is the employer specified in subsection (2) to be regarded as the employer who is immediately paying employees' salaries or is it to be the ultimate employer at the top of the hierarchy, who has released all the contracts to the subcontractors? Or is there to be confusion, where the employee will designate someone to be the employer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am closely following the impeccable logic of my hon. Friend's argument. Does he agree that given that an employee can secure an entitlement to the national minimum wage from a number of employers for work undertaken within a given pay reference period, line 21 in subsection (2) ought properly to refer to ``employers'' rather than an ``employer''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is an extremely powerful and sensible point. Perhaps the Minister would like to address himself to that for the Bill's future progress in this House and in another place. There seems to be a possibility of confusion arising from the clause and it would be a shame if the interpretation clause added to confusion and rendered the Bill's application more, rather than less, difficult.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Just for the avoidance of doubt, line 21 should properly refer to ``employer or employers''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I took that to be what my hon. Friend meant, but I am grateful to him for clarifying that for the Committee. I am sure that the Minister will take the point that as the clause stands, it will not be clear to an employee or, possibly more importantly, to the various enforcement officers, how ``employer'' should be interpreted. We hoped that when we got to this clause the uncertainty that has been discussed at length on previous clauses would have been cleared up. However, subsection (2) increases, rather than diminishes, the confusion felt by the Committee. We would be grateful if the Minister could clarify who is considered the employer when there is a hierarchy of employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I was mortified in our previous debate that the Minister thought I was speaking purely for the expulsion of hot air rather than making genuine points, as I thought I was doing. I was saddened by his response, but I shall not run that risk again. I shall confine myself if I can to points of obvious precision, particularly as we are dealing with interpretation.
<P>
The score between my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry and I is 1-1 in finding reasons to change the text of the Bill when it comes to reprinting. This is my further bid. We have each scored one, but he may claim two because a reference to ``Part'' appeared twice in a particular paragraph, but we will not cavil about that.
<P>
My bid on this occasion relates to clause 52(1). ``Government department'' is defined to include a Northern Ireland department, which seems reasonable, except in clause 49(a). Why is that excluded? Does that mean that expenditure under clause 49(a) in Northern Ireland is not to be allowed? Why will Northern Ireland departments not be allowed to spend money in pursuance of the Act in their area?
<P>
My second point concerns regulations, to which reference was made on an earlier amendment. We all understand that the reference to the Secretary of State means any Secretary of State--that is a term of art in legislation. The term does not, however, embrace the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. As I understand it, however, the Secretary of State and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food make regulations jointly under clause 44(6). Why does the definition not make allowance for the Minister of Agriculture to make regulations in the same way that it does for the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> This has been a curious little debate. I will put on record the reasons for the clause and then deal with the points that were in order--there were perhaps one or two.
<P>
Clause 52, like clause 50, is a standard clause for the purpose of legal clarification. It defines various terms in the Bill, such as ``civil proceedings'', ``enforcement notice'' and ``pay reference period''. The Committee will appreciate that such standard interpretation is for the purposes of legal clarification. The terms that the clause defines have already been debated on substantive clauses and some points were debated hour after hour. I do not intend to rise to the bait and to go over that ground. Hon. Gentlemen have had their opportunity to shoot the fox and I do not intend to go back into the paddock with them on the clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull is smiling at me. For old time's sake, I will give way to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> For old times sake, is the Minister old enough to remember the comedian Arthur Haynes who would draw a line under any argument by saying, ``It's a well-known fact, mate.''? Is the Minister telling us, ``This is a standard clause, mate.''? Is he saying that it does not brook further discussion? Is this a standard clause, mate? Or is there some meat on the bone?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Given that the hon. Gentleman is beating his pigeon breast at me, I should perhaps say, ``It is a standard clause, cock''. The clause is no more and no less than that. For the sake of clarity, I will explain why it is in the Bill.
<P>
Most terms are defined by reference to the clause. For example the pay reference period is construed in accordance with clause 1(4). Others terms are simply clarifications. For example ``notice'' means notice in writing and ``prescribe'' means prescribe by regulations. The clause also defines what is meant by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a person being remunerated for a pay reference period''. It explains that references to ``work'' should be construed as references to performing work or services.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Finally--the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire asked a well-placed question about this two or three weeks ago--the clause defines when a person ceases to be of compulsory school age in Scotland and Northern Ireland for the purposes of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked about the distinction between work and services. That is simply a catch-all definition, which has been used in standard form in other employment legislation. There is no need to distinguish between those terms because we have covered both. That saves us the trouble of using the words ``work or services'' throughout the Bill and is a simpler way of drafting it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull raised the issue of notice. Yes, there will be notice; it is standard practice. In addition, workers also must give written notice under clause 10(5) in the event of their exercising their right of access to records, although that does not preclude its being done informally. The employer must be given notice, which is reasonable.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull--the pigeon fancier--asked about service. It is 10 years since he left the legal fraternity. There is considerable case law using the words ``serve'' and ``service'', and the Bill relies on it, for example at clause 17(1). His point was well made, and the Bill is well founded as it takes case law into account.
<P>
My response to the hon. Member for Ashford will be very narrow because he raised issues that should have been debated under clause 51(4) which sets out clearly the meaning of ``employer'', ``worker'' and ``employee''. Unless a worker has two separate jobs, he will have one, immediate employer. The hon. Gentleman is the only one who is confused about this issue.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire asked about the exclusion of Northern Ireland. In respect of clause 49(a), we shall--it says here--clarify a complicated position. As regards regulations by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, that provision was amended by amendment No. 55. That news comes hotfoot, not by pigeon carrier post, but from the gracious hand of my hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln (Gillian Merron).
<P>
Following the good humoured clarification, I hope that the Committee will accept the clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 52, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments: Government amendment No. 261.
<P>
No. 230, in page 31, line 36, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>` , being a day not earlier than six months from the date of publication of the first regulations made under sections 1(3) or (4) or 2 above.'.<P>

<P>
No. 251, in page 31, line 36, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but not before one year has elapsed since the Low Pay Commission made its first report and it has been made available to both Houses of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is a substantive group of amendments. We must probe intensely. Our amendments would help with the coherence and universality of the Bill, but Government amendment No. 261 derogates from that. My lead amendment, brief as it is, provides for the works to come into force on one day. The Government have provided for more than one commencement day, but want to add the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and different days may be appointed for different purposes''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government must explain why more than one start day is needed.
<P>
To give the Government credit, there is a certain intellectual coherence in what they propose. Irrespective of whether we accept the premise, we can nevertheless accept that they are trying to produce a concept that hangs together. It requires a prescription of pay and regulations to enforce that, and exceptions which appear to be about young persons and have been extensivley debated. There are one or two rather important bits and pieces--the less important perhaps relate to share fisherman and prisoners and the more important, substantively, to the armed forces. To accompany all that, there are enforcement of penalty and offence provisions and supplementary matters which all seem to hang together, so it does not seem sensible to prescribe for more than one day of commencement. One can hardly have the regulations and the concept without having enforcement and associated matters introduced at the same time.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government may be able to say something about that; they need at least to justify what they are doing. The formal status of the lead amendment is to preclude them from doing so by saying that there has to be what the City would call a big bang and then the whole thing comes into force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that in the interests of the intelligibility of the Government's publicity about the advent of the minimum wage, there is a strong argument for having one day upon which the whole thing applies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a helpful comment. I think that my hon. Friend has in mind something like a phone or PH1 day when the country's telephone numbers were all changed and we all knew where we were on the day--admittedly, many of us did not, but we should have by then. I hope that the Minister will not regard it as flippant if I say that I can imagine the dry tones of the No. 8 commencement order about some minor provision that he is about to explain to us coming in on a different day and causing all manner of confusion to the muddled and befuddled employers who, having wrestled with commencement orders Nos. 1 to 7, are now confronted with an eighth. That is a fair point and it chimes in with something that I was going to say in relation to when the commencement date might be.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend also agree that it is of the essence that the date upon which the Act takes effect should be the same in every part of the United Kingdom? That is consistent with the Government's thinking about the Bill as a whole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing that out; it was implicit in my remarks, but he has made it explicit. It would be rather odd if there were a national minimum wage in, say, England and Wales but not in Scotland or Northern Ireland.
<P>
We come now to the separate but related question about when this day--or, if the Minister justifies it to the Committee, these days--should be. Embedded in amendment No. 251 and in related amendment No. 230 is the suggestion that there should be a reasonable elapsing of time before the matter is brought to a conclusion. Before Government Members say so, this is not an attempt to subvert the purposes of the Bill. It is to say that if the Bill is to work properly and, as the Minister has told us, is to work without losing its credibility, it should be introduced coherently after proper process and when everyone understands what is likely to happen. Nothing should be rushed.
<P>
I notice a certain difference in emphasis between Conservative Front and Back-Bench Members as to how this should work. I am sure that Government Members will be delighted, because it fits their stereotype, that those on the Front Benches have taken a rather more hawkish position than their colleagues on the Back Benches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Before my hon. Friend makes that assumption, may I say that I think that it is the other way round? My hon. Friend is being characteristically generous in assuming that the Government would make reasonable progress in making regulations after receiving the Low Pay Commission's recommendations. The amendment, which is in my name and that of my hon. Friends the Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Buckingham, was tabled in case the Government receive those recommendations, fail to act on them for some considerable time but then try to bring regulations into force very rapidly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed. I might have been misled by the fact that the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, who has temporarily left the Room, is appended to the amendment--I may therefore have drawn the wholly improper inference that the amendment was dovish.
<P>
I understand the concern expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire: we do not know. It is clear, however, that we take slightly different approaches. My amendment would start the taxi meter in a different place, while his starts it somewhere along the course at a point unspecified. I prefer my formulation, because the clause prescribes that the regulation-making powers should come into force immediately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Perhaps I am falling into the habit of asking my hon. Friend questions that I ought properly to ask the Minister. Does he agree that, although the clause provides that regulations can be made immediately, that does not mean that they could be brought into effect, because the minimum wage will not become payable under those regulations until the whole Bill is enacted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Our exchanges have been useful, and my hon. Friend is right. However, it does not matter which amendment we select for the purpose. The substantive point is that there needs to be a period of delay but, by inference, it should not be unreasonably extended. We must probe the Government's intentions, because they are somewhat opaque. We all know of bits of Government legislation that have been launched with a flourish and which then languished somewhere.
<P>
Rather as in the wartime story about the Ark Royal, we have been looking for the Government's evidence to the Low Pay Commission. We have now succeeded in corralling that, but on the other hand--I mention the point only in passing--a Second Reading to the Fossil Fuel Levy Bill [Lords] is scheduled without its Committee being empanelled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend has been generous in giving way three times and I am grateful to him. When we saw the evidence to the Low Pay Commission we thought that we had sighted the Ark Royal, but I suspect that what we saw was the tug pulling the Ark Royal--the Ark Royal has not yet come round the headland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend makes a truthful analogy but he perhaps takes it wider than the amendment's remit, to which I shall hastily return.
<P>
We need a proper but not excessive period of consideration and we need to have at least an indication from the Government of their thinking. There are two particular considerations. First, this has to mesh in with the Low Pay Commission's report. We have the Government's remit to the commission--which remains a non-statutory body--that it should report by the end of April with its terms of reference. Ministers have confirmed in this Committee that it will do so, and I do not want to suggest that it will not. Thus, we have at least one clear starting point. However, we then need to consider the implications, which I shall tease out in a moment.
<P>
The second consideration is related but different. When Ministers are ready to enact the Bill, there needs to be a proper process of consultation on the regulations that will actually be introduced, and there needs to be proper publicity and an understanding at large as to how and when the thing will work.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I think that in attempting to deal comprehensively with the matters before us, my hon. Friend is missing an important point. It is true that the Ark Royal is now in sight. We have the Government's evidence, which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The higher the level of the minimum wage, the greater the risk of an adverse effect on employment, inflation and the PSBR.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is one thing, but when the Low Pay Commission provides its report, that further sighting will be of the Bismarck. It will be the devastation of all the Minister's good intentions. He seems to have left his vantage point for the moment. Will the hon. Member for Daventry share with me the real possibility that the Low Pay Commission's report will hole the Bill below the waterline?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend has a remarkable capacity to make loyal points and use colourful language that enlivens the Committee simultaneously. He is right. As I recall, the Bismarck met a very nasty fate. It may well be that wolf packs are gathering. A process of sorting out will have to occur. That is why the Committee should consider the amendments. The Government have had difficulties in setting up the process. They have lost valuable time--whether or not it is steaming time--because of the dilatoriness of the evidence that they have submitted to the Low Pay Commission, which has received some 600 submissions from committed parties. The Low Pay Commission has been required to operate against a deadline. Because of those factors, the Government and the country will need a period of reflection to consider the economic implications of the matter.
<P>
It is clear to me that, even if the Government's evidence was late in arriving at the Low Pay Commission--if, as it were, it missed its tide--it was quite eloquent in its oblique message. As I recall the Committee briefly and somewhat breathlessly discussed that matter when it considered clause 49. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, being very experienced in the ways of Whitehall, can read the tea leaves even more effectively than I can. Of course, the message of the evidence is clear enough, even though the words do not appear.
<P>
The evidence contains a double message. First is the plea ``please, oh God, give us a lower rate for young persons''. All the supporting evidence from the helpful appendices, which the Committee has not discussed, and the experience of the world and certainly of Europe, is that statutory minimum wages for young people prejudice employment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am listening closely to the hon. Gentleman. He seems to be straying from the tight subject of the definition of commencement about which he was speaking earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Of course, it is self-evidently important that the national minimum wage will have to commence at one or more rates. The amendments seek to invite the Committee to agree that the Government should think long and hard before they produce the final rate.
<P>
Secondly, the evidence invites the Low Pay Commission to prescribe a generally low rate. Although I have entertained the concept, Opposition Members are not keeping a book. Perhaps we should, and perhaps we should extend it to Government Back Benchers. It would be based on estimates of what the hourly rate of the national minimum wage will be. I do not have a good record of winning such wagers.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I tried to advise the hon. Gentleman that the Committee is discussing the commencement, and not rates. The amendment is very narrow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is absolutely right. The matter concerns the day on which I shall have mentally adjusted down my race-card by 20p or 30p per hour, and I on which I should hope to win a glittering prize.
<P>
I am mindful of your strictures, Mr. Atkinson, but I should say that very important factors, which concern not just the consideration of the Commission, but the economic circumstances in which its recommendations--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman again. I must ask him to keep in order. The clause is very narrow, and it relates to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Short title, commencement and geographical extent.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee is discussing an amendment that seeks to change the phrase ``day or days''. The debate should be kept to the subject of the commencement date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I understand that, Mr. Atkinson. I seek no advantage in making my point. It is impossible to divorce the commencement of the Bill from external factors, which might lead to it being aborted.
<P>
I need not reopen the debate on those factors, but the Government will have to have regard to the economic conditions on the day of implementation. They will have to consider, for example, whether our growth rate is being toppled by the problems in south-east Asia, and their own growth and inflation projections. There was good news last month, but there is already concern about the state of the labour market and the possibility of shortages. The Government are bound to have to consider the impact on differentials and on Government finances at the time. When Ministers decide whether to commence the Bill, they must consider all those factors together with the impacts on particular industries.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
That relates to the point I made at the beginning of my remarks about the need for proper planning and implementation of the Government's proposals. Given that the Government are aiming for universality, it is important that they should have regard to the more vulnerable sectors in implementing the Bill. They may have to hold up the legislation until those sectors have had a reasonable time to adjust. I am thinking, for example, of the care homes sector. The median wage for care assistants was &#163;4.29 an hour in 1996. In the child care industry, the average wage--which I presume is the mean, not the median--was &#163;3.85.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Like most hon. Members, I had a late night last night, but I am having great difficulty in understanding what the hourly rate for care workers has to do with the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed. The point is that some care workers work late and long hours, as, indeed, we do here. If the Government are to get the Bill's implementation right, they will need to have regard to the situation in particular sectors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that a decent, not excessive, notice of the application of the minimum wage is important in my case because if the wage is to be established at a rate above &#163;7 an hour, I will need plenty of time to prepare for payment of my cleaner?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. A blanket of anonymity should cover the hon. Gentleman's cleaner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Yes, I think that you could call that a polishing-up operation.
<P>
We have already referred to the difficulties that charities will experience in adjusting their pay rates and cost structures to the new proposals. As with care homes, which involve many charities, there may be a case for taking time so that individuals, businesses and operations can adjust themselves to the provisions because they may have many workers who will be covered.
<P>
In agriculture, as I have already mentioned, there is a clear working distinction between casual employees in some areas of horticulture and full-time permanent employees. We discussed that on another clause.
<P>
I will advert to some internal material made available to me by representatives of a particular sector who recently met the Low Pay Commission. The material gives a flavour of their dialogue. When it was suggested that there could be inflationary rises, a member of the commission said that they might be low in relation to normal inflation, but the respondents pointed out that the rises would be in addition to normal inflation and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would have either a serious effect on business if passed on or on investment if absorbed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It was then asked why money could not be found to pay the employees what was described as a ``decent wage''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is beginning to test my patience. The amendment has nothing to do with the terms and conditions of the people whom the hon. Gentleman has mentioned; it is about the date of commencement and whether the provisions should commence on one day or on various days. I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would stick to the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed. I am seeking to make the point that the amendments are designed to provide a period of reflection after the Low Pay Commission has produced its recommendations so that vulnerable industries have a breathing space.
<P>
I conclude with one further sentence from the material. In response to the question about why they could not pay a decent wage, the respondents said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such expansion and job creation could only come through investment, which would be directly impacted through increased costs over and above what the market dictates.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That clearly signifies that businesses in the sectors that are traditionally associated with low pay--they are dealt with extensively in the Government's evidence--will need time to adjust if they are not simply to lay people off. That argues for a deliberate process in which the Government consider some of the administrative problems that they had in getting their evidence to the commission. The commission needs to report on new and different concepts, which need to be debated and understood by both sides of industry and by other players. In that way, the Government will be able to formulate sensible regulations, on which they will, in turn, need to consult. The industries that are likely to be most affected need a breathing space so that they do not undertake the wholesale dismissal of their employees, but try to find ways to work through the process and minimise the damage to employment and their business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the greater the burden, the longer the notice period required? Conversely, the lesser the burden, the shorter the period of notice required.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a valuable point. We will not know what the burden is until we have the Low Pay Commission's report and the Government's decisions on it. Conservative Members take a different view from the Government of the Bill's merits. Whatever view one takes, however, it must be sensible in terms of its credibility to provide a reasonable amount of time for detailed proposals to be considered in a way that was not possible in Committee because of the Government's approach to the matter. It would also be sensible for employers to be given adequate publicity and explanation. If the Government want the Bill to work properly, they need to give it time to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to add to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry and, in particular, to speak to amendment No. 230, which is in my name and that of my hon. Friends the Members for Buckingham and for Runnymede and Weybridge.
<P>
I ought to begin with the relationship between amendments Nos. 230 and 251. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry that we are pursuing the same objective, but we are using slightly different means. It might be helpful if I explained the thinking behind amendment No. 230. Notwithstanding my hon. Friend's remarks, it would be a perfectly good way of approaching the matter, if Ministers were inclined to use it. Let me tell them why they should do so.
<P>
The Minister will no doubt correct me if I am wrong--although I am not sure which Minister--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> It is me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I see. I do not want to direct my remarks to the wrong Minister. As I understand it, the power to make regulations comes into force on the day that the Act is passed. In practice, however, the commencement provisions and the day on which Ministers provide by regulation that particular provisions--for example, section 1--come into force are determined under subsection (2). Regulations may have previously been made, specifying, for example, the pay reference period or the single universal hourly rate.
<P>
Amendment No. 230 is a little distinct from amendment No. 251. The Government will receive recommendations from the Low Pay Commission, but do not have to make regulations at any particular time. The commission's recommendations might be rendered into regulations, but that may not be the case. We laboured under the misapprehension that the Government might have sought to influence the commission's recommendations, but they merely presented terms of reference and offered information, not guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> For the avoidance of doubt, does my hon. Friend agree that even if formal guidance was not offered, unmistakeable smoke signals were sent as to the range of exemptions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. There was tea leaf reading over the setting of a rate to take account of the impact of the minimum wage on different parts of the United Kingdom. Paragraphs 22 to 24 of the evidence deal with that matter.
<P>
We cannot be sure that the commission's recommendations will be unambiguous. The commission might drop the making of regulations into the lap of Ministers, who would then have to make judgments about, for example, rates for young people and trainees. Considerable time might elapse between the commission making recommendations and regulations being made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not want to interrupt my hon. Friend's flow, but will he confirm that Ministers need to decide anything in the light of the recommendations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. We debated that earlier. The Bill makes it clear that Ministers can choose not to implement the recommendations and, after explaining their reasoning to the House, bring forward explicitly different regulations. More important to the debate are the timing implications that flow from that. [Interruption.] The Minister seems to find this amusing.
<P>
Amendment No. 251 rightly suggests that a year is an appropriate period for making transitional provisions. The longer the period between the recommendations being received and transitional provisions being made, the greater the need for the period of grace for industry to respond to be related to the making of regulations, especially if Ministers are not following the recommendations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am following the thrust of my hon. Friend's argument closely. Does he agree that the scale of the burden is of the essence? If regulations largely reflect the thrust of the Low Pay Commission's recommendations, there is no strong argument for a long notice period. If, however, the Government's regulations do not substantially reflect those recommendations and are more burdensome, there is a much more powerful case for having a longer notice period before the Act takes effect.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. We do not need to labour the point, but I hope that it is well taken by Ministers.
<P>
As at so many points in the debate, the rate is a significant issue, which in this case relates to the timing of commencement and the transitional provisions allowed for industry to respond. However, I shall return to the transitional provisions later.
<P>
This is the first time we have had the opportunity to ask Ministers explicitly to give the Committee--and perhaps, via us, the wider audience beyond--an indication of the timetable that they have in mind. All we know at the moment is that we have made good progress on the Bill and that the Low Pay Commission intends to offer its evidence in the latter part of May. Beyond that, I know relatively little. It would be to our advantage, even in the absence of the important information to be gleaned from the commission's evidence in May, for Ministers to say something about their intended timetable.
<P>
Is it, for example, intended that the end date should be 1 April 1999? By end date, I mean the date on which the minimum wage will come into force. If Ministers would say what they had in mind, it would help those who are making judgments about the time scale on which they must make compensating and adjustment decisions.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will my hon. Friend acknowledge that if that were the Government's thinking, it would incline them, sadly and regrettably, to oppose amendment No. 251?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right. It might also lead Ministers to conclude that they could not accept amendment No. 230, either, although they could. If the Low Pay Commission rendered advice at the end of May and Ministers made regulations promptly thereafter, there could be a comfortable transitional provision--I put it no more strongly than that--from summer this year to the commencement of the next financial year.
<P>
I know that businesses by and large do not use the tax year or the financial year as the year against which they make pay decisions, but a reasonable proportion of businesses use the April commencement of the financial year as a point at which they make decisions on pay scales. I do not know whether Ministers have offered comment on that--there is none in their evidence to the Low Pay Commission--but perhaps they might try to make the first regulations and thus their impact bear some relation to the normal temporal character of industry's pay negotiations and the point at which pay scales tend to vary.
<P>
From my experience, early April is a good time for the minimum wage provisions to be brought into force. If the beginning of April were their target date, Ministers could accept amendment No. 230 and commit themselves to have made regulations by, for example, the beginning of October.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that even if the Government are not minded to accept our amendments, it is incumbent on the Minister to indicate his reasonableness so that businesses know that there will be a decent and reasonable notice period, even if the Government do not accept the Opposition's view of what that should be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I do not claim any particular expertise to justify the choice of six months in amendment No. 230. From memory--I do not have the relevant papers with me--the Confederation of British Industry was looking for a six-month transitional provision. Presumably, that six-month period would apply from the point when regulations were made, so the key factors to be taken into account would be available. If that were the case, the request for transitional provisions seems perfectly modest and not excessive. Further, it could be acceded to by reference to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I needed to check because I, too, was not certain. In fact, the CBI asked for a 12-month phasing-in period after the rate had been announced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I was more modest than the CBI. In that case, Ministers might choose to deal with amendment No. 251 on the basis that the making of regulations would follow hard on the heels of the evidence from the Low Pay Commission and be broadly constant with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am sorry continually to interrupt my hon. Friend's flow, although it has to be said that that has not spoiled his delivery to date. Does my hon. Friend agree that although the CBI's view is of the utmost importance, that of the Federation of Small Businesses is equally important? My hon. Friend is invariably well informed--does he know for what notice period the FSB has called?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend asked me a question to which I do not have an answer. I know how well informed he is on such matters and if he catches your eye, Mr. Atkinson, he may be able to offer that advice himself or approximate to it by reference to his knowledge of the way in which businesses respond to such issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> On the issue of timetables, I point out that it is not only business organisations that have made the point that my hon. Friend was so powerfully making. The National Council of Voluntary Organisations pointed out that because it negotiates its funding on an annual basis, it will take some time to work out the impact of a national minimum wage on its staff costs, so it should be allowed at least a year to implement the proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> That is interesting because I was about to consider the public expenditure implications. I must confess that in this respect my instincts are rooted too much in civil service practice and too little in business practice. I remember the public expenditure survey round only too well. I would prepare the papers for a discussion in August, leading to decisions in late September or early October, about six months before public expenditure decisions were to be implemented for the ensuing financial year.
<P>
Decisions relating to the national minimum wage have expenditure implications--we debated this only briefly at our previous sitting--which are significant not only for Government Departments but for their contractors. If one tracks back six months from the notional target date of early April 1999, that is in the middle of the public expenditure survey round. It is important that public expenditure implications are thoroughly considered during those negotiations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> On that point, my hon. Friend will note that in their own evidence the Government say that at higher levels of the minimum wage, the potential for adverse effects on tax revenues in public expenditure increases, with the risk of an adverse effect on the public sector borrowing requirement. If the Government do not accept at least the spirit of the amendments and delay implementation, they will endanger their financial position unless they are prepared to reject a high recommendation from the Low Pay Commission. The Government would help their own work if they accepted the spirit of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right and he has had great experience of those matters inside government. He will appreciate, as will other members of the Committee, that my point about public expenditure is important. The fact that decisions on tax revenue can be made much later in the financial year than decisions on public expenditure tax revenue leaves the Government vulnerable to such an impact. The minimum wage could be announced between September or October in one year, and be implemented in April of the following year. Although in such circumstances, it might be possible to adjust budgets in March to deal with tax revenue implications, it might not be possible to adjust for potential changes in public expenditure without relimiting departmental allocations across the board in relation to low-paid workers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that whatever date the Government set for implementation, it should not occur during an election campaign? Such a campaign could be, for example, the European elections campaign. If that were to happen, the Government would lay themselves open to the charge of seeking to extract political capital from a policy decision. Would not such conduct be quite improper?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right to say that it would be quite improper for the Government to seek to influence an election campaign by manipulating timing. I am quite sure that no Minister would contemplate such a thing.
<P>
There are two important sets of reasons why the transitional provisions should be generous, especially in relation to the first regulations. The Committee has debated whether the provisions should apply for six months or for a year. If the CBI says a year, I do not dispute that view.
<P>
The first set of reasons relates to the need to adjust pay scales. I shall not explore the debate about that matter, because you, Mr. Atkinson, would quite rightly call me back to order. To objective observers, the Opposition have established that differentials are an important issue. We have established, contrary to the Minister's initial outburst, that differentials will be affected by the setting of the national minimum wage, unless exceptional circumstances were to arise, in which the national minimum wage was set at a very low level, below the prevailing level of pay scales that apply in most businesses.
<P>
It has also been established that the higher the national minimum wage, the more impact that it is likely to have on differentials and thus on a range of other costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> While my hon. Friend is dealing with the subject of differentials--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members are again wandering wide of the amendments. The Committee is discussing transition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Atkinson. I am making the point that differentials will affect the ability of business to plan, and will therefore have a material impact on the commencement date. The Government admit in their own evidence that the extent to which differentials might be restored will depend upon the level at which the wage is set. The matter is therefore extremely important in terms of businesses' ability to plan ahead for the introduction of the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> With your guidance, Mr. Atkinson, I should say that that point is very apposite. The question whether a six-month or a 12-month transition should apply before the first regulations are brought into force is relevant to the issue of differentials and pay scales. On the six-month period, I had thought that at the very least the introduction of the national minimum wage should be timed to coincide with the bringing into force of new pay scales by a substantial proportion of businesses.
<P>
An alternative argument exists. I freely confess that it may be the stronger one, and that it reinforces the argument in support of amendment No. 251. It has been argued that most businesses do not require the coincidence to which I referred. The argument suggests that they should have the opportunity, during the course of a year--in which they will adjust their pay scales at least once in the normal course of business--to adjust their pay scales, while bearing in mind the prospective rate and the implementation of the national minimum wage.
<P>
All the evidence, including that concerning the Agricultural Wages Board, suggests that other rates will incline towards the rate specified by the board--or, indeed, the national minimum wage rate. That will occur in addition to the differentials impact, to which I referred. It will mean that when pay negotiators look at pay scales in the 12 months during which the transition might apply, they will have a view of the impact of the national minimum wage on their own business and pay scales, and will want to take it into account. It will be much more disadvantageous if they adjust pay scales once and then find that the national minimum wage is implemented quickly at a rate that they had not anticipated and they have to re-enter the process of negotiation.
<P>
There are many incidental costs involved, about which Labour Members will be aware from their trade union experience, such as costs dislocation and a general impact on competitiveness as a result of businesses entering into pay negotiations twice in a year. We can see from the wage round in Germany or Japan how important it is for business competitiveness to have one's pay settled--doing it more than once in a year is to be avoided.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The second general reason for generous transitional provisions is even simpler to express--namely, that any business has to adjust costs. If I were given to algebra, I might be able to find an algebraic expression. However, a change in costs over time is the equation. If time is short and the change in costs is large, the impact on business is disproportionately large. If, however, the change in costs is relatively small and the period over which the time allowed for adjustment is longer, the negative impact on business can be minimised.
<P>
It is a fairly simple equation; I hope that Ministers have it in mind and that they will recognise that just as exchange rate changes over short periods can be difficult for businesses, so changes in their costs occasioned by the national minimum wage, occurring over a short period without notice, could be damaging. At the British chambers of commerce, what was mentioned when the subject of exchange or interest rates came up was not the level itself--although that was important--but the instability in exchange rates in particular and sometimes in interest rates over short periods of time, and the impact that that has on contract negotiations and the like.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, put more positively, the argument is simply this: minimum burden accompanied by maximum notice period equals a greater level of compliance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, I think I follow my hon. Friend's argument, and he is quite right.
<P>
I seek your guidance, Mr. Atkinson. I wish to talk about subsection (3), but the amendments do not relate to it. If it suits you, I will sit down, having talked of the transitional provisions, and leave the question of extending the legislation to cover Northern Ireland to clause stand part.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Chair will look favourably at a clause stand part if this debate remains tied to the amendments before us. If hon. Members wander off, stray into discussing other matters and have to be called to order, the chances are that the Chair will not be inclined to allow a stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson--that ruling is, as ever, very clear. I shall not talk about Northern Ireland now but hope that I will catch your eye later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Bearing your strictures in mind, Mr. Atkinson, I will stick to the points raised in the amendments about commencement dates, running dates and how business can best get from here to there.
<P>
In deference to the Minister's sensibilities, I will shock him by speaking entirely on behalf of what he and I both regard as good employers. I refer to employers who wish to observe every jot and tittle--a phrase that I have always wanted to use in the House, alhtough I do not know what it means--of the Bill and wish to comply with it completely. The clause is relevant to them because they will require five different things from the Bill which will enable them to make sure that their businesses can continue successfully even given the procedures they will have to go through when the Bill is enacted, when the Low Pay Commission has reported and when the Government have responded. Each of them is relevant to the time which those businesses will have to make the dispositions that they need to make on behalf of their own businesses.
<P>
The first of those five points is certainty. Businesses need to know as soon as possible what the rate will be and the nuts and bolts--the details--of Government decisions about regulations. There is a peculiarity about amendment No. 261. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``different days may be appointed for different purposes''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 252 seeks to rectify the potential uncertainties that the Government have set up for business. At this late stage, businesses big and small will be dismayed that the Government, having thought long and hard about the Bill which the Committee has considered for a relatively short time, are even now muddying the waters and reducing certainty about the application of the Bill.
<P>
Secondly, businesses want to know that there is a level playing field across the country, that the minimum wage is indeed national and that it will be applied in all its force in all areas at the same time. I am puzzled as to what the Minister is attempting to achieve with amendment No. 261. What division does he imagine between purposes? Why should measures be introduced at different times? If the Government do not say early enough what measures will be introduced, businesses may fear--incorrectly perhaps, but legitimately--that in some parts of the country enforcement will be more rigorous early on than in others. Businesses will be left with increasing uncertainty and will therefore run at less than optimal efficiency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that in this instance the Government got it right first time with the clause, but seem to be backtracking and worsening the position with their afterthoughts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I would not go so far as to say that the Government got it right first time. I support our amendment, but they were right first time in that they are getting worse as they go along. People in the business world will think that extremely regrettable.
<P>
Thirdly, businesses can legitimately demand that they be able to plan ahead. Leaving things up in the air, saying that regulations may be imposed after three months or six, would make matters even worse. Yesterday, I received a letter from a small agricultural business which has experience of minimum wage legislation through the agriculture wages council. The business is under great pressure because of the strong pound and is worried about the wages award this year--it may cause reduced employment. That is clearly a bad thing.
<P>
I wrote back to say that, soon, those circumstances will apply across industry. The business made the specific point that the uncertainty, as it awaits the Agricultural Wages Board pay award, is particularly bad. The sensible way to plan an investment is to assume the worst--that the award will be high and that at times of low profitability workers will be laid off. The Government are in danger of replicating that uncertainty which is currently threatening jobs in my constituency. That must be a bad thing.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire mentioned the CBI's recommendation of a 12-month transition period for phasing in the legislation. Its evidence ought to be particularly attractive to the Minister, because it points out that such a long transition period is particularly important for employers who negotiate collective agreements with trade unions. Unless a full 12-month phasing-in is introduced, covering the full duration of the pay round, collective agreements will need to be renegotiated.
<P>
Given the Minister's fondness for collective bargaining and, indeed, for wider trade union recognition, it would seem perverse for him to reject the CBI's suggestion, which would make it easier for companies to negotiate collectively with trade unions. It is hard to believe that the Minister would find that acceptable.
<P>
The fourth item that business can legitimately demand from Government is fairness. A business may well be faced with taking tough decisions quickly after the Government have been extremely dilatory in producing their evidence to the Low Pay Commission. When they finally did so, we discovered that it was not the battleship we expected but a mouse, because it contained no clear guidance about the rate or anything else. Given that they delayed so long in producing that rather inadequate document--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is beginning to wander. I should appreciate it if he found the path of righteousness again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall return to the true path immediately, Mr. Atkinson. Given that delay, it is all the more unfair for the Government to insist that business has to respond to the proposals in too short a period. The least the Government can do in the interests of fairness, having been dilatory themselves, is to allow business a decent time to plan ahead so that it can organise its affairs and avoid being disadvantaged by having to take too many decisions too quickly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is unfair to impose a burden of renegotiation--which could easily be avoided--on employers and trade unions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Absolutely. I am sure that good trade union negotiators will want to negotiate their collective agreement and then allow it to operate. Constant to-ing and fro-ing on pay negotiations may well affect relations in the workplace and, indeed, employment levels. I am sure that sensible trade unions would not want that to happen.
<P>
The fifth and final reason why business can legitimately demand that the Government give it time for a proper response is to that the possibility of people being required to change premises or to take decisions quickly, which might involve them moving from one part of the country to another, does not distort the labour market in its important transition period as the minimum wage is introduced.
<P>
I know that you do not want us to talk about Northern Ireland, Mr. Atkinson, because we must do that in the clause stand part debate, but we have things to say about different wages and employment levels in the various regions. I hope that we can come back to that in a later debate.
<P>
For good employers--the sort of employers whom the Minister and I agree make up the vast majority of employers in this country--who will obey whatever laws the Government put on them, want good relations with their work forces and do not want to pay poverty wages, it is important that the Minister is clear, either now or as soon as possible, about when the regulations will be introduced, whether everything will happen at the same time--so that the minimum wage is introduced in a big bang, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry put it--and whether he accepts the CBI's argument that a 12-month transition period will help businesses not only economically but in planning their industrial relations strategies. The issue clearly affects not only small businesses but businesses large and small. It will be important for the successful introduction of the policy. I hope, therefore, that the Government will seriously consider the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Good afternoon, Mr. Atkinson. This is a small clause in terms of the space that it takes up, but it has raised a range of issues. To help the Committee, I will deal with the general nature of the clause and then with Government amendment No. 261, the other amendments and the specific questions that were raised.
<P>
Government amendment No. 261 and the group of three Opposition amendments focus on the timetable for bringing some of the provisions in the Bill into effect. I shall briefly clarify the way in which the clause works to set the amendments in context.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The commencement provisions in clause 53 distinguish between the commencement of powers to make regulations and orders and the commencement of other provisions in the Bill, which are not subject to regulation or order-making powers. For example, the power to make regulations under clause 1(3) to set the rate of the national minimum wage will come into effect on the day on which the Act is passed. That is, of course, subject to the will of Parliament. I should remind the Committee of the commitment that I gave at our previous sitting to consult on the regulations to be made under the Bill before their implementation.
<P>
We shall want to ensure that there is a reasonable interval between making the regulations to set the rate and the entry into force of the national minimum wage. We recognise that everyone will need time to adjust and become familiar with the new rights and requirements that the Bill and the regulations will create. At the same time, we do not intend to hang about. Low-paid workers have waited long enough for the right to a decent wage.
<P>
The Low Pay Commission reports at the end of May. It will report on the rate and the timing of its commencement. The Government will take decisions based on the Low Pay Commission's recommendations and on the practicalities. We will also take into account issues such as those raised in the debate today. The Bill allows flexibility to take decisions at the most appropriate time. I have made a commitment to consult on all those matters.
<P>
We recognise that employers need to prepare and that we need to provide them with significant information and undertake effective publicity. The time scale should meet the needs of industry. The introduction of the minimum wage should not disrupt individual companies, but should be a window of opportunity in the labour market. It should be appropriate and wages should be set in terms of the general economy.
<P>
On Tuesday, in answer to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, I reconfirmed the Government's willingness and commitment to ensure that the introduction of the minimum wage meets industry's needs. We want to do so for one simple reason: it is in nobody's interests for the minimum wage to be introduced in a way that is haphazard and difficult to understand and which causes serious problems. That would not be in the interests of the good operation of Government policy or of the employees who could benefit from the minimum wage. The Government are working on the premise that the date of its introduction will be properly managed in terms of the recommendations from the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
The regulation and order-making powers come into effect on the date on which the Act is passed. Other provisions in the Bill will be brought into force by a commencement order. The main provisions in that category deal with the appointment of and further referrals to the statutory Low Pay Commission. They include: workers' rights of enforcement; appointment of enforcement officers; and the application of provisions to special classes of worker, such as agency and home workers.
<P>
Government amendment No. 261 is intended to ensure flexibility and to avoid doubt. It ensures that the commencment order that brings into force the Bill's provisions, other than the regulation and order-making powers, may provide commencement dates for different purposes. For example, there is a link between the commencement of record-keeping requirements by means of regulations under clause 9 and the creation of workers' rights of access to such records under clause 10. Hon. Members will understand that I am speaking only of a hypothetical situation, to assist the Committee. If the Government decided that they had to delay regulations on record keeping for any reason, they might think it preferable to link the timing of those requirements to the commencement of the right of access under clause 10.
<P>
We are speaking only of contingencies. It is not our present intention to bring the Bill's provisions into force at different times. We do not seek a phased introduction of the national minimum wage, nor do we think it likely that we will need to bring provisions into force at different times for different purposes, but it would be unwise to rule out either of those possiblities.

<B>Mr. Bercow</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I will give way to the hon. Member for Ashford.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Minister is making a fascinating point. He has already given us an example of the type of detailed regulation that may need to be delayed. Could he expand on that? I am sure that those observing the Committee's proceedings would find it helpful to know in which areas he thinks there is a possible need for delay.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> First, I did not say that there was a possible need for delay. That is not a proper interpretation of what I said. I made it absolutely clear that the amendment provides flexibility so that if matters arise, we have the capacity to deal with them and to ensure that proper implementation of the proposals, no more and no less. I am giving the Committee examples of what could happen.
<P>
Such events are not unusual. The implementation by the previous Government of the Jobseekers Act 1996 was delayed for more than six months because, for a range of reasons, it could not commence on the dates set out in the regulations. The Government returned to the House and used regulations to delay for six months the commencement of the legislation. We are providing a similar capability here. I am suggesting that the Bill will be overwhelmingly correct, unlike the Jobseekers Act, but it is entirely fair and reasonable that the Government retain the capacity to ensure the proper implementation of their policies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> May I put a straightforward proposition to the Minister? There may be an argument for Government amendment No. 261, and he obviously thinks there is, but to cite the grounds of avoidance of doubt, as he did a moment ago, is surely wrong because the amendment does not avoid doubt but creates it.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman tries his best.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Just try answering, instead of blowing great tantrums.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Diddums. Tantrums, tantrums, tantrums. The hon. Gentleman has great difficulty in accepting that he can make remarks but must then wait a little for others to respond while they first decide whether the question is relevant and needs answering. However, I will attempt to give the hon. Gentleman a grain of comfort on this matter. I made it absolutely clear that the amendment's purpose is to avoid doubt. The Government's basic principle for the Bill's implementation is to give industry--employers and employees--the capacity to implement the Bill in a time scale that renders its introduction non-disruptive, fair and reasonable. The clause and the amendment fit in with that principle.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford asked me for examples. I can think of another example from the Jobseekers Act 1966 under the previous Government. The Government delayed their regulations under that legislation because they had not completed the training programme for the officers who were responsible for implementing the programme. They used a clause similar to this to delay regulations to ensure that officers were trained appropriately.
<P>
To give another example, if we were unable to ensure that appropriate training was completed on time, it would be reasonable for the timings for the operation of officials and the operation of the regulations to be in tandem, no more and no less. Thus, the issue is our capacity to deal with any practical matters which may arise but which we believe are unlikely to arise because of the planning, the drafting of the legislation and the consultation that has and continues to take place, whch is linked to proposals that will come in due course from the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 252, 230 and 251 go in the opposite direction by seeking to reduce rather than increase flexibility. They do not touch on the timing of the regulation-making powers themselves; they would affect only the timing and the manner of commencement of the second category of provisions that I described--for example, the enforcement provisions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford said that he was going to speak on behalf of good employers. I fear that it was too little, too late. The reputation that he has cultivated in Committee goes before him. Indeed, he reminds me of Mr. Micawber, if hon. Members remember him. Income 20 shillings, expenditure 19 shillings and elevenpence. Result happiness. Income 20 shillings, expenditure 20 shillings and a penny. Result misery. The truth is that the hon. Gentleman is an old Scrooge when it comes to the minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am not sure how well versed the Minister is with the works of Dickens. He was talking about different books. If he is comparing me with Mr. Micawber, whose economic analysis seems to have redounded through the generations as being entirely sensible, I am extremely happy to accept the compliment. Mr. Micawber was a sensible man with whom I am happy to be compared.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The Minister for Small Firms reminds me that not only was Mr. Micawber penny pinching, but he was a financial failure. Dickens was, of course, a writer of renown on social justice, and the whole ethos of his writing was to promote new Labour 100 years before it was invented.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that we should close that book now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I make the point merely that if the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the practices outlined in ``The Pickwick Papers'' in the Eatanswill election are anything to do with new Labour, I suggest that the Minister without Portfolio will have something to say to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman tries too hard. We have got the point across.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry raised the issue of appointments for different purposes. As I understand it, that is simply a standard form used by parliamentary counsel in these matters, no more and no less. As part of the continuity of the legislative process, it is used throughout the Bill to ensure that we do not spring surprises on anyone.
<P>
Amendment No. 252 would require the Secretary of State to bring the remaining provisions into force on the same day in a single commencement order. It appears to ask why it should be necessary for the Bill to provide for some provisions to be brought into force on one day and others to be brought into force on ther days. The straightforward answer is that as things stand, we envisage bringing all the remaining provisions of the Bill into force on the same day in a single commencement order. However, as I have already said, it is unwise to rule out the possibility of some provisions commencing at different times or, to put it another way, it is unwise to compel the Secretary of State to bring everything into force at the same time.
<P>
I know that the time approaches one o'clock and I do not want to end in mid-sentence, so perhaphs I shall return to my comments on the amendments later on, if that is helpful.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That will be helpful. Before we adjourn, I shall answer the question about the clause stand part debate. If we have one, I shall be very unhappy if we return to subsection (2), which concerns commencement and with which we have dealt thoroughly.
<P>
