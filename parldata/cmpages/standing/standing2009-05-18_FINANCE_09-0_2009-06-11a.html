morning, Mr. Hood. It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship in this, the ninth sitting of the Finance Bill
Committee.</div>
<a name="09061142000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 158
was tabled by my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary and the hon.
Member for Fareham, so I think that it will prove to be
uncontroversial. The amendment will delete an inconsequential signpost
attached to condition B of proposed new section 397AA to the Income Tax
(Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, which was included to help
taxpayers to interpret the legislation by alerting them to the changes
made in clause 39. However, it has been suggested that the wording
could be misinterpreted. To remove any doubt, the amendment will remove
the wording in
question.</div><a name="09061142000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment
158 agreed
to.</i></div><a name="09061142000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061142000252"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I beg to move amendment 169,
in
schedule 19, page 202, line 15, leave
out from &#145;397AA&#146; to end of line
18.</div><a name="09061142000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that this amendment will sail through as easily as the first one
that we debated this morning. However, as the Financial Secretary has
not appended his name to it, I suspect that it will run into heavier
water.</div><a name="09061142000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
6 April 2008, individual shareholders with holdings of less than 10 per
cent. in non-UK-resident companies have been entitled to a non-payable
dividend tax credit. However, that tax credit was disapplied for
dividends received from offshore funds in the Finance Act 2008, to
counter the inequality of treatment of distributions received from
onshore and offshore bond funds. Schedule 19 will restore
the non-payable dividend tax credit for distributions received from
corporate offshore funds that are largely invested in
equities.</div>
<a name="09061142000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 10 per
cent. ownership threshold is removed for dividends paid by offshore
funds, subject to anti-avoidance rules. However, when an offshore fund
invests more than 60 per cent. of its assets in interest-bearing
assets, or those that are economically similar, individuals receiving
distributions will be treated for tax purposes as having 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 322</div>received interest income and not a dividend or other type of
distribution. As a result, no tax credit will be available and the tax
rates applied will be those that apply to interest. Those rules will
have effect from 22 April 2009. That starting date is the
subject of amendments 167, 166 and 168, which are in the next
group.</div><a name="09061142000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
169 relates to the provision of tax credits to individuals in receipt
of dividends in non-UK resident companies, subject to certain
provisions. Under the new provisions, a tax credit will be made
available to shareholders in a company resident in a qualifying
territory. The amendment would give certainty that, once a territory is
designated as a qualifying territory and has passed the legislative
test, the Treasury will not be able by regulation to disqualify it. The
amendment would provide greater certainty for taxpayers that, once a
qualifying territory has passed the legislative test, there can be no
subsequent change to its
status.</div><a name="09061142000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000253"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The Government take a different view of amendment
169. We believe that it would remove one of the anti-avoidance
provisions that we are making in new section 397BA of ITTOIA. The
purpose of this part of the legislation is to provide the Treasury with
the flexibility to change the classification of an otherwise qualifying
territory to non-qualifying, so that the UK&#146;s tax system can
reflect and respond to future changes in foreign tax systems. It would,
for example, allow the Government to respond to the development of a
new regime in a tax
haven.</div><a name="09061142000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government do not intend to exercise the power unless exceptional
circumstances arise in which there is a substantial risk of loss to the
Exchequer, and any changes would be subject to the affirmative
procedure. A similar provision exists in the transfer pricing rules, so
the approach is well understood. It has never been necessary to use the
provision in the transfer pricing rules, but we believe that it acts as
an important deterrent to prevent the most blatant forms of
avoidance.</div><a name="09061142000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000254"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> For whom does it act as a deterrent? The Minister
is referring to changes that may take place in a tax jurisdiction, so
will it be a deterrent to a sovereign Government who might want to
change their tax rules? Is that an appropriate use of British
power?</div><a name="09061142000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000255"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We believe that the legislation is an appropriate
use of British power and, as I explained, that the UK&#146;s tax
system needs to reflect and respond to future changes in foreign tax
systems. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the regimes that may
operate in tax
havens.</div><a name="09061142000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have never had to use the rule on transfer pricing, but we believe that
it has acted as a deterrent. Amendment 169 would remove
flexibility and curtail the Government&#146;s ability to respond to
changes in tax systems abroad, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="09061142000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000256"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> One of my predecessors as Member of Parliament for
the area of Hampshire that I represent was Lord Palmerston, who was a
great believer in gunboat diplomacy, as well as the builder of
Palmerston&#146;s folly across the top of Portsdown hill. I thought
that the days of gunboat diplomacy had passed, but we have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 323</div>here the tax equivalent in a power that is intended to deter sovereign
Governments, or perhaps former British colonies, from changing their
tax regime. It is curious that the Government should have such a power,
that a Minister should suggest that we threaten other Governments with
it, and that it should be a deterrent. The provision suggests that
there may be a more martial spirit in the Treasury than we
suspected.</div><a name="09061142000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take on board the fact that the power has not been used in the transfer
pricing regime, and that it will be subject to the affirmative
procedure. I am sure that tax havens are quaking in their boots because
the measure has been included in the Bill. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061142000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09061142000044"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000257"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 166, in schedule
19, page 204, line 14, leave out &#145;22&#146; and
insert
&#145;6&#146;.</div><a name="09061142000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000258"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following: amendment 167, in schedule 19, page 204, line 16, leave out
&#145;22&#146; and insert
&#145;6&#146;.</div><a name="09061142000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
168, in
schedule 19, page 204, line 18, leave
out &#145;22&#146; and insert
&#145;6&#146;.</div><a name="09061142000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000259"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Having disposed of the threat from sovereign
Governments, we now come to the threat from taxpayers. The amendments
are relatively simple, and would replace &#147;22&#148; with
&#147;6&#148;. Hon. Members who have not perused the detail of the
schedule may wonder why I tabled the
amendments.</div><a name="09061142000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
changes in schedule 19 apply from the date of the Budget, but some tax
advisers suggested that it would be better if the rules were applied
from the start of the tax year. That would be advantageous for
taxpayers because the rules applying from 22 April are better than the
previous rules. There was some surprise among tax advisers that the
measure was not made effective from 6 April 2009, in line with
the announcement in the 2008 Budget, on which taxpayers may have
relied.</div>
<a name="09061142000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chartered
Institute of Taxation has noted that the draft legislation published in
January 2009, which continued to be available on the HMRC website
until  16 May last month, included the proposal that these
changes should</div>
<a name="09061142000194"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have effect in
cases in which a relevant distribution arises, is paid over or is
treated as paid in the tax year
2009-2010.&#148;</div><a name="09061142000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Bill was introduced, there was some surprise that it had the date
of 22 April in it. I know that that question was raised during the
Finance Bill open day, when CIOT
asked:</div><a name="09061142000195"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Will
the new measure to extend the entitlement to a non-payable dividend tax
credit to individuals with holdings of 10% or more be made effective
from 6 April 2009 rather than 22 April 2009 in line with the previous
announcement in Budget 2008 upon which taxpayers may have reasonably
relied?&#148;</div><a name="09061142000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
went on to ask whether HMRC will be able to able to grant concessionary
treatment to someone who in good faith has relied on last year&#146;s
Budget
announcement.</div><a name="09061142000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
argument that HMRC used at the time was that the announcement was only
general and should not have been relied upon by taxpayers. Normally,
the Budget would have been expected to have taken place  in
March and the change would have been effective from 6 April&#151;the
start of the tax year. The delay in the Budget has created a disconnect
and changed taxpayers&#146; reasonable expectation, which
were&#151;in line with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 324</div>draft legislation published at the start of this year&#151;that the
commencement date would be the start of the tax year. That would
reflect the general statement of intention made by the Government in
the Budget 2008 when the changes were
outlined.</div><a name="09061142000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000260"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is true that, as the hon. Gentleman says, the
Budget note from last year&#146;s Budget stated that the extension of
the shareholdings of 10 per cent. or more in foreign companies would be
made effective from 6 April 2009. It is the convention to make tax
changes effective from the beginning of the tax year, and with that
assumption date stated in the Budget note was 6 April. However, as he
knows, because the Budget did not take place until 22 April, the
changes to the non-payable dividend tax credit could not be made
earlier without the measure including retrospective legislation. That
is why the legislation is effective from 22 rather than 6 April. Given
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that some individuals might have
relied on that to determine their tax affairs, HMRC would examine any
hard cases on their individual merits, although it cannot offer
concessionary
treatment.</div><a name="09061142000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is true that, for the legislation to come into effect before the Budget
date&#151;when it was announced&#151;we would have to have evidence
of extraordinary circumstances, such as the existence of damaging tax
avoidance. That is not the case in this instance. Also, it is right to
recognise that making the measure effective from 6 April could
disadvantage some taxpayers&#151;for example, those who were affected
by the class of share definition&#151;retrospectively. Again, that is
why the Government decided that 22 April should be the date on which
the legislation should come in to effect: to ensure that the
legislation is compliant with the Human Rights Act 1998.</div>
<a name="09061142000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
sympathy with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s arguments. The issues to
which he referred are a result of the Budget being later than normal. I
have discussed how HMRC might examine any hard cases on their
individual merits, and I hope that with those comments in mind, the
hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09061142000208"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000261"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his response,
particularly for his comments on how HMRC will look at hard cases.
However, the Government clearly set out their intention to apply the
changes from the start of the tax year and it was reasonable of
taxpayers to assume that that would be the case. Solely for political
reasons, with the delay of the Budget, taxpayers lost out. They did not
lose out through their own activity, but because of the decision taken
by the Chancellor to timetable the Budget for after the G20 summit. The
Government should reflect on that, because they
have&#151;&#147;misled&#148; is not the right word&#151;given
the impression that something would happen from the start of the tax
year. That has not happened for political reasons, rather than for any
other good fiscal reasons, and that point should be taken on board by
the Government.</div>

have used the late interest rules to get a tax reduction for interest
expenses when they have needed it. That has particularly been the case
with part equity-backed businesses. If an interest reduction cannot be
used in the current year, it will be carried forward as a non-trade
debit that can be offset against non-trade credits. That was not felt
to be particularly useful, so companies would therefore trigger the
debit when they could use it or needed it. The schedule takes the
flexibility away on timing for finance costs.</div>
<a name="09061142000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s counter-argument might be that, as the legislation
has been partly introduced for anti-avoidance purposes, that might well
be the purpose of removing that flexibility. However, companies could
still obtain tax relief when the interest is paid using
companies&#146; non-qualifying territories&#151;for example,
Jersey. That means that they cannot refer an accruals basis for tax
relief when they need to. Will the Minister comment on the interaction
between the schedule and the debt cap rules? Some clarity is required
and I would be grateful for his thoughts on how that clarity
might  be
introduced.</div><a name="09061142000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000263"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> First, I acknowledge the comments made by the
hon. Gentleman on how the consultation was handled. I am sure that that
statement will be welcomed by my officials who have undertaken the
consultation exercise. He is right to point out that there is
widespread recognition for what the Government are doing; there were
only some minor points raised regarding the issue of loan relationships
involving connected parties.</div>
<a name="09061142000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">He pointed to
the issue of private equity companies. As he is aware, the legislation
contains an election to enable a company to stay on a pay basis for a
year after the change. That should give companies time to rearrange
loans if they think they need to. The private equity industry has
raised some practical difficulties with HMRC, where interest is payable
to a company controlled by a number of private equity investors. Those
are matters that we believe are best dealt with in guidance and HMRC is
discussing them with the private equity
industry.</div><a name="09061142000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061142000264"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): In
the current economic circumstances, was any consideration given by the
Treasury to extending the period of 12 months? The Minister will be
aware that, particularly given the potential difficulty of acquiring
funding, it may well be that that period, which might normally seem
quite a sensible transition period, will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div>not prove long enough for the reorganisation of finances for private
equity companies in this difficult economic
situation.</div>
<a name="09061142000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000265"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Well, we always consider these matters carefully.
It is our judgment that a period of 12 months is a reasonable period of
time to allow companies to rearrange loans if they need to do
so.</div>
<a name="09061142000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point was
made about whether or not an election should be allowed for private
equity groups to deduct interest on a paid basis, if they want to. In
response, I would say that allowing companies the choice to deduct
interest, either when it accrues or when it is paid, would go against
one of the key principles of the corporation tax rules on the taxation
of interest. Interest is taxable and relievable as it accrues in the
accounts. We are not persuaded that an exception needs to be made for
private equity. However, HMRC will work with the industry in improving
its guidance in this area.</div>
<a name="09061142000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
about the interaction with the debt cap was made by the hon. Member for
Fareham. Specifically on that point, I can say to him in response that
ordinary loan relationship rules, such as late interest, are applied
before the debt cap applies. That is another matter that we will cover
in the guidance.</div>
<a name="09061142000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said before, HMRC is in discussions with the private equity industry
about these matters and we believe that they can be satisfactorily
addressed through guidance. The industry is happy with that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000266"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I wish to raise an issue about the clause. The
changes in the clause enable transactions between rated parties so
that, where there is a waiver of a property or trade debt, these
releases will not be taxable in the debtor company nor will there be a
tax relief in the creditor company. So, within the group these changes
are tax-neutral.</div>
<a name="09061142000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there are other inter-company balances that arise other than through
trade or property debts. It has been suggested that it might be helpful
to enable long-standing inter-company balances to be written off and
relief to be given, so that there is no taxable transaction taking
place in the debtor company nor is the tax relief given in the creditor
company. I just wonder whether the Government have thought about
extending the relief to companies in those
circumstances.</div>
<a name="09061142000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000267"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am not sure that I have a direct answer to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s question at this point in time. He will be
aware of what we are trying to achieve through the clause. He will also
be aware that the clause covers trade and property business debts. He
asked why there could not be releases of any money debts between group
members and he specifically made the point about the period of time.
Covering other sorts of debts, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column327" />Column number: 327</div>such as those relating to the management expenses of investment
companies, would have made the clause considerably longer and more
complicated, and the representations that have been made to the
Government have not suggested that, in practice, such debts cause as
many problems as trade debts. However, we have not ruled out the
possibility of further changes in the future. We believe that we have
covered most of what needs to be done, but we would be happy to receive
further representations from business and the professions about any
real life problems involving money debts that are not within the
clause&#146;s
scope.</div><a name="09061142000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

exchange:

Bill.</div>
<a name="09061142000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000268"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I have just one question about schedule
21. Paragraph 2 states
that</div><a name="09061142000196"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
arrangements cause the company or any other company to gain a tax
advantage (other than a negligible tax
advantage).&#148;</div><a name="09061142000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
21 introduces anti-avoidance provisions, but why is there not a more
traditional motive test? Paragraph 2 offers a very broad
definition, but when anti-avoidance is involved, one normally expects
the more traditional wording where the main purpose involves tax
avoidance. Paragraph 2 might cover a much broader range of transactions
than would normally be covered by a targeted anti-avoidance
measure.</div><a name="09061142000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000269"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> This is an important schedule in relation to
targeting anti-avoidance. It is designed to stop schemes that involve
abuse of the tax rules for what is known as forex matching. A number of
such schemes have been disclosed to HMRC, and have been widely used in
practice. It is estimated that stopping such avoidance will bring in
additional corporation tax of &#163;20 million a year and prevent
further losses to the Exchequer of approximately &#163;120 million a
year. It is therefore important that we introduce
legislation.</div><a name="09061142000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman has asked why the legislation does not contain a purpose
test. Existing provisions in the tax rule for loans and derivatives
deny relief for losses where the loan or derivative has a tax-avoidance
purpose. Although those provisions may deny relief for losses generated
by forex matching schemes, they can involve some very difficult and
long drawn-out arguments between HMRC and the businesses concerned. The
Bill aims to put it beyond doubt that such schemes do not work, even
where they are designed to reduce the risk of a purpose test challenge.
The tax avoidance purpose rule would therefore be counter-productive.
It would not give certainty to compliant companies, because experience
suggests that such companies are likely still to be concerned about
whether their purposes could be perceived as unallowable. It might also
provide avoiders a loophole through which they could escape, where
contemporaneous evidence of a company&#146;s purpose is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 328</div>lacking. We considered a purpose test, but there are clear reasons why
we deliberately rejected it. Our approach is more
robust.</div><a name="09061142000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000270"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I have just a couple of questions about the
schedule. The first relates to the clarity of the guidance that has
been issued so far on the matter. My second and more substantive
concern may seem a curious one for me to raise given my earlier remarks
about the way in which the rules on the debt cap and dividend exemption
seem to be driven by the EU, and the fact that the Government have
assured us that they were robust to challenge. However, it has been
suggested that the rules on schedule 22 may not be robust and
may be challenged on whether or not they comply with EU
rules.</div>
<a name="09061142000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me deal
with the guidance point first. There is concern that although some
guidance has already been issued by HMRC it does not address all the
questions raised by industry during the consultation on
schedule 22. The grandfathering rules that apply until 1
December 2009 are helpful, but they should address immediate industry
uncertainty.</div><a name="09061142000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
characteristics-based definition is potentially so wide-ranging that
instead of providing greater certainty, it is likely to make the
position even more unclear. It is suggested that there may be a range
of offshore arrangements that are not, in substance, funds, but that
may be subject to the rules. There is concern regarding interpretation
around offshore companies&#146; fixed lives, shared buy-back
arrangements and liquidation exit routes as well as special purpose
vehicles under partnership. It may be the Government&#146;s intention
to ensure that such areas are not caught by schedule 22, but, as they
stand, the broad nature of the rules catches those entities.</div>
<a name="09061142000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">This schedule
introduces into legislation the definition of an offshore fund. It can
be</div> <a name="09061142000197"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
mutual fund constituted by a body
corporate&#148;</div><a name="09061142000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div>
<a name="09061142000198"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a mutual fund
under which property is held on trust for the participants where the
trustees of the property are not resident in the United
Kingdom&#148;</div><a name="09061142000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div>
<a name="09061142000199"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a mutual fund
constituted by other arrangements that create rights in the nature of
co-ownership&#148;</div><a name="09061142000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">where
those arrangements are affected by non-UK law. The schedule then sets
out some conditions that a mutual fund might need to satisfy to then be
defined as an offshore fund. Therefore, some certainty is required.
Uncertainty does not only impact on UK investors; it also creates
additional complexity and administrative 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 329</div>burdens for the offshore asset management industry, which already has
quite a lot to do in getting its funds in shape to meet the
rules.</div>
<a name="09061142000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
issue goes back to the breadth of the funds that might be caught. The
offshore funds&#146; tax regime does not comply with the UK&#146;s
obligations under agreements that create the European economic area.
Previous legislation linked the definition of offshore funds to the
regulatory definition, as in sections 235 and 236 of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000, and was unlikely in practice
to apply to mainstream retail investments. However, the proposed
definition set out in schedule 22 appears to bring a far greater range
of investments within the definition of an offshore fund&#151;that
was the comment I made in the first part of my remarks about trying to
have greater clarity. The definition is so broad that the question of
the regime&#146;s non-compliance with EC law arises in
practice.</div>
<a name="09061142000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been
given the following example, in which a UK bank offers, as a retail
investment,</div><a name="09061142000200"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
debt security which redeems at any time after a minimum holding period
of, say, 12 months by reference to the FTSE 100 (though any chargeable
asset, or index of chargeable assets, for capital gains tax purpose
would provide the same
result).</div><a name="09061142000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">In
the absence of complicating factors, such an investment should be
regarded as a capital gains asset for tax purposes, with any gains,
made on disposal of the investment subject to tax at 18%. The offshore
funds rules will not apply because the mutual fund is constituted by a
UK resident
company.&#148;</div><a name="09061142000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
if the same debt security
is</div><a name="09061142000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;issued
by a French or a Luxembourg financial institution under the proposed
new
definition&#148;,</div><a name="09061142000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
definition is sufficiently broad to cause that identical investment to
be subject to different rules, which would result in any gains being
treated as income and therefore taxed at the higher rate. Therefore, if
the Government introduce their plans for a 50 per cent. tax rate, those
gains could be subject to tax at that rate, whereas the same security
issued in a UK resident fund would be taxed as capital gains at 18 per
cent. There appears, therefore, to be a difference between UK issuers
of investments and non-UK issuers of investments, which constitutes
discrimination. That, it is argued, then constitutes a restriction in
the free movement of capital from UK resident investors to financial
institutions resident in other EEA member states, which would be
unlawful. I would be grateful if the Minister could comment on whether
the Treasury believes that that differential treatment renders the
rules in breach of EU
law.</div><a name="09061142000100"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000271"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Schedule 22 is in two parts. The first part deals
with a new definition of an offshore fund for tax purposes and the
second part deals with the capital gains tax treatment of participants
in certain offshore funds. The hon. Member for Fareham has concentrated
on the first part, and, as I think that we agree on the second part, I
will not specifically refer to
it.</div><a name="09061142000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman knows, following extensive consultation last year
the Government introduced powers, in the Finance Act 2008, to modernise
the offshore funds tax regime. At that time, we said that we would
consult further with industry on a new definition for offshore funds,
with a view to including that in the Finance Bill 2009.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 330</div><a name="09061142000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Additional
consultation has led to the inclusion of a new offshore funds tax
definition, in part 1. With the new offshore funds tax definition, the
Government aim to provide more certainty to UK investors and funds; to
achieve, to the extent possible, economic parity with the position of
UK investors in UK-authorised funds; and to strengthen existing
anti-avoidance rules so that UK investors who choose to invest in
offshore funds do so based on a commercial decision, rather than for
tax purposes. The new definition uses a characteristics-based approach,
which the hon. Gentleman referred to. That aims to counter unintended
tax advantage being obtained when offshore arrangements are technically
outside the current definition of an offshore fund but are economically
the same as such a
fund.</div><a name="09061142000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall now turn briefly to the substance of the schedule, before
responding directly to some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions.
Paragraph 40A defines the type of body that will be an offshore fund if
it meets the characteristics defining a mutual fund. Paragraph 40B sets
out three conditions that must be satisfied for a fund to be a mutual
fund. There are powers to make regulations to amend the third
condition, using the affirmative procedure. In addition, certain
closed-ended entities are
excluded.</div><a name="09061142000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Exclusions
apply for those investors in closed-ended entities who can effectively
redeem their investment only on the winding-up of the arrangements.
Those exclusions are applicable when either the arrangements have no
pre-determined termination date or are only generating a capital return
and do not give rise to any income, or when all income generated is
paid to credit to the investor and is taxed as income. The powers in
this part allow for future changes to the legislation by regulations,
and the Government will continue to monitor the area for avoidance and
will use those powers if it becomes evident that schemes are being
devised to convert returns that would otherwise be income into capital
gains. The Government will also be prepared to make changes in the
future if it is clear that certain arrangements should be excluded from
the tax
definition.</div><a name="09061142000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
part also amends the regulation-making powers introduced by the 2008
Act to repeal the existing offshore tax funds legislation and to ensure
that existing investors in arrangements that do not meet the current
definition of offshore funds are not adversely impacted by the change.
We have made draft regulations available to the Committee, and they set
out certain exceptions for UK investors from the tax charge to an
offshore
gain.</div><a name="09061142000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman made some points about guidance. As he knows, the
guidance has been published by HMRC as a draft for consultation and is
based on the offshore funds definition. I confirm that further guidance
will be published on the operation of the rules. HMRC is happy to make
the guidance clearer, following consultation responses on specific
issues.</div><a name="09061142000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also right to emphasise the Government&#146;s position, which is
that we believe that there is no discrimination here with regard to the
treatment of schemes and how they comply with EU rules. We intend to
treat investors in funds that provide taxable income to investors as
authorised UK funds in a similar way to investors in UK-authorised
funds. So there is no
discrimination.</div><a name="09061142000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000272"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments
about the compliance with EU law, but does he believe that, in the
example that I gave, where a UK bank 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>officer reads as a retail investment a debt security that redeems at any
time after, say, a minimum holding period and that return is subject to
the movements of the FTSE, for example, which is not dissimilar to
condition C in new section 40B, that return would be treated as income?
The industry believes that that would be treated as a capital return
and taxed at 18 per cent., not at the investor&#146;s highest rate of
income
tax.</div><a name="09061142000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000273"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I do not want to be drawn into commenting on
specific examples and giving rulings on them. I want to rest on the
fact that we believe that what we are doing is compliant with EU law.
Having heard what the hon. Gentleman says with regard to
industry&#146;s concerns about the treatment, I will see whether I
can clarify matters, whether through correspondence or other
routes.</div><a name="09061142000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061142000274"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): What practical steps do
the Government take in relation to the general issue of compliance with

is it solely opinion from here? What consultation goes on with
Europe?</div><a name="09061142000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000275"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As the hon. Gentleman is aware, extensive
financial and legal expertise is available to the Government. When
drafting legislation, the experts are aware of EU law that is extant in
this and other areas. When drafting legislation we always seek to
ensure that it will be
EU-compliant.</div><a name="09061142000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
policy is to exclude partnerships where they are tax-transparent for
both income and capital gains purposes. If we receive representations
saying that certain partnerships are included in the definition but
should fall outside it the Government will be happy to address that in
regulation.</div><a name="09061142000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
debt securities issued by EU institutions, debt will not be treated as
a participating interest in an offshore fund, unless it gives the right
to participate in profits. That point is addressed in the extract of
regulations previously provided to the Committee. I am more than happy
to provide, in correspondence, further clarification, if it is

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000276"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The clause has found widespread support within the
insurance sector. There was a differential in the tax treatment of
equalisation reserves between conventional insurance companies and
those people who participated at Lloyd&#146;s, particularly the
corporate partnership members. The clause tries to address an important
issue that has emerged over the past couple 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div>of years: for a certain group of reinsurers, it has become increasingly
more attractive, for tax and regulatory reasons, to move their
redomicile activities from the UK to Bermuda. The clause should help to
redress some of the competitive issues. Will the Minster say a little
more about what else the Government are doing to address the
competitive challenge that exists in reinsurance, because London has
been seen as the primary insurance market? Lloyd&#146;s has a strong
brand globally and is an important part of our financial services
sector, but there has been that shift from London to Bermuda, and
several people have questioned whether the Government are doing enough
to reverse that
move.</div><a name="09061142000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000277"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that that
provision has been welcomed by the reinsurance industry, which has
certainly been pressing us on this for a considerable time. The clause
will put in place Treasury power to make regulations that will extend
the benefit of tax relief on making equalisation reserves to corporate
and partnership members of the Lloyd&#146;s insurance market. He is
right to point out that general insurance companies currently benefit
from relief when they are required by the Financial Services Authority,
as the insurance regulator, to make equalisation reserves, but
Lloyd&#146;s members are not required to do so. Essentially, we are
seeking to level the playing field, and that has been welcomed by
Lloyd&#146;s.</div>
<a name="09061142000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations&#151;a draft is available to the Committee&#151;follow
the existing rules that apply to general insurance companies and are
suitably adapted to grant tax relief where Lloyd&#146;s members
choose to maintain notional reserves equivalent to the equalisation
reserves maintained by general insurance companies. The clause
increases fairness and helps the competitiveness of the UK insurance
market.</div><a name="09061142000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
generally on competitiveness, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that
groups take into account a range of factors when reviewing their
domicile, including regulation and its effect on credit ratings, the
availability and quality of local staff, professional support services,
infrastructure and also tax. We believe that London shapes up well as
an attractive environment and a world-leading, professional centre with
support and an unsurpassed insurance industry presence and
experience.</div>
<a name="09061142000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The UK
corporate tax burden compares favourably with those of similarly
developed countries. Luke Savage, the finance director of
Lloyd&#146;s, has expressed strong support for the measure, which is
expected to make a significant difference to members&#146; tax bills
and improve Lloyd&#146;s market competitiveness compared with other
general insurers. That addresses the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point
about Bermuda and other jurisdictions. The Government will always want
to keep these matters under review, but the clause has been welcomed by
Lloyd&#146;s and the industry. We are acutely aware of the need for a
competitive regime, but tax is not the only
consideration.</div>
<a name="09061142000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061142000278"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): Does the Minister recognise
that Bermuda, like the Cayman Islands, is a Crown dependency and that
there is unfinished work to be done? It is not just a question of
making a competitive environment; it is about doing something about a
regime over which we have some control.</div>

Pearson:</b> I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. He
will be aware of the work being done on tax havens and other
jurisdictions, and of the extensive amount of work involved in
insolvency. It is important that we, as a Government, continue to work
closely with the industry to discuss the impact of the proposed
solvency II changes, and the competitive position more generally, and
to take appropriate action where needed to ensure that the UK maintains

in
schedule 24, page 233, line 16, leave
out &#145;485B&#146; and insert
&#145;486B&#146;.</div><a name="09061142000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000281"></a>The

Government amendment
159.</div><a name="09061142000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000282"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I shall be extremely brief. We sometimes have
debates by proxy through various interest groups that are knowledgeable
in a field making representations to the Government and Opposition.
Amendment 176 was suggested by the Chartered Institute of Taxation as a
more preferable form of drafting. I want to give the Minister the
opportunity to consider what seems to be a reasonable representation
and to find out whether he concludes that the proposal is superior to
the current drafting.</div>
<a name="09061142000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000283"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> Welcome back to the Chair, Mr. Hood. I
would like to say a few words about clause 48 and schedule 24 before
responding to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment.</div><a name="09061142000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Current
tax law contains targeted anti-avoidance rules to ensure that amounts
economically equivalent to interest are charged corporation tax in the
same way as interest, instead of in a lower tax way. Clause 48 and
schedule 24 replace those piecemeal measures with a rule that sets out
the principle comprehensively. It is the result of consultation over
the past couple of years on the use of principles-based legislation to
tackle avoidance involving disguised interest. Subject to some
exclusions, a return equivalent to interest will be charged to
corporation tax as interest in all circumstances where it would not
currently be taxed as income.</div>
<a name="09061142000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule
ensures that companies party to arrangements that produce interest for
them in a disguised form are subject to corporation tax in the same way
as if they had received actual interest. It replaces a range of
targeted rules with the comprehensive rule that I have described, which
charges companies corporation tax on all returns equivalent to interest
in the same way as on interest, unless a specific exemption covers the
returns. There are specific exceptions for arrangements where it is
reasonable to assume that avoiding corporation tax is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 334</div>not the main purpose, or where the return simply results from an
increase in the value of certain shares held by the
company.</div>
<a name="09061142000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000284"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> One of the representations that we received from
outside bodies was about the
phrase</div><a name="09061142000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
is reasonable to
assume&#148;</div><a name="09061142000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
proposed new section 486D(1). The concern is that that is a subjective
test, whereas normally a much more robust test is used for
anti-avoidance measures. In such cases, the principal purpose is to
avoid tax, and that is demonstrable. Here, Inland Revenue or Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs might think that &#147;it is
reasonable&#148;. However, others might disagree about whether it is
reasonable to make such an assumption. Will the Financial Secretary
give some clarity as to why that wording was chosen, particularly as it
was not the wording in the original drafts that were consulted
on?</div><a name="09061142000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000285"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> There certainly has been some interest on this
point, as the hon. Gentleman says. Tax legislation already uses the
words &#147;reasonable to assume&#148; in a wide variety of
contexts, and HMRC has taken legal advice on legislation containing
those words on several occasions. However, the advice would not have
relevance to disguised interest legislation because of the different
context.</div>
<a name="09061142000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The words in
the schedule are words of limitation and would be interpreted as such
by the courts. In practice, &#147;reasonable to assume&#148; will
only rarely make a difference to the way in which the test is applied,
since an unsupported assertion as to purpose would, in any case, not be
accepted by HMRC as establishing true purpose, if objective evidence
pointed to the contrary. Any tax avoidance test based on purpose
already implicitly contains a reasonable assumption requirement. The
wording in the schedule simply makes that fact explicit. We have
thought about this point and discussed it with several outside
organisations. We think that it is helpful to have the words for
clarity.</div><a name="09061142000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been extensive consultation on that narrow point and also on the
wider point of using principles-based legislation to tackle avoidance.
The aim of such legislation is to stop avoidance activity in the area
concerned and to allow the repeal of traditional legislation that sets
out a series of detailed conditions to be met before the legislation
can
apply.</div><a name="09061142000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
traditional approach can, in effect, allow avoidance, because taxpayers
can seek to sidestep the detailed conditions. It is much more difficult
to sidestep an approach based on a comprehensive principle with
exceptions built in. We are turning around the way in which the
legislation operates, and we think that that approach will be more
effective. There has been a great deal of discussion about
it.</div><a name="09061142000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new legislation allows the removal of 30 pages of existing detailed
anti-avoidance legislation&#151;it will be replaced with the 11 pages
here&#151;and signals that we think that the principles-based
approach, which has been widely discussed, can be made to work, and
that we will in future consider its use in appropriate areas of
legislation as a means of tackling persistent attempts at
avoidance.</div><a name="09061142000142"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000286"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> The Financial Secretary has gone into detail about
some of the thinking here. Is he not concerned that the spirit of the
age, whether on tax law or the law 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 335</div>as a whole, is much more towards certainty&#151;in other words, having
deeper rules in a much broader context&#151;rather than a
principles-based approach? One of the concerns in what will inevitably
and continuously be a competitive world, where we try to attract the
best brains and businesses to our shores, is that the lack of certainty
in the principles-based approach is likely to be detrimental to the
better interests of this
country.</div><a name="09061142000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can see that there are great benefits from the Treasury&#146;s point
of view&#151;the Financial Secretary made that explicit. In effect,
he is suggesting that most avoidance schemes will be disallowed at the
outset unless they can be shown to have properly sidestepped from the
purposes of the Treasury, but the lack of certainty that a
principles-based system brings can surely only be detrimental to the
better interests of this
country.</div><a name="09061142000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000287"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I suggest that our approach gives greater
certainty. The problem with the old approach was that legislation set
out that taxpayers could not do this, that or the other. It was pretty
straightforward for people to devise slight variations on what was
being prevented and then to argue they could carry on doing it. That
created a fair amount of uncertainty&#151;and certainly a lack of
clarity&#151;about the position. With this approach, however, the
position is absolutely clear: if it really is interest, the tax needs
to be paid on that basis. The arrangement is pretty clear and
certain.</div><a name="09061142000211"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="09061142000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
disguised interest rules apply where a company is party to an
arrangement that produces a return that is economically equivalent to
interest. There are some exceptions, which are clearly set out. I do
not agree that such an approach produces uncertainty; if anything, the
reverse is true. We have had an interesting debate on principles-based
legislation. This clause and schedule and the next clause and schedule
embody that approach, which is, in a sense, experimental; it has not
been tried before. The intention was to legislate in last year&#146;s
Finance Bill along those lines, but the representative bodies argued
that we should take longer, because it was a significant departure from
how we legislated in the past. We have been able to resolve the
concerns about the principles-based approach, which I think is a good
one, not least from the point of view of
certainty.</div><a name="09061142000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Taunton explained the background to amendment 176. He
is absolutely right: there was an error in the schedule as drafted. We
spotted the error, I am pleased to say, and it has been accepted as an
error to be corrected as a matter of printing. Nevertheless, I am
grateful to him for tabling his amendment and drawing attention to the
error in that way.</div>
<a name="09061142000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 159 also corrects a typographical error, but one that cannot
be dealt with as a matter of printing. The error, which is in the
transitional rules, would have the effect that certain types of
arrangement already in place on 22 April 2009 would be excluded
inappropriately from the scope of the legislation. The amendment
corrects the error and ensures that the disguised interest legislation
can apply to such arrangements. The amendment has effect from Budget
day, on the basis that the legislation was widely consulted on before
the Budget using drafts that did not include either of the errors. It
can affect only transactions that were already in place on Budget day
and were caught by existing anti-avoidance legislation.</div>

Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments 179 and
180.</div><a name="09061142000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000290"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The second example in the Bill of the use of
principles-based legislation, the schedule secures that receipts that
derive from a transfer of a right to income are treated as income for
the purposes of income tax and corporation tax. Like the measure on
disguised interest, it is the result of consultation on
principles-based
legislation.</div><a name="09061142000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Case
law shows that it is possible for companies and individuals to convert
income into capital for tax purposes by selling the right to income
streams. For individuals, such schemes are particularly attractive as a
result of the capital gains tax increase to 18 per cent. Avoidance in
this area has led to a wide range of piecemeal measures that treat
sales of income as giving rise to amounts charged to tax as income. The
schedule replaces the various targeted anti-avoidance rules with a
comprehensive rule that ensures that a company or individual cannot
avoid tax by selling income for a lump sum that is taxed more
favourably than the income would have been&#151;for example, a
capital gain covered by losses.</div>
<a name="09061142000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a result
of the consultation, schedule 25, like the preceding schedule, contains
specific exceptions&#151;in this case, for transfers of income that
are the consequences of the transfer of the asset from which the income
arises, or where a transfer of income is the consequence of the grant
or surrender of a lease over land. There are also exceptions for
disposals of rights in respect of oil licences. The new legislation
saves 15 pages of anti-avoidance legislation, using only eight pages,
and is another example of the principles-based approach being made to
work.</div>
<a name="09061142000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments correct an error in the schedule, which replaces
a number of enactments. Among the repealed provisions is a rule that
currently taxes the sale of the right to annual payments as
income&#151;that is, recurring payments of an income nature that are
paid under a legal obligation. That repealed provision contains a
number of exceptions for sales of annual payments that are already
subject to appropriate tax treatment. Owing to an oversight, the new
transfers of income rules do not replicate those exclusions, but they
should have done. Without the amendments, the new rules could impose an
additional and inappropriate tax charge 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 337</div>on transactions of that kind, so they simply restore the exclusions and
make sure that they continue to apply under the new
legislation.</div><a name="09061142000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000291"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Is not the Financial Secretary making the case
against principles-based legislation? Instead of laying down things
that one knows are wrong and saying that they must not be done, the
principles-based approach sets out a principle that is thought to say
what things are wrong, but can catch things that are perfectly
acceptable. Is not the Minister outlining that in this exemption? Is
not that the problem that principles-based legislation
creates?</div><a name="09061142000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000292"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> No, I do not think it is necessarily a problem. It
is perfectly possible, with the new approach, to set out clearly things
that are excluded, and that is what we are doing. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s description highlights the difficulty with the old
approach. If one sets out in legislation things that people are not
allowed to do, it is not difficult for them to come up with a slight
variation that they will do instead. The disguised interest rules that
we were talking about a moment ago were introduced in 2005, but it has
been necessary every year to amend them to capture the new things that
people have come up with. I hope that annual amendments will not be
required under the new
approach.</div><a name="09061142000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000293"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> But again, I think the Minister is making my point
for me. Yes, the approach favours the Revenue in catching more
avoidance, but it is catching innocent taxpayers as well. Under the
previous approach, we said that something was definitely wrong and,
yes, it had to be updated every year, but taxpayers who were acting
innocently were not caught by it, whereas the new approach will capture
people whom the Minister has not realised should be exempted, so he
will have to introduce more and more exemptions each
year.</div><a name="09061142000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000294"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I do not agree. It is important that we get the
exceptions right and set them out clearly and correctly, which the
amendments will help us to do. However, I do not agree that the
approach we are adopting needs to catch people who are doing perfectly
proper and innocent things. Of course, if an exception is subsequently
drawn to our attention, it will be perfectly possible to include it,
but I do not think we will be in the position of having to make annual
changes, which was the position under the old
approach.</div><a name="09061142000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000295"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> There is an obvious analogy with the Green Book on
Members&#146; expenses. That had to be rewritten every year, but we
have now moved to a principles-based decision-making procedure. The
only problem with that is that it will lead to some post-hoc judgments
being made that might not be
favourable.</div><a name="09061142000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000296"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman draws an interesting and perhaps
illuminating analogy to assist the Committee in its
deliberations.</div>
<a name="09061142000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the approach we have chosen is right. This is something of a pilot and
we will need to see how it goes, but the work has so far shown that it
is a promising approach that we can perhaps make more of in the future.
I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 338</div><a name="09061142000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000297"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Given that the Financial Secretary made some
broader remarks about the schedule, perhaps it is appropriate for me to
make some comments about the schedule and ask one or two
questions.</div>
<a name="09061142000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
principles-based approach and the breadth of the schedule, I understand
the problem that the Minister wants to avoid of having to make annual
changes to legislation and introduce more exceptions to capture
different types of transaction. However, my hon. Friend the Member for
Wellingborough put the alternative case on the breadth of the schedule
and what sort of transactions it actually covers. Are we certain that
swapping narrow rules for a broader-based approach is the right way to
go?</div>
<a name="09061142000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">An example
has been raised with me that illustrates the problem that the
Government are facing and the issue that my hon. Friend has discussed.
Throughout the consultation process, the policy focus of this part of
the Bill was on the corporate sector. There was no suggestion that the
rules in the Bill would be applied to individuals to any appreciable
extent. However, in the drafting, it is necessary to include in part 2
the words</div>
<a name="09061142000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person within
the charge to income
tax&#148;,</div><a name="09061142000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
contrast with</div>
<a name="09061142000205"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a company
within the charge to income tax&#148;,</div>
<a name="09061142000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">which is referred to in
part 1. The wording in part 2 captures non-resident companies that are
not carrying on a trade in the UK through a branch or an agency. I
understand the point of having that, but the suggestion has been made
that for individuals, arrangements that divert income to another party
are likely to be caught by settlement legislation. IR35&#151;the
managed service company&#146;s rules&#151;also apply where income
from personal services is
concerned.</div><a name="09061142000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the Government have said that, as a consequence of the Arctic Systems
ruling, there has been some consultation on income shifting, in the
Budget it was suggested that such measures would be deferred. There is
concern about whether the provisions of schedule 25 are
drafted widely enough to be capable of catching transactions or
arrangements under which turnover generated by an individual&#146;s
personal activities can be passed to another person and caught by the
income shifting rules that, so far, the Government have not sought to
introduce. That goes back to the question of breadth. Although it is
not the intention or the policy objective to capture individual
arrangements, the breadth of the schedule allows them to be
caught.</div><a name="09061142000212"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="09061142000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Financial Secretary might say, by way of clarification, that the
schedule is not intended to capture individual arrangements, and such a
statement would be welcome. However, the concern is that any statement
to that effect made in this Committee would not have the weight in
court that it should have, because there is no ambiguity in the
schedule. I would be grateful if he clarified whether the schedule is
intended to capture income shifting between individuals. If it is not,
how can it be amended on Report to put it beyond doubt that it is not a
backdoor way of introducing the rules on income shifting that the
Government decided to put on hold?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column339" />Column number: 339</div><a name="09061142000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also want to
discuss how the rules will interact with other parts of tax law and
what the priority should be. For example, the CIOT representation
states that rules on loan relationships, derivative contracts and
intangible fixed asset regimes should take priority over the transfer
of income rules. There is also no specific provision on the interaction
of these rules with capital gains tax rules. Clarity on that would be
helpful.</div><a name="09061142000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the main issue that the Financial Secretary must tackle is whether the
transfer of income streams between individuals will be caught by these
provisions. If they are not intended to be caught, he should say how we
can clarify that through amendment on
Report.</div><a name="09061142000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000298"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> It certainly is possible for individual transfers
of income to be caught by the provisions, and deliberately so. Under
the new arrangements that the Committee has debated, people could
obtain a tax rate of 18 per cent. rather than 50 per cent., which is
the new higher rate of income tax. Therefore, individuals do come
within the schedule. However, on income shifting, I reassure the hon.
Gentleman that the provisions will not be applied in situations such as
the Arctic Systems case. That case involves a different type of
transaction whereby income is allocated tax efficiently between two or
more parties. As a result of the ownership of the asset from which the
income arises, that case does not involve the transfer of a right to
income. Therefore, the legislation will not apply in that case. What
the schedule deals with does not happen in cases such as Arctic
Systems, because there is no transfer of a right to
income.</div><a name="09061142000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000299"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Clearly there is some disagreement between the
Treasury&#146;s interpretation of the schedule and that of the Law
Society and others. Is it not possible to put the matter beyond doubt
by introducing an explicit exclusion for income that is transferred as
a consequence of a performance of personal services, for
example?</div><a name="09061142000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000300"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I think that the matter is beyond doubt, but I will
happily look at it again and reflect on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div><a name="09061142000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s second point was about capital gains tax. If
the consideration is charged as income under the transfer of income
rules and the transferor realises neither a capital loss nor gain on
the part disposal of the asset, but is able to carry forward the whole
pool of capital expenditure to deduct on a subsequent disposal of the
asset, that outcome is reasonable because the whole amount of capital
expenditure remains available when the asset is sold. If the asset is
subsequently sold for a capital loss, that loss cannot be set off
against the taxable income that previously arose, but that outcome is
not unreasonable, given that it is within the transferor&#146;s power
to avoid that outcome by selling the asset rather than just the
income.</div>
<a name="09061142000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been reminded, Mr. Hood, that the guidance on Arctic
Systems and income shifting cases of that kind does make the position

proposed, </i>That the schedule be the Twenty-seventh schedule to the
Bill.</div><a name="09061142000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061142000301"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Hon. Members may have been thinking that they were
just going to breeze through schedule 27 and clause 52 of the Bill.
Having spent a day last year in Committee debating the way in which the
residence and domicile rules were going to work in practice, I feel
this could not pass without some comment. Many of the questions about
the function of these rules that hon. Members raised in Committee on
last year&#146;s Finance Bill have come back to haunt the Government
and have led to the changes that we see in this Bill. We raised a
number of questions about the filing of returns, the de minimis limit,
trading, spouses and property, all of which are dealt with in this part
of the Bill.</div>
<a name="09061142000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
question I want to raise relates to the</div>
<a name="09061142000206"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;application of
the remittance basis without claim where unremitted foreign income and
gains are under
&#163;2,000&#148;.</div><a name="09061142000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
change in the Bill means there is now no requirement to file a return
where gains are less than &#163;2,000, which is to be welcomed. At
the time the matter was raised, we flagged up our concern that to file
such a return would be significant burden on HMRC and the taxpayer.
However, in clause 52, the rules are amended to introduce a de minimis
limit of &#163;10,000, so what happens now? Is someone with foreign
income of less than &#163;10,000 still required to file a
self-assessment claim, or does the &#163;2,000 limit apply in such a
case?</div>
<a name="09061142000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to have clarity on that point, because there is a large
number of people who work here temporarily who may have some foreign
income from overseas. We discussed the large number of migrant workers
last year, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham,
who is not in his place, cited the example of Polish workers in the UK
who might have some residual income, say from a flat they have back in
Poland&#151;rental income or other
interest.</div><a name="09061142000213"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.25
