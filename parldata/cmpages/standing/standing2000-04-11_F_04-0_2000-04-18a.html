<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks):</B> It was 1944, Mr. Hancock. Committee members will remember that I was briefly trying to place in historical context our priorities for 16 to 19-year-olds, and to set that approach in the wider context of our commitment to lifelong learning. We were somewhat sidetracked by a discussion of the Franco-Prussian war and by other matters, but we should try to focus on the Education Act 1944. Committee members will recall that that Act was introduced by a coalition Government, who also introduced the Family Allowances Act 1945. That was a short-lived but distinguished Government.
<P>
The Education Act 1944 was a landmark in the history of publicly funded education in this country. Apart from establishing the concepts of primary, secondary and tertiary systems, it also established compulsory schooling for those aged between five and 15. School-leaving age was later raised to 16. Education between the ages of five and 16 is now taken as a right, and it is unthinkable in a civilised society to consider denying any young person the right to education. Their education must be free, and it is an entitlement. We have come a long way.
<P>
What is an entitlement? The Bill places various duties on the Learning and Skills Council. The duties that are contained in clauses 2 and 3 create corresponding rights for individuals. The Bill will extend current rights to education from school-leaving age up to the age of 19. We have made it clear that tuition up to level 3 for that age group will be free, just as it is for pupils of statutory school age.
<P>
As we established earlier, the efforts of successive Governments have gradually raised participation for 16 to 19-year-olds to its current high level. The efforts of previous Governments raised participation for younger age groups to increasingly high levels, to the point at which school education became universal. We all know that there is a significant way to go in relation to 16 to 19-year-olds. The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) said that it was unlikely that we will ever reach 100 per cent. participation. That may be true—time will tell—but no one could claim that people in that age group do not have the right to education. I am sure that all Committee members want 100 per cent. participation in education or training, or a mix of the two.
<P>
The Government are committed to a step change. In order to realise the highest level of participation for 16 to 19-year-olds, the LSC must have appropriate resources, just as those aged between five and 16 receive publicly funded education. The Government are committed to ensuring that the resources are available. That is part of the evolution of public education in this country. I continue to be amazed at how little attention that evolution has attracted. As we have noted on various occasions, that vital part of the education and training system does not tend to grab many headlines.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving way in the middle of what appears to be a rather extended peroration. Perhaps the opportunities for 16 to 19-year-olds do not receive greater attention because the approach of the Further Education Funding Council meant that they did not pay any fees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The point that I am trying to establish is that we have great ambitions for 16 to 19-year-olds. Fees will not have to be paid at certain crucial levels, and we are flagging up the fact that young people now have rights to education and training where previously that was not the case. However, such rights are meaningless if they cannot be exercised, and we have now reached the stage where full participation at the ages of 16 to 19 can be backed up by resources. The Government have been able to find the resources to make a reality of the right to education and training up to the age of 19. I have not previously heard anyone object to that step forward, which added to my surprise on seeing the amendment.
<P>
I want to say something about quality for young people's education and training. On amendment No. 74, the hon. Member for Daventry made several points about the need to ensure high-quality provision. I doubt whether there is much difference between us in that respect. We always expect provision that is resourced from public funds to be of high quality; that is why we have made quality an intrinsic part of the LSC's duties. I also refer the hon. Gentleman to clause 9, which empowers the LSC to develop schemes for assessing the performance of providers. Such schemes will inform decisions that are taken under clause 5 when financial resources are allocated by the LSC. That will enable the LSC to assess the quality of the provision that it funds and to take judgments about equality into account when making funding decisions.
<P>
We expect to start consultation on the LSC quality improvement arrangements after Easter, and the hon. Member for Daventry should be in no doubt that the Government will pay close attention to that. It will be am important part of the LSC's functions to ensure that quality is continually driven upwards, in addition to the important work that will be necessary to follow up the outcomes of formal inspections by the Office for Standards in Education and the adult learning inspectorate.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary, because we have already built a quality dimension into the LSC's duties, and it will be failing in its duties if the quality of provision that it funds is inadequate. We consider that that is a strong enough safeguard. However, I will understand if the hon. Gentleman wishes to return to quality issues in connection with later relevant clauses, including, of course, part III, which deals with inspection.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked whether young people will be entitled to provision only if it leads to qualifications. The answer is no. We recognise that many young people benefit from general development and life skills courses, for example, and the LSC will provide for that. The same applies to adults, and we intend to make extensive provision in that respect.
<P>
I turn to learning entitlement for 19 to 25-year-olds. Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 would extend the learning entitlement that is provided by clause 2 to all those aged up to 25. We recognise that the country needs a substantial improvement in participation and achievement at every level. We are only too aware of the legacy that was left by a failure to invest in the nation's education. The LSC will be required to give priority to the learning of 16 to 19-year-olds. We gave that commitment in the White Paper, Learning to Succeed. The additional resources that we are devoting to post-16 learning will allow access to learning for all those who really need it, including adults. We are making the biggest-ever investment in further education: &#163;3.9 billion in 2001–02, compared to &#163;3.1 billion in 1998–99—an extra &#163;800 million.
<P>
However, we must recognise that even those amounts may not be enough to meet all demand, especially when we consider how many adults need to improve and develop their skills and qualifications. At the end of 1998, there were about 4 million 19 to 25-year-olds in England. More than 1 million of those do not have a level 2 or higher qualification, about 100,000 of whom are studying to achieve one. Nearly 2 million adults in that age group do not have a level 3 qualification, and about 120,000 are studying to achieve one. The third report of the skills task force recognised that extending an entitlement to a level 2 qualification to the 19-to-25 age group might cost about &#163;135 million a year. It recognised that a level 3 entitlement was not on the cards at present. Although we aim to meet an increasing proportion of this important demand, there are clearly difficulties in setting in legislation such an unqualified duty.
<P>
To extend the learning entitlement to all those up to the age of 25 at the stroke of the legislator's pen would be misleading, attractive as it may seem to anyone not thinking through the consequences. It would restrict the council's ability and discretion to make judgments about how best to target resources for adults. It would stretch the available resources across the entire 16-to-25 age range in a way that might endanger the higher funding generally required for those with the most pressing needs—for example, those with learning difficulties and/or disabilities or those with prior educational under-achievement. It would also divert resources away from adults over 25 as well—this was a point raised earlier by Opposition Members—as well as from those aged under 19, including those in sixth forms.
<P>
The LSC, and particularly local LSCs, must be able to exercise discretion about where to focus provision for adults. I assure the hon. Member for Daventry that this will be a matter not only for the LSC but for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. When such substantial amounts of taxpayers' money are involved, he will have to give careful and full guidance on the overall spending priorities for its use.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Minister respond, now or later, to my questions about the funding collection of money from local education authorities on account of adult and continuing education, its bulking together and its redistribution to the providers at local level? It would help the Committee if the Minister could give some more details about that and, above all, say whether it will be redistributive or whether he hopes for additional resources that will make it a smoother operation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The comprehensive spending review is under way and, like other Departments, my Department has put in bids for expenditure. We are very committed to adult and community education—very committed indeed. We have already given LEAs guarantees that current levels of expenditure will be maintained for the next two years, so that there are no difficulties about transition. We are ambitious about community and adult education, and concerned about the great variability in spend across the country on such education. I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman those assurances.
<P>
There will certainly be coverage about the overall spending priorities in our forthcoming consultation document on funding. Although we judge it right to distinguish between provision for 16 to 19-year-olds and adults, in much the same way as the previous Government's legislation did, we do not regard learning for adults as unimportant—quite the contrary, as I hope to demonstrate in relation to amendment No. 72.
<P>
We have already announced an enormous increase in the resources available for adult learning in further education. In 1998–99 expenditure on adults in FE was &#163;1.6 billion; in 2001–02 it will be some &#163;2 billion. That will enable the number of further education students to increase. Indeed, we expect to widen participation substantially for all, and the major part of that expansion will be for adults. I hope that that makes clear the Government's absolute commitment to adult education in the broadest sense.
<P>
As I said, the creation of the Learning and Skills Council gives us the opportunity to address the uneven provision of adult and community learning and carry forward a major programme to stimulate lifelong learning. Individual learning accounts, and the modernisation of supply through the university for industry and its information technology learning centres. will make learning much more accessible. The new duty on the LSC to promote and encourage learning will champion the cause of lifelong learning. The LSC will take responsibility for the planning and funding of high-quality information, advice and guidance services in April 2001. That will ensure that adults have the help that they need to make informed choices about learning.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Addressing the problems of basic skills among adults in particular is a key priority for the Government. We are very grateful for the efforts of Sir Claus Moser and his working group. Last year's report, A Fresh Start, highlighted the extraordinary fact that, at the beginning of the 21st century, some 7 million adults lack the literacy and numeracy skills needed to operate effectively in today's labour market. That appalling situation is the legacy of decades of neglect. What are we doing about it? In November, Baroness Blackstone announced the first stage of the Government's response—a major package of reforms to basic skills education that includes new national standards, a new curriculum, new national tests, teacher training reforms, a new common inspection framework and improved screening and support for the unemployed. To drive through those changes, we announced spending of &#163;16 million to April 2001. The next step will be the announcement, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State expects to make in the summer, of the Government's full national strategy for delivering the necessary step change in participation and attainment.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Department is giving the issue even higher priority. A new adult basic skills strategy unit is being set up to carry forward the programme. It will work closely with the basic skills agency and the new Learning and Skills Council. An advertisement for the post of unit director appeared in the press last week. In setting up the LSC and making its funding and planning arrangements, we will make clear the crucial importance that we attach to its tackling a pressing national problem.
<P>
I should also emphasise the help that the Bill will give to people defined in the legislation as suffering from learning difficulties: people who, compared to those without disabilities, are at a disadvantage when accessing learning. The LSC must take such disabilities into account when securing provision not only for learning and skills, but work experience. We have introduced a new duty on the LSC and its Welsh equivalent—the National Council for Education and Training for Wales—in respect of equality of opportunity. We have also introduced a new provision for assessing the needs of young people and young adults who are making the transition from compulsory education to post-16 provision.
<P>
However, as far as the Bill is concerned, there is a vital distinction between devoting additional resources to meet some of the demand, and creating an entitlement. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) mentioned the third report of the skills taskforce, which recommended the creation of an entitlement for education for adults up to level 2 qualification. The Government are giving that recommendation careful consideration. Of course, the Bill could provide such an entitlement for the 39 million people who make up England's post-19 population, but if it did, we would rightly be accused of making promises that we could not keep. An absolute entitlement would require a dilution of resources for the 16 to 19 age group—including provision for school sixth forms that will be funded by the LSC—and they would no longer have the priority we want to give them.
<P>
Particular issues are involved when we compare the needs of adults with those of young people—a point that I said I would return to. Many adults are in well-paid employment and can afford to pay for further education and training. Indeed, they do so because they know that it is in their interests to do so for their further career advancement and personal fulfilment. Should a highly paid City business man or woman be subsidised by the state if they want to study further? Would that entitlement be on a par with that of a 17-year-old with no qualifications?
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I cannot possibly allow the Minister to get away with that statement. Is he saying that all those who go to university at 18 or 19 should be treated in that way? If he is following that line of argument, he is saying that people aged 19 should have no entitlement by right to further qualifications and training, or to education. Even without the monstrous imposition of tuition fees, the cost of keeping somebody at university is extraordinarily high, if one breaks the cost down across the education spectrum. If the Minister wants to press that argument and wants the Committee to follow and support it, let him be honest about it and say that the Government are only interested in people up to the age of 19 receiving training as an entitlement, and that thereafter they are on their own. If it applies to the 21-year-old, it applies equally to the 19-year-old going to university.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should be short.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Hancock, but I feel passionately about this matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's passion, which I have never doubted, but I am trying to introduce him to some of the logical implications of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> What is the logic of the Minister's position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The logic of our position is that, in the context of our commitment to lifelong learning—I hope that the hon. Gentleman has listened carefully to what I have said about the Government's commitment to adult education in the broadest sense and our concern to help adults with basic skill problems—we give priority to 16 to 19-year-olds. That was my reason for introducing the hypothetical—it could be real—case of the City business man on a high salary.
<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough refers to university student finance, but that is a different matter with which the Bill does not deal. As he knows, we have introduced a student finance system so that those from better-off backgrounds pay some of the costs of their university education, and our loans system is designed to enable people to pay back some of those costs when they reach a certain salary. I see no inconsistency there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Passing over the issue of whether the Government's withdrawal of maintenance and imposition of tuition fees have improved access for the less advantaged student, I want to ask the Minister a specific question of logic. Surely in this clause and its successor we are discussing entitlements to education—access to resources? We are not, with respect to the Minister, discussing the charging of fees. It would be perfectly possible to enshrine an obligation to supply, or an entitlement to receive, to all persons, including adults, without necessarily determining whether the costs should be recoverable. I say that to be helpful to the Minister, who seeks to recover some of the cost of higher education from some students.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The issue of fees arose because I made the mistake of answering the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, who talked about fees in a sector that is not directly relevant to the Bill. Opposition Members seem unable to cope with the fact that, despite our commitment to lifelong learning, the extra funds that we are putting into adult education of different kinds and our clear commitment to helping the one in five adults in this country who lack basic literacy and numeracy skills, we are giving priority to 16 to 19-year-olds. If we accepted the amendments, we could do less in future for 16, 17, 18 and 19-year-olds than we intend to do. That is what the argument is about.
<P>
A massive amount of privately funded learning is already offered in the workplace—not enough of course; we need to improve on that. I am aware of estimates of its value varying from &#163;14 billion to &#163;18 billion a year. I am not sure whether Opposition Members are seriously suggesting that we should extend an entitlement to all adults who can afford to pay for themselves or who at present have free provision from their employers. That would clearly divert resources away from those with a genuine need for education and training to those who are already catered for to some degree, which could lead to a gross distortion of our priorities. These are serious questions about where it is right for the state to provide a public subsidy, and I assure the hon. Member for Daventry that our funding consultation will cover those difficult and complex issues.
<P>
I hope that I have demonstrated that we share the aspirations expressed by hon. Members for adult learners. We shall continue to make progress towards meeting the country's learning and skill needs for all—young people and adults. The Bill marks a significant step along the path of extending access to learning to all, but we cannot go down the route that amendment No. 72 entices us down for the reasons that I have set out. As I have said, the Learning and Skills Council will receive clear and thorough guidance on the funding priorities for adults, backed up, where appropriate, by conditions of grant.
<P>
I hope that I have managed to present our arguments and to persuade my hon. Friends that it would be foolhardy to accept the amendments, given our commitment in particular to those aged 16 to 19. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Member for Daventry will not press the amendments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This has been a fascinating and somewhat extended debate, and I do not intend to speak again at length. It was welcome to have three good contributions from Government Back-Benchers; not all Committees are so open. Their contributions are much to be welcomed, particularly as they have real experience in the sector and made some interesting points.
<P>
If I may single out one contribution without wishing to be invidious, I was very interested in what the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) said about the socially excluded. There is no difference across the Committee in our commitment to that group. We should be worried about that problem and we should be conscious of the waste of human potential, and sometimes worse, that is enshrined in that. It needs to be tackled and we should have no illusions about the practical difficulties of doing so. To use the analogy that I used earlier about not necessarily reaching 100 per cent. involvement, it becomes progressively more difficult. I see the hon. Lady nodding.
<P>
The only point on which I cross swords with the hon. Lady—I touched on this slightly in an exchange with the Minister a moment ago—is that in setting out an objective to include more socially excluded people, or generally to increase participation in the 16 to 19-year-old age group, it is not logically necessary to increase the legal duty on that as distinct from other legal duties. A council with a set of neutral duties as to age, whether prefaced by the word ``proper'' or not—I apologise to the Minister for having momentarily, and I hope uncharacteristically, mixed my nouns and my adjectives—and whether it was a general remit or confined to 16 to 19-year-olds, would still be able to go ahead and consider its priorities, which is ostensibly what the Minister wants it to do. It would then decide how to apportion its funds and its effort. Therefore, a legal distinction does not necessarily underpin a difference of quality or respond to different needs or pressures.
<P>
I recall the helpful intervention by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase), who wondered whether there could be cases in which adults had a greater or more pressing need than young people. I believe that there could be such cases; certainly, adults do not want to be excluded because they are not young people. These are not so much probing as scouting amendments, which go round the Government's proposals to try to find out what they intend to do in this important area.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
A fascinating element of the debate was the Minister's indulgence in a long historical essay, which, though valuable and interesting, perhaps did not have quite the application that he put upon it. He expounded on the evolution—as I shall tactfully describe it—from Forster, who was a Liberal, to the Conservative Education Acts of 1902 and, under a Conservative Minister in the National Government, in 1944, to the Conservative Government's Further and Higher Education Act 1992, to his own new proposals.
<P>
From that historical analysis, the Minister sought to give the Committee the impression that his proposals are entirely new and wonderful and will take matters much further than they have ever been taken in the past. A more sober analysis would be that various Ministers of all parties have at different times contributed to the extension of educational involvement, and that their contributions have had a cumulative effect. Thank goodness for that, because we are all committed to education. While I do not mind the Minister being interested in social exclusion or lifelong learning, I would resent it somewhat if he tried to leave the Committee with the impression that he was the first Minister ever to have taken an interest in those areas—although any success on his part will be very welcome.
<P>
During the debate, it has become increasingly clear that a squeeze box or concertina effect between educational provision for 16 to 19-year-olds—the sector of statutory entitlement—and for adults over the age of 19öthe aspirational sectoröis inevitable. Of the &#163;6 billion a year that the Minister proposes to spend across the whole sector, some &#163;4 billion will go to young people and some &#163;2 billion to adults. It is therefore self-evident, mathematically speaking, that unless the overall total figure is increased—I wish the Minister well in the comprehensive spending review— there is liable to be an automatic gearing effect, in that an increase in take-up by the younger age group would affect the sums that are available for the adult age group.
<P>
For example, if the figures were reshuffled by the addition of another &#163;0.5 billion to cover an expansion in enrolments in the younger sector—that is roughly the sum that would be required to accommodate the socially excluded if they were all to present themselves at further education colleges tomorrow—the amount available for adult education would drop by &#163;0.5 billion. That would leave it with &#163;1.5 billion, which would amount to a rather savage cutback of 25 per cent. of the original total. I am therefore concerned about the way in which the two sectors are to be tuned.
<P>
I should not like the Committee to gain the impression that we are necessarily saying that there should be no extra duty. That depends entirely on how the Learning and Skills Council, no doubt with the Minister's guidance, discharges its obligations. The hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) memorably made the point that an active involvement in learning in the early years after school is a foundation for subsequent involvement in lifelong learning. I might add ``at school''. Some people do not have a very satisfactory experience at school. We are not against getting young people in; the relevant thing is how we should do that alongside the adult sector.
<P>
I thought that the Minister was protesting a little too much, and I noted his words. I was always taught that the use of the word ``very'' was a litmus paper for the weakness of an argument, as was the use of the word ``surely''. The Minister said—I think that I quote him accurately—that he was ``very committed'' to adult and continuing education and went on to say ``very committed indeed''. He issued a guarantee to LEAs. I felt then that there was something that gave rise to concern. We can all play the game of selective quotation, if we want to—I do not—but, on the lead page of its comments on the funding document, the director of the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education, Mr. Alan Tuckett, says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The failure of the plans to identify an entitlement to public support for adult learners is a major weakness.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We might have expected him to say that. Many of us know and respect him. That is his current position. The Minister has failed to convince us on that issue.
<P>
I was interested in the Minister's comments about basic skills education, not least because there is in my family a passion for any moves to promote it. It is an important area—Sir Claus Moser showed that. The Minister would be ill advised to suggest—perhaps he just implied—that it is all the fault of the wicked Tory Government. It goes back a long way. One of the reasons for the high failure levels is that, over time, the boundaries shift. People who, at one stage, might have been classed as having the basic functional literacy required for the simplest jobs now find that their skills are inadequate, as jobs are upskilling. That creates a problem in the labour force. All power to the Minister's arm, if he can work on that area—which has not been charged for for several years—and improve participation levels, as with who young people, including those who are disaffected.
<P>
The Minister must not imply that he has set off into some great new tomorrow, without reference to the past that he described so eloquently. There has been a long series of iterations of different duties, which are gradually put together again, followed by a move on to the next stage. The Further and Higher Education Act 1992—Conservative legislation—created a new obligation to fund award-bearing courses and courses in basic skills. That was all well and good, as the Minister will agree. Courses not covered by the relevant part of that Act were less well protected and were provided through LEA budgets. We had some exchanges about whether they were adequate and who was to blame for that. Now, in a rather starker form than the 1992 Act, we have, in clause 2, duties in respect of young people and, in clause 3, duties in respect of older people that are radically different. It is not, in logic, necessary for them to be different, and I can imagine us having another debate in 10 years' time because some radical Minister—perhaps from another party—has put forward the idea that, after all, we will put all the duties together and tell them to get on with the business of funding, without regard to age groups or other artificial distinctions. The Minister has not convinced us that deletion of ``proper'' is inappropriate. He tried to say that that would make matters worse and damage some people's entitlements, but I am not sure that he knows what it means or that it will secure what he hopes. We are still waiting for enrolment of the 650,000 extra students to whom Baroness Blackstone referred in another place. That has not happened yet and, for all the Minister's words, I am uncertain whether it will happen.
<P>
On the question of increasing the limit to 25, I have some sympathy with the Liberal Democrats' argument that that would widen the boundary by increasing the inclusion and reducing the exclusion. That would be welcome, but, as they said, there are resource implications, to which the Minister also referred. We all understand that in the real world it is not always easy to know what resources will be available and it is certain from our exchanges that the Minister does not know how they will be spent in relation to the adult education budget, but we shall return to that later. The jury is still out and the Minister has yet to make a case for opposing our amendment, so we should tickle the Committee's interest by pressing the amendment to a Division.
<P>
I sense that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) might want to speak before we conclude our debate, which includes amendments in his name. I am not minded to advise my hon. Friends to support them and we might hold our fire to put the Government on probation to test their intentions because they have not responded satisfactorily to the wider issue covered by amendment No. 71.

<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I wish to make a couple of points on amendments Nos. 20 and 21. First, the hon. Member for Leeds, Central made a valid point about demands and the Minister referred to the cost of our proposal to widen the band to 25. One of the key issues is to stimulate demand and, whatever is offered, there will be a major problem in stimulating demand. We are pleased that other measures in the Bill deal with that. There is a problem in getting people through the doors in the communities that we are concerned about, but some imaginative work is taking place on that.
<P>
We urge the Committee to be careful about what it throws out. The children of millionaires are not charged for their education up to the age of 16, nor are they charged for their expensive sixth form education or level 4 education, most of which takes place after the age of 19. We do not want to challenge that, but someone who is socially disadvantaged and drops out of education from the age of 16 or even younger, but, at the age of 21 or 22, wants to enter a further education course might find it difficult. There are major problems with the current structure and we want a levelling up, especially for those who come through the less traditional routes and have dropped in and out of education but want education in the FE sector. Some contributions seem to have suggested that the ability to access free education should be limited.
<P>
Our amendments might require additional resources, but we make no apology for our general position that it is worth raising taxes to spend more on education. That theme runs consistently through our education policy because such spending is an investment that will be repaid as the general economic situation improves and through personal taxes. The Minister referred to &#163;135 million a year for widening the band for those seeking to reach level 2 when he quoted from the skills taskforce report. We think that that is achievable, especially in the context of a new deal budget underspend of about &#163;500 million. We hoped that the Government would be bolder and make the investment that was necessary to fund the sector. Some of us still subscribe to what might appear to be the rather old-fashioned notion that education and training are for the common good and for that of the individual and that the state benefits when people are trained to higher levels.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a distinction between the more general skills that are acquired in further education and the specific skills that may relate, for example, to a software package that is relevant to a specific job? Should not the latter skill be the responsibility of the employer rather than the state, especially in relation to cost?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I certainly accept that. We argue for a tripartite arrangement and make no bones about the fact that individuals, the state and employers should all provide funding because all will benefit. We want to ensure that the state's contribution up to the age of 16—the state has the primary responsibility to provide free education up to that age—is taken to level 2. We also want that approach to those who are under 25 to be extended to level 3. However, that is a different matter that involves basic on-the-job training and more advanced skills.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chaytor </B>(Bury, North): I am a little confused. The hon. Gentleman's argument moved from an entitlement to level 2 to an entitlement to level 3 and back again. I am not clear to what extent the amendment would shift the border from 19 to 25. Do Liberal Democrats support an entitlement to free tuition to level 2 or to level 3 for all up to the age of 25? If level 3 is involved, what costing have they produced?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I made it clear in my earlier contributions that we accept the skills taskforce recommendation that the entitlement should extend to level 3. However, our amendments, which would extend the Government's approach in relation to proper education, would involve level 2, although our broader aspiration involves level 3. As I said, we are currently doing the relevant costings. In this context, we are discussing level 2, but in relation to our aspirations and the skills taskforce recommendation, level 3 is involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): Do the on-going costings include the underspend from the new deal programme?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I used the underspend from the new deal programme as a way of indicating the relative sums of money. We believe that that money is additionally available for programmes in this area. In relation to the adult age group, that would a vaiid use of the money. The state of the economy means that the new deal money is available—the take-up is not sufficient. Presumably, the Government are also considering ways in which to spend the money on education and training. There is no difference between the Government and the Liberal Democrats in that regard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Is that the same pot of money that the Liberal party voted against when the Bill that established the new deal programme was passing through the House a couple of years ago?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> There was not a Bill to do that, although a windfall tax was raised. The money that sits in the Government's coffers—
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> The Finance Bill was used.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We should not start rewriting history. I was asked what we should do if we were in government. Our programme refers to funds that are available to the Government. The Government have not refunded money that was raised by charging VAT on domestic fuel, although they voted against that policy when the Conservative Government introduced it. It is not traditional for political parties to offer to refund money from taxes with which they disagreed. Resources are available in the education and training sector, and I have already identified some of the moneys. The general principle is that Governments should invest in this context and that the Bill should include appropriate powers. Such investment would repay itself many times over. So long as we fail to be bold enough to accept that approach, we shall continue to fall behind countries such as Germany—there will be disparities in economic performance and productivity, which can, as we saw recently, have disastrous consequences. It is essential to close the skills gap. Unless we make that investment, we shall not catch up. For that reason, we shall press amendment No. 20 to a Division.

<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 98, clause 3, page 2, line 37, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ba) development of skills of such persons in employment'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The amendments would ensure that there was an effective transition between the work of the training and enterprise councils and the chamber of commerce, training and enterprise—TECs and CCTEs—and that of the LSC. The amendments would make explicit the roles that many TECs and CCTEs felt they had developed effectively, namely, to work with people who are still in employment. When limited resources are available for training, there are concerns about the extent to which one should deal with people who are already in the work force or with those who are outside it. There is a tendency to focus on those who are outside the work force, for honourable reasons—they should be encouraged to enter the work force and given the skills to do so—and for the slightly more functional reason that there will be a benefit saving if people move from the benefits system into work. The second motivation will not apply to those who are already in the work force.
<P>
The Government believe that the development of personal employment skills is important. The LSC prospectus contains the key objective that the new framework should help employers to develop individual employees, so that world-class business performance is achieved. We are trying to get a commitment from the Government that, ideally, can be incorporated in the Bill. We think that work force development strategies will be included in the work of the learning and skills councils, but an explicit commitment would help us to give assurances in that regard, and place those strategies on an equal footing with the councils' other requirements and duties. That would build on work undertaken in, say, Investors in People schemes, which have persuaded employers to consider the training needs of individual employees.
<P>
We are considering ways in which to encourage employers to develop skills in the widest sense. The hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) referred to specific training courses, but we are talking instead about enabling 19 to 24-year-olds to achieve level 2 or level 3 qualifications in a generic sense, rather than being pushed into learning a particular software package. Representatives of the training and enterprise council in my constituency believe strongly that that is important, given the work that they have done. I have seen that work at first hand. I have visited organisations that have been given Investors in People awards and other certification. If we are to encourage employers to take part in such schemes, there must be subsequent support.
<P>
Having completed assessment and evaluation processes, employees want access to skills development, so that the exercise does not appear an empty one. It is clear that employers have a role to play in that regard. Some will play a direct role by engaging with LSCs, just as they engaged with training and enterprise councils and CCTEs. Others will want to support their employees by contributing time or other resources. We hope that LSCs will play an explicit role, and the amendments seek a commitment from the Government that LSCs will be full partners in work force development activity.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is a worthwhile probing amendment. Again, I hope that there is a common feeling among members of the Committee that workplace development and involvement of the work force in their own development—thereby contributing their firm's strength—is a thoroughly sensible aspiration. As I remember it, occasional paper 22, which was produced by the Institute of Personnel Development and is not sufficiently well known, dealt with the value added by personnel development activities. It conclusively established that firms with hands-on, ``employ me'' development activities regularly record productivity improvements that are greater than those recorded through, for example, hard capital investment. Most members of the Committee would be committed to such an approach.
<P>
The concept is sensible. Perhaps the only reservation, to which the Under-Secretary may wish to respond, is whether enshrining that concept in statute might give rise to onerous burdens on certain employers, or impose costs over and above those that might sensibly be incurred in developing their own work force. I see no reason why it should. I have noticed that Ministers have occasionally been hyper-cautious about imposing burdens on business. They are right to be so, but sometimes they take caution to a fault.
<P>
The Under-Secretary should explain what is in his mind and whether he sees the development as sensible. The plain fact is that, in the light of the labour market, the Learning and Skills Council will want to take a holistic view of various factors. This is one such factor, and I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would elucidate on how it will be dealt with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I strongly endorse the views expressed by the hon. Member for Hallam. The hon. Member for Daventry seems to be going in for textual analysis of my speeches. If I say that I am very much committed to something, he immediately thinks that it means that I am not at all committed. Being a barrack-room lawyer—as he described himself earlier—is one thing, but a barrack-room psychotherapist is altogether different. Therefore, partly for the hon. Gentleman's benefit, I should point out that when I say that I endorse this strongly, I mean that I endorse it strongly. I hope that that is well understood.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> For the avoidance of doubt, because we have plenty to do without playing games in the Committee, I entirely accept that assurance. I take it as coming from the Minister's heart and I am pleased that he has given it.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We must develop a responsive system of support for work force development, which not only meets the needs of the economy in general but provides sufficient flexibility to meet local needs and those of particular industries. Only yesterday I was discussing with both sides of the print industry its skill needs and the concern that, in that important industry to the British economy, a third of companies have done no training over the past 12 months. Businesses without a well-motivated and well-trained work force will find it increasingly difficult to survive.
<P>
To illustrate the point more positively, employers who have significantly raised the proportion of the work force in training have seen an increase of at least 3 per cent. in the value added per worker. It is not a question simply of economics but of the choices that individuals, including individual employees, will make.
<P>
I cite in evidence a survey commissioned by my Department, which was published this week. It found that almost two thirds of employees would choose a job paying 5 per cent. less than another if the employer provided formal training opportunities. That is an interesting piece of evidence, which suggests that, in future, employees' determination to get good training may drive skills. I see one or two hon. Friends looking sceptical at that finding. Even you, Mr. Hancock, are looking sceptical. I am not sure whether the ABC of chairmanship allows for that; I am sure that it does. It is simply an attitudinal survey, but it is significant that employees now regard training as one of the things that they are looking for. The same survey found that 84 per cent. of employees sought off-the-job training provision, describing it as either ``very important'' or ``important''.
<P>
For those reasons we made it clear from the outset that one of the driving forces behind our reforms of post-16 learning was the recognition that, in a knowledge-driven economy, the continuous updating of skills and development of people in work and out of work will make the difference between competitiveness and decline for some industries and companies in this country.
<P>
Clauses 2 and 3 require the LSC to secure provision for those at work as well as for those who are not employed or who are at school or college. The duties as drafted make it clear that the provision of work force development is one of its key concerns. Indeed, the Government amended clauses 2 and 3 in another place to ensure that the council considers skills needs in different employment sectors when it discharges its duties. As we explained at the time, we expect national training organisations, which now cover over 90 per cent. of the work force, to be the key focus of expert advice to the council on work force needs in different employment sectors. Indeed, a key challenge for the new policy is enabling the national training organisations and learning and skills councils, national and local, to work together.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman and I are therefore at one on this key issue, and I am sure that the whole Committee will agree with us. However, I am concerned about the unintended effects of his amendments on the interpretation of education and training in the Bill. In these main duties and in the LSC's powers throughout the Bill we have deliberately tried not to qualify the definition of education or training, so that they may be interpreted widely and allow the LSC maximum scope to deliver as circumstances demand. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the problems that are caused by limits on the kind of educational provision that the FEFC may fund—for example, questions about schedule 2 and non-schedule 2 provisions. We want to avoid that in future.
<P>
If we were to include a further provision in the main duties of the LSC that it must secure facilities for the development of skills, and that requirement was separate from the duty to secure facilities for education and training, that would imply that the development of skills is somehow different from, or separate from, education or training. I am sure that that is not the hon. Gentleman's intention, but it could be understood to be the implication.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> No—it might be helpful if I make some progress. I shall be happy to give way later.
<P>
Work force development is so important that I do not want to make a defence for inaction built on legal concerns, and I agree with the hon. Member for Hallam that we should take the opportunity to underline it in the Bill. I shall make two suggestions as to how that can be successfully achieved without the danger of legal problems affecting the duties of the council under clauses 2 and 3.
<P>
I intend to look again at clause 16. This important clause requires the LSC to formulate a strategy for its work. That will be a key piece of work that sets out its vision for learning and skills. I propose to the Committee that we make work force development an explicit component of that strategy, as we said in the LSC prospectus that it would be.
<P>
That would be a requirement of the LSC at the national level. It is perhaps even more important to enshrine work force development priorities at the local level in the work of the local LSCs. Clause 22 already requires local LSCs to produce a statement of the needs of their population, which would undoubtedly include a statement of the needs of people in employment in the area. That will be a key task. I propose to table an amendment to the clause to make it explicit that those statements, and the plans that flow from them, will meet our commitment in the LSC prospectus that local LSCs will develop integrated local work force development plans, building on the important preparatory work that is being carried out by TECs.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises that we share the same concerns about this issue. If he will agree to withdraw the amendment, I shall make a commitment to table Government amendments as soon as possible to reinforce the importance of work force development along the lines of the suggestions that I have made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not wish to sound churlish, because the Minister is making considerable attempts to assist the Committee. However, in relation to clause 22, will he confirm that the duty to build up an integrated work force development plan will not necessarily preclude funding by the LSC to an institution or provider outwith the plan if there is an appropriate need for it? I hope that the Minister is not implying that there has to be 100 per cent. inclusion within the work force development plan in order to qualify for funding from the LSC. If that is so, I shall need to reflect on the matter further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> No. The work force development plan will be an important means for the LSC to assess needs in its area. That certainly does not mean that an institution or possible provider that was not mentioned or included would not receive funding.
<P>
I thank the hon. Member for Hallam and others who have made similar points to us more informally. It was always our contention that the LSCs, both local and national, should be concerned with work force development, among many other important functions. It will be helpful to include that in the Bill, and I shall do so in the way that I have indicated. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman may now be prepared to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his helpful response. We wanted the Bill to include a commitment to work force development to ensure that it plays an important part in the general scheme of things. The Minister's comments on the role of national training organisations are very welcome and we agree with them. It is entirely proper that the amendments should be made in clauses 16 and 22 and the work force development plan will be a key part of local councils' plans. That entirely satisfies us and, without further ado, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move amendment No. 51, in page 2, line 12, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ab) take account of the reasonable convenience of learners and the likely impact on their motivation to learn;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 56, in clause 3, page 3, line 4, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ab) take account of the reasonable convenience of learners and the likely impact on their motivation to learn;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendments refer to the provisions established in clauses 2 and 3 for individual users of the system, particularly 16 to 18-year-olds. It is fair to say that we have had some good debates on the provision for education and training that is to be made by the Learning and Skills Council. It was inevitable that that debate was a little theoretical at times and amendments Nos. 51 and 56 are more practical and import practical considerations into the Bill. It is important to understand how they fit into the scheme of the Bill in relation to other subsections.
<P>
Subsection (1) requires the Learning and Skills Council to provide proper facilities for education and training for 16 to 18-year-olds. Subsection (3) sets out a number of factors that the council must take into account when fulfilling its duty under subsection (1). Those factors are varied. Some relate to needs that the Learning and Skills Council should satisfy—for example, it must take account of the education and training required in different sectors of employment for employees and potential employees. Some of those factors refer to the efficiency of the Learning and Skills Council in fulfilling those duties.
<P>
Amendment No. 51 would add to the list of factors that the Learning and Skills Council must take into account. It would require the council to take account of the reasonable convenience of learners and its likely impact on their motivation to learn. We are thinking, among other things, of the proximity of the provision for education and training to learners and the convenience of travel to that provision. I want to make three points on that in support of the amendment.
<P>
First, it is legitimate to consider the convenience of individual learners in terms of distance and travel requirements. We wonder whether it is sufficient for a local Learning and Skills Council to make provision that would otherwise meet the requirements of subsections (1) and (3), but to centralise that provision and leave individual users of the service with long and possibly difficult journeys. We are conscious that amendment No. 51 refers to provision for 16 to 18-year-olds who are likely to rely on public transport. Should we expect them to endure, for example, multiple bus journeys, long walks and so on to get the education and training that they need? That concern arises particularly in rural areas and could make a big difference to individual use of the system. We accept that the Learning and Skills Council cannot meet every need for on-the-spot provision of education and training, hence the test of reasonableness in the amendment, but it is a consideration of which the council should take account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will my hon. Friend bear in mind the fact that when making decisions on whether schools should have a sixth form, the convenience of scholars, if the alternative was an extended journey of, say, 20 miles to the nearest FE college, would figure large in my mind, as, I am sure, it would in the minds of subsequent Ministers? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point, and I shall come to it in more detail later.
<P>
On the first point, I invite the Minister and the Committee to look at it from the point of view of 16 to 18-year-olds and the convenience that they could reasonably expect.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the amendment recognises that this issue goes beyond the question of convenience for the individual. Remote and inconvenient provision may have an impact on individuals' motivation to seek education and training. For somebody in this age group, long journeys may be off-putting, and it is possible that those most in need of education and training have the lowest motivation and find long journeys the most off-putting of all. Inconvenience of the location of provision may have an especially strong impact on them.
<P>
Among the speeches that we heard in the debate before we adjourned for lunch was an elegant one from the hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn), who spoke of the demand for education and training. I hope that, if he turns his mind to it, he will realise that not all users of the service will be in the position of those in, say, Leeds, Central; he should think of rural users of services. I am sure that he would not want that demand to be choked off by inconveniently located services.
<P>
Thirdly, the amendment reflects the concern of rural areas. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry was right to draw attention to this issue, because it springs naturally to mind, especially, but not exclusively, in respect of school sixth forms in rural areas. The continued existence of sixth forms in secondary schools in rural areas may result in, among other things, a better staying-on rate than if provision were centralised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): I recognise that the hon. Gentleman has an important theme and I am pretty unreconstructed in my support of sixth forms. Certainly in the urban areas that I represent, the sixth form is an important educational provision. I do not believe that all sixth forms should be sacrificed for sixth form colleges, tertiaries and so on; I believe in a genuinely mixed economy.
<P>
However, there comes a time when it is impractical to conduct sixth form education with groups of youngsters who are too few to have the necessary interaction between themselves and their tutors. However unreconstructed we may be, at that point we must say: ``This is not a quality educational experience,'' and we have a duty to improve the experience.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right up to a point, but we are talking not about quality but about decisions based on convenience. Those responsible under these provisions for providing sixth form education may decide to provide a centralised sixth form education that does not take local priorities into account.
<P>
I impress on the hon. Gentleman, who I know is very interested in the subject, that these concerns come not just from Members on these Benches but from many other sources. He may have seen the Local Government Association's submission to the Committee, which I shall quote from briefly. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The mechanism by which resources are transferred from local government to the DfEE for school sixth forms and adult education to fund the LSC will be critical if existing local services are not to be adversely affected. Local authorities allocate budgets m accordance with local priorities. If the switch of funds to the LSC fails to take account of this, current services will face budget cuts.{**W10**}
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Dr. Phyllis Starkey </B>(Milton Keynes, South-West): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Lady, if I may first explain how that point relates to what I am saying. The Local Government Association is talking about the switch of funds from local government to the Department for Education and Employment. I am talking about the way in which local learning and skills councils operate the priorities that they set. However, the point remains the same: local priorities must be taken into account.
<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman expand slightly on what he said before in relation to quality? Is he saying that quality is irrelevant and that convenience is all that matters?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Lady, who has studied the provisions of the Bill, is making a false argument to support a weak case. I am talking about decisions that may be made by local learning and skills councils. They might be able satisfactorily to meet the provisions and duties set out under the Bill on a centralised, rather than a more remote and rural, basis. Nothing in the Bill stops them taking such a decision. We are talking about introducing a measure that considers the convenience of users, including those in rural areas. The hon. Lady, who speaks for Milton Keynes, and the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East, who speaks for Wolverhampton, should bear in mind the position of those in rural seats in places such as Cornwall, Cumbria and Northumberland, where sixth forms in secondary schools may be scattered across a relatively wide area.
<P>
I recently visited a remote part of the country that I know well, on the east coast of Yorkshire, where there is a local sixth-form school right out on the coast. The nearest urban provision for that school is some 20 miles away in the city of Hull. If provision were centralised in Hull, those attending that school would have to make a round trip of 40 miles into Hull; it would be a difficult trip for the many pupils who come from scattered communities and villages. They have a good school bus service to get them to school, but would otherwise have to rely on irregular and sometimes non-existent bus services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> May I put another scenario to the hon. Gentleman? Rather than taking a pessimistic view of what might happen to small sixth forms in rural areas, he should consider a pleasing element of the Bill. It would enable such schools to offer other services. They could not previously draw down money from what was the Further Education Funding Council for that purpose, but they can now do so from the LSC, to offer a range of services that make the overall position much more viable within those areas. Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that that benefit counteracts some of his arguments?

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not dispute the hon. Gentleman's point, but it does not give satisfactory assurance for those who rely on sixth forms in rural areas. We have to do more than is set out under the Bill to protect those sixth forms. If not, one can envisage ways in which the future of such sixth forms could be threatened by decisions taken by the LSC.
<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough suggested that the LSC might allow additional services to be provided at schools in rural areas that presently provide only traditional sixth-form courses. Will the hon. Gentleman bear in mind the fact that some pupils at such schools may have made certain course choices because they are the only ones available to them, but might make different choices were a greater range of facilities available to them—as they would be under the provisions of the LSC?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Of course we are all for a wider range of courses, but our worry is that many will decide not to take any course because the provision is not sufficiently close and is too difficult to reach. That could result in a regrettable reduction in the number of those in rural areas staying on for post-16 education. I hope that the Minister, in responding to the debate, will think carefully about the problems in rural areas, as well as the earlier points that I made about the convenience of individual users and the effect of that on their motivation.
<P>
I hope that I will not be accused of being a psychotherapist—although I am not sure what a psychotherapist does, let alone how to act like one—if I say that I am not looking for the Minister to endorse the amendment strongly. It would be enough for him to give us some warm words and promise that he will think carefully about the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) made some valid points. I am not in the business of uttering warm words, particularly after so many hours in Committee. I want to address the matter seriously because the hon. Gentleman raised some important issues. I also want to say something about the implications for adult and community learning and the priority that the hon. Gentleman understandably gave to younger people and the school sixth form.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Well, it is early on, but yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister because he suggested that amendment No. 56 makes provision for over-19s, which I did not mention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> That is why I want to say something about that.
<P>
First, however, I shall say something about the education of younger people in rural areas. I want to make two different, but related points. First, we are concerned about the problems of transport costs in some rural areas. Where the family decides that it would like the student to go to a sixth form college or a school many miles away, the transport costs can be prohibitive and a burden. Therefore, as part of our piloting of education maintenance allowances, we have undertaken specific pilots to take account of transport costs. We will report back to the House on the success of those in due course. That is one way of approaching the matter. It is still early days, but I also hope that we shall be able to negotiate discounts on transport costs for young people when we bring into being our plans for a youth card for the relevant group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> May I raise the related issue of cross-border movements from one LSC area to another? I should declare an interest because I am merely a stone's throw from the border of my own LSC, and most local provision will go into Banbury. Some people will go to the sixth form college and many others will go to the technical college, which is in a different area. Whatever comes up, I take it that the Minister will not shut his eyes to, but, if possible, facilitate practical arrangements where those would be sensible and in pupils' interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Yes, of course. I can certainly give that assurance.
<P>
Much of the burden of the remarks by the hon. Member for Hertsmere concerned sixth formers in rural areas. I give an assurance that the good rural school with a sixth form—even if it is relatively small—will be safeguarded where there is high quality and clear demand. That is part of the pattern of education in our society and in rural communities. In considering transport costs and education maintenance allowances, it is important that we try to bring to students in rural areas the same choice that students in urban areas exercise over where they undertake A-level or vocational studies.
<P>
I should say something about adult and community education because this is a good opportunity to do so. The issues raised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere are especially relevant to adult and community learning, where the local dimension is often key to assisting people to get back into learning and develop an interest and engagement in it. We must take that into account for those who are socially disadvantaged or who find it hard or intimidating to access learning in big institutions. We have already taken several initiatives and we have, for example, set up the adult and community learning fund with that in mind. The fund has been targeted at helping disadvantaged people into learning on their own terms. It has helped to develop the delivery of learning in more accessible ways and to build links with a wide variety of community and voluntary organisations, in addition to the more established bodies in the further and higher education sectors. I visited a small centre in north Somerset in which, on the initiative of people in the local community, a GP had been persuaded to hold regular surgeries. It was the first time that a GP surgery had been so close to that housing estate. A local shop was run by the community organisation, and, within those small premises, there was a learning centre. People from the community, some of whom had been away from education for 25 years, had plucked up their courage to attend the centre and master IT skills. One of the women is now the tutor in that centre. That is an indication of how it is often necessary to bring further education and learning to the community. We cannot always expect communities to get on two or three buses to go to a building called a further education institution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsden:</B> I concur with my hon. Friend the Minister. Does he agree that that is especially important given the advent of new technology? In my constituency, money from the European social fund has given young women in their 30s and 40s access to personal computer courses in community centres.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> It is encouraging to hear how many examples there are. The university for industry and the rest will further increase the number of people who access learning. Courses can be in the church hall, the chapel or, for those with different interests, the pub. I have also heard of examples involving a shopping centre, and, recently, a curry house. There are all kinds of ways—some spiritual, and some more enjoyable—of accessing learning. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The computer and IT will create more such opportunities in the future. It is therefore vital that the Learning and Skills Council allows, as it will, for that kind of access and funding. Local education authorities will play a vital role, and we have already guaranteed them their current level of funding for the first two transitional years of new arrangements, as long as they maintain current spend and effectively implement lifelong learning plans. We want to build on and develop the current work, especially in areas where there has been a significant decline in adult and community learning since the creation of the further education sector. I am especially worried about those areas—the hon. Member for Daventry should take note—where there has been a rapid decline in adult education opportunities. We have worked hard to establish the university for industry and learndirect to help open up access to learning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister and I share a common objective, but will he give an explanation that he was unable to provide earlier? A local authority, which will no doubt feel short of cash, may have diverted its standard spending assessment provision towards its schools budget and away from adult and community education, which, in terms of the Minister's argument, will therefore be deficient. Will that money be taken from better organised authorities, and transmitted through the Learning and Skills Council to shore up provision in the areas of deficiency? How does the Minister intend to cross-subsidise?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We are not in the business of levelling down. A local authority that has kept the flag of adult education flying high, of which, I am pleased to say, there are many—I will not say what colour the flag is—will be protected. We are in the business of levelling up. LEAs have received a guarantee in relation to the next two or three years. In assessing the community's needs, the task of the Learning and Skills Council will be to ensure proper provision of adult and community learning. We hope and expect that LEAs will be the providers. However, if a local authority had no interest, it would be the job of the LSC to find an alternative provider.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Is the Minister confirming that those local authorities that did nothing and got rid of this area of discretionary spend first will benefit from the measure? If they do, their action will have been an investment in the future. The Minister twice mentioned the university for industry and learndirect in his helpful remarks; will he explain how those two bodies, particularly the former, will interface with the LSC? Will their resources come from the LSC? Or will there be a separate funding stream for them and, if so, what?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The UFI will be adequately funded. I hope that there might be an opportunity later, because the hon. Gentleman has raised the matter rather late in the debate, to look properly at the links between the UFI and the LSC. We envisage a close connection between them. It would be absurd if, in our endeavour to establish learning centres and access to learning in different parts of the community, what happened to the UFI and to other bodies were entirely unrelated. The hon. Gentleman made the point that we can build on the smaller rural school, maybe with a sixth form, by enabling it to become much more of a community resource. Whenever I am asked—as I occasionally am—to open a learning centre in a school, the question I always ask is whether anything will be taking place there that evening. I am pleased that more and more schools have a good answer to that question.
<P>
To turn to the purely technical aspects of the amendment, I assure hon. Members that the LSC would not be carrying out its duties properly if it did not take into account the particular needs of individuals. Clauses 2 and 3 set out the provision that LSC funds must be suitable to learners' requirements. We are assessing needs. The LSC must also take account of the location and nature of provision and of people's different abilities and aptitudes. We are satisfied that the Bill already covers the good point made by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. We have had a good debate, with good contributions and interventions. I hope that with those assurances, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister's response. He made some important contributions on adult education. He fleshed out the provisions of the clause, which he must agree is a fairly full one, and put a slightly different interpretation on it —one which immediately occurred to me when I first read it. His comments gave it additional meaning.
<P>
It has been a useful debate, which has examined the provisions from the point of view of the individual user In my opening remarks, I concentrated on 16 to 18-year-olds; I should have said that amendment No. 56 relates to the older age that is dealt with by clause 3. Many, if not all, of my remarks would apply to those people, but I was thinking particularly of the convenience and the effect on the motivation of 16 to 18-year-olds. I am sure that the Minister would agree that we should do everything possible to encourage them to get appropriate education and training.
<P>
The debate has also been useful in regard to the issue of rural areas. Those who are familiar with rural areas know that the changes that have taken place in recent decades, and which have intensified in the past two or three years, mean that opportunities for work in agriculture are not what they were.
<P>
Once upon a time, the school leaver in a rural area might have gone straight into farming or a job as a farm labourer, but those opportunities no longer exist. There are nothing like as many openings for school leavers in agriculture as there once were. Furthermore, many older people who have been made redundant from jobs in agriculture are looking for education and training, too.
<P>
We make no apologies for examining the needs of rural areas. I have listened carefully to the Minister's remarks, but we will keep coming back to sixth forms and, in particular, those in rural areas. I am sure that they will occupy our attention in later debates. However, to make progress now, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 2, line 20, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) Provision is not to be considered as giving rise to disproportionate expenditure only because that provision is more expensive than comparable provision.'<P>
</UL></FONT>.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 12 to 15.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The amendments deal with concerns raised in another place, which might be shared here.
<P>
Clause 2(4)(e) was added to the Bill on Third Reading in another place and aims to secure that high-cost provision should not be put at risk simply because of its cost. The concern behind that clause related to the funding of small rural sixth forms and provision for students with special needs. Such provision is likely to be more expensive than that made in larger institutions for students with no special needs. I have written to the hon. Member for Daventry to confirm that we have no difficulty with the issues behind clause 2(4)(e). Indeed, we take a much broader approach to them, as I shall demonstrate later.
<P>
Amendment No. 12 removes the amendment that was made to the Bill in another place. As was made clear at the time, that amendment is legally defective, and there are several other problems with it. First, it is unnecessary to say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>disproportionate expenditure is expenditure that is wasteful.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Wasteful expenditure is clearly not that which makes best use of the LSC's resources within the meaning of clause 2(3)(e). Secondly, the amendment is technically defective in that it refers to ``duties and functions''. It should have said either ``functions'' or ``duties or powers''. Thirdly, it is wrong in principle to describe disproportionate expenditure as expenditure that is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>unrelated to the duties and functions of the Council.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such expenditure would not simply be disproportionate, but ultra vires—that is, outside the powers of the LSC and therefore illegal—[Interruption.] When Opposition Members say my lines for me, I know that we are beginning to win and to build the great consensus that we all strive for on skills.
<P>
Finally, the amendment arguably misses the key point about disproportionate expenditure. Something that is disproportionate must be measured in relation to something else. Disproportionate expenditure is that which, although not necessarily wasteful, is too much or too little in view of the LSC's overall functions and expenditure To give an example that might gladden the hearts of lawyers everywhere, the LSC might decide to finance every graduate who wanted to become a barrister or solicitor—even the Liberal amendment earlier did not go quite that far. The LSC would have the power to do that under clause 5(1)(d). Such expenditure would not be wasted, but it would nevertheless involve levels of funding that were too high for something that was so peripheral to the LSC's main duties in respect of education and training. Making such provision would give rise to disproportionate expenditure. Whether or not we agree with the concerns behind the amendment, it could not stand in its present form.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 11, 13, 14 and 15 cut out words that are unnecessary or legally defective. They also apply consistently to the main duties of the LSC and the Council for Education and Training for Wales in respect of young people and adults. They express plainly that disproportionate expenditure does not rule out the funding of expensive provision.
<P>
The amendment made in another place was narrowly conceived and applied. It applies only to clause 2—to the 16 to 19 age group in England—and does nothing for adults or anyone in Wales. I presume that Lord Pilkington was less concerned about those people. However, the principle applies equally to adult provision in England, where the LSC will be responsible for meeting the needs of students with learning difficulties and or disabilities and others whose needs may involve more expensive provision than usual. The same amendment should be made to clause 3, which amendment No. 13 will achieve.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am sure that those hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies do not want their constituents to be treated as second-class citizens if they need expensive provisions, so we consider that the same amendment should be made to clauses 31 and 32.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thank the Minister for his explanation. I have no intention of advising my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote against his amendments. They represent an improvement, but equally—the hon. Gentleman was verging on being churlish about the matter—Lord Pilkington was on to an important point of concern that has already been touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. We are worried about rural sixth forms. I am worried about adequate provision for special educational needs. I am satisfied that, given his explanation and the somewhat circular arguments that lawyers must deploy and which their draftsmen have to use on such occasions, the amendments are appropriate.
<P>
I want to press the Minister, however, on disproportionality. I must confess that I genuinely do not understand what is going on. I am not playing games with him or the Committee. It is clear that the concept of disproportionality must be to do with expenditure. The purpose of the Government's amendments, which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee accept, is to say that if a provision will be more expensive, it will not automatically be ruled out. I genuinely do not know what criteria could be applied to decide whether something was disproportionate. The Minister said that such provision would not be ruled out automatically if it cost more. He went on to say that there could be certain cases in which expenditure was over the top and he cited some examples of that.
<P>
I do not know how one would draw a distinction between the cases. I notice a look of puzzlement on the face of the hon. Member for Hallam, but I genuinely do not know how such a distinction could be made. It could come within a particular category of provision such as courses in a minority language. If a specific school wished to offer Italian in its sixth-form curriculum, that would not be ruled out automatically by the fact that it would be more expensive to provide it at the school than in a further education college. However, if such a provision were five, 10 or 15 times more expensive, that would fall into the area of disproportionality.
<P>
Another example given by the Minister was that the Learning and Skills Council could, in its wisdom, decided to gang up on the lawyers. The correspondence that I received when I was a Minister sometimes gave me the impression that the only matter that concerned hon. Members was correspondence about children who aspired to be in the legal profession. I should declare a modest interest in that myself People were worried that they would have to pay the costs of their children's legal education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight the difficult issue. Given the Minister's reference to the legal profession, it is fairly straightforward to talk about which courses should be in or out. It is much harder to decide which institutions one should agree to fund when there is a disparity between the cost of running courses at those institutions. It is unclear at which point a sixth form course becomes disproportionate compared with the cost of the FE course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is true. I took the Minister's analogy to be the balance of the overall funding. He brought it back—this may be the answer to the conundrum—to some of the general duties of the council. The Minister is interested in balance, as are we all. None of us, even for the purpose of debate, advocates shutting down all sixth forms, or the arts or doing only training or whatever. We need not have that kind of discussion. We are trying to get a broad portfolio of opportunities and broad access to them for the great mass of both young people and adults. The Minister helpfully mentioned adults and the Welsh.
<P>
I cannot see what is left to be disproportionate when we are seeking to impose a filter on the costing. Rather like Atlee's definition of the elephant, we cannot define it, but we all know what it is when we see it. There must be some way of deciding when something is disproportionate, but the Minister must help the Committee a little more, not least because these questions may, if push comes to shove, be tested in the courts. It would be helpful to have an indication at this stage of what is in the Minister's mind.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it does not matter whether a course is &#163;10, &#163;100 or &#163;1,000 more expensive? Expense is not one of the criteria for disproportionality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is the problem. If expense does not come into it, what does? That is what the Committee needs to know.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> We welcome the clarification. We felt that Lord Pilkington's amendment was narrow, but nevertheless got to the heart of one of the big issues. Sixth forms are used to a system of funding that is determined by the total number of students who go to the school. They are not funded on any course specifics. It is up to the head, the governors, the parents and the students to decide what courses are offered. They can decide to operate a French course for only two students or a music course for only one student, provided that they can balance the books overall. FE colleges are not used to working in that way. They are used to unit funding that is allocated to them in different stage—the ALF, or average level of funding—units. Decisions about whether a course is viable are taken much earlier. There is a totally different regime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is a genuine exploration by the Committee. Before the hon. Gentleman gets into his stride on this, within the further education funding formula, there is both pressure for convergence to produce a more uniform structure and an acknowledgement that certain courses require additional expenditure. Under one sloppy definition, that might be seen as disproportionate to the expenditure on exactly the same age group on a different course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The hon. Gentleman has clearly been reading some of my thoughts. One declared objective that we support is that there should be some parity between the funding of courses provided in sixth form colleges and sixth forms and those provided in FE colleges. One of the gripes of the FE sector has been that up to 30 per cent. more is spent to provide a three A-level course in a sixth form compared with an FE college. The Government have made it clear that they want to see a more level playing field, although not necessarily parity. We certainly do not wish to do other than support what the Minister is saying, but we must get the necessary clarification so that attempts to achieve a level playing field in terms of funding do not close schools or organisations by default. That is one of our major concerns.
<P>
It is not simply the small rural sixth form that is at stake. With respect, the hon. Member for Daventry, Lord Pilkington and others do their case a disservice by concentrating on what many might say was a narrow group of people. In reality, many urban constituencies have small schools for a range of different purposes. There might be small single-sex schools. When I worked in Leeds, there was a demand for a girls' single-sex school and not for a boys' school, but there had to be one due to the way in which the system worked.
<P>
Church schools are a clear example; they can be applied to under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. There may be small denominational schools as well. A group of Jewish elders is talking to me about setting up a school in Harrogate that, by definition, will have a small number of students. Nevertheless, we should encourage it. The nature of our exploration of the subject is to get satisfaction from the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that his earlier comment about the difference between institutions funded by the FEFC methodology and school sixth forms was not correct? He said that school sixth forms were funded by the number of students, but they are funded by the number of students deemed to be enrolled on 1 January in their form 7 return. That does not always equate to the number of students who complete the year's course.
<P>
My other question is about the trade-off between quality and convenience in small sixth forms. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there is a minimum number below which it is not possible to provide the breadth and richness of experience, the balanced curriculum and the range of choice, extra-curricular activities, support and guidance that we ought reasonably to demand for all 16 to 19-year-old students? The issue is not confined to rural areas; as he rightly pointed out, it is for urban and suburban areas as well. If there is a minimum number, what is it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman is starting to make a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful for the intervention. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the 1 January form 7 date for deciding student numbers. All he did was emphasise my point about the differences between traditional funding for sixth forms and for FE colleges, which has been far more rigorous through the FEFC's formula and will be, I presume, through the LSC's formula. That will impact on schools after the two-year honeymoon. The real test of the Bill will not be over the next two years, but thereafter, when it starts to bite home.
<P>
In terms of small numbers, I am at one with the hon. Gentleman. In the first reorganisation proposed in Leeds, late in the 1980s, I argued that small sixth forms, especially in large urban areas, that had classes with two or three students did those students a disadvantage. I have always held that view, but I recognise that it is not necessarily so. Parents and youngsters sometimes want to stay with minority subjects into the sixth form. They may study maths and physics in large groups, but music or Latin in small groups. In most FE colleges, courses cannot be run unless there is a magical number of students. I would not like to see that happen in sixth forms, or in FE colleges. Unless there is a mix and discretion within the management of colleges or schools, we shall remove from them the essence of managing the educational experience on behalf of youngsters.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The debate has been useful, and I am grateful for the spirit in which it has been conducted. We have recognised concerns about the future of sixth forms and about special needs provision by tabling the amendments. We want to offer young people options that meet their individual and different needs, and recognise that some types of provision will be more expensive than others. It is possible to produce precise definitions in this respect; we certainly cannot produce arithmetic or equations to help us through, although I refer the Committee to the extensive and detailed explanation of disproportionate expenditure given by Lord Bach in another place.
<P>
At one level, the matters are not new and are common to all public policy and its practice. I can think of one or two constituency cases involving disputes between the LEA and parents of children under the age of 16 who have special needs. Such disputes arise when parents have found a school, perhaps with boarding provision, which they reasonably believe will meet the needs of their son or daughter, but the LEA is concerned about the sheer public cost of the school in the light of other provision in the community. Such issues are difficult. In the sphere of health, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence is currently examining various treatments, including drug-based treatments and others, which are often very expensive because of their novelty or because they involve very new developments. The institute is considering issues of disproportionate expenditure and so on, which are difficult and complex, and about which a good point has been raised, to which we not have a precise answer.
<P>
Much of the answer that we can provide will have to rely on directions given by the Secretary of State in discussion with the Learning and Skills Council. It will also have to rely on the plain common sense of members of the national LSC and of the local learning and skills councils. I hope that the amendments will be accepted in that spirit and for the different reasons that have been articulated.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 52, in page 2, line 23, at end insert—

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This debate may be a little more simple in legal terms, but it is educationally important. The amendments are slightly different, and the first one arises from a legal concern. The Bill contains separate references to education and training. I am not sufficiently versed in law to know whether those concepts legally embrace one another. If they do, there is no great problem, because we are anxious to ensure that young people and older people—in clauses 2 and 3 respectively—receive education and training that is appropriate to them. Some people will suggest that too much distinction has been made in the past between education and training. I referred earlier to the trenchantly expressed concerns of the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education about the difference between young and old people. It asks:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Are we in danger of creating a new rift just as the academic-vocational one is closing?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the rift is closing, I welcome that and I am delighted. The Minister referred in remarks that I did not take down in detail to education and training operating together, as if they were collective activities. If so, it is good news.
<P>
We are anxious in amendment No. 52 to consider situations that might give rise to funding difficulties. First, is it possible to say whether an activity is education or training? I do not mind if it is useful to the student and his career development, but general education, which is a better formulation than academic education, may be important even as part of a vocational course. It is most important that people should have a broad battery of educational attainments and a platform on which they can build their specific skills. Those skills can then be developed. It is not always clear whether an activity will constitute education or training.
<P>
Secondly, students will take courses in which some elements will be educational and others will be vocational. The ratio may vary over time. An obvious example is that of general national vocational qualifications; some parts are clearly vocational and, implicitly or explicitly, others emphasise the core skills or add other units that are more generally educational.
<P>
Thirdly, although I do not believe that it is the Minister's intention to impose limits, I am slightly worried that activities will be branded according to where they were conducted. One may say that whatever goes on in a school is educational, but that would be a pity, because it may be appropriate to carry out training in schools. That is particularly so if, as the Minister said earlier—I know of many cases of such good practice in my constituency—evening activities offered to adults are more of a training or vocational nature. Unless it was done course by course, it would be fairly difficult to split the courses offered by sixth-form colleges or further education colleges along those lines.
<P>
We are anxious to ensure reasonable flexibility, and that the language of the statute does not create a difficulty by insisting on a prior decision about whether what is on offer is education or training. If it cannot be funded under one head, we must find a means of funding it under another. I look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
Amendment No. 53 is a little more legally fraught. It deals with the place of education—where education arises. I do not see a geographic reference in clause 2— indeed, I am not sure that I want to see one. I have tabled a new clause on the possibility of collaborative and participant activities taking place, and we shall discuss that matter later. I am concerned about the best use of the LSC's funds and the proportionate use of its expenditure. It should be able to draw on the best provision to meet the need, wherever it arises. That could be abroad—I include the constituent parts of the United Kingdom. It should be able to buy into those courses.
<P>
The amendment includes the phrase, which I drafted: ``education arising online''. Now that we have access to information technology and cyberspace, it does not matter where the information comes from if it is useful. People can and will want to get hold of it. I recently but tentatively staggered on-line. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will agree that the experience is akin to Keats's experience on first looking into Chapman's Homer. It is a new and exciting world. We should celebrate the fact that it creates tremendous opportunities and power.
<P>
Everyone in the 16 to 19-year-old age group, and many older people, are familiar with such technology. They would be extremely impatient if a legal hoop or funding restriction made it impossible to get access to the best product, no matter where it originated. Amendment No. 52 is in that spirit. We need to know that education and training are not mutually exclusive. Amendment No. 53 would ensure that education, wherever it arose or however it was delivered, was made available if the LSC thought that it was the best and most suitable provision.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I rise to speak to amendment No. 53. It raises important issues. I congratulate the hon. Member for Daventry for coining the poetic phrase ``arising on-line''. I have never thought of information as arising on-line. I have a vision of him surfing lonely as a cloud and coming across a host of educational websites.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have a brief confession. I suspect that the phrase arose because my internet service provider is AOL and it happened to fit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. I shall not divert into a discussion on internet service providers or anything too anoraky. We should stick to the poetic notions.
<P>
The important issue is how education is delivered. The Minister should consider that when defining full and part-time education. I am keen on the geographical and internet methods of delivery. Sheffield Hallam university, which, just to confuse matters, is based in the constituency of the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central, offers good courses at higher education that are applicable to the levels that we are discussing. For example, it offers courses that bring together students in Hong Kong. Course work is delivered on the internet and one tutor may be sent over there, but most tutorial work is done through video conferencing or on-line.
<P>
What we send in one direction in these post-colonial days can be sent in the opposite direction. The leading sector in the field of information communication technology has tremendous education facilities. There will be great advantages in contracting to purchase courses that are delivered in that way from other countries into the United Kingdom. We expect to sell our educational products abroad. If the LSCs are doing their job, they will buy in products that could come from anywhere. Those will not be simplistic models of computer-based training, but high-quality courses that are as good as any other product.
<P>
The other great advantage is that such products will allow people to balance work and family commitments with learning. The traditional full-time model involves someone going to a physical place. Courses will increasingly be delivered through the digital television at home. There will be a range of methods which will not involve going to a physical place. There are huge advantages. An individual will be able to stay in work or keep up with family commitments while having access to education and training. I am sure that the Government intend fully to promote the new methods of delivery through the LSCs. However, it is important that such methods are discussed.
<P>
The split between education and training raises key issues. I do not know whether I have to declare an interest for having participated in the Industry and Parliament Trust Fellowship with British Gas. The trust did not pay me; instead, it sold me electricity and Goldfish cards. British Gas equips its employees with laptops as part of its training system. Its employees are trained to a high standard in gas fitting and maintenance, and all their training is delivered via the laptop computers that staff members carry around. That method could be used equally well to deliver specific on-the-job training, which is the company's responsibility. It could also be used to deliver wider training, such as Confederation of Registered Gas Installers registration, or to teach physics O-level or A-level or anything else that traditionally comes within the field of education. That method of delivery will become increasingly common and people will want to take advantage of such non-traditional systems. The learning and skills councils should be able to fund that, perhaps in partnership with companies. I hope that the Minister will give the Committee some idea about the Government's view of those new methods of delivery, some of which are being pioneered by the university for industry, which is based in Sheffield, and some of which are being pioneered in the private sector. I hope that those private sector examples will be taken up for public sector provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> The amendment presents an opportunity to rehearse some of the cautions that we should observe in our wish to deliver education in as many different ways as possible. Several spectacular crooked educational schemes have been running during the past few years, and they have been delivered to pubs, gurdwaras and temples of all sorts. In our enthusiasm to provide as many outlets as possible for education, including on-line, we must have regard for the funding pressures that lead to such abuses, which have resulted in some very difficult situations for people to overcome. We must think carefully in expanding education on-line, which is bound to happen and should be widely used. We must carefully monitor the way in which such services are funded and used.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> This ostensibly harmless amendment opens—I was about to say a can of worms—a remarkably important debate. I understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East has a keen interest in the issue and many hon. Members will know why, given his experience. However, I want to tread a path between the wild enthusiasm of the hon. Member for Hallam and the note of caution expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East.
<P>
One of the problems is that, for many of us, our perception of how education might be in future is determined by the institutions that we experienced in the past. Therefore, for some people, the model of education is a grammar school sixth form of the 1950s, whereas for others it is the technical college of the late 1960s. Frankly, I believe that neither institution will be the dominant mode of delivering education in the next 10 or 15 years. We are moving into a period when the delivery of education will be far more deregulated, diversified, fragmented and fluid—a combination of delivery through traditional institutions and on-line delivery. I welcome the amendments, which remind us of the rapidly changing nature and rapid obsolescence of many of the traditional institutions that we thought would exist forever.
<P>
The other issue is the distinction between full-time and part-time. I am unsure whether such a distinction still exists. I do not believe that it has any statutory basis whatsoever. Some further education colleges and even some schools must conform to that arbitrary administrative convenience. However, in reality, it does not exist. No one can seriously define what now constitutes full-time education. There is no such thing as a 30-hour teaching week any more. My children are at sixth-form college. They attend for 20 hours a week but we assume that they are full-time students. Just a few years' ago, anyone doing 21 hours a week would have been defined as a part-time student. The blurring of the distinction between modes of attendance—full-time and part-time—parallels the blurring of distinction between modes of delivery—institutional and on-line. The future will be far more fragmented. Coming to grips with that will be a major challenge for the Learning and Skills Council.
<P>
<B>Charlotte Atkins </B>(Staffordshire, Moorlands): Before we throw out the additional institutions of which my hon. Friend spoke, I wish to address the issue of on-line learning. The Education and Employment Select Committee visited the United States. I remember a comment made about the loneliness of the interaction between the student and the screen when on-line. We must guard against banks of students each staring into their screens. I recognise from my education and from that of my daughter that the interaction of real live students can be far more productive than individual students accessing courses by video conferencing, however much one loves that system and however brilliant the courses are. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I fully accept my hon. Friend's comments. To continue with the literary references, I am conscious of the loneliness of the long-distance learner. I am not arguing that on-line learning will replace teachers completely. All I am saying is that there is an unstoppable momentum. Much of the learning for many young people and adults nowadays is on-line. They learn far more through either their computer or their television than in their classroom. We must recognise that fact. I am sure that my hon. Friend will comment on that matter.
<P>
I want to add a note of caution. We need to look forward to what life will be like in the next 10 to 20 years and not assume that life will remain as it was 30 or 40 years ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I suffer from the evils of conservatism and so have sympathy for the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East. I certainly share the view expressed by Sam Rayburn, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and a great Texan, to Lyndon Johnson, when the latter was president. He said that the three wisest words in the English language were ``wait a minute''. The hon. Gentleman did us a service by, in effect, saying that about the debate.
<P>
I speak in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. Not all that long ago, it was brought home to me that when my young were in higher education, they had criticised me over the years for continuing to buy books even though, as they rightly said, I had no time to read them and, however long I lived, would never have time to read them.
<P>
One new year's day, my youngest son said that he had much enjoyed being with us for Christmas but that he had to return to his university because he had to write three essays in the next nine days and that, for one of the essays, the critical work was on the closed shelves of the university library. I asked, on the principle of ``wait a minute'' and out of curiosity, what the book was. He said that I should not be ridiculous—there would not be the faintest prayer of my having even heard of it, let alone owning it. I said that the least he could do was to try me, and he said that the book was The architecture of ancient Greece: an account of its historic development by Dinsmoor, published by Batsford. I noted that I thought that I had a copy. That brought home to my youngest son that it was possible for books to be available on the open shelves of one's home that were otherwise available only on the closed shelves of the university library. In telling that story, I am revealing an addiction to books.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry is clearly right to have tabled the amendments. They have provoked a good debate. I agree with the hon. Member for Bury, North—education has been transformed, even in the 15 years since I ceased to be a Minister in the Department. 
<P>
It is certainly true when I think back to my time in higher education, more than 40 years ago, that the great danger is that people of my age or even younger think about education in the context of their own experience, rather than that which people are experiencing at the moment.
<P>
I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry tabled the amendments, which are immensely worth discussing. I share the views of the hon. Member for Bury, North on the evolution of the part-time student. The part-time student is patently one of the glories of our system that, with the exception of the United States, is not shared on the same scale by any other country in the world. The hon. Gentleman is right that just as the methods of delivering education are changing, so are the ways in which people receive it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We have had an interesting debate and have been introduced to a brave new world of learning, although one or two hon. Members reminded us that some brave new worlds have downsides and that some issues must be tackled. It was helpful that the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) discussed good, old-fashioned, humble bookshelves. He said that his own bookshelves were not closed. I am not sure whether that meant that we could introduce a new learning centre in his study—although, as I emphasised earlier, we have no powers of compulsory purchase through the Learning and Skills Council, so there is no danger of that happening.
<P>
The thought of the hon. Member for Daventry now being on-line was awesome, and it made me think, as we approach the fifth hour of our deliberations, that perhaps the scrutiny of Bills will be on-line in some way in a few years' time. That would have many advantages. It would mean that we could have by our sides a mug of tea. Although I am constantly assured that the modernisation of Parliament proceeds at a breathtaking pace, it has not yet extended to a cup of tea or even a chocolate biscuit. No doubt that will come as we modernise at this frantic pace.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry made some good points in speaking to amendment No. 52, and I shall try to meet his anxieties in the few remaining moments. I presume that we shall continue the discussion later in the week.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope not. Let us try to finish it tonight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Yes, indeed. But I must speak slowly and clearly.
<P>
The functions of the Learning and Skills Council deliberately combine education and training under the term ``post-16 education and training''. We have no problem with provision being made jointly by providers, regardless of whether that includes the LSC. We have repeatedly made clear our emphasis on the need for greater co-operation between providers. We may well close tonight.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I suspected that the hon., Gentleman would.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I need only an hour or two to make my points.
<P>
We want to ensure that the LSC has the flexibility to make provision in whatever way best meets learners' needs. If provision is better made jointly by two or more providers, it should and will be permitted.
<P>
I refer the hon. Member for Daventry to a couple of other clauses designed to deal with exactly that issue. Clause 5(2)(c) explicitly permits the LSC to make arrangements for funding provision made jointly. From a different perspective, I also invite him to read clause 115, which provides for greater collaboration between further education colleges and schools providing pre-16 education. The provision is backed up by a power in clause 5(1)(e) to enable the LSC to fund such collaborative activity.
<P>
In view of the provision already made in the Bill and in the light of those comments, I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will recognise that the amendment is unnecessary and will consider withdrawing it.
<P>
Amendment No. 53 would extend the definition of education for the purposes of clause 2 to make it explicit that it may include provision made on-line using the internet or provision from another country. It is at this point that my ministerial colleague, who is absent because of illness, could have made a better contribution to the debate, given his functions in the Department for Information Communication Technology.
<P>
Again, I thank the hon. Member for Daventry for raising the important issue of information technology. The Government want to ensure that the rapid pace of technological development does not leave our schools and colleges behind. Indeed, our initiatives to establish the national learning network and the planned IT infrastructure supported by &#163;74 million of new Government funding resulting from the comprehensive spending review are of particular relevance to post-16 education and training. The network will be established by March 2001 and will connect all FE colleges and higher education institutions with links to the national grid for learning. That will provide the essential infrastructure for the major providers to have a national learning framework linking further and higher education, and shows the links that we want to establish with the university sector, which we discussed earlier. There will be improved access to IT facilities for both students and staff, which will include access to the most up-to-date learning materials. That will also support the sector's capacity to play a leading role in the university for industry.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I will say a little about the university for industry, not least because the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough suggested last week that the Government had ignored the UFI in our proposals. We intend the LSC to work closely with the UFI, which will develop high quality on-line learning products and make them available to people at home, in the workplace and in learndirect development centres in different locations. At the moment, there are 77 learndirect development centres, and we have plans for a network of 1,000 centres to be established by spring 2001. The development centres are currently piloting 24 on-line products. At least 60 per cent. of learndirect's products will be available on-line by the time the service is fully launched in the autumn.
<P>
There is clearly a demand for a more flexible and innovative approach to learning. The learndirect helpline, which gives free impartial advice on a range of learning and career opportunities, has had more than 1.2 million calls since it was set up in February 1998. A recent customer survey, undertaken between October and December 1999, showed that 48 per cent. of respondents did not hold qualifications at level 3 or above. We are seeking to help such people.
<P>
We have allocated &#163;44 million to the UFI to take forward its development and implementation plans, and a further &#163;6.25 million for the development and management of the learndirect information and advice line in 1999–2000.
<P>
Reading college, for example, is already committed to the initiative. It has learndirect development centres at Reading station and at a bookshop in the town centre. I imagine that one occasionally has more time to learn at Reading station than one might have hoped from the timetable, but I must not stray into that territory. The college is using all the resources of information technology to attract new students and make learning accessible to them. 
<P>
The UFI will be one of the LSC's key partners, as we have clearly set out in the LSC prospectus. However, it is not necessary to say in the Bill that on-line provision is permissible. The LSC is under a duty to secure the provision of proper facilities for education suitable to the requirements of people aged 16 to 19. Obviously, that would include on-line provision, which is one of many valuable teaching resources available. We expect what has been achieved under the present framework to be further developed and enhanced by the LSC.
<P>
Amendment No. 53 would also make it explicit that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>education may include education arising . . . from another country.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I must confess to being unsure about how the LSC can secure the provision of proper facilities for ``education from another country''. However, if the amendment is intended to explore whether the council can fund on-line learning programmes or fund students to spend time abroad on learning programmes, I can assure the hon. Member for Daventry that that is the case and that his amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
An important point was made about the possibility of fraud. An inspection framework will inspect training and education rigorously, whether on-line or in more conventional institutions, such as the excellent adult education centre in Wolverhampton that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East and I recently visited. Inspection frameworks and other quality assurance frameworks will be in place, wherever the learning comes from. As we frame new policies, it is proper for the issue of fraud to be uppermost in our minds. I recall that a Green Paper on social security recommended that the best means of combating fraud was to design it out when new policies were established. The Department is certainly committed to ensuring that that happens.
<P>
We have had an interesting debate. We have heard about examples of part-time and full-time education and dealt with information technology. We have discussed the possibilities for youngsters and adults to learn and study abroad, which shows that we face a new world of learning. It is vital to have the right policies, procedures and funding structures to accommodate it. In view of my assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response and I agree that we have had an interesting debate. I thank the Minister for his assurances about amendment No. 52. As long as there is no glitch and joint provision can be encouraged, not merely tolerated, the provision is as welcome to me as it is to him.
<P>
In passing on to the wider and perhaps more appealing shores of cyberspace, I was interested to hear the Minister speak about the provision of a learning centre at Reading station. I hope that that is in no sense derogatory to my own daughter's teaching in that town and that it will not require her to move from the school to the station. That reminds me that my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster is a distinguished alumnus of Balliol college, about which it was once memorably said: ``C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la gare.''
<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> Let me correct the hon. Gentleman. That was said about Keeble college. If he is aware of that college's architecture, he would appreciate why that was an appropriate saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Hancock. The designs, by Charles Gilbert Scott, were originally intended for the Foreign Office. They were transferred to St. Pancras station, where the paraphrase of a remark made in the Crimean war came into being.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I accept, of course, the corrections of the hon. Lady and my right hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Where are those colleges?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We are now back in cyberspace.
<P>
I accept the Minister's assurances. If the Learning and Skills Council needs to buy programmes from abroad, I hope that the Minister has not precluded good old-fashioned distance learning materials. I leave that to him, but it is not ruled out. The hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands spoke about whether this aspect should be dominant. She obviously thought that it was important, but universal provision does not have to be made on-line. We are talking about facilitating the option to purchase education on-line. It adds to the armoury without derogating from other provisions.
<P>
Important points were made about the need for conventional teaching and for exposure to other individuals. The hon. Lady also made a good point about having a wider remit. On another occasion, we could usefully debate points about activities that are not educational, which may be funded incidentally or may arise from leisure provisions, which are specified in the Bill. We may have overlooked debating the importance of a rounded education. Education should not entail people sitting in their rooms metaphorically in their anoraks and quietly going crazy when they should be finding out about the world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsden:</B> I concur with the hon. Gentleman. Does he agree that the Open university provides a model for combining the most up-to-date techniques with the more traditional techniques of tutorials, summer schools and so forth?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do agree, and I readily share the hon. Gentleman's affection for the Open university, to which I have been going in one capacity or another for the past 25 years. I am a great fan of that institution, which, if not the most exclusive, is one of the important players in the field.
<P>
Education has moved on and advanced, and we have visual aids, television, the internet and ICT. They are all welcome, as long as we do not take away from the essential interaction between people, and we do not seek to do that. The Minister has answered well on the matter, and we have had an interesting debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
