                  </strong> Good morning to you, Mr Sheridan, and to hon.
Members. Thanks to a sterling effort on both sides on Tuesday, we made
good progress and had some good debates. We now come to clause 9, on
exceptional funding.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000010">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">These are
technical amendments, which aim to improve drafting consistency to
bring the Bill’s wording into line with existing legislation,
and particularly the European Communities Act 1972. The clause is
intended to allow the director to provide exceptional funding where the
failure to do so would breach, or risk breaching, those rights of an
individual under European Union law that are directly enforceable in
the domestic courts.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000011">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Section 2(1)
of the Act refers to such rights as enforceable EU rights. That
definition is adopted by the Interpretation Act 1978 and is employed in
other enactments. We propose that that defined term replace the
formulation in the clause and that the same references in clause 31 and
schedule 3 are amended accordingly.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000012">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We also
propose that the ambulatory reference in clause 39(2)(b) be deleted,
since the definition of an enforceable EU right in section 2(1) of the
1972 Act already refers to rights arising “from time to
time”.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000013">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Good morning, Mr
Sheridan—I am in slight disarray. I want to speak to amendments
6 and 7. [<span class="smallcaps">Hon. Members:</span> “96 and
97.”] It would be helpful if I knew where I was. I have been
caught slightly unawares. I am now awake. The other night has rather

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Bar
Council and others proposed amendment 96, which deals with
the provision of funding in exceptional cases. The belief is that the
clause does not go far enough to address the gap in funding for parties
who need representation. The amendment might seem simple and
straightforward, but it would ensure that an exceptional case
determination may be made when it was appropriate in the interests of
justice, and not merely in cases where there would otherwise be a
breach, or the risk of a breach, of the European convention on human

reach the doors of the court. At best, it is uncertain whether the
exceptional funding regime will be of assistance to those seeking
initial advice on, for example, welfare benefits, debt or employment

Liberty’s proposed amendment allow for cases of exceptional
importance to the individual or wider social significance, or cases
involving significant inequality of arms, to be funded on an individual

                  </strong> Good morning, Mr Sheridan. It is because I am
little, perhaps, that you did not notice me sitting in the second row.
It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again this
morning. I want to speak to amendments 226 and 227, which you have
grouped with the amendments tabled by the right hon. Member for Dwyfor
Meirionnydd.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
226 would extend the scope of legal aid to cases in all categories of
law in which a child, or someone who lacks the mental capacity to
conduct their own case, is engaged, and where it is clear that such
individuals could not be expected to act in their own interest without
assistance. My contention in tabling amendment 226 is that a child or
someone who lacks mental capacity should automatically fall within
scope, rather than having to overcome the hurdle of showing the need
for funding to be routed through the Bill’s exceptional funding
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is clear
from the proposals that Ministers are keen to target legal aid
provision on those they have described as the most vulnerable. The
Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Huntingdon
repeatedly relied on that contention in our discussions on Tuesday,
when we expressed concern about several areas of law that were out of
scope. I cannot think of a group more likely by definition to be in a
vulnerable position than children.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000045">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 395<a class="bkMark" name="Column395">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">I know that
all hon. Members will agree that it is a mark of a civilised society
that we should make special provision for and offer special protections
to our children in our legal system; indeed, the law takes that view,
both in the Children Act 1989, which set out the fundamental principle
that the well-being and interests of children should be paramount when
decisions affecting them are taken, and in the signature by the UK
Government of the UN convention on the rights of the child.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is rightly
recognised that children occupy a special position in the protections
afforded to them within our legal system. There are good reasons for
that. We know that investment in our children today pays long-term
dividends in their improved outcomes as adults, and the social good
that brings for us
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000047">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is correct to say that children have evolving levels of
capacity—indeed, the Children’s Society pointed that out
in its written evidence to the Committee. The capacity of a three or
four-year old child is plainly different from that of a child or young
person of 16 or 17. However, in the interests of keeping the amendment
simple, and because in many other areas of law we have recognised that
any child, whether a young child or an older child, has to be treated
as a child, I propose in the amendment that all individuals under the
age of 18 should fall within the scope of legal aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000048">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am talking
specifically about situations where the child or young person is the
party in the case and directly in need of advice and representation. Of
course, there are many situations in which the interests of children
are protected through the legal rights of their parents or guardians.
For example, in the majority of cases, welfare benefits are not paid
directly to children. Those benefits are extremely important for the
well-being of children because parents should have an adequate income
to care for and raise them, but the assertion of rights to welfare
benefits is largely made by the parent and not by the child—I
will say a little more about that as I proceed with my remarks. The
amendment is specifically about those cases where the child as an
individual in his or her own right is the party in the case, and would
therefore be directly in receipt of advice and in need of financial
support to conduct their case.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Hon. Members
will rightly want to know what the cost would be of bringing all cases
involving children under 18 within the ambit of the legislation. In
fact, the Government have helpfully already indicated from their own
estimates that the cost would be modest. Through their own
calculations, they estimate that 6,000 children under 18 would be
captured under the amendment, and that the estimated cost of bringing
cases for those 6,000 children who are currently excluded from scope
would be about £10 million.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000050">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I know that
£10 million is not an insignificant amount of money, but I
suggest respectfully to the Minister that in the scheme of the savings
he seeks to achieve overall—not only in the justice system
although that is naturally his focus but also, importantly, for society
and the public purse in the round—£10 million is a modest
level of investment to improve significantly access and outcomes for
children, especially the poorest. The long-term impact on those
children’s life chances and on future costs to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 396<a class="bkMark" name="Column396">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the state would significantly outweigh an investment of £10
million and help secure and protect children’s legal
rights.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
would like to explore those remarks further and look in a little more
detail at those categories that are currently excluded under the law
but would come back into scope for children, and at why those
categories matter for children. I am grateful to JustRights for the
briefing with which it has provided me. I think it has been offered to
all hon. Members and has provided a good deal of food for thought. I am
sure that hon. Members will agree with me and pause for thought when
looking at what the Bill could mean for some of the most vulnerable
children who are in need of our protection.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As hon.
Members will know, JustRights is a coalition of over 30 organisations
established by Youth Access, the Law Centres Federation, the Howard
League for Penal Reform, and the Children’s Rights Alliance for
England, organisations for which I have tremendous respect and with
which I have been privileged to work in the past. They campaigned
specifically for the rights of children and young people in the legal
system, and I am grateful to them for this briefing.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000053">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We all know
that the Bill will remove access to legal aid for clients in a
significant number of categories of law that could have a bearing on
children, including: medical negligence; employment—that might
come as a surprise to hon. Members when talking about children, and I
will say a little more about it; immigration; debt, which again might
not frequently be a problem directly, but can be from time to time;
similarly, some housing cases; most education cases, which by
definition are likely to impact on children; and welfare benefits in
some cases. Among the children and young people who will lose access to
legal aid and be expected to represent themselves, as children but in
an adult system, are: those who might be living independently after
leaving the care system and who would not now be in a position to
obtain the support to challenge decisions about their access to
financial support; those, fairly worryingly, who have experienced
criminal injuries, including abuse, and we all know that that, to our
shame, can happen while children are in care as well; and those left
severely disabled by medical
negligence.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government have taken some steps to protect children up to the age of
18 from the changes proposed in the Bill, which seems to be evidence of
a recognition on the part of Ministers that children and young people
differ from adults: developmentally, obviously; in their legal
status—we certainly know that to be the case, for example, with
some of the obligations and duties that we owe children in the legal
system; and, crucially for the amendment, in their ability to navigate
the legal system. I was pleased to note that Lord McNally, said in the
House of Lords on 7 July this year, for the
Government:<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000055">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“As
far as possible, our intention is that, where children are involved,
legal aid will still be provided.”—[<em>Official Report,
House of Lords,</em> 7 July 2011; Vol. 729, c.
343.]<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000178">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government have made some concessions, albeit quite minor, to protect
children in some family cases, which I very much welcome, and to exempt
under-18s from the requirement to access legal advice via the single
telephone gateway. Those are good steps, but none the less thousands of
children and young people 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 397<a class="bkMark" name="Column397">&#160;</a>
                  </div>have not yet been protected properly and will be denied access to
justice if my amendment is not accepted today. For matters that will
now be out of scope, children will simply be left without advice or
representation—just as adults will, but with very different
effects and much greater vulnerability—yet the
Government’s own equality impact assessment has barely
considered children directly, as I believe fundamentally that it
should.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000056">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
what kind of circumstances could that impact on children become an
issue? I mentioned employment earlier and, while young people under the
age of 18 are not frequently in employment, we might have those aged 16
and 17 in paid work and in need of challenging exploitative and
discriminatory practices at work which have directly affected
them—for example, not being paid the national minimum wage. In
some circumstances, people might be living independently and claiming
financial support in their own right. That, too, might be a relatively
unusual occurrence, but none the less those young people—often
those who have left the care system—are particularly likely to
be vulnerable. In this category, I highlight a very small number of
young mothers and young pregnant women or mothers-to-be. Not only do we
have to think about the young person in that situation receiving
particular protection, but her very young children might also be
involved. For criminal injuries, children who experience abuse,
including potentially in the care system, will not now get help to
enable them to gather the evidence to put in a claim for compensation.
There are also exclusions in relation to immigration and
debt.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000057">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">I
am grateful to JustRights and a several law centres which provided us
with some powerful case histories, so we could get a real handle on the
sort of situations we are talking about. They describe the case of
Terry, age 17. Terry got his first job as a trainee mechanic in a local
garage. He was thrilled to get employment and keen to work. We often
say that our young people are not keen to work, but my experience is
absolutely the opposite. Most young people, like most adults, are
desperate to be in employment. It is a hallmark of transition to adult
life. Terry was keen to be in paid work, proud of his job and
consequently willing to take on overtime, which led to him—a
young man of 17 in his first job—working 50 hours a week during
his first four weeks on the job. That is exploitative in
itself—I am interested to know why the working time directive
has not been drawn into the case study—but what is shameful is
that at the end of those four weeks, he was paid only £160, the
equivalent of 70p an hour. That is well below the national minimum
wage, even for 16 and 17-year-olds.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">Terry was
understandably disappointed by the amount of money that he received,
and asked his employer why his pay was so low. The employer told Terry
that he was not paid for the first week of his employment, as he was
training, and that he was paid that much—the case study says
“that much”; I would say “that
little”—because he was a trainee. Terry’s
Connexions adviser recommended that he contact the law centre, which
advised Terry that he should have been paid the national minimum wage
for all the hours that he had worked, including the week during which
the employer alleged that he was training. The law centre wrote to the
employer pointing out the breaches of law and threatened to take a case
to the employment tribunal. As a result, and without the need to go to
law—that is a crucial point if we are considering 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 398<a class="bkMark" name="Column398">&#160;</a>
                  </div>saving costs downstream—Terry was paid for all the hours worked,
including the overtime. I am glad to say that he went on to find
another job where he was not
exploited.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000058">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
second example that I would like to draw to hon. Members’
attention relates to John, also 17 years old, who was living
independently, having been thrown out of his mother’s home after
repeated conflicts with her boyfriend. John has a learning disability
and attended a special school. He had no experience of managing money,
and arguably would have struggled with it in any event because of his
disability. As a result, he fell into arrears with the service charge
on his accommodation and was threatened with eviction. Streetwise
community law centre supported him to apply for disability living
allowance. He was refused initially but won a review.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000059">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">John did not
really understand that he had a learning disability, and on his own, he
would not have been able to explain his needs at a review or appeal.
Nor did he have anyone to support him. Not only had his family thrown
him out of the family home, the staff at his accommodation had no
knowledge of disability living allowance, which is admittedly a complex
benefit to apply for. The backdated benefit that Streetwise secured for
him cleared the arrears on his service charge. Streetwise also helped
him set up a standing order to pay his rent as soon as the DLA was paid
into his bank account. It is a powerful story of how early investment
in supporting young people can save costs down the
road.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000060">&#160;</a>

carefully to those examples. Apart from the human circumstances, they
show how simple it is for a qualified person to intervene in such
cases, and therefore how low the cost of an intervention at that time
can be, compared with exploitation in one case or the eventual costs to
the state in the other. I do not know whether my hon. Friend has
figures on the costs of intervention. My guess is that it is hundreds
of pounds rather than thousands. That shows not just the seriousness of
the cases but the fact that false economies are being made,
particularly where young people and vulnerable people are concerned.

                  </strong> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I am afraid
that I do not have the costs of carrying out the advice work in those

I think we all agree are a cost-effective source of advice for

hon. Members are anxious because I am taking some time over the
amendment, so I will move on and talk a little more generally about
children and young people in the immigration system, a group about
which I am concerned. Out of 4,000 cases with no funding through the
legal aid or exceptional funding schemes that are proposed,
approximately 2,500 of the excluded cases for under-18s will relate to
immigration matters. I am concerned that taking immigration out of
scope will have a detrimental effect on the children, including
trafficked children, even though I accept that they might be eligible
for exceptional funding. I will say a little more about that in a
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000063">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Children’s Society has highlighted the vulnerability of children
who might have been abused, neglected or exploited by their carers in
its “Hidden Children” report. Child victims of
trafficking may have immigration claims that are not asylum claims and
might not automatically qualify for legal aid. Such cases can be
complex and require expert legal advice and representation, sometimes
including medical legal reports, country expert evidence, and evidence
on the modus operandi of the traffickers and how the child arrived in
the country. Additionally, in many instances, an unaccompanied or
separated child under age 18 will need to apply for further leave, or
appeal against a refusal of leave to remain, because children are
usually granted discretionary leave to remain for only three years. An
11-year-old unaccompanied child could be granted leave when they arrive
in the country, but that would take them to age 14 only. They would
then require a new application, and it would be fair to say that it is
difficult for a 14-year-old to make that application on their
own.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000064">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important that the Government have already recognised the need for
some extension into scope of immigration cases where domestic violence
is involved—that is welcome. We should look carefully at the
position of children in the immigration system, particularly
unaccompanied children, who are a very vulnerable
group.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000065">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
other group of cases that I want to highlight through the amendment
relates to education, which is clearly likely disproportionately to
affect children under 18, who have the fundamental right to receive an
education. I welcome the Government’s adoption of the previous
Government’s intention to extend the age of compulsory education
to 18. That would encompass all the children whom I am discussing and
require them to be in education or other equivalent activity. Education
will be in scope for all of
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000066">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
also welcome the Government’s decision to retain legal aid and
assistance in cases affecting special educational needs. However,
according to the information provided by the Ministry of Justice and
its equality impact assessment, at least 58% of all education cases
will still be out of scope under the current proposals. They include
cases of bullying, exclusions and admissions. Appeals are not
straightforward, and many parents will struggle to support their
children’s cases without legal help and representation.
Providing legal aid for admissions appeals helps ensure that children
from different backgrounds have equal access to the better-performing
schools, something I know that the Government are keen to achieve. It
is also important to note that some children face a particularly high
risk of exclusion from school. In particular, Traveller, Gypsy and Roma
children are five times more likely to be excluded from school than the
national average and would be disproportionately affected by the
elimination of legal aid for education cases. Parents are often
ill-equipped to understand the law and apply facts effectively to
challenge exclusion decisions. Legal aid funding is therefore crucial
in such situations to protect a child’s right to education. The
changes will go against the Government’s own ambitions for the
most disadvantaged children to participate in and benefit from the
top-quality education that we all want our children to
have.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000067">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">I want to talk
a little about the issue that I touched on in my opening remarks, which
is children’s actual level of legal capability. It is well
understood, and researchers have demonstrated, that young people have
the lowest levels of legal capability. Children are not always able
fully to understand the consequences of their decisions. New evidence
shows that the brain’s centre of reasoning and problem solving
is among the last to mature in terms of our physiological development.
That indicates the case for an age-specific approach to service
delivery and legal
rights.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000068">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government have recognised that children have different needs within
the legal system; for example, by retaining legal aid for children in
some types of family cases and by excluding under-18-year-olds from the
requirement to access legal advice via the proposed single telephone
gateway. I would like to see the recognition that children are in a
special place extended to ensure that they are never left to fend for
themselves in a legal system that is designed for
adults.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Unresolved
problems can have a significant negative impact on young
people’s prospects—for example, on their emotional and
mental health—and stress-related illnesses can result from civil
justice problems. We can all understand that, for example, debt and
housing are issues that could cause high levels of stress and distress.
If the amendment is not accepted, young people will be more likely to
experience those problems. Departments have previously recognised the
importance of providing good early advice to young people on issues
such as benefits, housing and debt. As the Community Legal Service and
Connexions joint initiatives document states, early advice is key to
helping young
people<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000070">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“to
overcome barriers to participation in learning and make a smooth
transition to adulthood and working
life.”<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000179">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
cost of retaining legal aid for all children and young people would be
modest. New Ministry of Justice data show us that only 6% of currently
funded civil representation cases involving under-18-year-old clients
are due to fall out of scope. Protecting all those children and young
people from legal aid cuts would be affordable in the short term and
would generate significant savings to the public purse in the long
term. Any savings made through denying children and young people civil
legal aid are likely to be outweighed by increased costs for the MOJ in
the criminal legal aid budget, as well as the wider costs to the public
purse.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Young people
who have recently been arrested report experiencing at least one
difficult to solve civil justice problem. That group was particularly
likely to have problems concerning housing, debt, benefits and
employment—all key factors in influencing reoffending
rates—and to have multiple problems. Legal advice can help
vulnerable children and young people resolve civil justice problems and
support them to achieve their potential. Seventy per cent. of young
people report reduced levels of stress after getting legal advice. More
than a third report improvements in their ability to engage in
employment, education and training, and 48% of disadvantaged young
people report an improvement in their
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Retaining
legal aid for children and young people would also cut bureaucracy and
reduce delays in the system. In the absence of a blanket exemption for
children and young people from the cuts to scope, it is likely that
lawyers will apply for exceptional funding for 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 401<a class="bkMark" name="Column401">&#160;</a>
                  </div>legal aid for their clients case by case under the
exceptional funding scheme. It is proposed that the scheme will provide
for legal aid to be granted where it would not be reasonable or in the
interests of justice for vulnerable clients to present their own cases.
Bureaucracy and administrative costs will increase substantially,
leading to delays that could harm children and young people’s
chances of obtaining timely justice, as well as increasing the cost to
the system
itself.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is also important to note that the availability of advice for children
and young people from alternative sources is being drastically reduced.
The Government have suggested repeatedly that clients faced with
problems that have been removed from scope will be able to seek advice
from the voluntary sector. However, as we all know from our
constituencies, local authority funding cuts mean that the availability
of advice to young people from the voluntary sector is being reduced
and is under serious pressure. Youth Access surveyed youth advice
providers earlier this year and found that a quarter will close this
year and a further half expect to operate at a reduced level. Youth
Access says that that means 45,000 young people will lose access to
advice at the same time as demand is increasing and that 85% of
agencies already say that they do not expect to be able to meet young
people’s needs in full in the next 12
months.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000074">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> That is exactly what I am saying. Indeed, I was
about to make the point that it is not only in the non-profit sector
that sources of advice for young people are suffering financial cuts;
the future of Connexions is obviously of great concern too. Connexions
is facing cuts of 40%.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is
other advice provision that is not specifically tailored to the needs
of young people, but few young people will access that kind of advice
at all if it is not dedicated to and designed for them. For example,
they are particularly unlikely to go to a citizens advice bureau or a
law centre. Outreach to young people requires much more involvement in
the type of organisations that young people themselves would go to.
Fewer than 1% of advisers and solicitors currently practising social
welfare law report that they see young people as a target group. Young
people are the least likely of any age group to obtain
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000077">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally, we
should note that UK and international law demands that we provide
special protection for children. It is not only morally right that we
should do so; there is a legal obligation on the Government to do so.
The Government are bound by UK and international law to make the
welfare of the child the primary consideration in any legal proceedings
involving children and to ensure children’s access to justice,
for example through the provision of advice and representation. Article
3 of the United Nations convention on the rights of the child
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000078">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“In

               <p>I
accept that the Bill acknowledges the Government’s
responsibilities to uphold children’s rights under international
law, for example in paragraph 15 of schedule 1. However, in
practice the Bill still leaves thousands of children’s cases
outside scope and that is simply unacceptable.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000080">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Other
people—not necessarily children—also lack the mental
capacity to carry out their own cases. It is important that we ensure
that they too are properly protected and have access to advice and
legal support. Again, the Government have indicated their recognition
of the special needs of people lacking mental capacity by protecting
legal aid for them to challenge mental health detention orders.
However, if the Government recognise their lack of capacity to
challenge the very order that determines their lack of capacity, the
logical follow-through from that is to accept that those people will
need advice to exert any other rights they may have, since their mental
capacity has already been an issue. It is quite clear that adults who
lack the mental capacity to exert their rights will struggle in all
categories of law.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000081">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is also
right that we recognise what we are talking about—the sort of
situations that could have given rise to lack of mental capacity. It
could be mental illness. It could certainly be adults with learning
difficulties and disabilities, adults who have been brain-damaged or
people suffering from dementia. Those are all cases that we would
regard as worthy of protection under the law.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000082">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Of course,
many people in those situations are more likely to be receiving the
type of support that can lead to justiciable issues; they are more
likely to be in receipt of benefits and they are likely to be in debt.
I heard a very traumatising story in my constituency last week of a
lady who was in the early stages of dementia and who was repeatedly
ordering completely unwanted goods from catalogues. Not only was her
house stuffed full of goods that she simply did not need or want, but
the debt that she had piled up to those catalogue companies was not
insubstantial. The illness itself can create problems that in turn
create justiciable needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000083">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Criminal
injury is another consideration. Regrettably, vulnerable people can
sometimes be subject to abuse, including in the public services that
exist to care for them. They may have difficulties with employment; for
example, learning disabled people are often poorly treated in the
workplace. Those are all concerns that we must
address.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000084">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is clear that such adults will be much less likely to be able to
resolve problems on their own. They will struggle to comprehend what is
going on, and the legal issues involved, and will sometimes struggle to
communicate, to read and interpret information, and to present
information in an orderly and systematic way so that the issue may be
considered on the appropriate merits and arguments. The Ministry of
Justice’s own research acknowledges that for such people the
experience of being in a court or at a tribunal may be exceptionally
stressful. If we do not ensure that those who lack the mental capacity
to conduct their own case are properly 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 403<a class="bkMark" name="Column403">&#160;</a>
                  </div>protected, the likelihood is that they will receive
no advice, and will not be able to take forward their own case. The
social exclusion of a group of people who are already at significant
risk of social exclusion will be greatly
increased.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000085">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are legal limitations on participation in litigation when adults or
children lack capacity under the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Under that
Act, they cannot conduct their own litigation. Without support, they
simply cannot access courts. In his written evidence to us, the
Official Solicitor said that that would be completely at odds with the
Government’s laudable ambition of targeting their reforms to
ensure access to justice for the most vulnerable people. They will be
expressly shut out from access to justice. They will not be entitled to
legal aid, but will be prohibited from taking cases to litigation on
their
own.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000086">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">For
all those reasons, I hope that the Government will seriously consider
amendment 226, and think carefully about extending provision to those
who, by definition, are too vulnerable to prosecute their own case
effectively. That is a moral, as well as a legal obligation on us, and
I look forward to the Minister’s

it would be a breach of their human rights not to provide funding for
representation. That will, of necessity, involve a detailed explanation
of the substance of the legal case to show why the applicant needs
representation, plus evidence of any characteristics that contribute to
the need for representation, and legal argument around the test being
applied. It is not plausible for a client who meets the test and needs
the exceptional funding criteria to demonstrate, without assistance,
that they meet the test. It is a classic Catch-22 situation, and not
the first in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000089">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
we are not to fall foul of our convention obligations, it is essential
that legal aid funding is available to assist prospective clients to
make an application under the test, and the amendment provides for such
assistance to be made available. I hope that the Minister will
accept
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000090">&#160;</a>

amendment 226. I have spent much of my time in politics working hard to
get a better deal for children, but it seems from the Bill that the
deal is becoming much worse. Tens of thousands of children and young
people will suffer adverse consequences as a result of the cuts in
legal aid. They will be affected not just as individuals and
advice-seekers in their own right, but as members of families whose
problems are left without satisfactory resolution following withdrawal
of affordable and acceptable

demonstrating why the Government must consider the
amendment.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">The report
says that Government plans to cut the scope of legal aid will mean that
the help accessed last year by 6,000 under-18s is longer available.
Those who will lose out range from the victims of particularly tragic
circumstances to ordinary young people facing everyday problems that
they need help to resolve. In most employment, education, debt, welfare
and immigration cases, legal aid will no longer be available to those
under 18. Those cuts come on top of other cuts to services for young
people. Some 45,000 will lose access to voluntary sector youth advice
services this year, and the state service for 13 to 19-year-olds,
Connexions, which has been mentioned, is being cut by nearly 40%. The
children and young people who will miss out are also likely to be the
most vulnerable in our
society.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000092">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Recent
evidence shows a clear link in young people between civil legal
problems and crime and mental and emotional ill health. Many of those
young people are looked-after children. I have known many such
children. They need the state to provide support to develop their
lives. I do not know the exact figures, but when visiting prison I have
met young people who have come out of the care
system—looked-after children who have not had the support that
they need—and their numbers are far too high. Unable to deal
positively with their issues on the civil side, they find themselves on
the criminal side, and many end up in prison. Are the Government going
to abandon the support that makes a difference to the lives of such
young
people?<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000093">&#160;</a>

because I genuinely do not know the answer. If looked-after children
are excluded from the scope of legal aid by the Bill, does that not
mean that the local authority responsible for their care will bear the

local authorities?<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000094">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I have been asked a question that I cannot
answer. I hope that the Minister can answer it. My local authority in
Stockton-on-Tees is proud of the services that we provide to children,
but I am thinking of children moving into adult life. Looked-after
children are often left at 16 to live their own lives. They want to
leave the care system and its support mechanisms, which often leads
them into the sorts of problems with debt, housing and education that
my hon. Friend outlined earlier. It is critical that the state is in a
strong position to pick up such young people when they realise that
they need support. One of my two sons left home at 27. The other left
home at 25. I am still supporting and helping them in all sorts of
ways. How can we expect vulnerable young people such as those exiting
the care service to look after themselves when they cannot go back? My
sons also return to the bank of Dad occasionally. If they needed
financial help for legal advice, I would help them, but where will
young people in the care system find the cash?<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000095">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Can those
young people find their own legal support or represent themselves? Does
the Minister know of any teenager—a son or daughter, a niece or
nephew or perhaps the child of a friend—who could represent
themselves in a formal court or tribunal environment, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 405<a class="bkMark" name="Column405">&#160;</a>
                  </div>or appeal against the refusal of a benefit? I see no response from him;
he is looking down. Maybe he is thinking deeply about it. So how can we
expect some of our most vulnerable young people to know what to do when
they need help and support?<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000096">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston gave some excellent
examples of why the Government should accept the amendment. I would
like to add my own specific example. A young woman in my constituency
faces deportation to Ethiopia, despite arriving here as a child of 15
many years ago. The conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea resulted in
her parents splitting up; one parent was from one nation and one from
the other. The father disappeared, but they found themselves on
opposite sides of the conflict. The issues in that conflict are very
well documented, with rape, killing and maiming on both sides being
very much in evidence. Fortunately, the young woman I refer to was able
to escape that situation and, eventually, found her way to Britain. She
attended school here, she attended college here, she trained herself to
be an interpreter and she was given permission to work, which was
tremendous news. She is able to work, she supports herself, she is a
valuable member of our society and yet now she faces deportation. Next
week, I will be leaving Committee to see a Minister and discuss her
case. What will happen to young people such as that woman under the
Bill? They will simply not get the support that they require so, again,
I hope that the Minister will deal with such
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000097">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
believe that children and young people are treated by the justice
system in particular ways, which will define our view of them as
citizens and shape their own views of our society. In addition to all
the adverse effects that they could face as a result of not getting
personal support, children will suffer the effects of their parents
being unable to resolve disputes. The Law Society and JustRights
provided some more examples, such how the 34,000 disputes about
residence and contact, involving an estimated 60,000 children, that get
at least as far as the issuing of court proceedings before the parents
manage to resolve them, will no longer be funded. Somewhere in excess
of 36,000 children are likely to be affected by problems involving
their parents’ benefits; the cases will either not be resolved
correctly or take longer to be resolved, meaning that the children will
live in greater poverty than the law says that they should,
indefinitely or for longer than they currently would. Thousands of
children are likely to end up living in substandard accommodation
because their parents are no longer entitled to advice and
representation to secure repairs unless or until their health is at
serious
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000098">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am proud of the youth advice services, legal and otherwise, in my
constituency of Stockton North and in Teesside. The Cabin provides
bespoke advice on a wide range of issues, from housing to training, and
the service is recognised nationally for its expertise. I am always
pleased to meet young people who have accessed services at that centre,
and have done so several times. They say that it makes a tremendous
difference dealing with people who are on their wavelength and
understand their issues, rather than with the general services in which
people do not understand the specific issues facing young people. Good
management has allowed the Cabin to maintain its services, but I fear
for its future as the spending cuts bite deeper. I would like to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 406<a class="bkMark" name="Column406">&#160;</a>
                  </div>know where the young people will go. Where will they get advice? Where
will they get that shoulder to cry on, in some cases, with someone who
can guide and help
them?<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000099">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">To
provide to those under 18 the right advice in all cases for which
advice can be obtained is not a huge ask of the Government. According
to JustRights, the Law Society and of course the Government themselves,
as outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston, the
cost of protecting from the cuts all those children up to the age of 18
would be £10 million. What will be the cost to Government if
that need for advice is not met? I hope that the Minister will come up
with some numbers for the real financial effect of those particular
cuts. Potentially the cost will be many millions more, but more
important than the cash cost will be the damage done to our young
people and their opportunity to live fulfilling lives. It is obvious to
me that unresolved legal problems will have knock-on impacts on the
employment prospects, physical and mental health and housing situation
of children and young people.</p>

               <p class="tabbed">By
helping young people to solve their problems earlier, the Government
could make greater savings than they will by cutting off access to
legal aid. Withdrawing that legal funding is tantamount to abuse, which
will condemn thousands of young people— people who already feel
that their lives are hardly worth living, in a society from which they
often feel excluded. I hope that the Government will show compassion
for young people and accept the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000100">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I support
amendment 226. I am not sure whether I should make a declaration of
interest at this point. We had a very good briefing from the
Children’s Society, and I used to work for it when it was the
Church of England Children’s Society, as many hon. Members know.
It works with 100,000 children throughout the country, who face a wide
variety of difficulties in many hard situations and many poor
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000102">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We hear a lot
from Ministers about the importance of working with the voluntary
sector. It is therefore incumbent on us, as well as telling the sector
that we want to do things in partnership with it, to listen to it when
it tells us the lessons of its experience. It is extremely significant
that we have had briefings from an array of voluntary sector
organisations that work with children and young
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000103">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause
9 is clearly one of the points in the Bill at which there is a link
between the earlier parts dealing with legal aid and part 3, dealing
with the sentencing and punishment of offenders. Everyone repeatedly
says what a problem it is that our prisons are full of people who have
been in the care system. It is remarkable: a third of people in prison,
I think, have been in the care system. The Under-Secretary, who is
responsible for prisons, is trying to remember whether that statistic
is right, and we can both check
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000104">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
fact is that there is a high correlation between being in the
looked-after sector and going to prison. Some of the problems that are
outlined by the voluntary sector bodies in the evidence that they
submitted to us 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 407<a class="bkMark" name="Column407">&#160;</a>
                  </div>show that that is not chance—it has not come about accidentally.
The transmission mechanism, as it were, from the looked-after sector to
prison is clear. The voluntary sector organisations have fully and
helpfully set out what is happening in their evidence. Children in the
looked-after sector have multiple problems, which are not resolved
adequately. Making cuts to legal aid that affect children is making
that situation worse.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000105">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
aspect of the double standards or confusing messages that we get from
the Government is the fact that, as well as saying that they want to
work with the voluntary sector, they make statements such as,
“As far as possible, our intention is that, where children are
involved, legal aid will still be provided.” However, the figure
of about 6,000 children under 18 who will no longer receive legal aid
is the Government’s. It has not been made up by the Opposition;
we are using the Government’s numbers and we are examining those
cases, based on the evidence that Ministers signed off in their impact
assessment. I therefore want to examine what is happening with the
transition mechanism and why children in the looked-after sector end up
in the criminal justice system later
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000106">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
I said, those children have multiple problems and difficulties, many of
which remain unresolved. The other problem is the fact that when they
leave the care system the services that were provided collapse and they
are pushed out into the big world. Those young people have more
difficulties than the average child, but less support. That does not
make
sense.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000107">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am sorry to
say this, but Ministers are taking a really short-term view. I cannot
see how that fits with what the Secretary of State has said about the
rehabilitation revolution. We need a rehabilitation revolution, and the
Opposition agree with and share that aspiration, but this is not the
way to achieve it.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000108">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me turn
to some of the more detailed issues. If people’s problems are
not resolved adequately, their situation will get worse and worse. The
areas where legal aid is being withdrawn include employment—my
hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston described a serious
employment case—welfare benefits, criminal injury, immigration
and debt.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000109">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As my hon.
Friends the Members for Stretford and Urmston and for Stockton North
said, young children who move into the criminal justice system
frequently have a range of other problems. Research shows that 80% of
16 to 24-year-olds with civil justice problems fall into at least one
vulnerable group. More than 8% of young people with civil justice
problems experience loss of employment as a result.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000110">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Young people
leave care, they attempt to establish themselves—perhaps in a
flat—and they try to get a job, but something goes wrong, and
they do not get the help they need. They are then are on a downward
spiral and end up being dealt with under another part of the
Department’s budget—the prisons budget. That does not
make sense for young people or the
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some
55% of 16 to 24-year-olds who have recently been arrested have reported
experiencing at least one difficult-to-solve civil justice problem.
When disadvantaged young people received advice, however, and things
were resolved properly, 48% reported an improvement in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 408<a class="bkMark" name="Column408">&#160;</a>
                  </div>their behaviour. More than a third reported improvements in their
ability to engage in education, employment and training.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000112">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The other big
problem, as the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member
for Reigate (Mr Blunt), knows perfectly well, is that the
prisons are full of people who cannot read or count, so their
employment prospects are severely limited. It would be far better to
take a preventive approach to such
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000113">&#160;</a>

lower? I can give some figures. The cost of a welfare benefits case

a housing case is approximately £200. Does that not show the

was a Tory Administration that signed the convention—Virginia
Bottomley signed it when she was the responsible Secretary of State. I

The vast majority of children who will lose legal aid do not have
wealthy parents. They are children in extremely vulnerable situations.

compelling speeches from five or six Opposition Members who have made
points, some of which will have been new or unanticipated. I would like
those points responded to, particularly in the case of this clause.
That is because not only during the proceedings of this Committee but
over the months in which I have heard the Minister speak and write on
these issues, I have lost count of how much reliance he has placed on
this clause. Whenever it is put to him that the
swingeing cuts that are being made to legal aid will annihilate legal

shown to be necessary in order for the United Kingdom to meet its legal

9 provides that the new Director can bring excluded cases back into
scope where he is ‘satisfied’ that a failure to make
legal services available ‘would be a breach of the
individual’s Convention rights (within the meaning of the Human
Rights Act 1998) or that it is appropriate to do so, in the
particular circumstances of the case, having regard to any risk that a
failure to do so would be such a breach’. This carefully worded
provision limits exceptional funding to cases where it is the decision
not to fund which would lead to a violation of human

               <p>The
Government have drawn the definition of exceptional cases as narrowly
as they can, which leads me to the conclusion that the clause is more
about protecting the Government and seeing that they do not fall foul
of a breach of a statutory duty than about ensuring that there are more
rights for people who would otherwise be excluded from legal aid
because of the cuts in
scope.<a class="bkMark" name="11090846000157">&#160;</a>

is the point I want the Minister to address. Given the reliance that he
has placed on this provision as the escape valve for those people who
are now refused legal aid and who may be in extremis, how does he see
it working in practice? Who does he see the measure applying to and
when does he think it will be used? We need to hear about that. I know
that practitioners out there are very keen to do so. I was at the
