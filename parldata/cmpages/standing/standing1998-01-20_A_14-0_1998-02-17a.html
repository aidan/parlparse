<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Spring being still with us, and the crocuses being out in the park, it may be convenient for hon. Gentlemen to remove their jackets.
<H4><center>Clause 52</center></H4>
<H4><center>Staffing of community, voluntary controlled and community special schools</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 249, in page 39, line 26, leave out from "time" to end of line 28 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a community, voluntary controlled or community special school does not have a delegated budget by virtue of any suspension under section 17 or Schedule 5 or by virtue of section 47(2) or (3)-".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 250 to 252.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am sure that the Committee is looking forward to the delights of debating Government amendments on staffing matters. I apologise for having to introduce so many amendments, but almost without exception they are fairly minor and technical.
<P>
The first group of amendments deals with the situation that arises when a school has its delegated budget suspended, which can happen in one of several ways. The amendments deal with the staffing arrangements that should apply when a school has its delegated budget suspended as we need to make appropriate provisions in the Bill for that. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

Clause 52, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 16</center></H4>
<H4><center>Staffing of community, voluntary controlled and community special schools</center></H4>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 268, in page 148, line 46, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>", and references to a person's absence are to his absence, or prospective absence, from the school."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendments Nos. 271 to 275.
<P>
Amendment No. 337, in page 152, leave out line 15.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 276 to 281 and 284 to 292.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The amendments will ensure that when a post is vacant, the school is able to make appointments. It may seem rather odd that we need to make so many amendments to achieve that specific aim, but they would merely give the school the power to make an appointment if a post was vacant because the member of staff holding that post was absent. I hope that the Committee will agree to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I want to speak briefly to amendment No. 337. It is partly a probing amendment, but it raises an important question about the head teacher's role in appointing teaching staff, and I want to hear the Government's response.
<P>
Paragraphs 8 to 15 of schedule 16 deal with the appointment of "other teachers" teachers other than head teachers. Paragraph 15 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The governing body may, in relation to the filling of a particular vacancy or absence ... delegate any of their functions ... (a) to one or more governors, (b) to the head teacher, or (c) to one or more governors and the head teacher acting together."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have no difficulty with the head teacher having a delegated power to make an appointment, nor with the governors and head teacher acting together, but it seems odd to delegate to one or more governors the power to appoint teaching staff without the head teacher having a role in the process. Having a powerful voice in the appointment of any new member of the teaching staff is an intrinsic part of a head teacher's role. Paragraph 26 of the schedule states that the head teacher and the chief education officer
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shall be entitled to attend, for the purpose of giving advice, all proceedings of the governing body relating to a determination"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of a different nature. However, the schedule does not provide any way of remedying the extremely undesirable anomaly in paragraph 15 that a governing body can appoint a member of a teaching staff to the school with the head teacher left outside in the cold, without any role in the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am sure that in most circumstances the head teacher will be, as is wholly appropriate, involved in staff appointments. However, the responsibility for such appointments rests with the governing body. We all need to draw a vital distinction whereas the head teacher can advise a governing body, the prime responsibility for appointments must always rest with the governing body. It would not be appropriate to place the straitjacket on a governing body that the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) wants. I am sure that the head teacher will be closely involved in the vast majority of cases, but we see no compelling argument to write into the Bill a legal requirement for the head teacher to be involved. That is why I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the Minister give the Committee an example of the sort of circumstances in which he would want a governing body to make an appointment without the head teacher having any role in the process? The head teacher is the person responsible to the governing body for teaching standards the standard of education service delivered by the school and it is difficult to think of circumstances in which it would be desirable for a member of the teaching staff to be appointed without the head teacher being engaged in the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I do not disagree with the right hon. Gentleman, but the Committee needs to draw the important distinction between the legal responsibility of a governing body to make appointments and the defacto responsibility of a head teacher to give leadership and advice. I am confident that, in the vast majority of circumstances, a reasonable and sound governing body will welcome advice from a head teacher. It would be highly unusual not to get the guidance and advice of a head teacher, but it is not appropriate to make that a requirement in the Bill. The legal responsibility should rest with the governing body; it should decide how it goes about making appointments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 299, in page 149, line 6, after "employed", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>", or otherwise engaged to provide their services,".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 293, 302, 294 to 298, 303 and 304.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> This is a more important group of Government amendments. They would clarify the different types of employment in which those in the school sector might be engaged under a contract of employment or a contract for service. A variety of conditions can now apply to schools. Our concern is that under the Bill's present drafting, someone who may be working in a school perhaps as a supply teacher or an agency teacher will not have to meet the strict requirements, particularly that of being people who are fit to work with young people. For those reasons, I hope that the Committee will agree to the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale; I hope that I will speak as briefly to the amendments as you did in listing all of them.
<P>
I am sure that all members of the Committee will have studied this group of amendments with considerable interest, and will have noticed not only that there is a large number of them, but that there are remarkable similarities between some amendments tabled by me and by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) and some amendments tabled by the Government. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to conclude that, in most respects, the Government are prepared to accept the principle behind our amendments, but have chosen to make minor changes to their wording.
<P>
For example, the Committee will be interested to note that in our amendments we use the increasingly accepted word "chair" [Interruption]. I apologise, that comment relates to later amendments. Nevertheless, the Committee will notice remarkable similarities between our amendments and the Government amendments. We are delighted that the Government have seen fit to accept the principle behind most of our amendments.
<P>
The amendments raise three key issues. The first is the fact that under schedules 16 and 17, a local education authority will be able to nominate candidates to fill teacher vacancies which arise within its area. That seems perfectly reasonable and sensible, but it is surprising that LEAs will not have a parallel ability to nominate a person to be considered for a head teacher post. That is proposed in the first group of amendments.
<P>
The second group of amendments which are not paralleled by Government amendments, so we must assume that the Government will resist them concerns who should serve on the appointments panel for head teachers. As we have already argued, we need to sort out the relationship between school governing bodies and local education authorities. Although the decision to appoint head teachers must ultimately be for the governing body, the LEA should have significant input to the decision. One way to further that partnership agreement would be to have LEA members represented on the selection panel not as a majority, because we accept that the governors must form a majority, but as a minority. That is proposed in the second string of amendments.
<P>
The third string of amendments are important, so I am again delighted that the Government appear to accept the broad principle behind them. Everyone who has considered the appointment procedure for head teachers under schedule 16 will have recognised that it will be protracted. That may have an unwelcome effect on the ability of governing bodies to appoint the best candidates. If it has to notify the LEA of its preference after interviews have taken place, as the Bill proposes, it risks losing candidates to another school and the prospect of having to re-advertise the post at additional cost as a result of having to wait the proposed 14 days for the LEA's considered opinion on the proposed appointment.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As I have said, we believe that the LEA must have an input into the process, but that that input should come into the selection process before the interviews take place. Therefore, the amendments introduce a procedure whereby the selection panel would create a short list of applicants and inform the authority in writing of those applicants. The authority would then have 14 days in which to give its opinion on their suitability for the post, by which time arrangements for the interviews can have been made and the interviews can be taking place. The procedure would thus be much quicker and there would be no possibility of the school losing the candidate that it had selected, but it would retain the LEA's involvement in what we believe, and I think the Government accept, is a sensible way.
<P>
While I accept that the Government may resist our proposal for the LEA to appoint a minority of members to the selection panel, I am delighted that they appear to have accepted the other two key issues.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> I shall deal with each of the four groups of amendments in turn. The comments of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) were correct, with one exception. He implied that the Government would accept one group of amendments, but we will not.
[Ms Estelle Morris]
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 269, 270, 282 and 283 clarify the fact that the selection panel's vote may be by a majority rather than unanimous. There is some confusion in existing legislation about whether a selection panel can make an appointment if it is not unanimous.
<P>
We do not wish to accept the Liberal Democrat amendments Nos. 192, 193 and 210, but I urge the Committee to accept Government amendments Nos. 305 to 307 and 311 to 315, relating to when a local authority should be able to offer advice on the appointment of a head teacher. It makes sense to do that before the appointment is made. That is a more cohesive approach to the appointment-making system and, as the hon. Member for Bath rightly said, it will mean that time is not wasted and people's lives are not messed about. Given the rules for handing in notice in the teaching profession, if appointments are not made on the right date it is possible to miss making an appointment for a term or more.
<P>
We welcome the hon. Gentleman's amendments, but hope that he will accept the Government drafting. His wording meant that the information would go back to the governing body rather than to the selection panel. He also wants local authorities to comment on every applicant, whereas our wording means that they comment only on applicants about whom there is concern. I do not think that we disagree about that.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Bath predicted, we do not agree on amendments Nos. 43 to 46. Time has moved on since the introduction of local management of schools. Governing bodies should be responsible for their own appointments, particularly at a senior level. We do not want to turn the clock back to the days when local authorities had more or equal rights on appointments panels. As my hon. Friend the Minister said in a previous debate, the local authority should be able to advise, but the governing body should decide. We wish to reserve the governing body's right to have the major say in making appointments.
<P>
We want to resist the last string of Liberal Democrat amendments Nos. 194, 195, and 199 to 202, which relate to LEA nomination of persons for vacant heads and deputies posts. As the hon. Member for Bath said, he has transferred to head and deputy the powers that exist in the appointment of teachers other than head and deputy. That is not appropriate in such senior posts. If somebody wants a person to apply for a post, when the post is advertised the person simply needs to say, "Have you seen that post advertised? Go on you might make a good job of it. Go ahead and apply."
<P>
There are two reasons why the provision exists for those other than heads and deputies. The first is what used to be called the pool, where the local authority employs a pool of teachers, especially new teachers, and schools then appoint from that pool. Therefore, they are first appointed to the local authority and then to a school. The second relates to redeployment. Whereas, redeployment from school to school is now established practice, we do not wish to see it applied to posts as senior as head and deputy.
<P>
To sum up, the Government are asking the Committee to resist amendments Nos. 43 to 46, 192 to 199, 200 to 202 and 210, but to accept Government amendments Nos. 269, 270, 282, 283, 305 to 307 and 311 to 315.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I look forward to the Under-Secretary offering us guidance case by case, as we go through the amendments. It is Ministers who lead, and the Whips who blame Ministers when they get it wrong. That is how the system works.
<P>
I do not have any difficulty with what the Under-Secretary has just said about the desirability of making it clear that appointing committees should vote by majority by absolute majority, I believe the position is 
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> That is not by majority of those attending, but by absolute majority of the members of the committee. Nor do I have any difficulty with the proposition that, if an LEA is to offer advice, the advice should be available to the committee before it makes a decision, instead of a committee having to revise its decision to take account of the advice. That seems more sensible. I agree with the Under-Secretary's remark about the difference between a head teacher appointment and other teacher appointments. I also agree with her reasons for having a formal right of nomination for an LEA in the case of other teachers, but not for head teachers.
<P>
In particular, I strongly agree with what the Under-Secretary said about the hon. Member for Bath's proposal that an LEA should have a right to minority representation on appointment committees. She drew a similarity between that and the question that I raised with the Minister about the relationship between governing bodies and head teachers in the appointment of teachers. I am not sure whether that is a correct analogy. I was seeking to strengthen the head teacher's role in appointing other teachers to the school for which the head teacher was responsible, but, given the balance between the LEA and the governing body, the Government are right to focus responsibility within the school. In that sense the governing body is ultimately accountable for what goes on in the school.
<P>
Although I did not seek your permission for a vote on the earlier amendment, Mr. Gale, while I agree with the Government that we want governing bodies to be responsible for appointments to the teaching staff and we do not want the formal engagement of the LEA in the process, I hope that again we can underline the need for the head teacher to have an active role in those appointment decisions. Although the Minister for School Standards invited the Committee to keep open the option that governors should take such decisions without the head teacher's active engagement, I very much hope that that occurs in only a tiny minority of cases, if at all.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> We are now in a similar position to the one in which we found ourselves a few moments ago. My hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and I have tabled a set of proposals, the principle of which the Government have clearly accepted, but have chosen for sound and sensible reasons to make minor drafting changes to them.
<P>
Amendment No. 127 would leave out the words "they propose" and insert the words "he proposes". We were delighted that the Minister could not find a way in which to change our wording and merely appended his name to the amendment. Our amendments would make minor changes and we are more than happy to support the Government's redrafting of them.
<P>
The key effect of the amendments would be to place local education authorities under a duty to inform the chair of governors, rather than the whole governing body, when there was serious concern about the performance of the head teacher, and to furnish that head teacher with a copy of its report. Under the Bill, the provision is not compatible with the capability procedures for head teachers that are being drafted by many LEAs as a result of the decisions of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service working group, which was set up to examine teacher competence. Furthermore, the procedures would not work closely with the competency procedures being developed by the diocesan authorities.
<P>
The first stage of the capability procedure is for the chair of the governing body and, usually, the chief education officer to discuss with the head their concerns about his or her performance, to identify areas for improvement, to set targets, and to set a time scale for improvements to be made. Only at the next stage does the governing body become involved typically a personnel sub-committee of the governing body, because it would leave other governors free to hear an appeal without prejudice if dismissal was proposed. The amendments would introduce such a procedure into the Bill in place of the existing one.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to amendment No. 203. Judging by the Government's proposed amendments, they are unlikely to accept it. Under the Bill, an appeal against a head teacher's dismissal will be heard by a panel consisting of members of the governing body not involved in proposing the dismissal. That is the position under existing legislation for all schools except grant-maintained schools; for the latter, an appeals panel must include an independent member. The requirement for an independent member was introduced some time after GM schools came into being. Presumably, therefore, the introduction of an independent member was based on experience and considered to be sensible.
<P>
The appeals panel will effectively be considering a decision made by fellow governors. Members of governing bodies support and respect the corporate nature of their role. They delgate functions to sub-committees and accept their decisions, and work as a team. It could therefore be argued that it would be almost impossible for an appeals panel to overturn the decision of a group of fellow governors, particularly on such a vital matter as the dismissal of a head teacher.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 203 and 204 propose the inclusion of an independent member of the appeal panel in all cases, not only in former GM schools, which are to become foundation schools.

<P>

<B>Sir David Madel </B>(South-West Bedfordshire): In respect of paragraph (b) of amendment No. 203, is the hon. Gentleman saying that the head teacher should have a veto on the appointment of an independent member, or would he be only consulted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The intention is that the head teacher should be consulted. It would certainly be inappropriate for the head teacher to have a veto. I am sure that the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Sir D. Madel) and, indeed, the whole Committee will accept the principle that there should be an additional independent person on the panel. Amendments Nos. 203 and 204 are proposed because loyalties understandably build up, and governors get used to delegating and accepting a sub-committee's decisions. That might create difficulties.
<P>
The main thrust of our argument, however, is in relation to the other amendments. Notwithstanding some minor changes in drafting, I am delighted that the Government seem to accept the principles involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I was interested in what the hon. Member for Bath said when moving the amendments. It is not clear whether the Government have accepted amendment No. 118, which would insert the word "serious" 
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris</b> indicated assent.<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's acceptance. It is an important amendment. As drafted, the schedule would allow any concern of any nature to precipitate the process described by the hon. Member for Bath. That would be wholly wrong. I am pleased that the Under-Secretary has agreed to include the word "serious" to qualify the nature of the concerns that would lead to a report being made.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 338 and 341 would achieve a related purpose, allowing the head teacher to express a view on his or her performance and on the use of the power of suspension provided in schedule 17. Paragraph 21 of schedule 16 provides that where an authority is concerned about the performance of the head teacher, it will make a written report to the chairman or the chair of the governing body, but the head teacher concerned has at no stage any right of response to the LEA or the governing body. If the case led to a suspension or a dismissal hearing, on the other hand, there would be plenty of provision for the head teacher to have his or her point of view heard. If an LEA expresses concern to the chair of a governing body about a head teacher's performance, it would surely be sensible to allow that head teacher to express his or her point of view early in the process.
<P>
Amendment No. 338 would provide that the LEA could not submit a report on a head teacher's performance without first having notified the head teacher of the LEA's concerns and allowing him or her a reasonable period to respond to them so that the report would include that response. That does little more than allow the operation of the principles of natural justice. Even if natural justice were not involved, the amendment would enable both sides of the case to be heard at an early stage of the process so that the governing body could make a rational and orderly consideration of the LEA's concerns. I hope that the Minister will reflect on the thought process behind the amendment and behind amendment No. 341, which provides for the same requirement in regard to schedule 17.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I hope that the Government can be helpful in regard to several amendments. We are happy to accept all the Liberal Democrat amendments in principle and some of them in wording. We accept amendments Nos. 118, 120, 123 and 125, together with Governments amendments Nos. 308, 309, 316 and 317. As the hon. Member for Bath said, my hon. Friend the Minister has added his name to amendments Nos. 122 and 127. That ensures that, as all members of the Committee agree, LEAs should make representations to the authority only in regard to serious concerns about a head teacher.
<P>
I did not have that much pleasure in moving the amendment referring to "chairman", but my desire for a legally acceptable Bill exceeds my desire to push the matter further at this stage. We now know that Government draftsmen and women never draft legislation referring to a chair person they always refer to a chairman. We have already passed several clauses in the Bill approving the word "chairman". If we were now to approve the term "chair person", someone might think that two separate bodies or people were involved. That would be illogical and none of us wants to jeopardise the good provisions in the Bill for want of a word. I am sure that many women will take on such posts and will play their full part in everything that happens. Therefore, I reject the amendment to include the word "chair" I should have preferred the term "chair person" in any case and we shall use the word "chairman" in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I now come to amendments Nos. 338 and 341 and the comments of the right hon. Member for Charnwood. I have some sympathy with what he said about natural justice, but the amendment implies that the head should have advance warning, which would build in a delay. We would be very nervous about keeping a chair of governors in the dark when a local authority has serious concerns about a head teacher's behaviour. If it reached that point, one would expect immediate action in the interests of the children. We have made provisions I am not sure whether in an amendment or in the original Bill that when a copy of the report goes to the local authority, a copy will also be sent to the head teacher, so he will not know about it later than the chair of governors. We do not wish to remove a head teacher's right to make comments, but we do not want to build in an unnecessary delay.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> There is indeed an amendment in the hon. Lady's name, allowing a head teacher the right to see such a report. Of course it is common ground that we do not want children to suffer as a result of a delay in dealing with a head teacher's inadequate performance. When the LEA is about to reach a conclusion about a head teacher's performance, it will not come like a bolt from the blue. The problem will have been developing over time and it would not build in a delay for a head teacher to be given formal warning of the next stage in the process and the nature of the LEA's concerns.
<P>
My argument is partly about natural justice, but it is also about the effective use of the power of the LEA to ensure that the governing body receives a full report reflecting the LEA's concerns and the head teacher's response.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> That may well happen. The right hon. Gentleman was right to say that it will not come like a bolt from the blue. If it did, we would have to worry about the relationship between the support services, the inspection advisory service and the head teacher. However, we are advised that the amendment could build in a delay, as it stands. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will share our concern about that happening. I have no problem with the chair of the governing body receiving the report at the same time as the head teacher. They should be able to talk to each other and the teacher should have the right to make written representations to the governing body. However, I am worried about the head teacher having the report in advance of the chair of the governing body. We should not be responsible for providing for a situation whereby a chair of the governing body does not know that a local authority has serious concerns about a head teacher's behaviour. In some ways the relationship between the head and the LEA is likely to be closer because they have day-to-day contact, whereas the LEA and the chair of the governing body may not have discussed the fact that they have serious concerns.
<P>
I do not wish to take away natural justice. It is right that the local authority should get the report when the chair of the governing body gets it, when it will have ample opportunity to discuss it with the chair in writing or orally, and that should inform what happens then.
[Ms Morris]
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath wants to have an independent member of the governing body appeals committee. That is a matter not for the Bill, but for school government regulations, which will be made under schedule 11. I am not convinced about the need for an independent member of the panel, but we have the option of putting it into the regulations. We shall therefore give the matter more thought and, perhaps, have further discussions.
<P>
The Government ask the Committee to accept amendments Nos. 118, 120, 122, 123, 125 and 127 and Government amendments Nos. 308, 309, 316 and 317, but to resist amendments Nos. 119, 121, 124, 126, 203, 204, 338 and 341.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> This amendment concerns the power to suspend a member of staff of the school. The same principle is involved in schedules 16 and 17.
<P>
Paragraph 22 of schedule 16 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Both the governing body and the head teacher shall have power to suspend any person employed to work at the school".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not have any difficulty with that, but it is a similar principle to the one that we discussed earlier. We cannot imagine circumstances in which a governing body would meet to suspend a member of the teaching or non-teaching staff of a school without seeking the head teacher's view on the matter. Therefore, amendment No. 339 would write into paragraph 22 the qualification that, before exercising its power under the paragraph, the governing body should first seek the head teacher's advice.
<P>
I do not believe that that undermines the principle set out by the Under-Secretary in response to an earlier amendment, namely, that the governing body is responsible of course that is true. However, the head teacher is accountable to the governing body for the day-to-day management of the school. Therefore, it would be undesirable for a governing body to suspend a member of staff without the head teacher having any voice in whether it should do so.
<P>
The theme that runs through a number of my amendments is the entrenchment of the head teacher's position. Nobody queries the important principle of ultimate accountability set out by the Under-Secretary that the governing body is accountable for the service of the school but the person who is responsible day to day for delivering it and for managing the school's resources is the head teacher. It would be an important safeguard of the head teacher's position that he or she cannot find a member of the school staff suspended by the governing body without his or her view on the proposition having been sought.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): We support the amendment, which we believe is essential. We hope that the right hon. Member for Charnwood will press it to a Division, as it is clearly unacceptable for a governing body to involve itself in a suspension without seeking the head teacher's advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I shall ask the Committee to resist the amendment, although I understand the principle. In many respects it repeats our short debate on amendment No. 337 relating to the head teacher's right to give advice.
<P>
The problem is that the amendment reads,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the governing body shall take account of the advice of the headteacher"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
when any person employed to work at the school has been suspended. As drafted, the amendment would cover "the head teacher". We would get into a rather unusual position if the governing body had to take the head teacher's advice about his or her own suspension. Opposition Members may think that that is a suitable way of making progress, but I think that it creates difficulties. It would be interesting to see the advice that the head teacher gave a governing body about his or her suspension.
<P>
I accept that, in the majority of circumstances, the head teacher will give advice. That is the role that we would expect the head teacher to play and which he or she will play. However, the amendments are flawed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I was conscious, as I was drafting the amendment, that that would be the result, following one of our earlier debates about the way to deal with a head teacher if there was a concern. Would the Government consider it more acceptable if, after the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Before exercising its powers to suspend any person employed to work at the school"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the amendment inserted the words "other than the head teacher", followed by the words in the amendment,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"under the terms of this paragraph"?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If so, it would be within the might of the Government's draftsmen to produce such an amendment on Report, or indeed the Minister might accept the principle on Report and respond with his own words. If the Minister resists that, I would pose the same question to him as I posed earlier: can he think of an example of a set of circumstances where he would be content to have a member of staff of the school suspended without the head teacher's advice having been sought?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We are moving back to the debate that we had on amendment No. 337. I am happy to confirm, as I said then, that we do not feel that it is appropriate to place a straitjacket on a governing body in these matters: it must decide what advice it wants to take. In the majority of cases the head teacher will give the advice to which the right hon. Gentleman refers. Schedule 17 gives the head teacher powers to give advice. Therefore, the powers are there, but it is not appropriate to insert in the Bill a requirement that the head teacher shall give advice. Such matters are best left to the governing body.
<P>
The two amendments, which would put a head teacher in the unusual situation of being able to give advice on his or her own suspension, are flawed. I ask the Committee to resist them, for the reasons I have just given and for those that I advanced in our debate on amendment No. 337.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I want to push the amendment to a vote. It is vital that the head teacher's role and his or her right to give advice on appointments be entrenched. The Minister has not detailed, now or in our earlier debate, the sort of circumstances in which he would be happy for appointments to be made without the head teacher's advice. A vote would give the Committee an opportunity to make a point about the position of a head teacher, as the person responsible for the day-to-day delivery of the school service, and I invite any member of the Committee who shares my commitment to that position to support the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Sixteenth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): I want to ask the Minister two questions. The first relates to the interaction of the Bill and the Data Protection and Privacy Bill that has been introduced in another place. The schedule requires that anyone appointed to a teaching or non-teaching post should be suitable for work with children and young people. I am sure that everyone agrees that that is an appropriate statutory requirement and that those who appoint staff should use that as a criterion in their decision.
<P>
As I understand it, the Data Protection and Privacy Bill prevents an employer from holding detailed information about the criminal records of staff. Has the Minister considered that in regard to situations such as that of a non-teaching member of staff who was previously employed within the LEA in a capacity in which he or she was not working with young people? Information should be available to the local authority to enable it to decide whether someone is suitable for such work. Will LEAs be restricted by the Data Protection and Privacy Bill in regard to the information that will be made available to those responsible for making appointments? If not, what impact would that have on their ability to make an informed decision about whether a person is suitable to work with children and young people?
<P>
Secondly, will the Minister also confirm that the schedule, as amended, provides that a governing body may not appoint non-teaching members of staff such as caretakers, cooks or cleaners even if it wishes to do so, under local management of schools, for example? Would such appointments be solely a matter for the local education authority, not the governing body?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> On the latter point, I confirm that non-teaching staff are employees who will be appointed on behalf of the local education authority. On the substantive point about the Data Protection and Privacy Bill, the hon. Lady is right that Bill provides for checks to be made. I am not sure about the detailed interaction between this Bill and the Data Protection and Privacy Bill, but I will write to the hon. Lady. If it is a cause for concern, we will want to do something about that on Report.

<B>Mrs. May:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 331, in page 156, leave out lines 24 to 26.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may consider amendment No. 332, in page 156, leave out lines 43 to 45.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Both amendments relate to the same point, which concerns when advice would be given by the chief education officer to the governing body of a foundation or voluntary-aided school. My first concern about the schedule is that where there is no agreement between a governing body and an LEA that the authority's chief education officer will have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"advisory rights in relation to the appointment, engagement, or dismissal of teachers in the school",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Secretary of State will have right to require that the chief education officer be given such advisory rights.
<P>
That touches on a debate that we have had from time to time, en passant, as it were, about the relationship of the local education authority to schools and the rights and responsibilities of schools to manage themselves. In response to an amendment proposed to the previous schedule, the Minister said that it was for the governing body to determine what advice it took. That is right; governing bodies should be in that position. I am concerned at the proposal in the schedule that if a governing body has decided that it does not want the advice of the chief education officer, the Secretary of State can require the governing body to consider such advice.
<P>
We are considering foundation and voluntary-aided schools, which have decided to be different from community schools which we discussed under schedule 16 and it concerns me that the Secretary of State will impose what advice governing bodies of such schools must take. That is why I have proposed that that right of the Secretary of State be deleted from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Lady has made clear the effect of the amendments. The Bill does not attempt to dilute the power of school governing bodies to manage their own affairs. I shall ask the Committee to resist the amendments because we have already given local education authorities certain responsibilities on staffing in voluntary, community and foundation schools. For example, a local education authority can make representations about someone unsuitable to be short-listed for a headship the matter that we have just debated or it can express serious concern about a head's performance. However, it would be difficult for LEAs to exercise those responsibilities if they were denied the opportunity of advising governing bodies on those particular matters.
<P>
Schedule 17 provides that the Secretary of State should have a role if a governing body resist the advisory functions of the LEA. The Secretary of State would have to consider each case on its merits and, in my view, would need to be clear that the right to act in an advisory role was being discharged reasonably. If it were not, I am sure that the Secretary of State would tell the LEA that it was not appropriate, in those circumstances, that it should have an advisory role.
<P>
However, it is possible that the LEA may be acting reasonably in discharging its responsibilities, but that the governing body was acting unreasonably in resisting the LEA. The Bill gives the LEA legal responsibilities for staffing matters, along the line that I have just mentioned, so the LEA must have the opportunity to make representations. If a governing body refuses to accept that advice, we need a failsafe device in this case, the Secretary of State to allow the local education authority to discharge its advisory responsibilities. Each case will go to the Secretary of State, who will determine whether the advice is appropriate in the circumstances.

<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> Would the circumstances that the Minister envisages include the Secretary of State having to decide whether it was appropriate to impose the advisory right of the chief education officer of the local education authority if a voluntary-aided school had taken advice from the diocesan advisor instead of the LEA? Could he decide that the LEA's advice was appropriate in such circumstances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> That is a good example of why I shall not be drawn. I shall simply say that every case will have to be treated on its merits. The hon. Lady has given a good example of a governing body discharging its responsibilities in a reasonable way without involving the local education authority but involving another respected education authority. It is the sort of question to which the Secretary of State would want to give detailed consideration.
<P>
Every case will need to be considered on its merits, which is why I ask the Committee to resist the amendment. The Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to require a governing body to take advice when it seems to be reasonable in the circumstances.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 340, in page 159, leave out from line 41 to line 16 on page 160.
<P>
The amendment would remove from schedule 17 the right of the chief education officer to attend, for the purpose of giving advice, any governors' meeting that dealt with the appointments of heads of other teachers. We have discussed the role of the governing body of a foundation school and what advice it should be under an obligation to accept.
<P>
The Minister as my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead reminded him said earlier that it should be for a governing body to decide what advice it should seek. I argued then that the governing body should at least be under an obligation to seek the advice of its head teacher who is responsible, day to day, for the delivery of the service of the school. The Minister resisted that argument. However, paragraph 16 of the schedule entrenches the power of the chief education officer not merely to give advice, but to attend meetings of the governing body when decisions have to be made about the appointment of heads or other teachers. That will happen regardless of any agreement that may have been reached between the LEA and the governing body under the terms of paragraph 1 of the schedule, and regardless of any arrangement that may be imposed on the governing body, failing such agreement, by the Secretary of State.
<P>
Under paragraph 16, the chief education officer has the right to attend such meetings, invited or uninvited, to offer advice to a governing body. Will the Committee consider the circumstances in which a chief education officer sought to exercise that right? He would not need to exercise it if the governing body sought his advice because he would be invited to attend such proceedings, but let us consider circumstances when the chief education officer is specifically excluded from such meetings, either because of the agreement between the LEA and the governing body or because of the arrangement imposed by the Secretary of State. What would happen if the governing body wished to make an appointment without seeking the advice of the chief education officer?
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead said, the governing body, may seek the advice of the diocesan representative or a wide range of other people, but may choose not to include the chief education officer. The CEO may say that, under the provisions of the Bill, he has the right to attend meetings, but it will be a pretty nugatory right being allowed to attend a meeting at which he is not wanted, in order to offer advice that has not been sought.
<P>
Will the Minister consider the right that is being vested in the chief education officer? It is not one that is likely to deliver a beneficial result. Indeed, it establishes the wrong relationship between a foundation school, in which the Government make a virtue of the fact that a governing body will have greater authority, and direct responsibility for employing both teaching and non-teaching staff. That is one of the principal distinctions between a foundation school and a community school. The terms of paragraph 16 call into question the principle on which the foundation school is based the relationship between the school and its staff in an extremely undesirable way.
<P>
I am certainly not arguing that there are no circumstances in which a foundation school should seek the advice of a chief education officer; but, from both the CEO's point of view and that of establishing a proper relationship between the LEA and a foundation school, I doubt the wisdom of giving the CEO the right to insert himself into meetings, like a cuckoo into the nest, and offer uninvited advice when the governing body has chosen to proceed without such advice.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I support the amendment, which relates to my previous amendments Nos. 331 and 332, which I withdrew following the Minister's comments.
<P>
A governing body of a church school could, for example, decide not to take the advice of the chief education officer, but to take the advice of the diocesan authority instead. The Secretary of State may have[Mrs. May]
determined that it was entirely appropriate for the governing body of the school to take such advice, but notwithstanding that determination, the CEO would still have the authority to attend governing body meetings and to contribute to them.
<P>
That is contrary to the good will that the Government intended to exude in their response to amendments Nos. 331 and 332, when the Minister suggested that the powers of the Secretary of State to require the CEO to give advice to a governing body were almost reserve powers to be used only when a governing body was being intransigent or refusing to take advice on appointments. Yet the Government are proposing a far wider power. The CEO will have the right, in any circumstances, to attend governing body meetings and to give advice. It is inappropriate to include that power in the Bill. I ask the Minister to consider the circumstances that I outlined of when the Secretary of State had determined that it would not be appropriate for the CEO to be required to give advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Schedule 17 is not the easiest part of the Bill to comprehend. Paragraph 16 will take effect subject to paragraph 2(3) and (4). Paragraph 2 refers to the advisory rights of the chief education officers and applies only when the governing body has agreed with the local education authority to accord to the CEO advisory rights in relation
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to the appointment and engagement or dismissal"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of the teachers involved. If no such agreement is reached, the provisions of paragraph 16 do not apply. There is a default arrangement, whereby the Secretary of State can determine that it is appropriate for such advisory rights to be accorded to the chief education officer. It is not a question of the chief education officer deciding unilaterally that he or she wants to advise a particular school on the benefits or otherwise of appointing a certain individual. An agreement has to be reached between the school and the LEA that the CEO can play that advisory role.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I puzzled a bit over paragraph 16, and thought that it would have the meaning I feared, so I am grateful to the Minister for his confirmation that that is not the intention. Is the sole purpose of paragraph 16 to allow the CEO to attend meetings, to offer advice either in accordance with the terms of agreements reached between the LEA and the school or in accordance with an arrangement imposed by the Secretary of State? Such an agreement will provide for the sort of advice that the school seeks, which may well include advice about the head teacher and staff appointments. If the agreement provides that, what is the purpose of paragraph 16?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Paragraph 16 simply puts into the schedule the circumstances in which such advice can be given, for the sake of clarity and certainty. Everyone will know precisely the advisory rights and the circumstances in which they can be exercised. The important element is that paragraph 2 lays down a clear requirement that there must be an agreement with the governing body. If the governing body chooses to resist a chief education officer's advice or advisory recommendations from a local education authority, it is perfectly entitled to do so. However, there is a default arrangement, whereby the matter can be determined by the Secretary of State. That takes us back to our earlier debate about what are reasonable circumstances and the sort of example given by the hon. Member for Maidenhead, which I am sure the Secretary of State will take into account.
<P>
Given the agreement requirements in paragraph 2 of schedule 17, there will be no imposition of unwanted advice on a governing body. It would be foolish to require a governing body to receive advice that it did not want; it would not take much notice of it in any case. That is why paragraph 2 refers specifically to an agreement being reached at the start.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I am sorry to be pedantic, but it is important to clarify the relationship between the governing body and the chief education officer. Paragraph 2 of schedule 17 provides for agreement to be reached by the LEA and the governing body that they will take advice from the CEO. That does not require the governing body to allow the CEO to attend meetings or to be part of the interviews. The right to do that is included in schedule 16.
<P>
The Minister seems to be saying that a governing body can tell a CEO that it wants his advice in advance of interviews, or perhaps even on the basis of paper CVs, but does not want him, or presumably his appointee, to attend the interviews and discussions. In those circumstances, the CEO could say, "No. The Act gives me the right to come to the meetings as well." Is that a correct interpretation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> My understanding of paragraph 16 is that it gives the CEO an entitlement where an agreement has been reached under paragraph 2. Therefore, the hon. Member for Maidenhead is correct that the function of paragraph 16 is to set out clearly the nature of the agreement and the entitlements that the CEO would have as a result of being able to exercise the advisory rights referred to in paragraph 2.
<P>
We have sought in the schedule first, to provide that there must be an agreement which is entered into freely by the governing body; and then to say clearly what that agreement will mean. We do that in paragraph 16.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Does that mean that it is not within a governing body's power to reach an agreement with the LEA that is different from the powers set out in clause 16? In other words, this is a package one can either opt in or opt out and the individual governing body cannot reach a specific agreement with the CEO or the LEA that reflects its particular wishes. Is that the effect of the schedule?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The governing body would be agreeing to the provisions contained in paragraph 16, which refers specifically to the appointment of teachers. That would ensure that the CEO could advise the governing body effectively in the circumstances of a particular appointment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The governing body cannot, for example, agree with an LEA that advice would be provided, but say, "Thank you very much; we don't think your attendance at the meeting will be necessary." That agreement would be outside the scope of the provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Yes. Paragraph 16 would allow the CEO to attend various proceedings, and the list is there. Therefore, the agreement referred to in paragraph 2 includes all the rights in paragraph 16.
<P>
I hope that I have been able to explain the provisions of schedule 17 and I ask the Committee to resist the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I accept that the Minister has made clearer the effect of the interaction of the various paragraphs, but he has not persuaded me that it is desirable. He has described a state of affairs where there can be one agreement the governing body can agree to engage the LEA on certain terms but on no other. I do not understand why the discretion of a governing body or, indeed, an LEA should be fettered in that way.
<P>
If the Minister is seeking to encourage agreement between foundation schools and an LEA, a proposition I do not disagree with, why can they not be treated as adults and allowed to reach agreement according to what one wants to receive and the other wants to provide? Why does the agreement have to be defined in the schedule? Surely the schedule will reduce the likelihood of foundation schools and LEAs reaching agreement, because it is saying to both parties, "If you cannot agree on these terms you will be deemed to disagree, because it is beyond your scope to reach any agreement other than the agreement set out in this schedule". That seems to me a rather bizarre state of affairs.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): I seek the Minister's reassurance about a detail in the code of practice that might accompany the clause in respect of the staffing of non-school activities. The clause says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The relevant staffing provisions shall, to such extent as the local education authority may determine".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In determining relevant staffing provisions for non-school activities, some of which subsection (2)(b) describes as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"solely for the purposes of non-school activities"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or, in subsection (2)(a)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"partly for the purposes of school activities",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will the Minister assure me that in making staffing provisions the LEA will bear in mind the relevant first-aid qualifications? Non-school activities include the usual sporting activities, with their track record of injuries, and the less obvious activities such as cookery and upholstery, which also have a track record of injuries. I seek an assurance that the burden of maintaining the appropriate services in the event of an accident will not fall on existing school-employed staff.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I have to admit that I had not considered the matter in detail, although the hon. Lady has touched on an important point. The aim of the clause is to ensure that the governing body can arrange staffing for the institution as a whole. The governing body has the legal responsibility for health and safety matters within the school, and I am sure that in discharging that responsibility it will need to have regard to people with first-aid expertise. I do not disagree with the hon.[Mr. Byers]
Lady's argument, but we shall need to reflect on how we can draw this important matter to the attention of the relevant bodies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 343, in page 41, leave out lines 31 to 35.
<P>
The effect of the amendment is to remove subsection (5) from the clause. It is a probing amendment to get the Government to respond to two questions. First, why is a distinction drawn between premature retirement costs, which the Government think should be met from the school's budget share, and costs associated with dismissal or resignation, which the Government think should not be met from the school's budget share? I hope that it is now clear to the Committee that I am a strong supporter of delegation of managerial and financial responsibility into the school; I am therefore more comfortable with the proposition in subsection (4) that retirement costs should be met from a school's budget share even though the sums involved can be quite large, albeit spread over several years.
<P>
I am unclear about why the LEA should be deemed to be normally responsible for dismissal or resignation costs. There are two dangers with that. First, the LEA could hold back a sum of money that includes a safety margin that could otherwise be delegated to schools and secondly, a school could regard any process of a teacher's dismissal or resignation as desirable without having to take account of the financial consequences, in the way that it has to take account of the financial consequences of a wide range of other activities or measures. So I am unclear about why the Government draw a distinction between subsection (4) and subsection (5). I am more at home with the thought process in subsection (4).
<P>
My second question about subsection (5) relates to the phraseology at the end. Although the basic principle of the subsection is that the LEA should bear dismissal and resignation costs, it goes on to specify
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"except in so far as the authority have good reason for deducting those costs".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not exactly tight wording. What did the Government have in mind when they provided that the costs should normally be met by the LEA except where the authority thinks it has good reason for deducting the costs from the school's budget share? Could the Minister clarify the distinction between subsection (4) and subsection (5) and what circumstances he thinks could constitute "good reason" in the clause's woolly drafting to reverse the principle and impose the burden of the costs on the school?

<P>

<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I hope that I can be of help to the right hon. Gentleman. We accept that local authorities will pick up the costs, but we want to protect them from unreasonable action by governing bodies. Let us suppose that a local authority had advised a school against dismissal and had given strong grounds for its decision. If the matter went to a tribunal and costs were incurred, the local authority could reasonably think, "There you are. We told you so." When the governing body acts unreasonably, the local authority would not usually pick up the cost. Otherwise, we run the risk of governing bodies being able to act unreasonably in the knowledge that they will never pick up the costs.
<P>
In many instances the local authority will have agreed an arrangement with the governing body about premature retirement, so it will bear the costs. Costs should be made from the school budget when an agreement had not been made with the local authority. Practice shows, however, that in most circumstances the agreement would have been made. The plan is to protect the local authority from the action of governing bodies when no agreement had been made with them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not understand that argument. Is the hon. Lady saying that the provision is in place to protect the local authority when the governing body acts without an agreement having been made with it?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I accept that that relates to the provision of "good reason", but I still do not understand why the costs of premature retirement should be met from a school budget. In the majority of cases, those costs are likely to be higher than costs associated with dismissal. There is no obvious reason to believe that they would be lower and therefore less disruptive. Why will the costs of premature retirement be met from a school's budget share, but not the costs of dismissal and resignation?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Such costs will not be met out of a school's budget share if it has made a prior agreement with the local authority. They will be met by the local authority if agreement has been made with the school governing body. If an agreement has not been made, the local authority cannot meet the costs because it was not party to an agreement. That happens in many cases of premature retirement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Under-Secretary seems to be saying that, in most circumstances, despite the wording of the subsection (4), the costs of premature retirement will not be met from the school's budget share.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> That is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> It is an odd way of drafting. It seems preferable to leave the responsibility under subsection (5) with the school. However, I do not wish to detain the Committee, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 333, in page 42, leave out line 40.
<P>
This is a probing amendment to tease out from the Minister the exact circumstances in which the clause would apply. It refers to a voluntary-aided school with a religious character. Subsection (7) enables such a school, without the consent of the local education authority, to dismiss a teacher who had been appointed to give religious education if it were felt that he was not giving such education "efficiently and suitably". The school cannot do that, however, when it has a delegated budget.
<P>
I understood that all maintained schools would have a delegated budget, so my first question is about the circumstances in which subsection (7) might apply. If, in most circumstances, the school would not be able to exercise that right under subsection (7) because it had a delegated budget, why has the Bill been so drafted?
<P>
My second question is about the potential interaction between this Bill and the Human Rights Bill as amended in the House of Lords. The wording of the latter Bill is a trifle vague, referring to a church school or college with a religious foundation, trustees, a memorandum or articles of association, but it provides that nothing in it should be used to prevent such a school dispensing with the services of a person whose beliefs and manner of life were not appropriate to the basic ethos of the school. That could, of course, apply to the suitability of the method of providing religious education.
<P>
Has the Minister had the opportunity to consider the interaction of those two Bills, and whether there is a potential conflict? I should also be grateful for some clarification of the circumstances in which subsection (7) would apply, given that it applies only to those schools that do not have a delegated budget.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The final point raised by the hon. lady was about the amendment made to the Human Rights Bill in the other place. The Government are considering their approach to that amendment and will make their decisions accordingly.
<P>
The hon. Lady also spoke about the delegation of budgets. She is right that, as a matter of course, budgets will be delegated. However, in the exceptional situations that we discussed earlier, a delegated budget can be suspended. Clause 56 seeks to cover budgets that have been delegated, and those rare occasions when a delegated budget is suspended. Subsection (7) and (8)(a) are needed to cover both eventualities.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I am grateful for that clarification, but it adds to my confusion. I may have misread the Bill, but the Minister seems to be saying that if authority has been given to a school under local management of schools with a delegated budget, for the reasons set out in the Bill it will not be able to dismiss inappropriately a teacher of religious education. However, if the delegated budget has been suspended because of concern about how the governing body is managing the school, the governing body will have the power to suspend without reference to the LEA. It seems to me that it should be the other way round.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I shall try to clarify the matter. Clause 56(8)(a) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"where the school has a delegated budget."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A school with a delegated budget now has the power to dismiss a teacher without reference to the local education authority. The power in clause 56(8)(a) is exactly the same as that which exists under clause 56(7). Subsection (7) will apply only if a delegated budget has been suspended.
<P>
The hon. Lady is right to say that, even if the budget has been suspended, the governing body will have the power to dismiss a teacher without the consent of the LEA. In both circumstances whether the budget remains delegated or whether it has been suspended we believe that it is appropriate that a voluntary-aided school employing a teacher of religious education should have the power to dismiss such a teacher without the consent of the LEA.
<P>
It is a belt-and-braces approach, but it is important that in all circumstances, and whether or not the budget is delegated, the governing body of a voluntary-aided school be able to dismiss a teacher of religious education.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3A)Schools must make arrangements to ensure that they fulfil the requirements of the Education Act 1944 (as amended by the Education Act 1996) in respect of provision of worship and religious education in maintained schools.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a probing amendment. Clause 57(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No teacher at the school shall be required to give religious education."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 57(4)(b) states that no action should be taken against a teacher
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"by reason of his religious opinions or of his attending or omitting to attend religious worship."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I seek reassurance that the Government still intend to recognise the requirements of the Education Act 1944, as amended by the Education Act 1966, in respect of provision of worship and religious education in maintained schools. I think in particular of circumstances such as arose when a Catholic school in my area recently closed. In seeking admission of their children to other schools, parents were especially anxious to find a school at which an act of worship took place and in which religious education was of an appropriate nature.
<P>
Under the Bill, in smaller schools, if all teachers chose not to attend the collective act to daily worship, who would conduct it? Can the Minister reassure me[Mrs. Browning]
that in such circumstances schools would have a duty to make other arrangements to fulfil requirements under previous Acts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): I entirely share the concern of the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) that religious education and collective worship an important part of the education system. We are all victims of our circumstances and influenced by them my experience of religious education and collective worship was good. At my school, collective worship word well, sixth-form assemblies worked well, and Muslim and Jewish friends of mine were able to absent themselves as and when their parents so wished.
<P>
In the light of clauses 65 to 67, which we will discuss in due course, the amendment is unnecessary. The Government's intention is clearly to safeguard the provisions of the Education Act 1944, as amplified by the Education Act 1996. That is also made clear in schedule 20. Even if no teachers are prepared to teach religious education or to lead collective worship, the head has a duty to comply with the law. The Bill is clear in that respect.
<P>
Collective worship is important, and all parties are agreed on that. We also share the belief that there should be a broad Christian character to such worship. Acts of collective worship such as repetition of the Lord's prayer, the singing of hymns and the use these days, often the only use of excerpts from the "Book of Common Prayer" provide a broader cultural context that is entirely useful. The Government have shown their sensitivity on such issues in the past, and have done so again in the wording of clauses 65 to 67.
<P>
However, it is not good practice to pass a law that says that the law should be obeyed that is already clear. I fear that that is what the amendment would do. On further reflection, in view of the provisions of later clauses and schedules, and because of the Government's overall approach, I hope that the hon. Lady will see fit to to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I join my hon. Friend the Minister in reassuring the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton that we have no intention of changing the current requirements. The clause merely rolls forward the existing situation; it does not introduce new provisions. The hon. Lady's scenario about collective worship could occur, but even if no teacher in a school was prepared to teach religious education or lead collective worship, the head teacher would still be obliged to secure compliance with the law. That could be provided by bringing a member of the religious community into the school or even, in some circumstances, having older pupils take assembly. The governing body and the head teacher would, of course, retain responsibility for the care and discipline of the children.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It may reassure the hon. Lady to know that while someone's willingness to teach religious education cannot be a condition of his or her appointment, it is open to governing bodies as set out in circular 1/94 on religious education and collective worship to take their obligation to plan staffing and staff development into account when appointing staff. Although a governing body cannot say to a prospective member of staff, "We will not employ you because you will not take collective worship", a willingness to do so can be a consideration at appointment. I hope that the hon. Lady will accept that nothing in the legislation removes the obligation on schools to provide a daily act of collective worship and to teach religious education, and that we have no intention of removing that obligation. I hope that she will therefore withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am reassured. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Clause 59</center></H4>
<H4><center>Responsibility of governing body and head teacher for discipline</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 344, in page 44, leave out lines 9 to 11 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1) The headteacher of the school shall be responsible to the governing body for ensuring that standard of behaviour within the school is conducive to effective learning and the personal safety of the staff and pupils of the school.".
<P>
The amendment would write into the clause an important principle that we have touched on in other contexts this morning the position of the head teacher as the person responsible for the day-to-day delivery of the school's service. I speak with some deference to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, who has more experience of that issue than I can claim.
<P>
The clause begins by stating:
<P>
"The governing body of a maintained school shall ensure that policies designed to promote good behaviour and discipline on the part of its pupils are pursued at the school."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the Minister's firm commitment to the principle that the governing body is responsible for discipline. I understand that that is so, but day-to-day discipline in a school is surely a perfect example of a function that can, in practice, be delivered only by the person employed to be responsible hour by hour not even day by day for what goes on in the school the head teacher. While the ultimate accountability of the governing body is important, in this context it is more important to stress the key responsibility of the head teacher. The clause seems to place the responsibility on the governing body, which is invited to draw up a written statement of principles. It is invited to take account of the head teacher, but not until subsection (6) is the role of the head teacher defined as anything other than giving advice on principles:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The standard of behaviour which is to be regarded as acceptable at the school shall be determined by the head teacher".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment summarises the standard of behaviour in a school that we surely all want. It should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"conducive to effective learning and the personal safety of the staff and pupils of the school."</ul></font>
<P>
That is not negotiable or variable between schools. We should state clearly the head teacher's responsibility. A head teacher's right to make day-to-day decisions would then form part of his or her statutory responsibility to deliver a standard of behaviour conducive to effective learning and so on. It is an attempt to shift the balance of the clause away from saying that the governing body is responsible for a series of principles, towards saying that it is the hands-on responsibility of the person who is accountable day to day for the service delivered in the school. It seems to me that the statute should more closely reflect good practice in a well-run school. I am sure that in the majority of schools there would be no doubt whether the governing body or the head was responsible for making the decisions and determining what was acceptable, what was not, and what action should be taken. If that is the position in a well-run school, the statute should reflect it more closely than the clause allows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I have a great deal of sympathy with the point made by the right hon. Member for Charnwood, although I will not support his amendment because I think that it is unnecessary.
<P>
The relationship between a governing body and a head teacher is crucial. We tried earlier to clarify that relationship and to lay down a code of practice for a governing body, so that it was clear where its duties lay and where the head teacher's duties lay. The Government felt that such clarification was not necessary but that it would come out in the wash, even though, with many grant-maintained schools, it has proved extremely useful to know exactly where the governing body and the head teacher stand.
<P>
As an ex-head teacher, I believe that the governing body is supreme in the schools. It has the Secretary of State's authority and therefore it seems right and proper that it should be in the opening part of the Bill. Indeed, the head teacher works to the governing body. As the clause makes clear, the school's disciplinary programme and polilcy must be set down explicitly, so that the head teacher can then carry them out, overseen by the governing body. Therefore, the Bill adequately protects head teachers and puts the emphasis where it rightly lies with the role of the governing body.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I do not substantially disagree with anything that either the right hon. Member for Charnwood or the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said, and yet they find themselves on different sides of the vote on this matter. They are right that the head teacher must be responsible for the day-to-day maintenance of discipline in schools. The clause reflects the long debate that some of us had last year on a Committee considering another Bill, when the right hon. Gentleman's predecessors sought to place more responsibility for discipline on the governing body.
<P>
The crux of the argument is that in no area is it more important that everybody takes their share of responsibility than in maintaining discipline, good behaviour and an effective learning environment. Everybody in the education service has that responsibility. The clause aims to set out clearly who has which responsibility. It is crucial that in day-to-day activities the head teacher knows that the governing body will support him or her. The clear message goes out to parents and to the community that in a certain school everybody will insist on the highest standards of behaviour and on creating a conducive learning environment. We cannot afford to create splits, on such a crucial matter, between those who deliver the education service. That is why the right hon. Gentleman's predecessors and we are now responsible for enacting their legislation required LEAs to produce behaviour support plans. They, too, can state their responsibility for ensuring that discipline is maintained. The message that we must give to parents and pupils is that we will not accept irresponsibility in a classroom that stops a child or other children learning.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman said that the head teacher is not mentioned in the clause until subsection (6). That is not correct a reference comes in earlier than that. Subsection (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The head teacher shall determine measures... promoting, among pupils, self-discipline and proper regard for authority".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough pointed out, clause 59 is split, subsections (1) to (3) dealing with the responsibilities of the governing body, and subsections (4) to (7) specifying those responsibilities that fall to the head teacher. That is done not only for the reasons outlined by the hon. Gentleman, but to ensure that the head teacher acts within the guidelines laid down by the governing body, including that the governing body will consult the head teacher in drawing up those guidelines.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman's predecessors were right to place an obligation on governing bodies for discipline. It cements their relationship with the head teachers, and, in that most important of tasks, the head teachers will know that they are acting with the full authority and support of the governing body, provided they act within the guidelines agreed with the governing body. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept those assurances and withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary. I certainly accept the importance of the governing body being seen to support the day-to-day policies pursued by the head teacher. I take note of what the hon. Lady said and am grateful for the way in which she responded. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I do not want to detain the Committee, but there is an interaction[Mr. Nick St. Aubyn]
between clause 61 and 78. Will the Under-Secretary confirm that she will make a statement when we come to clause 78 about what provision the Government should make for those children excluded for a second time, and who may therefore be denied access to other schools in the area?
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> Yes, I am happy to give that assurance. The Government are considering that and we shall come back to the matter later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> It would be wrong to allow clause 61 to stand part without drawing attention to some of the matters that arise from clauses 61 to 64 and schedule 18, although I shall speak only about clause 61; therein lie some of the most important aspects of the Bill and to rush over them would be a mistake.
<P>
The question of exclusion is of monumental importance. The Ofsted report into exclusion from secondary school was most depressing. More than 12,500 students are permanently excluded from school, and that number is rising. Sadly, none of the clauses does much to deal with that situation, particularly clause 61. The clause gives power but no responsibility.
<P>
It is easy to give head teachers the power to exclude children, either temporarily or permanently, Indeed, when I was a head teacher I often prayed that a Government would give me those powers to deal with the many children lined up outside my office at 9.25 am. Power is not the answer. Power is the reason why more children are being excluded and why more head teachers, governing bodies and LEAs are agreeing to permanent exclusions.
<P>
Chris Woodhead's report pointed out the reality one of the principle reasons for children being excluded is that so many of them are not engaging with the curriculum. Even at secondary school, too many children lack the basic skills to connect with the curriculum and to take advantage of it. They are therefore on a loser as are the staff, the head teachers and the governors. We fail to recognise the enormous social and home problems that so many youngsters have, especially in inner-city areas. It is too easy to say to a school, "You have the power to exclude, but not the responsibility to do something about it."
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am most concerned about those youngsters who have statements of special educational needs. While 2.8 per cent. of children in our schools are statemented, about 18 per cent. of all those excluded have statements of special educational needs. That is a major issue for the Government, LEAs, governors, head teachers and their staff; it cannot be ignored. There is little in the Bill that gives LEAs or schools the responsibility to do something about it. A child could be excluded for 45 days on a fixed-term exclusion. That could happen in one term and the child could be out of school for nine weeks.
<P>
The incidence of crime-related activity linked to exclusion has been proven beyond doubt. The answer to the problem does not lie in our simply saying that we can make it easier to exclude children. A period of 45 days is far too long unless children are supported when they are excluded and, more important than that, preventative measures are put into place. The Bill makes no reference to measures for children who might lend themselves to exclusion.
<P>
What arrangements do the Government have in mind to ensure that the demands of children with special educational needs are considered before head teachers can make them subject to temporary or permanent exclusion? Given that the Bill provides for children who have statements of special educational needs to be subject to annual reviews, it is absolute nonsense that we can turf them out of school for up to 45 days. They can be excluded from one school; they can be re-admitted and permanently excluded; and a school can then refuse to admit them. Such issues need to be resolved and I should like a response from the Under-Secretary on that matter.
<P>
My second question is where will the responsibility lie for the preventative work that will have to be undertaken by either the LEA or the school? Where will the budget come from to do that? My third question concerns a child who has been excluded permanently or is on a fixed-term exclusion. In my experience, we did not do a good enough job with the children we kicked out of school. The staff were often delighted that the children had been excluded and they would stop me in the corridor and say, "Well done, boss." When asked to prepare work for Johnny or Mary, their faces dropped. Encouraging staff to visit the home to deliver the work and to educate in the home was an enormous financial responsibility for the school and it was also an enormous responsibility in its own right. I should be grateful to receive a response from the Under-Secretary on such matters.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right and, as one who also has experience of teaching, much of what he said rang a bell with me. He described the daily experience of many teachers, especially in secondary schools, but the problem is occurring increasingly in junior schools. It is sad that the age at which exclusions takes place is dropping, even to infant school. A child who is excluded at any stage statistically stands little chance of succeeding at school. An exclusion at an early stage makes the prospects of such children rather dim.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the need for children, especially at the secondary school stage, to be equipped for a relevant curriculum. I have not the shadow of a doubt that if a child reaches the age of 11 and moves on to a secondary school without the basic skills of literacy and numeracy, he is lost to the education service for life. If a child cannot read at age 11, a secondary school is not equipped to teach him, and he will be left further and further behind. There is no cohesiveness with the same class teacher, as one has at junior school. The problem leads to an increase in disaffection and exclusion in years 10 and 11, when the vast majority of exclusions take place.
<P>
I know that the hon. Gentleman will welcome the fact that we aim to ensure that all 11-year-olds transfer to secondary school with levels of literacy and numeracy that equip them to access the secondary school curriculum. We cannot over-estimate the alienation felt by children who lack such skills.
<P>
Secondly, and equally importantly, we must make the secondary school curriuculum relevant and effective within the requirement to offer children a broad and balanced curriculum. I do not want to return to the days when children who did not behave and who were difficult in class were turned out of all lessons and given something to do that was second class. Some were even sent on work experience for five days, and not seen again until they left the register.
<P>
The national curriculum was right because it made schools try to deliver subjects to which children should have access. The hon. Gentleman may be aware that we have already taken action to ensure that for 14 to 16-year-olds there is more flexibility in schools to free up that curriculum and offer a more relevant one. We have said in the past two weeks that the ability to disapply two of the foundation subjects will be available to teachers of key stage 4 students, so that they can have more work experience, which is related back to school. They cannot leave school they will always be on the register but schools can begin to build up a relevant curriculum by making links not only in the world of work and employers, but with further education. If, at that crucial stage the end of year 9 and the beginning of year 10 we can make kids see that there is something for them in the next two years and that they are not just lined up for failure, we shall have begun to address the problem. Those are welcome moves. It is an acknowledgement by the Government that all is not right in the secondary school curriculum for certain people.
<P>
I am glad that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough raised this issue, because there has not been an opportunity to say that we are not entirely happy with the proposed legislation at this stage for the very reason given by the hon. Gentleman. The Bill gives us the bones, structure and skeleton; it says who has responsibility for what; but we have not addressed the important question because it is impossible to do so of who make sure that as much effort as possible will go into stopping exclusion in the first place. The aim must be to stop exclusions as well as ensuring that there is a structure in place when exclusions occur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am sure that the Under-Secretary is aware that the Education and Employment Education Sub-Committee is considering the question of disaffection and I hope that the Government will examine its recommendations when they are published before easter. Will the Under-Secretary reflect on a suggestion that has been made by a number of people? If a school excludes a child permanently, it should have some continuing financial responsibility. For example, if a child is excluded in the middle of a year, the payment for the rest of the year could be passed on to fund the child's continuing education. That would make the excluding school's responsibility very clear.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> There is merit in that and it is something that we shall have to address if we are to get the problem right. The Committee will be aware that the Prime Minister has set up the social exclusion unit. One of the tasks on which it must report in the not-so-distant future is how we can reduce the number of school exclusions. The Bill provides a skeleton structure for us to follow when exclusions take place. That is right. The social exclusion unit will address the real and difficult issues to which the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough referred. The ideal is for there not to be exclusions, rather than just having a system to deal with exclusions where they are required.
<P>
We look to the social exclusion unit to further the Government's policy in this area. It will have to address a multiplicity of factors. The hon. Gentleman recognised the role that parents and home circumstances have to play, but the social exclusion unit will consider other factors as well. Having put the structure in place we may reconsider the matter before Report and may then propose amendments in the not too distant future we will produce a raft of proposals and measures that will cross departmental boundaries.
<P>
We in the Department of Education and Employment cannot solve the problem by ourselves; nor can schools by themselves it must be attacked from all levels and across all Departments. That is the next stage in trying to tackle what is a growing and worrying problem. We do not for one moment forget how important and serious the problem is; we are aware of figures that show that exclusions have risen and that life thereafter for excluded children is not what we would want it to be.
<P>
I have made it clear to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough that I share his reservations that some issues are not addressed by the Bill, but the Government are already working on other ways of doing so. That is an important part of the Government's social exclusion agenda, and it must be part of the Government's education agenda as well.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am struck by the way in which the Under-Secretary has responded to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. Of course, nobody would dissent from the proposition that we want those who are liable to be excluded to be supported and encouraged to take a proper part in full, mainstream education. However, the Under-Secretary said that there was a question concerning responsibility for dealing with excluded children. The first responsibility, of course, lies with the children themselves and their families. The only reason that exclusion is discussed is because children are disrupting the education of other children in a school. I hope that the Under-Secretary would agree that in discussing the implications for excluded children, it is essential that we do not lose sight of the reason why exclusion is provided for in legislation to safeguard the education of the majority.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I am most grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for having raised that point. I was answering the concern mentioned by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough about the increase in the number fo exclusions. I know that all members of the Committee share that concern. However, the head teacher must always have the right to exclude in the interest of other children in a class and the school. That goes without saying, although it is sometimes misinterpreted outside the House, so I thank the right hon. Gentleman for the opportunity to make it clear.
[Ms Estelle Morris]
<P>
We hope, in a number of ways, to achieve behaviour that does not disrupt other students and enables children to be kept in mainstream classes.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am conscious that the Under-Secretary's consultation document on special educational needs had a separate chapter on emotionally and behaviourally disturbed children. I have raised this point with the Under-Secretary before. We continue to lump EBD children in with children with other types of special educational needs. I hope that what has been covered in our discussion of exclusion this morning will be picked up in her consultation about that group of children.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Yes. There are so many different forms of behaviour within EBD from children who are probably very naughty, to use the wrong word, but who are behaving in a totally inappropriate way and could behave well if they so chose, to children who suffer from mental ill-health and need to be dealt with in adifferent way. We will return to that matter when framing our response to consultation on the Green Paper.
<P>
I have sought to respond to some important matters that the debate has raised. I hope that the Committee will accept that the Government take those matters seriously and will return to them at a later appropriate date.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 61 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. It might be for the convenience of the Committee if we sought your guidance, Mr. Gale, as to whether it is possible for us to finish
