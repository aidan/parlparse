                     </span>
                  </strong> Good morning. I have to make some housekeeping
announcements first. Hon. Members who have not already done so without
the leave of the Chair may remove their jackets if they
wish.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000010">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have important business before us, and I find it tedious to start with
rulings on minutiae, but I have to. There appears to have been a
misunderstanding about the agreement on coffee in Committees. The
Chairman of the Administration Committee has made an
agreement with Mr Speaker, and Mr Speaker has agreed to issue a notice,
which I understand has not yet been issued, that will allow hon.
Members to have coffee in Select Committees sitting in private. That
does not include sessions such as the evidence sessions that this
Committee had the other day and it most certainly does not include
Public Bill Committees sitting in public, such as this one. That is the
ruling, so if hon. Members want to have a coffee, they will have to nip
outside and have it; they can sit outside in the corridor for a minute
or
two.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000011">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
also have to point out that the Procedure Committee report on the use
of electronic devices has been neither adopted nor debated by the
House. As the rule stands, therefore, although it is perfectly
reasonable for hon. Members to receive e-mails—for example, on
BlackBerrys —laptops are completely out; tablets are in
order so long as they are not obtrusive or intrusive; and no messages
may be sent from the Committee while it is sitting. I must make that
clear. It may change if the matter is debated next Wednesday, but for
the moment hon. Members cannot twitter, so please do not. That includes
Ministers.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000012">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Now
let us move to the business, which is what we are really here to
discuss. Amendment 227, in the first group—<em>[Interruption.]
</em>Pay attention, please. <em>[Interruption.] </em>Order. Amendment 227
is a starred amendment and was tabled by the Opposition yesterday.
Under the terms of the agreement that I reached and indicated at the
Programming Sub-Committee meeting on Monday, I am fully prepared, as I
said then, to accept that amendment, which is why it is included. From
now on, it will not be the custom of anyone in the Chair to accept a
starred amendment. That provision was made by me specifically to
accommodate the timetable to which we have to work. I hope that that
will be helpful to all concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000013">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Another point
has been raised concerning the groupings. For those hon. Members who
are serving on their first Committee, or are not fully experienced in
the procedures, I point out that custom and practice in Committee is to
take themes and debate them. That is why they will find groupings of
items that are not necessarily related.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000014">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For example,
we are about to start on clause 1. Some of the grouped items do not
relate to clause 1; they relate certainly to clause 5 and possibly to
other clauses as well. They are debated together and later moved
formally and voted on. They are not moved or voted on now. I hope that
that is clear. It may be a good idea for those outside the Committee
who are taking an interest in the proceedings and providing advice to
be aware of that as well. Without further
ado—<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000015">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> On a point of order, Mr Gale. I should be grateful
if you advised me on whether it would be appropriate at this stage, for
the benefit of the Committee, to give an explanation regarding changes
to the names of some statutory bodies, particularly the clinical
commissioning groups, because we will not reach them in the Bill until
a bit later, although of course in the Bill in front of us, they retain
their old names. With your leave, I will read out a short statement to
explain the situation, if you think that that would be
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000016">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am not in the habit of accepting ministerial
statements, or indeed any statements, at the start of a Committee
sitting. You will have to convince me, but if it seems that this would
be for the convenience of the Committee rather than of Government Front
Benchers, try me and see. I will stop you if it is out of
order.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000017">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> This is not for the convenience of Government Front
Benchers because we are fully familiar with the change. Clause 6
inserts a new section 1E into the National Health Service Act 2006. It
provides that there will be new statutory bodies, to be known as
commissioning consortia, and that they will commission services for the
purposes of the health service in England in accordance with the 2006
Act. As right hon. and hon. Members will be aware, in our response to
the NHS Future Forum we announced our intention to change the name of
commissioning consortia to “clinical commissioning
groups” better to reflect the changes to their role and
membership, which our proposed amendments to the Bill are intended to
introduce.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000018">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
was a particular concern of many professional stakeholder
organisations, voiced during the listening exercise, that commissioning
consortia as proposed, led by local GPs, would be dominated by a single
professional group. Changing the name to “clinical commissioning
groups”, and through amendments that we will come to later, we
propose to strengthen the involvement of other professions in the
commissioning groups. We intend to introduce the necessary amendments
on Report to bring into effect the change of name.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Changing the
name of these bodies will involve technical and drafting amendments,
and we intend to introduce them as a single batch covering the whole
Bill, as they will simply replace references to the plural terms
“consortia” and “commissioning consortia”
with references to “clinical commissioning groups”,
“commissioning groups” or 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 105<a class="bkMark" name="Column105">&#160;</a>
                  </div>“groups”, and replace references to the singular terms
“consortium” and “commissioning consortium”
with references to “clinical commissioning group” or
“commissioning group”, as appropriate. There will be no
change in the effect of the relevant
clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000020">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
avoid confusion during our proceedings now, and to ensure that our
discussions in this Public Bill Committee are consistent with our
response to the NHS Future Forum, in which we first set out our
proposed changes to the Bill, rather than referring to commissioning
consortia or to GP consortia, as they were becoming known, we intend to
refer hereafter to clinical commissioning groups, even though the text
of the Bill still refers to the original terms, as do the amendments
that we have tabled for consideration by the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000021">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
the purpose of this Public Bill Committee is to consider the
substantive changes to the legislation relating to clinical
commissioning groups, and subject them to detailed
scrutiny, I hope that the Committee will agree that it is therefore
wholly appropriate to defer consideration of these numerous but routine
technical changes to the names until a later stage of our
proceedings—that is, on

On the Minister’s statement and the nomenclature in the Bill,
will you rule amendments out of order if they are not using the correct
description of the commissioning groups? The Minister referred to
technical amendments and amendments relating to the recommendation for
the NHS Future Forum, but there will be confusion if we do not use the
same
terminology.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000025">&#160;</a>

language used in the Bill as drafted at present. If the Government are
minded to change the terminology later, that is for later, but if hon.
Members wish to move amendments now or during the Bill’s passage
through Committee, the language used will be the language in the Bill.
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not have any difficulty with that.
If he does seek the advice of the Chair again, we will rule in his
favour.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000026">&#160;</a>

This is completely unrelated. Forgive me if the matter was addressed
earlier, but it is about the declaration of interests. The question
arose in the original Bill Committee, and the advice that I received,
based on precedent in “Erskine May”, is that if Members
on either side of the Committee have a direct financial interest in
aspects covered by the Bill—I think in particular of private
health care companies or related advocacy arrangements—they
should declare it. Would this be an appropriate time to make such a
declaration?<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000027">&#160;</a>

understood that all Members’ interests must and should be
declared in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests. It has
been custom and practice in Committee that when Members first rise to
speak in a Bill Committee, they should declare any interests then, so
that it is doubly on the record. However, I do not encourage a chapter
of declarations of interest at the start of every Bill Committee. As
long as Members make it plain when they rise to speak that they have an
interest, their declaration is then in the <em>Official Report</em>. I
hope that that is okay. I now call the next

interests of democracy. However, as a matter of procedure any Member
may table amendments at any appropriate time—I mean any Member,
including those who are not members of the Committee, although those
amendments would have to be picked up by a member of the Committee to
be debated. Any Member of the House may table amendments on
Report—any Member, up to and including members of the
Government. That is entirely proper. It is up to the individual
Member—or Ministers for the Government and shadow Front Benchers
for the Opposition—to determine the political timing of the
tabling of amendments. Once we get to that point, however, it is no
longer a matter for the Chair. I hope that that is
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000035">&#160;</a>

and that is what I was concerned
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000066">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
amendment is designed to ensure that we put back into the clause the
provision that the Secretary of State has an obligation to secure and
provide. That seems to us to be a core point. Why do the Government
want to take away the Secretary of State’s obligation to provide
and secure health services in this country? Is it that it makes
absolutely no difference, which was the heart of the Minister of
State’s argument promoting the original clause? He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000067">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
Secretary of State’s accountability to Parliament is already
integral to the Bill. Including it explicitly in this clause would do
nothing to add to the powers, responsibilities and the duties that the
Secretary of State already
has.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Health and
Social Care Public Bill Committee, </em>15 February 2011; c.
182.]<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000196">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That was
his position on 15 February, when he believed that the amendment we had
proposed to the original clause 1 was unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000068">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We now find
ourselves in the odd position whereby the Secretary of State, the
Minister and the Prime Minister seem to have accepted that the original
clause is simply not sufficient in terms of accountability and of
ensuring that the Secretary of State fulfils what we, the public and
the national health service believe should be his full role. As a
result, they propose partially to amend the clause, but the problem is
it still remains weasel words. They are essentially talking about
restoring the powers that were available in the original Act, but they
would only partially re-establish it by way of new clause
1(1); crucially, they are not dealing with the duty to provide and
secure. If the amendment is passed and we do not have a Secretary of
State with an obligation to secure and provide, who has
responsibility?<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If one looks
further into the Bill, one sees that there is an attempt to amend the
national commissioning board’s role to echo the changes to the
Secretary of State’s responsibility. That means that the
national commissioning board and the Secretary of State will not have
an obligation to provide. Crucially, if something went wrong, who would
the public sue? Would the Secretary of State have responsibility for a
failure of provision, or would it be the national commissioning board?
It would not be the NCB because it now has the same obligation as the
Secretary of State. Will each individual local commissioning consortium
have the responsibility, because they will be the ones that are
providing the services, or will actions continue to be against the
Secretary of State or the national commissioning board? The Minister
seems to be looking for some assistance on this important
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000070">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On 17
February, the Minister
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
Secretary of State cannot be held personally, directly responsible for
quality levels.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report,

272.]<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000197">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
Secretary of State cannot be responsible for the provision of services,
so presumably he no longer has legal responsibility. More
importantly—never mind the lawyers or the individuals who may
have suffered from a catastrophic failure of the national health
service and need some relief—where is the political
accountability? It is all very well for this new clause to say that the
Secretary of State will have some overarching responsibility to ensure
that a health service is provided nationally, which is the major thrust
of the change that they now want to make.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000072">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">However, if
the Secretary of State is not to be held
responsible for the provision and securing of health services, that
raises the same questions as last time and throughout the pause. What
is the Secretary of State’s responsibility? Could the Secretary
of State be held personally responsible for anything that happens in
the NHS? At a time when we are looking at £20 billion of
efficiency savings, when there will be a reconfiguration of services,
is not the real agenda that this clause continues to include the weasel
words that have been challenged throughout the Bill’s
development?<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We continue
to have the problem that the Secretary of State is ducking the big
questions. If, for example, the Secretary of State during the election
campaign had stood outside a particular hospital—I will not name
one, as there were many—with a banner saying, “Save
Hospital X”, and a decision was made to close that hospital,
could the Secretary of State be held liable for that? Could the
Secretary of State be brought before the House and be questioned about
it? If he is no longer responsible for securing and providing health
services in the way that the law has always said, what are we
doing?<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
central point is that the changes either answer the questions raised by
the public and health service about the Secretary of State’s
central role regarding responsibility for the NHS, or they do not. If
they do ensure that the Secretary of State continues to have that
central responsibility, what is the problem? Why do they need to change
the original legislation? If there is a difference, will the Minister
spell out in words of one syllable, so that we all understand, what the
changes are and what the purpose is behind
them?<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000075">&#160;</a>

understand that a clause stand part debate is that the clause stand

That creates the opportunity to have a rather broader debate than might
ordinarily take place on a specific and clearly defined amendment. That
is why what the hon. Lady has said and is saying is in order under the
terms of clause 1 and the responsibility of the Secretary of State, and

concerned and am yet to be reassured, for example, about the remarkable
power that used to be available to local authority overview and
scrutiny committees to refer a decision on a reconfiguration to the
Secretary of State, which the Bill originally sought to remove. I do
not understand whether there has been an amendment to give back the
power to overview and scrutiny committees to refer a decision about the
reconfiguration of services to the Secretary of State. I presume that
that change has not been made; otherwise, it would have been trumpeted
by the Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000080">&#160;</a>

she may have been as well, was that when the Secretary of State spoke
in the House after the publication of the Future Forum report, we got
the distinct impression that he was effectively going to revert to the
2006 provisions. When we saw that proposed new section 1(2) of the 2006

evidence sessions, I asked the Secretary of State for a little more
clarity about proposed new section 1(2) of the 2006 Act, given
that under the Bill he will not be directly providing or securing the

him. Surprisingly, given that he is responsible for the Bill, he was
unable to give a full answer. He has since written to me with an
answer, for which I am grateful. It contained 235 pages of delegated
powers and was sent to me, in classic fashion, seven minutes before the

               <p class="tabbed">The issue of
legal accountability is being raised, and I briefly want to deal with
that. Legal accountability in the NHS can mean a range of different
things. I assume that we are discussing the legal accountability for
securing a comprehensive health service. The legislation makes it
absolutely clear that the buck stops with the Secretary of State. If it
is not secured, he is legally responsible for that.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000092">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Other sorts
of legal accountability, such as the failures of services from
individual providers or commissioners, will presumably depend on the
circumstances and whether the Secretary of State has any part in
influencing their particular behaviour or whether that decision was up
to the providers. Legal accountability is not exactly a red herring,
but it is not the meat of the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000093">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Political
accountability has always been problematic. As was suggested earlier,
any Secretary of State in the world would like to row away from tough
decisions on health service configuration and put the responsibility
somewhere else. Ultimately, though, however a Secretary of State
phrases legislation, he never escapes accountability of one sort or
another because he is the guy who holds all the controls over the
health service and its
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000094">&#160;</a>

this part of the legislation, the Secretary of State is trying to get
away from being accountable

my question on Tuesday, the Secretary of State said that he did not
want to get into a theological debate. This has the air of a

the public do not understand. All the objections to a particular clause

what I think was the original nature of the debate and despite the fact

issue because of the Labour party, but rather because of Lord
Owen’s and Baroness Williams’s raising the function of
the Secretary of State specifically in an ordered and coherent fashion.
Subsequently—we can trace this—people started to raise
the issue themselves, and organisations that had not mentioned the

of a variety of e-mails that I have received. The e-mails have been
surprisingly learned. An awful lot of people out there have legal
counsel at their beck and call, and they present me with words that are
scholarly in form and nature. I respond to every single one of them; I
write back saying, “Given that the Government are putting the
Secretary of State in a position where he has to secure a comprehensive
health service and that there are amendments that say something
different, can you tell me”—as the hon. Member for

themes, as our Chair made clear at the beginning, we should be talking
about the duty not only on the Secretary of State, but on the NHS
commissioning boards. The point is that we are looking at the changes
in all their responsibilities, not only the Secretary of
State’s. People are concerned that what was the Secretary of
State’s duty is worded for the commissioning board in the same
way, and that will then go down to commissioning groups, which is the
real concern. There will no longer be a national responsibility for
comprehensive services; it will be up to individual commissioning
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000103">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I ask the
hon. Gentleman to look at a GP on a board for the Leicester
commissioning group, who has said that he wants to set out an explicit
list of services that would be excluded from the NHS; I note that he
was a former Conservative candidate for Bradford North. That is
people’s real concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000104">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> If that has the net effect that, in that area, a
comprehensive health service is not secured, it is simply the job of
the Secretary of State to ensure, by whatever means he can, that there
is one. Usefully, I have been sent a list of the Secretary of
State’s functions. I have not had the time to absorb them all
yet, but I notice, rather reassuringly, that on the first page of the
printout we were sent yesterday by the Secretary of State, there is the
power<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000105">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Everyone accepted after the first iteration of the
Bill that it was not sufficient to say that the Secretary of State had
a duty to promote a comprehensive health service. That was simply too
weak an assertion, whatever it was intended to imply, because we do not
want to run the risk of the Government turning around and saying,
“We’ve done our best.” We actually want the
Government to deliver what they say they will, which is a comprehensive
health service.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000109">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That can be
done in two ways. We could either have a clause that says to
“provide or secure” a comprehensive health service, or we
could have a clause that says “to secure” one. Those are
the stark alternatives in front of

               <p class="tabbed">There are two
very clear, logical—not legal—points, which are
absolutely beyond challenge. First, “secure” does not
exclude “provide”. Secondly, if one fulfils the second
variation of the Secretary of State’s duty—bar the one
preferred by the Secretary of State “to secure”—it
is a logical fact that one necessarily secures the first intention, of
to “provide” or “secure”. It is not
possible to do what the Secretary of State says, without also doing
what the Government are asking him to do.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000111">&#160;</a>

their operational differences and the practical effects that they would
have. The Americans would ask, “Where’s the beef?”
Why would substituting one wording for another change things, and why
is one wording preferred to another? To some extent, an element in me
asks why the Secretary of State does not go for a quiet life, agree a
wording that suggests what everybody thinks is suggested by their
favourite form of wording, and include as many appropriate nouns and
verbs as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000118">&#160;</a>

think that there are two answers. There is a good answer, which I
prefer, and there is another answer, which people might not be so
comfortable with and which we need to talk about. The Secretary of
State appears to be saying—and I can see why he is saying
it—that “secure” better reflects what he will be
doing. His preference and operational principle is that he wants to use
a number of potent levers in managing the NHS, rather than directly
provide everything within the NHS, because there is a dislike of
micro-management. I can understand that. For about six or seven years,
everybody in my constituency has been saying that they

specifically responsible for deciding how many boots the Army should
have; he is not supposed to make sure that they all fit and he does not
put them on people’s feet. However, if the Army was sent to war
without any boots, that would be his responsibility. It is not

defence issues would argue for long about whether the Ministry of
Defence should “secure” or “provide” that
troops have boots, because they would not see any hope or significance
in it. There is a legitimate debate about whether the Health

“provide” or “secure”. There is another

Prime Minister seemed to give a clear promise that they would replace
the Bill’s original wording with the current duties of the
Secretary of State under the 2006 Act, but they have not done that.

not going to happen, so they are asking why the Government are doing

was a change in the role of the

former colleague said. We have a difference of opinion about what the
Bill does. He has acknowledged, quite fairly, that the BMA is concerned
that the Secretary of State does not appear to have enough hands-on
control and responsibility, but on page 3 of its representations on the
original Bill, under the heading “Key areas of concern”,
it
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000129">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
BMA believes that the Secretary of State will have too much control

the BMA—I have a most congenial relationship with it—but
I would like to see an element of intellectual consistency in its
critique. According to an article published on 26 March headlined,
“BMA presses for health changes”, the BMA was pressing
for more independence of the NHS commissioning board. It was sceptical
about the rhetoric to do with giving clinicians greater involvement
with commissioning decisions, and feared the Bill would give sweeping
powers over consortia, and give the Health Secretary too much control
over the board. One might say that what the Secretary of State desires
is an element of control without accountability. None the less, that
was its accusation. It is on the record and it is
indisputable.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000132">&#160;</a>

A moment ago he was telling us that he was not persuaded that our
original discussion on clause 1 was anything other than synthetic, and
then he acknowledged that people were right to be concerned that the
word “promote” was insufficient, and that it should be
changed. He has therefore conceded that it was not synthetic, but a
real debate. In this instance, irrespective of what the BMA has to say,
and irrespective of any inconsistencies in its statements, we are not
being inconsistent. Our concern is that the clause moves the Secretary
of State’s duty to secure and provide a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 118<a class="bkMark" name="Column118">&#160;</a>
                  </div>comprehensive service one step further away. That is why we are debating
the point. The situation has not changed in this iteration of the
clause; it has not changed with the words. It still passes things off
to a
quango.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000133">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> There is quite a legitimate debate about how and to
what extent the health service should be micro-managed, and we can have
that debate when we come to other parts of the Bill. We are not
debating that specifically; we are debating what the words in the Bill
actually do, and the intent behind changing the wording. I am
suggesting that the rationale for the change is to reflect better the
operational principles of the NHS, and we can look at how far that
involves micro-management, but it might not be that. To sketch a
worst-case scenario, the change could reflect the view—I shall
be absolutely honest about it—favoured by some right-wing
think-tanks that the state simply should not provide health care. The
view that the state should simply concentrate on funding and arranging
it is a perfectly clear ideological view. If one wanted to, one could
look at this legislation as preparatory to such a scenario, but I have
to say that one could look at every previous health Bill produced by
the Labour party as equally preparatory to that, so we cannot pursue
that argument too far without difficulty.

not think that that is the rationale behind the Bill—at least I

health care, if only because we cannot “secure” unless we

clear opportunity, which I hope they will take in future weeks,

something they would endorse, first because we cannot genuinely
“secure” unless we can also, to some extent, provide, and
do so in collaboration and partnership

Secretary of State has already answered it in about five different
formats, basically saying that the provision as phrased at the moment
does the job and adequately reflects the difference in structure in the
NHS—not the difference in responsibility, but the difference in
the operating framework of the NHS, which is encompassed in the
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000142">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Hon.
Members can decide that they do not want an NHS commissioning board and
want to do things differently. There is an argument to be had about
that, but once there is an NHS commissioning board, that necessarily
leads us to re-examine the phrasing that we use when talking about the
Secretary of State and to choose the most apt form. That is what has
happened in this
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000143">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
do think, though, that there is a distinction—it is not one that
I have drawn myself so far, or, indeed, that I find myself capable of
drawing—between what the state can provide and what the
Secretary of State can provide. The Secretary of State may view himself
as the state, but unless he is Louis XIV, he is not. For the
benefit certainly of Liberal Democrat colleagues, the Government need
to make it clear that the state continues with a provider role, or some
sort of
function.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000144">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
in some ways is implied by the legislation, because the Secretary of
State has wide intervention powers, which is a provision function. He
has a role in public health, which is a provision function. He has 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 120<a class="bkMark" name="Column120">&#160;</a>
                  </div>command over the capital programme and will continue to have it, as far
as I know. That is a provision function. He does not therefore just
continue, in a sort of half-life, to act as a back-stop
in the case of failed provider functions.
Theoretically, it is still possible under this legislation—the
Secretary of State can correct me if I am wrong—for the
Secretary of State to create another provider arm, one that is not in
existence at the moment. We are talking about various functions. There
is a whole pile of them in the information sent to me yesterday by the
Secretary of State. Unfortunately, I have not had a chance to read
that, but I will be sending him my photocopying bill. It is a huge
300-page document. If we look through it—I am sure that hon.
Members will have studied it—we see that he has various
functions apropos of the provision of health care, as well as arranging

other. It would be great if there could be a consensual view on which
is the most elegant phrasing, but that is what we are talking about

                     </span>
                  </strong> Let me try to clarify the situation again for the
benefit of everyone concerned. We are at the moment debating amendment
1 to clause 1, with which we are taking the stand part debate, the
debate on amendment 227 and the debate on the Government amendments and
new clauses on the amendment paper. As I am on my feet, and without
wishing to give hon. Members a master-class in procedure, let me say
this. A clause stand part debate is in the gift of the man or woman in
the Chair. Ordinarily, if it takes place at all, it takes place at the
end of the debate on the amendments. It is like a Third Reading debate,
in which one asks, “Is this still a good idea in principle, and
should it remain in the
Bill?”<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000148">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
the Chairman feels that the matters arising from the clause have been
sufficiently debated in the course of dealing with everything else, he
has an absolute right to say, “I’m not having a clause
stand part debate,” and to put the clause before the Committee
for a decision, and a vote if necessary. Some Chairmen—I am one
of them—take a slightly more relaxed view and say, “You
can have a clause stand part debate at the beginning or at the end, but
you can’t have both,” so it is up to the Committee to
decide what it wants to debate and
when.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000149">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
reason why we have included the clause stand part debate in this
grouping is that it is the first opportunity that all members of the
Committee have had to have an initial skirmish around what we are going
to do over the next few days and weeks. It seemed to me—I hope
that the Committee agrees—that it was right to create an
opportunity to have a slightly broader debate than might otherwise be
permitted. I make that point because I would not want hon. Members to
think that they will get away with this every day of our remaining
sittings. When Dr Pugh has finished his
comments—<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000150">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I want to reiterate many of the points that my
hon. Friends have made. The issue is definitely one of trust, and has
probably been the biggest source of concern among the public. There
were 300,000 signatories to the 38 Degrees survey. During this
re-committed Public Bill Committee I am still receiving correspondence
asking particularly for scrutiny of the clauses relating to the
founding principles of the NHS. I understand what the hon. Member for
Southport said about semantics and words. The issue is about trust, and
if there is no difference, why change the words? The response to the
Future Forum report is absolutely clear, so why allow ambiguity and
concerns to be
raised?<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000153">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government may argue that they are changing the words because they want
some distance between delivery and politics, but that is not a
significant argument. The Secretary of State will still have
responsibility for appointing members to different boards, and will
continue to have political control, so the argument does not stand up.
The way in which it has been couched does not reassure me or the public
that the original principles of the NHS will be
restored.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000154">&#160;</a>

                  </div>Professor Field that many of the changes make no difference whatever. It
worries me that Ministers and Government Members
have spent longer looking at the thesaurus than considering the
responses from the many organisations, staff and patients that have
raised concerns about clause 1.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000180">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Southport spoke about the new provision not making a
difference, so I ask again the question that we have asked so many
times: in that case, why change it? This is an opportunity for a
Government who said that they were pausing, listening and reflecting to
give something back to those organisations. They said that it would
cost them nothing and that it would make no difference, so why not make
that gesture of good will and reassure patients and organisations that
the Government are committed to the NHS? The Government love the NHS,
as the Prime Minister often says, and he is often helpful in directing
his Secretary of State, but he appears not to have been successful in
this instance.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000181">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Rather than
hoping that the Government intend nothing sinister or damaging to the

pleased to know that hope is still alive in the coalition; will he not
take the safety position but instead vote with the

                  </strong> I do not want to be lured into a debate about
semantics, but I cannot help noting that the 2006 Act, which was passed
by the Labour Government, changed the wording of the National Health
Service Act 1946 from “effective provision of services”
to “provision of services”. We could have a huge debate
about whether the public would be satisfied with ineffective services,
but we accepted Labour’s assurance that that was not what they
were trying to do. They said that the change in wording did not amount
to anything, and asked why should a Secretary of State want to change
things? Undeniably, “effective” was removed by the 2006
Act. There could be a conspiracy theory about the Labour party wishing
to deliver incompetent services.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000183">&#160;</a>

Perhaps the Liberal Democrats, or whatever they were called back
then—perhaps they were Whigs; I am not sure—and the
Conservatives trusted the founding fathers of the NHS always to have
its best interests at heart, but if he wants to leave nothing to chance
he should support the amendment. This is a very different
Bill—one that creates many layers of quangos, commissioning
boards, groups and consortia. That is why we value the

gives the Secretary of State a duty to keep health service functions
under review. It mentions various bodies, including the board, Monitor,
the Care Quality Commission and the National Institute for Health and

schedule 1, the Secretary of State will continue to have the power to
appoint all non-executive members of the national commissioning board.

can presumably keep the board under review very effectively if he is
appointing all its members. Given how little time we have had to
consider the re-committed Bill, will the Minister give us some
information about whether the Secretary of State will also have the
power to appoint all board members of the other bodies mentioned in the
proposed new subsection? Such a power would have an effect on the role
that the Secretary of State was able to

been passed one. Thank you. This is a simple amendment. Members might
remember that in the previous Bill Committee, there was an extensive
debate on clause 3, which is about the Secretary of
State’s duty in relation 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 126<a class="bkMark" name="Column126">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to reducing inequalities. I do not intend to go through the arguments
again, but anyone reading today’s proceedings could perhaps do
so with column 296 of <em>Hansard </em>from 17 February 2011 also open.
The amendment would take out “have regard to the need
to”, and I shall explain
why.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000191">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
exercising functions in relation to the health service, the Secretary
of State will have to reduce inequalities between the people of
England. If the Bill works, if it is everything that the Prime Minister
seems to believe it is, if it does everything that the coalition
believes that it will, and if the Opposition, the national health
service and the public are wrong, there is no problem with agreeing to
the amendment. If the Bill works and the health service is improved, we
should have greater equality of both access and outcomes within the
NHS. Presumably we all want that.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000192">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If the Bill
will do its job and has been worth the blood, sweat and tears, surely
the Government parties must be sufficiently confident to accept that
what we need is not for the Secretary of State merely to “have
regard to” the need to reduce inequalities, but to know that by
passing the Bill he actually will be reducing inequalities. Why not
take out the weasel words and go straight for, “the Secretary of
State must reduce inequalities between the people of England”?
That gives the Secretary of State a clear instruction from us that
whether or not the Bill works, his job is to reduce inequalities, which
surely is the purpose of the national health
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11063047000193">&#160;</a>
