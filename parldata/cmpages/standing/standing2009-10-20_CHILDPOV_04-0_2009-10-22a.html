bound by the deadline agreed to on Tuesday? That means that this
afternoon&#146;s evidence session must end at 2.30 pm. I hope that I
do not have to interrupt Members or witnesses in the middle of their
sentences, but if that time arrives, I am afraid that I will have to do
so.</div><a name="09102239000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

social policy at the university of Bath. I imagine that I am here
because I have a considerable amount of experience in carrying out

studies at the centre for research in social policy at Loughborough
university. I have done a lot of work for the Joseph Rowntree

the child poverty targets and, latterly, looking at the cost of child

entail.</div><a name="09102239000012"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">198
1</b><a name="09102239000196"></a><b class="B">John
Barrett</b> (Edinburgh, West) (LD): I would like to ask each
of you to what extent you think that the Bill is going to be an
effective means of tackling what is a very complex issue. A number of
witnesses have gone over a range of issues that the Bill does not
tackle. I think that all members of the Committee appreciate how
complex the issue is; passing legislation is clearly not going to
deliver the end result on its own. Could you say how effective it will
be and how much support you think that the legislation might
have?</div><a name="09102239000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102239000197"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Can we stick to the same batting order for
answering questions?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div><a name="09102239000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ridge:</b></i> Okay. May I start by saying that I very much
welcome the Bill? I think that it is a very important mechanism for
keeping children&#146;s needs and concerns central in the policy
process. They very easily drift out to the margins&#151;that has
certainly happened in the past&#151;which is to their disadvantage. I
agree with you completely, John, that poverty&#151;and family
poverty&#151;is an exceedingly multifaceted issue, and tackling it
needs many different approaches. The Bill in itself is an important
part of that, in the sense that it has a strategy of focus, annual
reports and a framework to keep children&#146;s needs central in
policy as we go through time, so I think that that is very important.
There are aspects of the Bill that I would like to see strengthened,
and it cannot exist on its own, of course. There have to be very
important, very well thought-through strategies right across the board
to get some real developments in the
area.</div><a name="09102239000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> I agree with all that and I certainly agree
that while having the Child Poverty Bill is helpful, because of the
signals that that sends out, it can do very little on its own. Perhaps
the most important thing in the Bill and the way that it is followed
through is the requirement to have a specific broad strategy. Of
course, everything will be on what that strategy is&#151;how specific
and how tough it is, and how much leverage it
has.</div><a name="09102239000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are several things that really have not been planned for in a coherent
strategic way over the past decade, in terms of what is going to
contribute to reducing child poverty. One of those regards the whole
benefits and tax credit system. There is no systematic way to ensure
that the amounts being received by families with children on low
incomes even keeps up with rising incomes generally&#151;when they do
rise&#151;let alone makes progress towards narrowing the gap, which
is what would be
required.</div><a name="09102239000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
second big one is about the types of jobs that people move into and the
ways in which you can reduce in-work child poverty without an excessive
burden on in-work tax credits. The third&#151;on which, to be fair,
there have been strategies but they have not proved adequate&#151;is
on child care and how genuinely adequate that is, in terms of making
opportunities available to
families.</div><a name="09102239000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
mentioned all those because they are three things in which something
pretty big needs to happen. I would judge the effectiveness of a
strategy by how tough it is on things like that in really planning
forward to create a significant change, rather than just small changes
at the margin.</div>
<a name="09102239000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> I can&#146;t really see what the Bill would
achieve that Government action could not do. The Government missed
their target in 2004, and it looks like they will miss their target in
2010. I think they would have missed it even if they had had this Bill
12 years ago. The Government publish indicators at the
moment, in the &#147;Opportunity for all&#148; report&#151;others
are proposed in the Bill&#151;but still they missed their targets in
2004 and 2010. The reason why they will miss their targets in 2010 is
because of a lack of money. The child tax credit is not high enough.
The Government have not yet found the political will to raise taxes and
increase spending on tax credits, and I cannot see what the Bill will
change, compared with the current
arrangements.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div><a name="09102239000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
2</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000198"></a>John
Barrett:</b> Do you think that it is effectively hot air? It
sounds like something is being done, but not a lot is being done. Is
that what you are saying?</div>
<a name="09102239000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> I welcome the individual things in the Bill,
but I question whether you need all 650 MPs to sit round and talk about
it for something to come about. Why do you need an Act of Parliament to
do it? Why can&#146;t the Government just say, as they do at the
moment, &#147;We&#146;re going to have an annual report on poverty
and we&#146;re going to measure progress by these indicators&#148;?
Ultimately, what counts is the strategy of the Government, or future
Governments. This Government said that they were serious about child
poverty. They had high-profile targets and an annual report, but still
missed the target. I do not see why an Act of Parliament would change
that.</div>
<a name="09102239000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neil
O'Brien:</b></i> The good thing about your question was your
point about the problem being complex. The good thing in the Bill is
the broad-based strategy to deal with that. The bad thing in the Bill,
from my point of view, is the narrowness of the legally binding
targets. What you have is not a child poverty target; it is an income
inequality target. That strongly drives you relentlessly towards
downstream intervention to give people income, rather than upstream
intervention to tackle the causes.</div>
<a name="09102239000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
the IFS points out that you could spend &#163;4 billion and hit the
target by giving people more through the tax credit system. But would
that be the best use of &#163;4 billion for tackling long-term child
poverty? That is less clear. The strategy recognises that, but the
targets do not. It would be better to have a set of targets, or a set
of indicators, that are more broadly based on opportunities for jobless
households, low educational attainment, substandard housing, infant
mortality, teenage smoking, teenage pregnancy and children in care who
do not get adopted. The Government have recognised that there is a
tension there. Yvette Cooper said that the child poverty targets had
never just been about poverty, but had always been about narrowing
unfair inequalities. That might be a good thing, but there is a
trade-off between tackling inequalities and tackling child
poverty.</div>
<a name="09102239000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
problem with rather narrow, income-based targets is that they do not
tell you too much about the depth of poverty. Because incomes cluster
just above the line&#151;you know all this stuff&#151;it is
possible to bring about big changes in the headline rate by giving
people just enough money to get over the line. In a sense, it is an
arbitrary line. If you look at a measure based on 50 per
cent. of median income, you would have the same number of people in
poverty as in 1997. If you look at 40 per cent. of median income after
household costs, it looks like there is more poverty. I am not saying
that there is overall more poverty, I am just saying that it is, in a
sense, an ambiguous and arbitrary measure. You might be better off
tying your targets to your broader strategy and using those concrete
measures instead.</div>
<a name="09102239000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
3</b><a name="09102239000199"></a><b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): Obviously, we are in a recession,
but most of the statistics that we have got so far are
pre-recession. I wonder if I could ask&#151;initially to get the IFS
perspective, although others might want to comment&#151;how you think
that the recession will impact on the level of child poverty on these
measures.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div><a name="09102239000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> Colleagues of mine carried out research to
look at what happened to poverty as measured by the Government in
previous recessions. It shows that there is a tendency for relative
poverty to go down in a recession because Mr. and
Mrs. Median, if you like, are more likely to be affected by
the recession than people who are living around the poverty line. The
median household gets more of its income from the labour market, so
when unemployment goes up, that tends to affect them more than it
affects families around the poverty line who get an awful lot of money
from the state. We do not see any reason why this recession should be
different from previous ones. I suspect that relative poverty will fall
in 2008-09.</div>
<a name="09102239000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
4</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000200"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Looking ahead to 2020, if we are going to
&#147;eradicate&#148; or get down to 10 per cent, and if we have
tax credits and benefit levels below 60 per cent. of median income, can
you see any way in which we can achieve the goal? Presumably, there
will always be 10 per cent. of children at any one point in
time on benefits. Is it credible to think that any party will ever
achieve those
goals?</div><a name="09102239000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> That is a question about politics rather than
economics. We set out in our report earlier this year that it would be
possible to get child poverty in the UK down to 10 per cent. by 2020 if
benefits were raised high enough, but that would be at some
considerable cost and would probably lead to a set of incentives in the
benefit system that would be undesirable. I would not say it is
impossible to imagine. You are getting at saying that if you know the
poverty line, is it not straightforward to eradicate child poverty by
just setting benefit rates high enough? I agree with that; it is as
simple as that. Again, that leads me to question why we need a Child
Poverty Bill to bring that
about.</div><a name="09102239000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> The slight retreat from
&#147;eradication&#148; literally to 10 per cent. might slightly
change the answer to that question. It has recently gone up, but I
believe that the number of children in workless households went down to
about 16 per cent. The number in workless families would be a bit below
that, so it is conceivable that we could actually work to get that
number down to about 10 per cent. That is important because it
illustrates how adopting the 10 per cent. target could, in a sense,
make a fundamental difference to the ambition. When it was as close to
zero as technically possible, we could not get away from the fact that
there would always be a certain number of people who, for good reasons,
were not working. The concept of trying to get benefits above the 60
per cent. median level is no longer quite so important, which might be
a bit troubling to people who thought that that was being
promised.</div><a name="09102239000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the recession point, Mike and I collaborated on modelling work under a
year ago to look at initial and projected effects of the recession.
Whether or not it was a net decrease or stayed the same, the important
thing was that one group of people would be shifting slightly above the
poverty line as a result of the poverty line being fairly static, while
the income of people in work on low incomes was going up because tax
credits were going up. However, that was a bit of a statistical thing
and their incomes were not changing very
much.</div><a name="09102239000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
group of people were those who were losing their jobs and entering
poverty. If those two numbers were about the same, the people who were
making the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>losses were suffering a lot more than the people who were making the
gains and getting better off. As was mentioned earlier, that also shows
why the pure statistics do not tell the whole story. There really is an
issue now about people who have entered deep poverty because of having
lost their
jobs.</div><a name="09102239000034"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000201"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Our understanding is that the figure of 10 per cent.
was chosen ostensibly because 10 per cent. is about as good
as you get in the EU at the moment, but obviously 10 years ago 5 per
cent. was about as good as you got in the EU. Should the goal of a 10
or 12-year strategy be as good as we have at the moment or as good as
it credibly could be? Is 10 per cent. too unambitious or would 10 per
cent. be extraordinary given where we are
starting?</div><a name="09102239000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> It depends on what you are measuring it
against. If you measure it against what Tony Blair said in 1999, it is
a retreat. If you measure it against what is a really ambitious goal,
it is a fantastic target. In fact, I noticed that the Bill talks about
&#147;relating to&#148; eradication rather than saying that this is
eradication. If you look at the Bill carefully, nowhere does it say
eradication is 10 per cent. That might be a healthy thing, but it does
represent a retreat.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
6</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000202"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Helen
Goodman):</b> What do you think will be the impact of having
the four measures? You have all talked as though there were just the
one relative low-income target, but there is also the material
deprivation, the persistent and the absolute poverty level. Do you not
think that that makes the impetus of the policy much tighter?</div>
<a name="09102239000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ridge:</b></i> I certainly welcome four measures&#151;we
have had several measures for a while, anyway&#151;particularly
bringing in and keeping material deprivation. That is how we can
directly make a difference in children&#146;s lives. Some of the
things that children themselves identify as critical for them are not
necessarily things that will be picked up by an income measure, but
they are important in everyday well-being in childhood, which is one of
the things that we need to keep focused on&#151;the experience of
being a child in childhood rather than the future investment that we
make in that child as a future worker, for
example.</div><a name="09102239000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
persistent poverty rate is important, because it will give us a chance
to monitor and try to make a difference in the lives of children who
experience long periods of poverty and deprivation. However, I would
say from my work&#151; particularly with children and young people,
and we ought to bear in mind that there is a lot of talk about
persistent poverty, which is a severe and important problem&#151;that
time is a strange thing in childhood. An experience of poverty at a
critical time in the child&#146;s life can be significant for them in
their future well-being and how they carry on through childhood. Two
years in my life, sadly, is nothing like the equivalent of two years if
you are moving between a primary and a secondary school and unable to
make that transition healthily and securely.</div>
<a name="09102239000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> I think that that is right, as long as we are
not concluding, as has in some ways been suggested by some Government
documents, that it does not matter if people are not in long-term
poverty or not in poverty three years out of four. In fact, as Tess has
said, a few months or a year of poverty might have a very damaging 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>effect. I would agree with what you say as long as the multiple targets
are seen in the sense in which they are presented, which is that you
have to succeed in all of them in order to succeed. The risk is that
the Government say, &#147;We have succeeded in two of them, so we
have done half well.&#148; The reason that one is tempted to think
that is because of the way in which the absolute poverty target is
formulated, which talks about whether in 2020 a target is
met relative to incomes in 2010, which is a 10-year period in which we
hope we will have some growth in real incomes. That is so unambitious
and it is hard to understand what the use of it is if it is saying,
&#147;What is the difference between meeting three targets without
that one and meeting that one?&#148; It is not an additional
constraint, so why is it there, other than to be able to say,
&#147;At least we have met this one&#148;?</div>
<a name="09102239000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> I think having four targets is better than
having one, but they are all about income, and I share the reservations
that Neil expressed earlier that all the targets are about family
income. It is ironic, given what most of my research has been about. I
wish that there were a broader range of indicators and perhaps some
that related directly to children&#146;s well-being rather than their
parents&#146; income.</div>
<a name="09102239000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neil
O'Brien:</b></i> On the specific points about the material
deprivation, the data quality is poor in a lot of the survey-based
measures. For example, it would appear from the material deprivation
statistics that those who are below 40 per cent. of the median income
are better off than the children who are between 40 and 60 per cent.,
which is obviously counter-intuitive. So there are big problems, which
the Department for Work and Pensions acknowledges, with that as a
measure. In one sense, you are responding to the concern about it all
being about income, but it is not a particularly good way of doing
that. As has been mentioned, it is still tied to income, because you
have people who are 70 per cent. of the median. In a sense you are
acknowledging a problem with those targets but not really to my mind
addressing it.</div>
<a name="09102239000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
fluctuations and continuing poverty, I think that is an extremely
important point, because people are constantly moving in and out of all
those things. You are still just looking at income. The way to hit the
target is still to increase benefits, because then you get the number
of people down. I am not sure that that is, necessarily, the best use
of the money.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><a name="09102239000203"></a><b class="B">Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): I would like to
ask about severe poverty, which is generally regarded as being below 40
per cent. of median income. The figures that I have seem to suggest
that that has increased slightly over the past decade. Picking up on
our earlier point, on the basis that you should do the most for those
who need the most and are in the greatest difficulties, do you think
that there would be any merit in tracking those in the most severe
poverty, particularly severe, persistent
poverty?</div><a name="09102239000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ridge:</b></i> I have had a tendency, and I think that I
probably still have that tendency, to be a bit cautious about the
severest poverty, because so many families are moving and fluctuating
in their experiences and income. Families enter poverty for lots of
very different reasons and the experience can be very different across
families. If we start to focus more and more on families in the
severest poverty, we may miss families moving into that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div>and lose the focus. Overall, we have a significant problem for children
and they may experience it differently over time, depending on the
position of their family at any one time. If we focus more and more on
one particular group, there is also a danger that we focus on them in
an unhealthy rather than a productive way in terms of support and
encouragement.</div>
<a name="09102239000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000204"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> So you think 60 per cent. is where it should be
and you are
comfortable?</div><a name="09102239000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ridge:</b></i> I think that 60 per cent. catches a lot of
experiences of poverty, as my research has indicated to me. I am not
saying that there is not a problem about being in the severest poverty
and having long durations of poverty, but family lives can change so
much; there is a lot of fluidity in family life. People are trying to
get in and out of employment. Some of the poorest children, research
has shown, are in those families that are moving between employment and
benefits. If you focus just on the 40 per cent., increasingly, you will
miss what, certainly for children, is one of the most problematic
experiences. Research that we have done at Bath, longitudinally,
looking at children&#146;s experiences of employment&#151;lone
mother employment&#151;over time has shown that the loss of
employment, the drop out of the labour market, the attempts to get back
in and then, perhaps, another drop out of the labour market is
experienced in a very particular way by children. It is very
problematic. Not only is there other research evidence to show that
some of those children can be the poorest children but also that that
experience can be particularly problematic.</div>
<a name="09102239000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> It is obviously very worrying that people are
living at such a low level, but one very useful, I think, by-product of
such a high-profile campaign as has existed over the past decade has
been highlighting the 60 per cent. It seems to have set at least some
level of aspiration. The research that I have been involved in on
minimum income standards, which looks at what ordinary people believe
you need to have an acceptable minimum standard of living, shows that
60 per cent. is certainly not too high, and that you cannot, in
general, even at that level get to an acceptable standard of living.
The idea that has been put around by this campaign and this
statistic&#151;that people below that are at a level that our society
does not want to tolerate&#151;is helpful and correct. One would not
want to feel, &#147;Well, actually 40 per cent. is now what we
don&#146;t find acceptable.&#148; I am not saying that that is what
you are suggesting, but one would have to guard against that
risk.</div>
<a name="09102239000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
thing about looking at 40 per cent. is that I think that it is fair to
say that entitlements would normally bring families with children
significantly above that, in theory. The reasons for people being below
it will be complex and varied, and will include things such
as having to repay tax credits and having transitionary
situations. In so far as you are looking at solutions to that issue,
you have to look at things that are probably about process as much as
anything else, so it is a different set of issues and we need to bear
that in mind.</div>
<a name="09102239000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> I can see the desire to worry about the
children who seem to be the poorest in society. We should presumably
worry more about someone on 40 per cent. than someone on 60
per cent. of median income, but, as Neil intimated, I am not sure that
the data are up to having a statistical indicator, particularly one in
the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div><a name="09102239000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000205"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Why are the data more robust at 60 per cent. than
at 40 per
cent?</div><a name="09102239000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> The data are particularly unrobust at the
bottom of the income distribution. As Neil said, if we look at the
material deprivation level of people who report very low incomes, we
see that they are less deprived than those between 40 and 60 per cent.
I do not know the answer; I did some of the research, but I do not know
why that is the case. I think that there are various possible
suggestions. It is partly a statistical argument. At the moment, I do
not think that our data are good enough to accurately measure how many
families have the lowest incomes. If we could do that, I think that
having an indicator that tracks how many children are in severe poverty
would be a very good
idea.</div><a name="09102239000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neil
O'Brien:</b></i> In one way my answer to your question would
be yes, because I think that you have to look at as many different
measures as possible. I also think that the concept of deep poverty is
important. On the other hand my answer would be no, because it is
essentially the same type of target. You have the same&#151;in fact,
worse&#151;statistical problems. It is certainly the case that only
half of those who are below 60 per cent. of median income are below 60
per cent. of median spending, so that is one illustration of the
problems with the data. If you look at the family resources survey,
which all this is based on, you will see that about 600,000 people say
that they have an income of less than &#163;10 a week. There is
clearly a problem with the data there, because they would not still be
here if that were the case. So you need to look at as many different
measures as possible and have the broadest base of understanding, but a
40 per cent. of median income target suffers many of the same problems
as a 60 per cent. of median income
target.</div><a name="09102239000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
10</b><a name="09102239000206"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): May I follow
up on the point about robustness? I was struck, Mr. Brewer,
when you said that the 40 per cent. measure is particularly unrobust.
How robust are data relating to income and material deprivation at
60 per cent. of income? You have just touched on that,
Mr. O&#146;Brien. How reliable are the surveys and such
like on which the assessments are
made?</div><a name="09102239000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> There is nothing particularly magical about
40 per cent. being the figure below which you suddenly disbelieve the
data. It is just that for much of the income distribution, you can see
a very clear relationship between the amount of income and the level of
deprivation&#151;the lower the income, the higher the deprivation.
That relationship breaks down entirely once you get to incomes around
30 or 40 per cent. of the median, such that the lower the
person&#146;s income, the less deprived they are. I feel like I am
verging on giving a statistics lesson, but that is partly about sample
size and reliability. There are fewer families who report low incomes,
so it is always less reliable to count them. There are more families
with incomes lower than 60 per cent., so it is easier to count them. It
is also to do with the nature of the families who, in the survey,
report that they have no, or very low, income. They are just there, and
I just do not believe that income level, or at least I do not believe
it as an accurate representation of their long-run
resources.</div><a name="09102239000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102239000207"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> But is there still a problem at 60 per
cent.?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div><a name="09102239000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> Yes, there is still a problem at 60 per
cent., but it is a smaller problem, because it is basically about a
group of families at the bottom whose income does not reflect their
standard of living. If you look at those below 40 per cent. you will
see that those odd-looking families represent such a high proportion
that it distorts the
statistic.</div><a name="09102239000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
11</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000208"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The draft orders have been circulated among members
of the Committee, and one of the things that I found it somewhat
difficult to get my head around was the equivalisation of net household
incomes, which involves a complicated formula. How objective and
scientific are the equivalence scales? Or is that a matter on which a
degree of judgment is used in determining what they should be? There is
clearly an issue about families of different sizes and the income that
you need. How does that
work?</div><a name="09102239000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> I think it is very arbitrary, ultimately. The
system was changed two or three years ago to accord with an
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development way of weighting
the different family members, which was itself rather unscientific. The
real question is: does this really reflect extra costs in families? The
work that I mentioned earlier on income standards, where we have
actually looked at the needs of different families, gives some clues
about that. The system that we have at the moment is very simplistic,
because it gives quite a small weighting to children who are under 14,
and then it suddenly doubles when they get to 14. Our research shows
that there is an increasing cost over time as the children get older,
but it is much more continuous than is shown.</div>
<a name="09102239000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
point that is particularly interesting concerns singles and couples.
The evidence we have collected seems to show that there is a
significant underestimate of economies of scale. That is to say, it
shows rather higher poverty than would otherwise be the case for
couples than for singles. It assumes that couples need more relatively
than would be the case with the weightings that we have measured. That
could be one reason why one has to be cautious about the evidence,
which seems to show that under the present system lone parents have
done rather better in reducing their poverty. You have to qualify that
by saying that it might be that, in relative terms, the needs of lone
parents are being
underestimated.</div><a name="09102239000060"></a>

12</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000209"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Would other witnesses agree that there is an
arbitrary element
here?</div><a name="09102239000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> The Government&#146;s choice of scale was
arbitrary. They basically picked the one that seemed to be used most
internationally. The OECD picked it rather arbitrarily. You can do
objective research into what is the right equivalence scale, but there
are different methods, and they never seem to give the same answer. My
research in this area basically accords with what Donald has been
saying: we give too much weight to couples and so we overstate their
poverty compared with lone parents. I am sure it is possible to do
another scientific study and come up with the opposite
result.</div><a name="09102239000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
13</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000210"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> We always look at this from a national perspective,
but there are disparities between income and costs on a regional basis.
London, for example, has a very high level of child poverty, and costs
are higher and the median income is higher. What would happen if we
started looking at the issue on a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div>regional basis? I imagine that we would find that there is more child
poverty in London, but on a national basis, would we have more or less
child
poverty?</div><a name="09102239000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> I think you would have the same level of
poverty nationally but, as you say, you would change the distribution
of it across the regions. We looked at this a couple of years ago, and
we found what you would expect: poverty in London goes up and poverty
elsewhere goes down, particular in Scotland, which ends up with the
lowest level of child poverty of all the nations and regions of Great
Britain, once you account for the lower costs of living there. But it
should not make a difference to the national level of child poverty,
because you are just taking account of the differences between the
regions.</div><a name="09102239000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
14</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000211"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> We have talked about the target in the 2010 figure.
On current policies, what level of child poverty are we heading for in
2020?</div><a name="09102239000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> The research that Donald and I did in
February this year was more of an illustrative forecast than a
projection, but it basically said that if between now and 2020 the
Government in power follow the current rules for uprating benefits and
tax credits, child poverty will start to rise, and we will probably end
up roughly where we were in 1998. Why is that? It is because the
current rules for uprating benefits and tax credits increase them much
less quickly than average earnings. Inevitably, the relative incomes of
the poor will fall back.</div>
<a name="09102239000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
15</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000212"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> You have said that the 2010 target is not going to
be met. For how long has that been apparent?</div>
<a name="09102239000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> I guess that I should give the Government
some benefit. They do have a few weeks until they have to announce the
2010 rates of tax credits. It is clearly possible for the Chancellor to
announce increases of the order that we think necessary; we think they
would cost him about &#163;4 billion a year. It is hard to imagine
him announcing a &#163;4 billion tax rise to pay for it, but it is
not impossible. I grant the Government that. Donald and I started
forecasting child poverty in 2010 back in 2006, and we have basically
been updating our assessment of what needs to be done since then. I
would not pretend that this is an exact science, but for the last three
years the story has been that the Government need to spend more on tax
credits if they want to hit the
target.</div><a name="09102239000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> The important thing is that when one makes
these projections, one makes them on present policies. Policies are
constantly being developed. Mike and I said in 2006 that the Government
needed to do a certain amount, and they have done roughly half of that
and closed half the gap. Looking ahead, that sort of projection can be
quite useful in the short term. In the long term, to say
&#147;It&#146;s going to get worse if nothing is done&#148; shows
the magnitude of the task, but that should never be taken as a
forecast. On the other hand, it can show the importance of a more
systematic method of uprating, for example. That at least gives a
starting point that is not moving backwards, so that all the other
things that will have to go into a strategy are not starting from such
a dismal
projection.</div><a name="09102239000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
16</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000213"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Coming back to your point about the 2010 targets,
Mr. Brewer, I am sure that you must be right. The pre-Budget
report is to be produced in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div>next few weeks. Presumably, if there were a legal obligation to meet the
2010 target, the Government would have to increase child tax credits by
&#163;4 billion. Is that how you read the operation of the
Bill?</div>
<a name="09102239000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> I&#146;m not sure what the Bill means. If
there were a target that the Government were legally forced to hit
then, yes, mechanically they would have to increase tax credits by that
amount. I don&#146;t know whether the Bill actually requires the
Government to do that. I suspect the man on the street might think that
is what a legal obligation would force the Government to
do.</div><a name="09102239000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
17</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000214"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Presumably it would have been possible, some years
ago, to identify the need to increase tax credits under this type of
rubric, had it
applied.</div><a name="09102239000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike

Government, not by
Government.</div><a name="09102239000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> By 2006, we could say that long-term measures
were going to be too late to take effect, because they always take a
long time to take effect. It would be unfortunate if what the Bill did
was to cause Governments not really to take those long-term measures,
but to get to the point at which we hit the panic button and then just
pass or transfer. Let&#146;s be clear: the kind of resources you
would have to transfer even to get to a 10 per cent. target
would be massive, and it would distort all sorts of things if you did
it entirely through a redistributive tax and benefit
mechanism.</div><a name="09102239000074"></a>

18</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000215"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> If I might, I shall ask one more question that
flows immediately from that. Is your argument that in the early years
of the operation of the Bill, a Government should take long-term
measures to reduce child poverty&#151;measures that might not
necessarily have an immediate, visible impact on the annual targets and
the number of people who are taken out of poverty? You could have an
immediate impact by raising benefits, but to achieve the aims of the
Bill you need to address the longer-term causes of poverty in the early
years.</div><a name="09102239000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald

O'Brien:</b></i> That seems to be the political problem with
the Bill; it is difficult for any politician to say, &#147;We are
going to miss the legally binding target that we set for ourselves, but
we are instead spending the money on something that will be better in
the longer term.&#148; To me, that is the problem with periods in the

local government can do on its own. If your interpretation is correct
and is used to get central Government off the hook, then I think that
is true. There are a lot of things&#151;not only what the Treasury
does in terms of shifting money, but relating to resources for the
education system and all sorts of things&#151;that are influenced or
decided at national Government level, which I assume will be in some
sort of national strategy. If the fact that the monitoring is largely
put on to local authorities causes the Government to take their eye off
that ball, then that would be true.</div>

Ridge:</b></i> The local authorities&#146; role is going to
be critical, in terms of how things work for children and young people
in those areas in particular. I welcome local authority involvement,
but it is going to be about resources and forging good partnerships.
Also, some of the provision in the Bill, about communicating and
consulting with children and young people in families in those areas,
could result in very good, well-centred policies that are informed with
a much stronger grass-roots perspective than they might otherwise be.
Child care policy is an example. I also would like to point out the
important issue of low-income children in rural areas, who very easily
miss out when we are looking at overall measures. The experience of
being poor in a rural area is a very particular one. Local authorities,
with this kind of duty on them, may well be able to provide better
quality services and a better response to those children and young
people.</div><a name="09102239000081"></a>

O'Brien:</b></i> It seems to me that there is a complete
mismatch between the wider strategy and the targets in the Bill. In a
sense, you are not going to be voting in this place on the strategy and
all those things; you are voting on just a target that is very much
focused on central Government and everything they are doing. So, in
answer to your previous question, there is a complete

force councils down the line, but maintains an approach that pushes
them more towards area-based programmes rather than towards
family-by-family programmes. Given the success of family-by-family
programmes, do you think there is sufficient flexibility in the Bill to
allow it to achieve anything good on the

the same as &#147;there definitely is&#148;. I think that the
intention is to achieve that kind of response on the ground. The

result in a much better grass-roots response, and in local authorities
responding in more family-friendly ways to some of the issues

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
23</b><a name="09102239000220"></a><b class="B">Ms
Karen Buck</b> (Regent's Park and Kensington, North) (Lab):
You talked a minute ago about the estimated &#163;4 billion cost of
meeting the 2010 target. I don&#146;t know if you heard it mentioned
in this morning&#146;s evidence session, but you will have looked at
the report by the Centre for Social Justice estimating that it would be
possible, for around &#163;2.5 billion, to change fundamentally the
work disincentives. Don, you in particular have done some work on the
estimated cost of poverty&#151;around &#163;25 billion a year. Can
the four of you help us to understand the relationship between the
estimated cost of poverty and the cost of investing in meeting
short-term targets, whether they be work incentives or the
&#163;4 billion 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>in tax incentives? How quickly would it be possible to start offsetting
expenditure on poverty against the money you invest to tackle
it?</div><a name="09102239000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> The honest answer is that there isn&#146;t
a sudden gain. Some of the &#163;25 billion could come quite quickly
as a result of children who are no longer in poverty requiring fewer
services for when their lives go wrong, although it takes a while for a
society to adapt, even in those terms. Some of it will be about the
long-term impact, because if you have grown up in poverty, you might
have difficulties as a teenager that require extra spending, and some
of it will be very long term. About half of it is for future labour
market outcomes. So, the honest answer is that it helps in terms of
seeing the order of magnitude. One of the things that you can
do&#151;it is only one of the things&#151;is to be a bit more
generous on the direct transfer of income. It is just showing that the
cost of doing that is pretty low, compared with the overall costs we
are faced with all the time from having children with these outcomes.
One of the real difficulties that the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which
I have done work for, has had is that it is always easiest to model the
cost and results of poverty on doing something such as income transfer.
Once you go beyond that&#151;and we have tried&#151;it is difficult
to say how much it will cost to have an education system that is fairer
and has better outcomes for children on low incomes. The shocking
amount that this costs to society is important, but it will be hard to
persuade the Treasury that this stream of money is going to come in as
a result of this
investment.</div><a name="09102239000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
24</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000221"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> What about specifically targeting money on removing
work
disincentives?</div><a name="09102239000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> Then, of course, you get some money back
straight away. You get increased tax revenues, and that was the kind of
sum that the Centre for Social Justice arrived at when it worked out
the net cost of its package. Once you allow for the fact that improving
incentives encourages people to work, you typically still do not raise
money overall&#151;you are still spending money, but it will
obviously offset some of the costs. I agree with Donald that if you are
thinking of tackling child poverty, it is an investment in children,
and the pay-offs are going to take a generation. But if you are
thinking about tackling work disincentives, yes, there is a
pay-off.</div>
<a name="09102239000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000222"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> This is the same question as the one Steve Webb
asked this morning. Is there any risk that investing in tackling work
disincentives as a means to encourage people into employment simply
displaces costs from one group of people to another? Unless the labour
market grows, you are not necessarily going to make any savings in
terms of gross expenditure.</div>
<a name="09102239000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> I think that most economists would argue that
the labour market would expand so that people who wanted to find a job
would be able to do so. I don&#146;t think we see that as the
problem.</div><a name="09102239000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
26</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000223"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> May I clarify the question? You are actually right,
Karen. My worry about what the Centre for Social Justice seems to be
saying is that there is a kind of free lunch here. It is suggested that
some &#163;2.5 billion could be spent up-front doing nice things to
the benefits systems, and 600,000 people will take jobs. You can then
take all the tax revenues, the benefits savings, the growth in the
economy and the VAT they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>create, and that pays for it. I felt&#151;this might be
pejorative&#151;that there was a slight free lunch feel about that.
Surely, to some extent, you are just displacing other unemployed
people. You are down as an advisor to the centre&#146;s report. Has
it taken any account at all of the fact that there is a whole set of
people who could have had those jobs but did not? You said that the
whole thing will just
expand.</div><a name="09102239000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> Yes, as I say, I think the labour market will
expand to accept those people. Perhaps the Centre for Social Justice
exaggerated how quickly that will happen, but I think people will
respond to improved financial incentives&#151;they will begin to work
and help offset the costs of doing this. But the package that the
centre came up with will still cost the Government money, so it is not
a free lunch&#151;it could still cost them &#163;3 billion after
the behavioural
responses.</div><a name="09102239000095"></a>

27</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000224"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> To what extent is it helpful to consider the
characteristics of groups most liable to fall into poverty when
developing a policy response for them? Does that help you to target and
focus your resources, or does it run the risk of pathologising the poor
and missing as many people as you want to
reach?</div><a name="09102239000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neil
O'Brien:</b></i> It seems that that depends on what you mean
by a group. If you are thinking about children in care who are not
adopted as a group, that would be an extremely good place to start,
because we know that the outcomes for those kids are absolutely
terrible&#151;they are in the deepest kind of
poverty.</div>
<a name="09102239000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102239000225"></a>Ms

groups and large families, for example&#151;the major groups,
really.</div><a name="09102239000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neil
O'Brien:</b></i> I am less clear about what exactly you mean
about targeting them.</div>
<a name="09102239000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
28</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000226"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> Quite a few of the discussions in the last few hours
in the Committee have been about people at risk of being in poverty,
aspects of family breakdown and all the things that are
potentially&#151;depending on which perspective you are coming
from&#151;drivers of poverty. Policy has frequently chosen to target
resources and policy prescriptions on particular characteristics,
family structures and risks of falling into poverty. There might well
be an argument for that, but it would be interesting to know your
perspective on whether, when one is trying to reduce that number of 2.9
million children currently living in poverty, the right way to do it is
to say that we need to worry in particular about lone parents, couples
or large families, or whether it is actually simply better to stick
with the income indicator targets that are on the face of the
Bill?</div><a name="09102239000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ridge:</b></i> I think there is a problem with thinking about
groups, in the sense that people belong to multiple groups; they do not
just belong to one group. There is a really important need to
understand the challenges facing families in particular circumstances.
In certain circumstances&#151;if you are a lone parent and you belong
to a BME group with disability in the family&#151;you have a multiple
set of challenges to face in order to try and manage on your income and
with your life challenges. The danger of grouping people, particularly
a simplistic grouping of people, is that it very easily leads
to&#151;as you would say&#151;pathologising people, with those
people being conceptualised as having a certain set of characteristics,
however they might be determined. What 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>is really important&#151;and this is probably one of the strengths of
the Bill and one of the strengths, increasingly, of thinking things
through in terms of policy&#151;is the need to engage with people in
different circumstances to understand the type of challenges they face
in relation to some of their characteristics that might define them.
However, actually targeting groups can be problematic, because
people&#146;s lives are very diverse.</div>
<a name="09102239000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> I think that most of the policies that you
talk about are targeted to some extent. Another issue is whether you do
wide or narrow targeting? The risk in narrow targeting is that you
focus on people who are already in situations of multiple
deprivation&#151;when a lot of problems in the family are
compounded&#151;and you then say that those are the problems and that
if we can just solve them for those groups, we can forget about the
rest. The problem with that is that a much wider group of people are
leading lives that have very little slack in them. They are very
vulnerable to things that go wrong. If you wait until all those things
have gone wrong, you are not really adopting a preventative strategy.
The new deal for lone parents was targeted on lone parents, but they
represent 40 per cent. of families who are in poverty. We are doing
wider targeting all the time. We have to be intelligent about looking
at people whose lives have risk in them, not just at the ones where
there has been a complete
breakdown.</div><a name="09102239000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><a name="09102239000227"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): Is there is
a consensus on the balance of the long-term measures that are required,
because that would appear to be the unstated assumption in the Bill? I
particularly ask that because the Government have done a lot with what
they regarded as long-term measures to try and tackle
deprivation&#151;Sure Start, various credits, new deal programmes,
doubled school spending, skewing funding to areas of
deprivation&#151;yet children on free school meals have moved further
behind. The number of children leaving primary school unable to read
and write has not really moved, and the number not in education,
employment or training&#151;even before the credit
crunch&#151;increased, reaching a million. In the Bill, there is an
assumption that if only we got some money and got going, we could sort
that out. The Government did have money, and they did get going, but
that did not sort it
out.</div><a name="09102239000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neil
O'Brien:</b></i> In a broader sense, one of the findings of a
lot of social science research is that the relative pound for pound
efficacy of earlier intervention and so on is generally greater than
that of dealing with problems that have happened. You, quite rightly,
raise a question about whether the specific policies are the right ones
and whether they are effective, which I think is a different thing. As
elected politicians you are constantly&#151;naturally&#151;under
pressure to do things that will deliver results now, rather than
spending a lot of money to invest in something that will produce
results in 20 years&#146; time when you might no longer be an MP, or
your Government may be long gone. You therefore do not want to
introduce anything, such as the Bill, that pushes you further along the
direction of bias between the short-term and the long-term solution.
Ultimately, those kinds of earlier interventions are better pound for
pound and you need to create a framework that enables the multiple
parties that could be in government over time to keep concentrating on
them, rather than being distracted towards thinking that the short-term
solutions are right.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
30</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000228"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Do we have a consensus, because we heard evidence
this morning from a witness who said that the Sure Start programme
simply had not touched the families in greatest need&#151;the sort of
families that that witness deals with on a daily basis? Is there
consensus about what needs to be done for the long term? There is
political pressure not to do the long term; as I say, this Government,
to their credit, tried to do things for the long term. Is there a real
understanding among the academic community that there are measures that
will really make a
difference?</div><a name="09102239000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> There is a consensus that some of the areas
that you are talking about are the right things to be working on. There
might be differences over whether the particularities of the strategy
are right, whether the long term has actually arrived and so on. The
areas in which that is the case are certainly child care and early
intervention. You mentioned achievement by children on free school
meals. Recent figures have shown&#151;and some may take issue with
this&#151;that there is some improvement there. Who knows if that is
the beginning of a trend. Again, there is agreement that you need to
work on that and do whatever we can.</div>
<a name="09102239000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is one
area where, in theory, there is some agreement that something needs to
be done, but there is not much agreement over what should be done. I am
referring here to the question of how you ensure that people who are
going into work get better jobs. It is very hard to imagine that in
2020, if we have the present distribution of work among the lower-paid
group of parents in terms of the hours that they work and the earnings
they receive, we will be able to meet the child poverty targets. We
would need to have a massive amount of tax credits to get such people
out of poverty. People generally agree that we need to improve the
quality of jobs and make them more family- centred. We must ensure that
parents have the ability to progress and to do well in the labour
market. However, by comparison with those other areas, I do not think
that anybody has a clue how the Government should do that. That is
probably the biggest challenge of the
strategy.</div><a name="09102239000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ridge:</b></i> There is general consensus, as Donald just
said, across several particular areas. I should like to point to a
couple where ever such a lot more could be done. One of them is school.
You particularly mentioned the experience of free-school-meal children
at school. One of the things that we have been very slow to approach
and to try and address are children&#146;s actual experiences within
school as a social experience. There has been a lot of focus on
literacy, numeracy, truancy and school exclusions, but the research on
children that I have done and have reviewed for the child poverty unit,
and that others have done as well, shows that the biggest problem for
low-income and disadvantaged children in school is exclusion within
school. By that I mean those social experiences of being unable to take
part in the same way as other children. I believe that you have seen a
video of children talking about their experiences&#151;I could be
wrong about
that.</div><a name="09102239000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102239000229"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I
have.</div><a name="09102239000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ridge:</b></i> Thank
you.</div><a name="09102239000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, children whom I spoke to found the delivery of free school
meals in their schools so problematic that they did not want to take
them up, yet they would be an enormous advantage to them. A small boy
once said to me that his favourite thing in life was his free 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>school meal ticket, yet other children refuse to take that up because
the delivery is so heavily stigmatised. So, the delivery of services to
families and children should be done in a way that they feel is
appropriate and does not stigmatise and single them out. The social
experiences of school and the ways of incorporating children and giving
them a social inclusion within school is really important, and we have
not begun to tackle that at
all.</div><a name="09102239000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think child care has been approached, although it is an
incredibly important thing. Sadly, it is missing as a building block
here. Child care should be in here, even though there is other
legislation about child care, because it is such an important factor
for children. A lot of children I have spoken to recently in employed
families and in low-income families trying to get into employment are
very resistant to the type of child care that is on offer to them. We
have a problem in the sense that we have not started to think about
child care from the perspective of children first. What we have thought
about is the labour market first and, sadly, I think we are still doing
that. There are definitely areas where there might be consensus that it
is the right area on which to target policies, but where we may not be
getting it right or have the right focus
still.</div><a name="09102239000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
31</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000230"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> May I ask you about minimum income standards?
Again, we had evidence this morning about that. If the Bill is not
going to prescribe minimum income standards delivery because of the
costs mentioned, surely we should at least ensure the publication of
minimum income standards&#151;numbers&#151;and monitor that over
time?</div><a name="09102239000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>As someone who has produced
some, I think I should reply first. The minimum income standards that
we produce do, as I said earlier, serve to strengthen and in some way
justify the idea of these kinds of targets because they show that
looking at relative poverty is not just some kind of abstract thing; it
is about expressing what the standards and expectations of our society
are. It is more credible to do that if you can actually say why that is
the case, rather than just having an arbitrary
statistic.</div><a name="09102239000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other important thing about having the standards mentioned within this
process is that it actually tells you a bit about what sorts of things
people need to spend their money on and why. Our work includes a lot on
how families&#151;members of the general public&#151;rationalise
what is a necessity and why that is. It is a way not just of
challenging what numbers you use, but of strengthening what it is you
are trying to do and helping to show the public and perhaps even MPs
why it is that people need these sorts of things as a
minimum.</div><a name="09102239000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
32</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000231"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> So would you like to see an amendment to the Bill
to ensure that, as you say, something that puts down the price of a can
of baked beans is part of a family&#146;s budgeting and what the
budget needs to be to live any reasonable quality of life?</div>
<a name="09102239000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald

welcome.</div><a name="09102239000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.

33</b><a name="09102239000232"></a><b class="B">Judy
Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): I must say that I contest
the tone of some of the questions that have been asked&#151;for
example, in relation to there being 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>no improvement in the standards of reading and writing for primary
school children when they leave school, and in relation to child care,
which has improved enormously in my county of Derbyshire.</div>
<a name="09102239000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I could
just come back to the text of the Bill, Neil O&#146;Brien made the
comment some while ago that there was a mismatch between the strategy
and the targets in the Bill. I do not really understand that comment
because targets have been set out as the first duty of the Secretary of
State. The second duty of the Secretary of State is about drawing up a
strategy that concerns two things: first, looking at meeting the
targets and, secondly, ensuring that children do not experience
socio-economic disadvantage. A number of headings set out what would be
part of the components of that strategy, which in my view would also
encompass child care. As that is my interpretation of the Bill it, in
terms of how effective the way in which we should draw up strategies
is, I wonder if you could comment on how effective you believe those
strategies might be. Do you have any other comments on how you think
they should be developed, as set out in clause
8?</div><a name="09102239000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neil
O'Brien:</b></i> I am sure that the Government will come up
with a broadly based and sensible strategy for child poverty in the
round, and that is a good thing. The point I was making is that you
then selectively privilege some of the aspects of child poverty and
turn them into legally binding targets. But you do not do that in
relation to some of the other things you are going to be
doing&#151;you do not have a legally binding target to make sure that
more children are adopted, although I know that the Government did set
a target and try to raise the rate a few years ago. You are taking some
of the parts of what you do and privileging them hugely by turning them
into legally binding targets, which I worry distorts your overall
efforts, because all these different things are potentially just as
important as the income target that you are turning into a legally
binding target. Does that make
sense?</div><a name="09102239000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
34</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000233"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> Yes. Does that mean that your inclination will
be to have no targets or to have far more targets? How do you take
account of the fact that there are targets in other parts of Government
policy that would feed into this strategy? We are bedevilled. We are
told that we have too many targets and that we should not have any,
then everybody comes along and says that we want a target for this,
that and the other. You cannot win.</div>
<a name="09102239000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neil
O'Brien:</b></i> My answer to that question is fairly clear.
I think that you want a broader range of targets and you do not want to
privilege a few of them over others. So you want, in a sense, to be
neutral between the different types of approaches to challenging child
poverty, rather than saying that one thing is much more important than
another by turning it into a target.</div>

answer now for all time that there should be a single set of targets.
In any sensible research programme, that set of targets would probably
evolve over time and you might add to it as you find new things that
are important. Near the start, I mentioned the sort of things that I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>think are the good causers-of-poverty type of targets. So I mentioned
living in jobless households, or people being NEET themselves; low
educational attendance, or erratic school attendance; living in
substandard accommodation; infant mortality rates; serious
childhood injuries; registration to the child protection
register; teenage smoking, teenage obesity and teenage pregnancy; and
children in care who are not adopted. So all those things are important
and I do not think that you should just turn only one part of what you

Hirsch:</b></i> If I may slightly disagree with Neil, I would
like to comment. It seems to me that, if you honestly apply the
objectives and targets of this Bill, you will have an enormous task on
your hands and a task that is very multi-faceted. What Neil&#146;s
argument rests on, I think, is a view that the Bill will distort the
situation to certain mechanisms that are easier to measure. I think
that that is a slightly gloomy interpretation. One would hope that,
perhaps with the help of this child poverty commission, there would be
the discipline of saying that you tackle some of these issues about
employment, child care and other things that will be very important to
get right in order to meet that income target. In so doing, you would
be fulfilling quite a wide range of social objectives.</div>
<a name="09102239000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
if we think that somebody who is in school now might in 10
years&#146; time be a parent living in poverty if they do not get
good enough qualifications, that person, who has had a disadvantaged
upbringing themselves, needs to do better at school, to help to fulfil
these income targets. That is already quite a broad strategy.</div>
<a name="09102239000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">So I think
that the key thing is to ensure that you create a commission with some
clout and some teeth, and one that provides a sort of discipline to
ensure that you really are tackling these problems in the round. The
risk of having lots and lots of targets is that they duplicate targets
elsewhere and also that each one of those targets itself becomes a
potentially distorting
measure.</div><a name="09102239000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neil
O'Brien:</b></i> The bottom line is that you have a certain
budget in the end and you have to choose where a pound should go. Is it
better to spend the pound tackling lower educational achievement in
order to get a good result later, or is it better to spend it on a tax
credit today? That is a question for good academic research that the
Government should undertake. However, you do not actually have that
choice if you set these targets. You have got to choose, as David
Gauke&#146;s question implied earlier on; you must choose to hit the
target with a tax credit now.</div>
<a name="09102239000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> Not if your target is established for
10 years ahead. They have to publish a strategy now. It is
true that, if that task got neglected now, in eight years&#146; time
you would be in that situation. However, in 2010-11, when the strategy
is published, there will not be that pressure.</div>
<a name="09102239000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neil
O'Brien:</b></i> Let us say that something happens to the
economy that takes the median income up a lot over the next 10 years
and a new Government arrive in 2018, and they find that they are a long
way away from the 60 per cent. median income target. That
Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>really will not have a choice at that point, politically, other than to
spend the money on tax credits, even if that is the wrong thing to
do.</div>
<a name="09102239000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
36</b><a name="09102239000236"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): My first question
is for the IFS. At the time of the fiscal stimulus, which was
&#163;2.6 billion, the cost of eradicating child poverty was
virtually exactly the same amount. A read-across would be too
simplistic, would it not? How much of child poverty should be through
redistribution and how much do you think it should be through the other
targets in the
Bill?</div><a name="09102239000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> This is similar to the previous question. The
Bill requires the strategy to be both about tackling child poverty as
defined by the four indicators and reducing socio-economic disadvantage
among
children.</div><a name="09102239000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
37</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000237"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I know that it does, but an argument is that, if
we had done the &#163;2.6 billion through child tax credits, we would
have made a real dent in child
poverty.</div><a name="09102239000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> Yes, you certainly would. The Government had
a choice, particularly at the time of the fiscal stimulus. They had a
choice between where to spend the money and they chose, for example, to
keep the higher rate of personal allowance, which they introduced under
a personal, temporary measure, rather than spend it on tax credits. The
Government could have spent some on tax credits, as you said. That
would have made a severe dent in child poverty, and I might well be
sitting here now telling you that the Government were on track to hit
their child poverty
target.</div><a name="09102239000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
38</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000238"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Has the IFS costed out the other elements in the
Bill?</div><a name="09102239000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> We have looked at the relative poverty
measure and what would happen to it in the future, based on current
policies. The particularly important things are current policies on
benefit and tax uprating. They become the most important things when
forecasting 10 or 15 years in the future. We thought that, on current
policies, child poverty would rise back to its &#146;98 levels
by
2020.</div><a name="09102239000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
39</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000239"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I want to ask more about child care. Bearing in
mind where we were some years ago, the changes are very dramatic. Which
bit of child care do you think has not been dealt with? If you take
into account the child care element of the tax credit system, the early
years curriculum, the children&#146;s centres and the specifications
for the children&#146;s centres and for early years&#151;things
like outdoor covered play areas, which seem to be entirely
child-focused&#151;what practical steps do you think should be taken,
and what is being costed, that would further improve child
care?</div><a name="09102239000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ridge:</b></i> I don&#146;t think that I will be able to
help you on the costed element. I agree that a lot has been done on
child care, but it is interesting that research with children still
shows that they are quite resistant to a lot of child care that they
are either receiving or would receive if their mothers, or mothers and
fathers, went to
work.</div><a name="09102239000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
40</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000240"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> What are they resistant to, and to which age group
of children are you referring? I am thinking of two-year-olds screaming
as they are led into a children&#146;s
centre.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div><a name="09102239000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ridge:</b></i> Perhaps we mean children of a different age.
For a start, we still need to tackle to a much greater extent the type
of child care that we provide for older
children.</div><a name="09102239000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
41</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000241"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Which
age?</div><a name="09102239000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ridge:</b></i> I would say nine, 10 and above. There is a
point at which lone mothers, in particular, do not want their children
coming home and letting themselves in, although a lot do that while
their mothers are working. Child care does not really capture in any
way the type of care or provision that they might
want.</div><a name="09102239000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
42</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000242"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> How about the extended days? I completely agree
that there is always room for further improvement in child care, but
extended day provision in quite a number of schools has been extremely
good, and has looked at precisely the group of children you are talking
about. It has provided services precisely for them. The schools in the
disadvantaged areas have probably been the best, so will you be more
specific about exactly what is needed? If we are going to recommend it
to the Government, we must be clear about exactly what is
needed.</div><a name="09102239000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ridge:</b></i> The thing about extended schools and extended
days is that a lot of disadvantaged children are not having a terribly
good time at school, and school is not necessarily the place at which
they might want to stay after school has finished. I can only tell you
what has been picked up in qualitative research, and that is the
case.</div><a name="09102239000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have done a longitudinal study of children in lone-parent families. A
group of children in the study were very resistant to any child care,
because they felt that it was very stigmatised. For example, one girl
said, &#147;Child care is for scabs.&#148; I think that that
happens where child care becomes identified with a particular type of
provision, and is not rather a suite of opportunities after school that
might be offered to
children.</div><a name="09102239000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
43</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000243"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> So would it be more helpful if we thought of child
care more as youth services? If you tell a nine or 10-year-old that
they are going into child care, they will say, &#147;Not me.&#148;
Northamptonshire county council, which is Conservative-controlled, is
scrapping all its child care and youth services. Should we not be
looking at the role that those services have to play in the total suite
of services for disadvantaged
children?</div><a name="09102239000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ridge:</b></i> Yes, I agree with you totally. One of the
things that slightly older children, aged around nine or 10, who are
attending child care talk about&#151;this is in other studies as
well&#151;is that they quite often find themselves in care with
younger children. So a lot of the time they are basically getting told
off for knocking young children over, or they feel that they are not
doing the things that they want to do. If children become very
resistant to going to child care, it narrows the opportunities for
mothers to work beyond school hours, at the beginning or the end of the
day.</div><a name="09102239000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
44</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000244"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Would it be more sensible, bearing in mind that we
are talking about a Bill, to look at wording that relates to child care
and youth services, rather than just child care, so that we capture the
age ranges?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div><a name="09102239000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ridge:</b></i> I totally agree. I think that at that
particular age there is still a need to be looking at a very different
type of
provision.</div><a name="09102239000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> It would be misleading to say that the only
shortfalls at the moment are with older children. A lot of other
shortfalls have been picked up, one of which is atypical hours, not
just provision up until 6 o&#146;clock in the evening. It
is very difficult to get that. You talked about the child care tax
credit; there has been a very poor take-up of that. Another issue is
the argument for more direct funding of places, rather than funding
through means-testing. Also, things can look quite good on paper, such
as the guarantee of free child care for three and four-year-olds for 15
hours, but that is very difficult to match with a job, and you end up
getting extra charging. There are a lot of different ways in which many
parents are not finding the child care opportunities that they need,
despite all the improvements that have been
made.</div><a name="09102239000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102239000245"></a>Ms

specific
measures.</div><a name="09102239000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald

issue.</div><a name="09102239000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
45</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000246"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I would like to ask a question on work incentives
or disincentives, and then follow up on something that Donald Hirsch
said earlier about in-work poverty. Have any of you done any research
on the effect of increasing levels of tax credits on labour market
incentives and disincentives? That is an area that the Treasury
traditionally takes very seriously. For example, when earnings
disregards were being looked at in the child maintenance system, the
Treasury pored over them very carefully to try to see what the impact
would be on the labour market. Are there any potential worries that, by
trying to meet the targets and by the possible ramping up of tax
credits at some point in the future, you might skew the labour market
somewhat and leave people on benefits? Such benefits might put them
just above the poverty level, but would not give them a very good
quality of
life.</div><a name="09102239000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> One general thing is that if you rely
excessively on in-work tax credits, rather than wages, to get people
who are out of work out of poverty, you will have a lot of people on
very high marginal withdrawal rates. That creates huge difficulties and
a sense of injustice, in that if you work harder, get a promotion,
train or whatever, you are not getting much of a reward for it. That is
the real reason why, as I was saying earlier, you have to look at the
market returns alongside the actual
transfers.</div><a name="09102239000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
46</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000247"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Okay. Following that up, you made a comment
earlier, Donald Hirsch, where you quite properly referred to the large
levels of in-work poverty. We all talk about work being the route out
of poverty, but there are huge numbers of children whose parents are in
work and yet still in poverty. That seems a rather neglected area
sometimes, in terms of what we do with those parents to try to enable
them to earn a higher income. Karen Buck will remember that a previous
Chair of a Select Committee that we served on in the last Parliament
used to talk about A, B, C&#151;a job, a better job, a career. Do you
see that as an important 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>area? Do you see anything positive being done that you would alight on,
and that would cause you to say, &#147;The Government should look
further in this area&#148;?</div>
<a name="09102239000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> Yes. There are some broad things about
training and how we upskill our whole work force and create better
jobs. A tricky aspect of that relates to couples in which there is
presently one earner. There have been indications from the Government
that the solution has to be getting a second earner in that family.
There is a case for that, but it is telling families how you want them
to behave, and any Government drawing up a strategy will need to be
clear about the extent to which they rely on that particular
phenomenon.</div>
<a name="09102239000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><b class="B"><a name="09102239000248"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Right. I am sorry, but you are still not quite
getting my point, which is that if someone gets an entry-level job,
they may be in work, but the reason why there are a lot of children in
poverty is that those people never get above an entry-level job. They
are still doing something with pretty basic skills all the way through
their working lives, and that does not enable their children to get out
of poverty. How do you upskill people who are in low-paid work, to
enable them to progress in work and earn higher pay? That is what I am
trying to get at.</div>
<a name="09102239000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> I agree with that, but what I am saying is
that a lot of in-work poverty has to do with the low number of hours of
work in the family, and not just a low wage. Both are
important.</div>
<a name="09102239000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> I agree that the issues you have highlighted
are important. I wish I knew how we could get parents who are in
low-skilled jobs that are going nowhere into careers. That is
incredibly difficult. I do not think that we have very good evidence
about what kind of interventions from Government work in such an
area.</div>

What do you believe the impact of the minimum wage is on child poverty?
If we did not have the minimum wage, what would be the impact on child
poverty? Have either of you done any simulations on the
subject?</div>
<a name="09102239000165"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mike
Brewer:</b></i> The minimum wage is very important for lone
parents in keeping their income up, but it is one 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>of the perversities of the way we measure poverty that the minimum wage
is also very important for households at and around the median income,
and for some well-off households. When you think about relative
poverty, the minimum wage is not a great anti-poverty device, but it is
very important for some low-wage earners.</div>
<a name="09102239000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Donald
Hirsch:</b></i> I think that low pay is very important. Often
it is about people who are somewhat above the minimum wage being able
to progress further. It is not always the case that there are problems
for people who are at the minimum wage. When the minimum wage came in,
it brought up fewer people than we thought, so low pay is definitely an
issue. The minimum wage, at its present level, is not very
direct.</div><a name="09102239000167"></a>

<a name="09102239000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ridge:</b></i> Very quickly, I wanted to talk about work and
give you a quick sense of the qualitative work that we have done
longitudinally with lone parents, a sample who were keen to work. When
they go into employment, the critical thing for them is sustaining
their employment. That was a real struggle. Everything changed all the
time for parents. The problem was the fluidity, in terms of hours of
work and types of work. At the end of the sample, only one person had
not had some change in either hours, job, spells of employment or
spells of sickness. They may find themselves in a job but then have the
employer change the goalposts&#151;they have sorted out their child
care and suddenly they are expected to work on a Saturday. That bottom
end of the labour market is very unstable and very fluid and, when you
are trying to manage child care as well, that is particularly
important. You talk about a job, a better job, and a career, but for
the women who have been in work for four to five years in that sample,
their notion of advancement was, almost exclusively, permanence. That
was their notion of advancement: just having a job that was permanent
and in which they were aware of what the rules were going to
be.</div>
