<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>

<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, everyone. I have an announcement to make.
<P>
I am happy for the Committee to have wide-ranging debates on amendments. However, if those debates move too wide, I shall apply Standing Order 68 and Standing Order 89 part b, which allow for a restriction on stand part debate. Therefore, if debate on amendments is going to be wide-ranging, there will be no stand part debate. I am making that point to make things clear from the word go. However, I wish to give Committee members an opportunity to make their arguments, as I--like everyone else in this Room--want to hear all available evidence. However, it is only right that business is not repeated in Committee, and I request Members' co-operation on that.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Maintenance calculations and terminology</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [18 January], No 1, in page 1, line 8, at the beginning to insert the words--
<P>
'(A1) Subsection (1) shall not come into force until such time as the Secretary of State shall have published in the London Gazette, an estimate prepared by him of:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) The number of maintenance calculations he expects to perform (whether as a result of the operation of section 4 of the 1991 Act or as a result of the operation of section 6 of the 1991 Act) in the period of 12 months following the coming into force of subsection (1);
<P>
(b) The number of maintenance calculations referred to in (a) above in which the amount of child support maintenance would be more if that maintenance calculation were to be undertaken in accordance with Part I of Schedule 1 as amended by this Act rather than in accordance with Part I of Schedule 1 to the 1991 Act prior to any amendment by this Act;
<P>
(c) The number of maintenance calculations referred to in (a) above in which the amount of child support maintenance would be less if that maintenance calculation were to be undertaken in accordance with Part I of Schedule 1 as amended by this Act rather than in accordance with Part I of Schedule 1 to the 1991 Act prior to any amendment by this Act; and
<P>
(d) The number of maintenance calculations referred to in (a) above in which the amount of child support maintenance would be the same if that maintenance calculation were to be undertaken in accordance with Part I of Schedule 1 as amended by this Act rather than in accordance with Part I of Schedule 1 to the 1991 Act prior to any amendment by this Act.'--[
Mr. Pickles.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I shall bear in mind your admonition about the conduct of debate, Mr. Brien. I said much of what I wanted to say about the Bill's winners and losers before we adjourned on Tuesday.
<P>
Will the Minister make it clear who the winners and losers will be, and how much the sums are likely to amount to? After all, the financial transaction involved in Child Support Agency cases is the single most contentious issue for parents with care and absent parents, the latter being more vocal than the former. Under the new system, many absent parents will become winners, as they will pay less.
<P>
However, that is not true for everyone, as some people will pay more under the new system, as there will be no cap on the amount to be taken from people's income under the new percentages arrangement. Therefore, before the Bill is enacted, we should know who is going to come to our surgeries to complain and why. Will the Government provide a better idea of the changes and their impact on people's financial circumstances? You can bet your bottom dollar that, whenever a change is made, those who gain will say "Thank you very much", but that those who lose will be banging on our surgery doors, saying, "What's going on? It was bad enough already, but now it's even worse." As a Committee member with some responsibility for such measures, I should like to reassure those people that such issues were explored and subjected to parliamentary agreement.
<P>
However, absent parents are not the only ones to gain or lose as a result of the new formula. Parents with care--whom the Bill is designed to help--are also affected. If the majority of absent parents pay less, the majority of parents with care will receive less, and I am sure they will complain as well.
<P>
On Tuesday morning, I accepted that there will be quite a large number of such people. However, although absent parents may contribute less to the maintenance of their children, those with care may not receive less because of new arrangements on the disregard. How many people fall into that category? How many will receive less overall as a result of absent parents' income being assessed on a new basis?
<P>
The changes will not be welcomed by women in tight financial circumstances, and they too will beat a path to our door. I reiterate that it would be helpful if Ministers provided much more precise information about the changes to people's personal financial circumstances that the Bill will bring about. We look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): When first I read the amendment, it seemed quite innocuous. However, I was anxious to hear from Opposition Members about the thinking behind it. Leaving aside the hon. Lady's contribution this morning, from my reading of the Hansard report of four first sitting on Tuesday, I now have a better perception of what was behind it, and it appears to be a charter for wealthy absent fathers. I was disappointed by some of the contributions on Tuesday. There was no mention of the needs of children. There seemed to be a presumption that the parent with care, whom it was assumed was a woman, was some of gold-digger who would take a man's money and do with it what she would--invest it in the stock market and enjoy herself on cruises or holidays--rather than spend it on the children.
<P>
I make a plea for the vast majority of mothers, and fathers, who are parents with care and who spend more than half their income on caring for their children. Let us consider how the average family works. What parents would not provide a roof over their child's head knowing that they were subject to the law for abuse or neglect? What parents would not ensure that their children were properly clothed and fed? What parents would not ensure that their children had adequate leisure time, assuming that they could afford it? Of course many parents cannot afford to spend large sums on the leisure pursuits that most children enjoy these days. It was a bit sad that there was so much concern about wealthy fathers and whether it was right for them to contribute to the same extent as less wealthy fathers. There was an imbalance in the debate.
<P>
However, I was pleased with the speech of the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride), which I felt was the first time attention had been paid to parents with care. I was glad that the hon. Lady at least mentioned them. However, I feel strongly that the whole thrust of the debate so far has been to neglect the main winners in all this, who must surely be the children who hitherto have had no support whatever. The old formula was treated by parents as a tool, in divorce proceedings or afterwards, to carry out a vendetta against each other.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The hon. Lady is right. Clearly these legislative proposals are designed to deliver money to children. I just wonder whether she is worried that, in the majority of cases, the new formula will reduce the amount of money paid by absent parents to parents with care? Given the way in which her argument developed, it appeared to go against the interests of the children, because she suggested that their maintenance will be less.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> The hon. Lady takes us down a route that we went along Second Reading, which was to ask whether we should stay with a complicated formula that no one can understand, that does not work and delivers nothing, or whether we should simplify the procedure so that those who currently have nothing are given something, thereby taking the heat out of the situation and moving forward. I thought that there was consensus across the House that the latter was the right approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): some 850,000 children will lose out under the Bill. Would it be fair to say that the hon. Lady is telling them that the system is too complicated so we must simplify the formula?
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is developing the same argument that caused the Child Support Agency to be such a shambles. It is extraordinary that he wants to step back in time and forget that that shambles delivered nothing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): My hon. Friend is right. Does she agree that a wealth of difference exists between an assessment under the CSA and what is paid? The Select Committee on Social Security report stated that, by May 1999, almost a third of non-resident parents assessed to pay child support paid nothing, and a quarter made only partial payments. Is not that the real difference?
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I congratulate the Select Committee on its excellent report, which members of the Committee should have read. The main thrust of the argument is that if people do not receive the money that they are due, the assessment is worthless.
<P>
It would take a genius to understand the algebraic formula used in the schedule to the Child Support Act 1991. I know from people who work in the CSA that the only way in which they can do the calculations themselves is to use the computer. It takes someone who has several degrees to work out the CSA. formula. Clearly the agency is one of the main winners, because at least its staff have a worthwhile job to do, but we should not worry too much about that. My worry is that children must be the main winners. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) frowns because that does not suit his argument. Children gain nothing if they get nothing, and I regret that that point has been missed so far in the debate. We do not want a charter for absent wealthy fathers; we want a charter for children, which is what the Bill represents.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Jaqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): I should like to begin by saying that, much as I appreciate the arguments used by the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford), the point of the amendment is that the information should be published. I am looking forward to a debate about variations and who the winners and losers will be but we want the information to be published so that those currently in the system, who will remain on the old formula, know whether they will win or lose compared with the new system, and so that people know how they will be affected in future. The purpose of the amendment is to put the information into the public domain in a recognised journal. The amendment refers to the London Gazette. I doubt whether any member of the Committee reads the London Gazette. with avidity, even in the mornings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Browne </B>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun): I apologise for being unable to attend the first sitting of the Committee because of other commitments, so I have not had the benefit of hearing hon. Members' contributions, although I have read them. Will the hon. Lady explain how the publication of gross figures tells people whether they are likely to be winners or losers? Surely such matters can be established only in an individual relationship with the agency.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> When we debate further amendments, we shall deal with the changes that we want to make so that the information that we want published makes it clear to everyone whether someone is a winner or a loser. If the hon. Gentleman remains patient as we debate the amendments to clause 1 and schedule 1, he will discover who we think should be the winners and losers.
<P>
I do not mind whether the information is published in the London Gazette. On 18 January, in an interesting written answer, the Minister of State stated that the Department publishes the Child Support Agency Quarterly Summary of Statistics. I should be happy for the Under-Secretary to draft a similar amendment, stating in which publication she is prepared to put the information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh: </B>(Gainsborough): We may have made a mistake with the London Gazette. My hon. Friend may remember that we started publishing it to break the general strike in 1924. It was the only publication on the streets and the Labour party has hated it ever since.
<P>
<H5>10.15am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> If my hon. Friend wishes to amend our amendment to change the publication to encourage the Government to publish in a journal to which they feel friendly, I would have no difficulty with that. If the Under-Secretary wants to redraft our amendments indicating which publication she is prepared to put these statistics, we would have no difficulty with that either. The Government already publish the Child Support Agency Quarterly Summary of Statistics. We do not even need these figures quarterly. We would just like the initial figures once the Bill has been enacted and the regulations have been published.
<P>
As with so much of the Government's legislation, everything is being done by regulation. If the statistics are not to be published, can the Under-Secretary guarantee that the regulations, either in draft or final form, will be available to us before the end of the Committee stage so that we can pore over them and work out for ourselves who will be the winners and losers? We could then inform those of our constituents who are affected and regularly come through our doors whether they will win or lose under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr.  Dismore:</B> Will the hon. Lady tell us how a general statistical analysis will enable her to tell individual constituents whether they are winners of losers? Surely the answer is to do the very much simpler calculation under the proposals in the Bill and compare it with the amount that is being paid or received.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Once we have gone through our amendments to clause 1 and schedule 1, we will have a much clearer idea of what the formula and the variations will be, because as ever the devil is in the detail. I do not see why it is not possible for the Department to produce these statistics so that we can tell our constituents, in board and general terms, whether they will win or lose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> It is important that we concentrate on this issue. The whole basis of the amendment is that working out 15, 20 or 25 per cent. of a net income is a complex calculation. When people ask me whether they will be winners or losers under the new formula, I will ask to see their wage slip. I will see what their net income is and tell them what 15, 20 or 25 per cent. of it would be. That may not be entirely accurate in every case, but it will give everyone a broad indication. Why do we need the complicated process proposed in the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> It is amazing that an hon. Member who sits on this Committee--granted on the Government side and, although I am delighted that he has contributed, therefore not likely to contribute in great detail unless allowed to do so--has clearly not read the Bill or the Green Paper, or listened to the debate. The devil is in the variation detail. I was not an MP when the original legislation went through, but I was in the House when the first of the complainants came pouring through my then constituency door in Hastings and Rye, many of whom had a wonderful reason to have a variation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swane </B>(New Forest, West): On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien, I refer to the difficulty in reading the Bill to which my hon. Friend has just drawn attention. I attempted to read clause 1 last night so that I could understand it fully for these proceedings. Reading the Bill requires an understanding of or at least access to the 1991 Act, which the Bill amends. Replacement Section 11(4) at line 6 on page 2 begins:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If it appears to the Secretary of State that subsection (10) of Section 4".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and line 28 on page 2 provides that an amount of child support maintenance will be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"determined on the basis he determines under Section 28F(4)."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I referred to the 1991 Act and found that neither of those sections existed. Of course, they were amended by the Child Support Act 1995, but we do not have a consolidated copy of the Act to which to refer.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Gentleman wished to obtain that information he could so so from the Library without delay, so that is not a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I understand my hon. Friend's point. Without wishing to go out of order, one of the things that amuses me about clause 1 is its use of he and she in clearly defined roles.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I remind the hon. Lady that in previous Committees on which we have both sat, my hon. Friends and I made many contributions.
<P>
I also refer her to the algebraic formula in schedule 1 of the 1991 Act. Is she seriously suggesting that it would be possible from the proposal before us,--albeit with possible variations--to make a reasonable assessment about a winner or loser with this algebraic nonsense which no one can understand?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I do not want to go down the mathematics route but, as the hon. Lady knows, I was educated in Scotland and therefore to me the algebraic formula is understandable. To pick up the hon. Lady's other point, she did indeed make many contributions in last year's Committee, but I think she would acknowledge that she was one of the few.
<P>
Opposition Members seem to have spent most of their time implying that they are talking only about those who are well off, but what concerns me and many of my colleagues is that many of the less well off will lose by this formula. I have a constituent--I am sure that I will refer to his case when we discuss variations--who could, even with the straight formula without variations, possibly be better off under the new proposals; the problem is that he will be unable to benefit from them.
<P>
The information should be published. We all know of the great example--now some 80 years old--of how rumours change in the telling. By the time the order "Send reinforcements, we're going to advance" reached the back lines in the 1914-1918 war, it had turned into" Send three and fourpence, we're going to a dance". There are probably members of this Committee who do not know what three and fourpence is. If this information is not published, my constituent would be the victim of rumours about whether he would win or lose. He has only to talk to someone in the same position but who is a new claimant and paying much less and he will be apoplectic. Believe me, he needs a lot of calming down when he comes to my surgery. The information should be in the public domain, so we can go some way towards explaining why some people who are poorly paid are losing out--and blaming the Government for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Or praising them.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Or praising them if people gain, but I suspect that this gentleman will lose out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I return to my previous point, which the hon. Lady has not yet answered. The individual she hypothecates as attending her surgery is not interested in whether he is one of one, 100, 1000 or 10,000 winners or losers, only in where he stands individually. As my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne) said, that can be established by a quick look at the pay slip and a comparison with what he is currently paying or receiving. The individual counts here, not the overall statistics, which is what the amendment deals with.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am sorry to prolong the argument--
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> I do not think that the hon. Lady is sorry.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am very sorry to prolong the argument. That is a most ungracious comment from a sedentary position. I am sorry to hear it, because thus far we have conducted proceedings in a good-humoured way.
<P>
I wish to reply to the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) and I return to my point about rumours. Of course people are interested in their own circumstances, but they draw comparisons and if they cannot compare on the basis of clear evidence provided by the Government, they will do so on the basis of rumour which, let me tell Ministers, is the worst possible case for them. The anger that those dealing with early cases had to face will be just as ferocious in future. Those coming up for a second time round--such as myself and not many, but several, Members on the Labour Benches--will not enjoy it. Those experiencing it for the first time will certainly not enjoy it. It is a very difficult situation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I want to ask my hon. Friend her view on keeping the public informed. Does she, like me, strongly support the concept of freedom of information, so agree that the amendment should find favour in the eyes of a Government who are, at least on paper, committed to freedom of information?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Information is power--a hackneyed phrase. I thought that the Government were in favour of giving power to the people to take decisions. If they do not have access to the information, how can they take a decision? My hon. Friend's point was first class.
<P>
Let me summarise the background to the amendment. First, information must be published. Secondly, we do not mind in which organ the information is published, but it must be as informative as possible, so it should be published in regulations or, we will concede, draft regulations. Everyone must be clear about what is going to happen. We would be happy if the Under-Secretary were prepared to take the amendment away for redrafting into a format acceptable to the Government and to return on Report with a promise that the information needed by our constituents will be put in the public domain as soon as possible.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It is a pity that Conservative Members are so pessimistic about my intention to provide information. I am happy to ensure that information will be available, so I hope that that will put to rest much of the speculation about how awful everything will be. The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) has something in common with me: we both entered the House when changes resulting from the 1991 Act were starting to take effect. What happened then demonstrates only too well the consequences of getting such a delicate operation wrong.
<P>
However, the position now is not the same as it was when a brand new Act was passed. The 1991 Act--with its resultant effects--has been in force since 1993. Therefore, I ask Committee members not to discuss the Bill as if the slate were clean. We must use our experience when attempting to navigate such sensitive, difficult matters. We must accept that some people--whether non-resident parents or parents with care--will persist in the acrimony that may have led to their break-up. Some of them do not always think as much as they should about their children's welfare, but continue to play games. We all know of such cases.
<P>
When we examine the position that non-resident parents and parents with care may be in when the Bill is enacted, we must remember that we cannot please everyone. If we attempt to please everyone in every circumstance, we shall certainly fail.
<P>
We were seen to be as fair as possible to as many people as possible in our long, open consultation about the shape of the new child support formula and the new arrangements to be implemented by the Bill. We must be seen to be so again when debating the Bill. We must appeal to reasonable onlookers, who are not involved in the emotions that are often churned up in such circumstances, to accept the laudable and essential principle that parents have a duty to help to provide for their children, whether or not they live with them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Lady did not say anything with which I disagree--I hope that that does not cause her problems. She referred to couples who continue their acrimony after separation. Does she agree that we are all under a duty to ensure that we do not create a system that will enable aggrieved parties to pursue their disputes and cause hurt?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We have an absolute duty to minimise that possibility. However, I am not as idealistic as the hon. Gentleman in thinking that it is possible completely to get rid of the aspect of human behaviour that sometimes leads people to act like that. We must minimise the opportunities for such behaviour, but must also recognise that there will be circumstances in which people are determined on such a course. We cannot legislate that away. We must therefore aim for fairness and appropriateness, as we did in our long, open consultation.
<P>
We must use our experience of existing legislation. As members of all parties have said, we must also take account of the formula and the complexity of putting it into effect. Tailored schemes with a high degree of rigidity are hard to apply in practice. Hence the decision to move to a radically simpler formula that anyone can understand and predict.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am listening closely to the Under-Secretary. She may be using English loosely, but I got the impression that the new formula will not be as rigid as an algebraic formula. Does she agree that if it is not rigid, or if there are no clear-cut variations, as soon as one person is given a variation not allowed to others, a coach and horses will be driven through the formula, however simple it is?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> If I am allowed to complete my arguments, some of those matters will become clear. The hon. Lady is right: the idea behind the formula is that it should be simple, transparent and predictable, unlike the obtuse, confusing and complex one that it replaces. No doubt there will be pressure in forthcoming amendments to complicate it. The hon. Lady has issued a useful warning that attempts to reintroduce that complexity will take us back to what we are meant to be moving away from--a complex, difficult-to-administer formula.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 would delay the introduction of a new, more effective, child support scheme until such time as our estimates of the scheme's effect are published in the London Gazette. My notes tell me that the London Gazette is widely read by Members of Parliament, but it is certainly not read by me. The amendment is unnecessary. I am happy to give the Committee the estimates that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar and his hon. Friends requested. However, I must make it clear at the outset that any discussion about winners and losers in the context of changes in maintenance liability is largely academic. As some of my hon. Friend's pointed out, current assessments bear little relationship to the amounts of maintenance that are actually paid. A theoretical liability that goes unpaid is no good to a parent with care. It is not clear how one defines a winner or a loser in this context.
<P>
It is important to remember the effect that our proposed reforms will have on children. My hon. Friends have reminded us that children are at the centre of these reforms. Unless we keep that in mind, we shall become embroiled in sterile arguments about hypothetical winners and losers.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Our point has perhaps not been fully understood. Many parents with care receive maintenance payments. Under the new formula, those parents are likely to lost out. Labour Members said that we do not need the statistics because the absent parent will be able to look at his wage slip and divvy it up. The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun said that he would do that for absent parents if they came to his surgery. However, the present formula is so complicated that we have no idea what will happen when a percentage of an absent parent's income is suddenly assessed and that amount paid to the parent with care determined. It is precisely the probable losers who need to know what the likely scenario will be, because they are unable to make such back-of-an-envelope computations.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The simple back-of-the-envelope computation in the Bill is easy to work out. Unlike the hon. Lady, most people can calculate what 15 per cent. of something amounts to.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Let me give the hon. Lady the information for which she asked; perhaps then she will be happy.
<P>
Of the one and a half million children now on the CSA's books, only about 300,000--this is a well-known figure--are enjoying the benefit of maintenance, and of those, fewer than half are getting all the money that is due to them. We estimate that the new, simpler child support system, together with the introduction of a £10 maintenance premium to income support and the 100 per cent. disregard of maintenance in working families tax credit, will mean that more than one million children will stand to gain. Many of them will have the benefit of maintenance for the first time. They include about 600,000 children in the poorest families on income support.
<P>
The amendment asks for figures in relation to applications for maintenance in the first 12 months of the scheme, but it is not strictly possible to provide that information in the form requested--obviously, we cannot know in advance the personal circumstances of the people who will be coming to the Child support Agency for a calculation of their liability in the first year of the new scheme's operation. We can only make estimates based on what we know about the agency's current case load and extrapolate from there, assuming that there will be no change in the sorts of people--and their incomes--who will use the agency in future. The estimates are therefore contingent on those assumptions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Has the hon. Lady built into those estimates a modelling of the current prevalence of departures in the existing case load and taken account of the change in the departures regime as it will affect the case load after the implementation of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We are talking about what might happen in future and we must make assumptions on that. We do not and cannot know in advance how many people will apply for variations under the new formula. We have made assumptions, but that is all they are and they may be proved wrong by subsequent behaviour. We cannot predict the future--if we could, I suspect that many of us would be doing something different.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I entirely accept what the hon. Lady says, but it is precisely those assumptions that I want to examine. If it is a complicated matter, it may be appropriate for her to let me know the details in writing.

<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> If the hon. Gentleman would let me make some progress, he might decide that he does not need me to write to him.
<P>
In all, we estimate that the Child Support Agency will complete in the region of 300,000 new maintenance calculations in the 12 months following subsection (1) coming into force. Of those, around 200,000 of the non-resident parents will be in work and, as I said, assuming that future applicants maintain the characteristics of the current case load, we estimate that around 65 per cent. or 130,000 cases will have a lower maintenance liability than they would have done under the current scheme, and 35 per cent. or 70,000 cases will be assessed as having to pay more.
<P>
Of the 100,000 cases where the non-resident parent is on benefit, we estimate that around 50,000 will have a lower assessment, because of the reduction in the flat-rate contribution for those on benefit from £5.35 to £5, and that 50,000 will pay more, because the current exemptions from paying the minimum amount will have been removed in most cases.
<P>
In other words, of the 300,000 non-resident parents coming on to the CSA's books in the first year of the new scheme, around 180,000 are likely to have to pay less maintenance and around 120,000 will have to pay more. We estimate that in only a small number of cases--we think fewer than 5,000--will the amount of maintenance remain the same, whether it is calculated under the new or the current rules.
<P>
In total, around 60 per cent. of non-resident parents will have a lower assessment under the new scheme. That does not mean--this is one of the basic errors, to put it gently, that was made in the speeches that we have heard--that 60 per cent. of parents with care will be worse off. As I said, it must be borne in mind that assessments currently bear little relation to amounts paid. Only 40 per cent. of those using the CSA's collection service pay everything that is due and overall only about 66 per cent. of maintenance due is collected. The new scheme will mean that more men will pay more of what is due and, hopefully, more quickly. That, combined with the maintenance disregards in income support and working families tax credit, will mean that the large majority of parents with care--around 85 per cent., we think--will be better off at the point when they first come to the CSA.
<P>
There are bound to be differences in maintenance liability between the new scheme and the current complicated formula. The Hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) almost argued that we should not do anything because we will change maintenance liabilities. His speech was an argument for doing nothing. But we cannot learn from the lessons of our experiences with the Child Support Agency to date to make the system fairer and more effective, and to get maintenance money flowing to the children who deserve it, without changing the liabilities.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving us the figures. I will not repeat the ideas for reform that I outlined on Second Reading, but I should like to go over the figures with her. I accept that only 300,000 children see any maintenance and only half get all their money. A considerable number of fathers, therefore, pay their full assessment and I should be grateful if she could tell me how many. It is not enough, but it is still a considerable number. My point on Tuesday was that the problem was not so much with the new claimants, who will find it difficult to work out what they would have paid under the old system, but the absent fathers who at present pay in full. They will find it easy to work out what they would pay under the new system, so will be aggrieved and will come to our surgeries to complain. How many such fathers are there?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I am getting confused. Sometimes Conservative Members argue that the formula is so hard that no one can work it out, so I should announce the figures. Now the hon. Gentleman says that it is so easy to work out the fathers will all be ploughing into our surgeries to complain when they realise that they are, in his words, losers. I can give him the figures: 45 per cent. of non-resident parents currently pay their full amount and 30 per cent. currently pay absolutely nothing. Those figures are often confusing. The idea that if 60 per cent. of non-resident parents have a lower maintenance assessment they will lose is wrong, because other things have to apply to the final outcome.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am happy if the Under-Secretary answers this at a later date. She said that 30 per cent. pay nothing. We all understand that. Would that 30 per cent. who currently pay nothing be reassessed under the new system?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> My understanding is that they would but the transition is clearly an important and difficult aspect of the move from the current scheme to the scheme that we all hope to see. There are difficult issues here and the question of transition came up in some comments on Tuesday. In case hon. Members are worrying about this, I want to confirm that--
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Let me just say this: it would be unfair to responsible non-resident parents, who have paid regularly, to write off money that is owed. There will be no debt amnesty for those with debts from the old system. They will be carried on into the new system. Because it will have a more radical, simplified formula, the agency will be able to pursue its enforcement more effectively on those who so far have managed to evade their responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am glad to hear that.
<P>
The Under-Secretary will recall that I produced the figure of 850,00 and I was eagerly hoping that she would knock it down. It does not rely on an algebraic formula: it was literally done on the back of envelope. I want some assurance that nothing like that number of children in households where the parent has care will be affected. Will the Minister make me happy and knock those figures down?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I have given the hon. Gentleman the figures. His back-of-the envelope calculations were based on mistakes. The first was that he assumed that CSA families would have 2.4 children. That is how he arrived at his figure of 850,000 children losing out. They will not. The average is 1.5, which brings the figure down. I have given him the correct  figures. There is no way that 850,000 children will lose out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> It is more than half a million.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman is not taking account of those who get nothing at the moment, even though their assessment has been completed by the agency. The hon. Gentleman's figures are theoretical. The agency was given a complex administrative task under the Child Support Act 1991: in practical terms, it is impossible to do it. The agency spends 90 per cent. of its time making assessments. It must be demoralising for those working for the CSA when so many of their assessments are challenged. There are so many grounds on which claims can be challenged, so staff seldom get round to enforcing their assessments. In the real world, the figures that I provided are correct. Over time, as I have said, we expect more than 1 million children to gain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Under-Secretary says that 45 per cent. of non resident parents pay in full. Given that 1.5 million children are on the CSA books, will she remind me what that means in figures? What percentage of those paying in full will be better off in the new system? It should be possible to work out the answer to that crucial question.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I am told that 65 per cent. will be better off under the new system. I gave the hon. Gentleman the figures earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I know that this is difficult. I acknowledge that hon. Members often fire questions at Ministers, which are impossible to answer immediately. I will understand if the Under-Secretary has to provide an answer later. However, I have asked a simple question and it is crucial to have it answered. We know that 45 per cent. of non-resident parents pay in full. It should be possible to establish the exact number--not percentage--of people who will be better off under the new system. We will then have a much more precise idea of how many people will complain.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We made our estimates of how many people will have a lower assessment. I have already provided a figure of 65 per cent., which becomes 60 per cent. if people on benefit are included. I cannot work out, particularly in Committee, which individuals will personally gain or lose. I do not know off the top of my head the net wages of every individual who currently pays child support. [Hon. Members: "We are not asking for that."] Each individual can make the calculation. We believe that the simpler formula will gain widespread support. I have already provided the figures that Conservative Members require. The amendment is unnecessary and I ask the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am surprised at such a short response, particularly when the Minister was doing so well. Had she decided to address many of the points raised my hon. Friends, I am confident that weeks could have been taken off our deliberations. Now we will have to establish, through line-by-line scrutiny, the answers that the hon. Lady could have addressed to put our minds at rest.
<P>
One might have thought that the official Conservative Opposition were somehow opposed to the measure. What sort of reaction would there have been if we were opposing it? Here we are reaching across the Room in the spirit of friendship, yet getting cold shouldered. I am of sterner stuff and shall continue to make overtures of friendship to the Government, whether they like it or not.
<P>
I was particularly disappointed with the Minister's response to my calculation of the number of children affected. She said my calculation was full of flaws. It was not. There was only one flawed element in the calculation: that CSA families had 2.4 children. The hon. Lady said that they have on average 1.5 children. I understand that; it is staightforward.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> That is almost 50 per cent. down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> No, 30 per cent. We have a problem here. The good folks doing the calculations are bandying their figures about. This demonstrates the superiority of the Scottish system. I have no idea whether it is 30 per cent. myself.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that we need to pursue the 30 per cent. who are not paying? I was confused by the Under-Secretary's reply, which led me to assume that if the 30 per cent. currently not paying are not put into the new system, they will continue not paying, thereby making the children worse off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point, but there is slightly more to it than that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> No, there is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Yes, there is. The Under-Secretary said that the reason why those who shirk their responsibilities do not pay is because the CSA spends so much time on the algebraic formula--trying to work out exactly how much individuals have to pay--that it has no time for enforcement. I do not mean this personally, but I do not believe that for a second. In the CSA, as in similar systems throughout the world, officials take decisions about how much people should pay. I shall use simplistic figures in my example here, so I do not want hon. Members to criticise my mathematics, but if someone owes £1,000 and it could cost the best part of £3,000 to collect it, officials will decide that there is no point in pursuing it. My bet is that a sizeable proportion of the cost of collecting sums from absentee parents simply makes it not worth doing. Under the new system, that will be no different.
<P>
It would be different if the Government decided to pursue defaulters as a matter of social policy, perhaps in the same way that people are taken to the criminal courts for breaches. That would have considerable repercussions. We understand that the cost will be neutral. However, I do not accept the idea of notional losses in relation to non-enforcement. Nothing in the Bill suggests a toughening of the enforcement regime.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Later in the Bill, we shall come to a provision making it a criminal offence to tell lies to the CSA. The previous Government forgot to include such a provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That is not about enforcement, is it?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I think it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> No, it is not. Enforcement is about determinations and penalties. There was some talk about taking away people's driving licences, but that turns out be an alternative to a custodial sentence. Whether or not someone has lied to the CSA, the person making the deliberation must still decide whether it will be worth while expending a lot of public money to collect a relatively small amount-- that is the point that Labour Members, who are happy to heckle, must take into consideration. We would be prepared to bite the bullet if the Government decide to ensure, as a matter of public policy, that people pay. That is right, but it is an element that is missing.
<P>
I emphasise that we broadly support what the Government are trying to do, but we cannot see a problem with the publication of this information. After all, as I said when I intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, the Government support freedom of information, and the public have a right to know. The hon. Lady started to produce figures that were pretty close to acceptable and I commend her for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The Under-Secretary gave us those figures, but she would not tell us, in response to the question from my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, how many fathers who are currently paying everything will end up paying more. My back-of-the-fag-packet extrapolation from her figures is that, given that there are 1.5 million cases, of which she said that 45 per cent. pay everything and 40 per cent. will be worse off, about 270,000 fathers will be asked to pay more. If I have got that wrong, perhaps the hon. Lady would correct me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am not sure that that is my recollection, but if the hon. Lady wants to intervene to put the record straight, I should be happy to give way.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Again, Opposition Members are not taking account of those with nil assessment and various other factors that take the figure down. It is a mistake to calculate 45 per cent. of the entire figure. Of the non-resident parents who pay through the CSA, 150,000 are paying all that is due. As I said, some 65 per cent. will have lower assessment and 35 per cent. will be assessed as having to pay more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am grateful for that information as, I am sure, is the whole Committee. It will be all the more valuable when we can read it in the Official Report next Tuesday. The fact that the hon. Lady is prepared--rightly--to release those figures is an indication of how completely harmless the amendment is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> We could have given that information on Tuesday.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We would already have given it if Opposition Members had sat down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am very sorry. The Under-Secretary said that if we had sat down, we would have been given the information, but I seem to recall the Minister saying on Tuesday that when we last debated the issue, it had not received proper scrutiny because we had done an old pals act. If I attempt to be helpful to the Government, I am criticised and if I try to raise a proper debate, I am criticised. Some people might take offense at that, but fortunately, I am not one of them.
<P>
There is no reason why the figures should not be produced. As my hon. Friend said, we are not hung up on the London Gazette. Far from it--we would be very happy to have the data produced in any way. We should not be frightened of giving information to the public.
<P>
I have long been an advocate of freedom of information--I have a long track record of it in local government [laughter.] The Minister of State laughs. When I was leader of Bradford council it was one of the first authorities in the country to issue guidance on freedom of information and we were commended for doing so by the Campaign for Freedom of Information. It was a good 10 years before the Government got round to putting in place the kind of reforms that I introduced in Bradford. [
Interruption.] Honestly, I'm quite hurt. We are on the subject of Bradford because it is apposite,
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not on the subject of Bradford, we are on the subject of amendment No. 1 and I ask the hon. Gentleman to keep to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I was, Mr. O'Brien, but I was drawing an analogy.
<P>
The provision typifies the Government's approach because in many respects it represents the bureaucratic tendency for those of us who are accustomed to being talked to by officials. The Minister must stamp it out at every opportunity. I recall wanting to give more information, and saying that we must give choice. That is why I raised the point. What my officials said--and what the Minister came close to saying--was, "We can't do that. We're not having that. If we did that, the parents wouldn't know what to do with the information." As the hon. Member for Hendon said, they are not interested in information; they simply want to know how it affects them. Labour Back Benchers who seriously think that walking into the Child Support Agency with a pay packet and handing over the sum net of tax will produce a person's net income are in for a nasty shock. We shall come to the definition of net income, so I will not go down that path now. But that is the root of the difference between us.
<P>
There is a reason for our reservations. The previous Government produced a very difficult formula which we accept was a problem. In 1985, they issued a long list of what we can call variations. They made a mistake in not producing the sort of percentages that the Under-Secretary has published. If the previous Government had published a scheme similar to that in the first part of schedule 1, we would not have had problems and would not be sitting here now. But the Government are actually repeating that mistake in mirrored form by going for a simplified formula and a simplified system of variation. Frankly, to provide justice and a better CSA--I give the Committee my word that that is our sole intention--we should look towards complexity in the variations. Hence the necessity of our amendment. We want the Government to say, "Whoah! Let's pull back a little and not commit the same folly that the previous Standing Committee committed." The evidence is in the Select Committee's report and in what happened in Australia. I am confident that if the Government did as I suggested, we could produce from the Bill an Act of Parliament that would stand the test of time. My concern is that when the Bill is enacted, it will not stand that test.
<P>
The hon. Member for Colne Valley suggested thatwe wanted to protect "a rich person's charter". I resent that, as that is not our intention. However, we shall not hold back whenever we find injustice. We shall not hold back just because a handful of toffs suffer or benefit. Justice does not recognise money. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Carry on, Mr. Pickles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> As always, Mr. O'Brien, I am grateful for your protection.
<P>
It would be wrong to regard the matter as a weird extension of the class war. Frankly, we are discussing only a handful of cases which, however, will make headline news and be an enormous niggle. The matter is about social engineering and will upset just about every financial settlement on divorce. That is not in the CSA's or the Government's interest. We shall shortly consider amendments dealing specifically with that matter, so I shall not say any more about it now.
<P>
The amendment is sensible so I do not understand why it cannot be accepted. We certainly do not intend to force gratuitous Divisions, as we want reasonable progress to be made. However, the matter is relatively simple and the Bill will make a poor start if the Government are not prepared to stand by their undertakings to open government, freedom of information and keeping people informed. Therefore, I regret to say that I must ask my hon. Friends to put the matter to the vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> We have made some progress today. Earlier, the Under-Secretary said that 45 per cent. of non-resident parents pay in full. When I asked how many people that was, she could not immediately give a figure, but has now provided one.
<P>
The Under-Secretary will correct me if I am wrong however I understand that 150,000 men are now paying everything; 30%--roughly 45,000--will pay more under the new system; and 70%--which, with the aid of my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) I calculate as 105,000--will pay less under the new system. Therefore, as soon as the Bill is enacted, 105,000 men will be able to work out that they would pay less if the new system was introduced immediately. I hope that my hon. Friends appreciate that point and may argue that, as there is a transitional period with no big bang solution, some people are being asked to pay more on their existing salary than are those new to the system. Someone could say, "My friend earns the same as me and has the same number of kids, but he is paying less than I am because he is coming into the new system. That isn't fair." So, those 105,000 men will complain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I understand and accept the importance of my hon. Friend's point. However, I urge him not to forget the 45,000 fathers who pay all that is required of them, many making additional voluntary payments. They will look at the Bill and see that they will be hit for more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is a difficulty facing the Government. Some people will always complain. However, as we argued in the Select Committee, if a new system is to be introduced everyone must be treated the same. It is unfair that some people should pay more than others, when they have the same income and number of children. The Under-Secretary must address that, otherwise those 105,000 people will complain. I accept that if there were no transitional period, other complaints would be made and political difficulties would arise, but the Government must accept that. Although I should like to make other points, I want to concentrate on that point, so I shall sit down now to give the Under-Secretary the chance to comment on it.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am sorry that the Under-Secretary has decided not to reply because my hon. Friend has made an interesting point. I do not intend to cause a delay. To show that we want to be as helpful as possible, I draw the Under-Secretary's attention to page 73 of the Select Committee report and the excellent letter from Justice Kay of the Australian court. The letter contains a possible solution. Time lags between assessments are common in Australia, where a person's previous tax return is used, so there is a delay of about 2 years before the calculation comes into effect.
<P>
We might be able to draft amendments so that a person who pays considerably more now could make a payment with regard to the new formula and an adjustment could be made between the two figures when the assessment is made. The Under-Secretary should address such practical problems so that the proceedings can be speeded up.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I shall be brief, because we have been round the issues, many of which will come up in future amendments. The hon. Member for Gainsborough has referred to the difficulties involved in the transition, and we shall debate them later. He will know that several options exist. We could have a big bang, which would be extremely risky and probably operationally impossible, because the CSA will have 1.2 million assessments on its books when we shift to the new system. We have been advised that it is not operationally possible to complete the shift in a big bang. Therefore, there must be a transition, which we want to be as short, predictable and easy as possible so that existing payers know when they will be taken into the new system. We shall go into much more detail about that in future. There will be phasing arrangements to assist non-resident parents and parents with care who face changes in their assessments.

<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move amendment No.2, in page 1, line 15, leave out 'section 12(1)' and insert 'section 12'.
<P>
This is a drafting change. It is purely technical and is not a policy change. It is one of those amendments that I referred to in my short opening statement the other day. Minor corrections have been made as we have re-examined the Bill. In some circumstances, maintenance payments will not be able to be made straight away--for instance, when there are insufficient details or the CSA is waiting for verification. It is intended that the default rate of maintenance liability will be set at a basic percentage rate of the average net weekly income so that the maintenance can flow quickly. We want to get the money to the children as quickly as possible.
<P>
It has always been the intention that, if the calculation cannot be made perhaps because an application for a variation has been made, an interim rate may be used. The Bill amends a previous Act. As currently drafted, referring simply to Section 12(1) of the 1991 Act rather than to the whole of section 12 restricts the Secretary of State. The amendment will enable him to fix either a default maintenance or an interim maintenance, rather than tying him to just one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am glad for that clarification, because this is slightly more than a drafting amendment. It gives the Secretary of State much wider powers in that it gives him choice. Although I can think of one colleague who could have spoken on this amendment for 50 minutes without any problem, we are broadly supportive of what the Government are doing and we want to spend more time on matters that we regard as important. It is good that when a Secretary of State exercises powers he has a choice. The amendment does not give him additional powers, but merely a choice of powers, and I can see nothing wrong with that.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 56, in page 2, line 11, leave out 'one month' and insert 'two months'.
<P>
This is a simple, probing amendment. We have no particular view that two months would be better than one month, or that six weeks would be a better time. I suspect that this matter will come up at our surgeries so we simply want to hear the rationale behind this provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The time limit of one month exists in current legislation. We are not aware either from our constituents or right hon. and hon Members, that it causes a problem, so I see no justification for changing it. My policy is to give the Committee as much information as possible--even when we are told that we do not have to do so--if it is available for us to use. If there are financial consequences, I think we ought to say so. There are no financial consequences of such a change.
<P>
The parent with care has one month to respond to a letter telling her--we use the words "him" and "her" for the two parties, although it is sometimes the other way round--that the Secretary of State intends to cease dealing with the applications. If she does not want action to stop, she may be considered as a voluntary client of the agency without further application. If the parent with care misses the one-month time limit she can apply for maintenance later, and the agency will pursue the non-resident parent from the current date. The one-month time limit gives the parent with care a reasonable time to make up her mind while not requiring the CSA to suspend action for too long. Decisions need to be made as quickly as possible.
