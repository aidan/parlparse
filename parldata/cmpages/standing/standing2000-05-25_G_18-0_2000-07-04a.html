<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning. Before we start, there is one housekeeping matter to be dealt with. It would be helpful to the Officers of the House and the Chair if hon.

<P>
Will hon. Members, particularly those who may have received the amendment paper last night, double-check against this morning's selection paper to ensure that we are all referring to the same amendments?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I thought for one moment that my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) might move to adjourn the Committee when you, Mr. Gale, had completed your introduction of the amendments.

<P>
It is a great pleasure to move amendment No. 462. I hope that we shall have a full debate this morning on the proposals for the children's commissioner for Wales and on the Opposition's amendments relating to England. It might be helpful if I inform the Committee that I intend to speak to the amendments relating to Wales and my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) will respond to the debate and speak on matters relating to England, which form the substance of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). The partnership between the two Ministers and between the Government and the National Assembly for Wales will be displayed this morning. This is an important day for the National Assembly for Wales and the Government in terms of the partnership that we have brought to our debate this morning.

<P>
Hon. Members will be aware that there was considerable interest and concern in the north Wales child abuse inquiry, which was commissioned by the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) when he was Secretary of State for Wales. There was considerable concern about child abuse in north Wales and both the National Assembly and the Government wish to implement the recommendations made by Sir Ronald Waterhouse.

<P>
Sir Ronald's report, ``Lost in Care'', was published on 15 February this year. It referred to a number of issues which my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Health, has taken forward as chair of the ministerial safeguards task force which is examining a range of issues on the protection of children following the response to the Waterhouse report. The main recommendation in the report was that the Government and the National Assembly should appoint an independent children's commissioner for Wales.

<P>
On 2 March, two weeks after publication of the report, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales said that the Government intend to table amendments to the Care Standards Bill to establish a statutory independent children's commissioner for Wales. The amendments before us give fruit to that objective.

<P>
In his report, Sir Ronald made several recommendations. He said that the duties of the commissioner should be widespread because it is important to help to protect and develop children's rights. The report also makes it clear that, in Sir Ronald's view, a children's commissioner in Wales would ensure respect for children's rights through monitoring complaints, whistleblowing procedures and arrangements for children's advocacy. He emphasised strongly that the commissioner could examine the handling of cases brought to his or her attention, and made recommendations on merit, as necessary and appropriate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Will the Under-Secretary confirm that Sir Ronald's report did not recommend that the children's commissioner should deal only with children who are in care or being looked after?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Indeed. Sir Ronald said that he wanted a children's commissioner, and it is important that we deal with this point at an early stage. The Government want speedily to establish the post of children's commissioner for Wales. As I said, on 2 March-two weeks after the report was published-my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales, as part of our annual Welsh day debate, stated in the House that we would table an amendment to the Bill. Like the hon. Gentleman, I recognise that the Bill is limited in scope, but the amendments will establish the post of children's commissioner. We are having on-going discussions with our National Assembly colleagues about how, when and if we can make further proposals. We will look at them sympathetically and urgently, so that we can build on the established post and support the aspirations of the children's commissioner.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have intervened again because the Under-Secretary used the phrase ``how, when and if'', and I want to be clear about the ``if''. He need not quote what the Secretary of State for Wales said in March, because on 16 February, in answer to a question from my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition about the Waterhouse recommendations, the Prime Minister said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We shall implement the recommendations as soon as we possibly can.-[Official Report, 16 February 2000; Vol. 344, c. 941.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is therefore no ``if''-at least, not so far as the Prime Minister is concerned.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> To-hopefully-reassure the hon. Gentleman, we will look sympathetically and urgently at the matter. Indeed, we are discussing with the National Assembly the expansion of the role of children's commissioner. There are various issues to consider, and only recently has the Assembly concluded its analysis, in committee, of what it expects from the children's commissioner. We must look at the future legislative programme, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we have acted speedily. We could have waited, but on 2 March-within two weeks of the publication of Sir Ronald's report on 15 February-we announced that these amendments would be tabled.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I will raise the point later, but I should say now that both the Secretary of State for Health and the Secretary of State for Wales made it clear a long time ago that new clauses would be tabled. Therefore, why were they tabled as recently as last week? Twenty Government new clauses will be added to a Bill consisting of some 100 clauses. That is a substantial increase, and it has been presented to Committee members at a late stage in our proceedings.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being slightly churlish. As I said, on 2 March, within two weeks of the report's publication on 15 February, we said that we would table amendments. It is clear that, in government, tabling amendments takes time. They must be prepared and consultation must take place. They must be discussed with the National Assembly, and parliamentary counsel must then draft them. Given that we have tabled them in Committee, I hope that we can consider them, and others, today.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): If further discussions with the Assembly conclude that-as Waterhouse and others envisage-the commissioner should have greater powers and a wider role, will further primary legislation be required, or will the new clauses that we are discussing today provide sufficient powers?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The new clauses give powers to the National Assembly in relation to the scope of the Bill. The children's commissioner will therefore have powers in relation to a range of issues, including the regulation in Wales of services for children under the age of eight.

<P>
Further primary legislation will be necessary. That is why I and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales have undertaken regular and continuing discussions, in Government and with the National Assembly-especially its Health and Social Services Secretary, Jane Hutt-about proposals for future developments, which we shall consider sympathetically and urgently. I am not in a position to give firm commitments today, but we have acted swiftly in tabling the amendments.

<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): I was struck by the Under-Secretary's remark that the Bill is of limited scope. Surely the Government may have the width of scope that they wish. The Bill is full of enabling measures, and, given that the idea of a children's commissioner has been floated for a number of years, I do not understand why it could not have been included in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The Bill was initially introduced into the House of Lords prior to Sir Ronald's report, which was published on 15 February. Having looked at the report's recommendations, the Government determined to seek approval for announcing-as we did on 2 March-that we would table the amendments. As drafted, the Bill's long title does not provide sufficient flexibility for a wider amendment to cover the aspirations of the National Assembly for Wales. Furthermore, although the National Assembly has aspired to the post of a children's commissioner, it only recently completed its consideration in committee of the fine details of what it wants the commissioner to undertake.

<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government have acted speedily, within the scope of the Bill, to table the amendments. We are considering sympathetically and urgently the National Assembly's requests for further legislation, which we shall undertake at an opportunity that will shortly be forthcoming.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Can the Under-Secretary be more explicit, and explain to the Committee the nature of the legislative vehicle that is contemplated? Will he also tell us whether his Department tested the House authorities as to the scope of the Bill? Did it present new clauses and amendments that would extend its scope, which were rejected?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> On the first point, further primary legislation is required, and discussions are continuing to that end. As the hon. Gentleman knows, it would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt the content of a Queen's Speech either prior to or post the election.

<P>
On the second point, we have discussed the amendments with the House authorities. My understanding is that we have gone as far as we can within the scope of the Bill. The amendments were tabled at this stage partly because, as a Government, we have been keen to examine the opportunities in discussion with the National Assembly. I hope that members of the Committee accept that the Government are acting in good faith in bringing forward these proposals.

<P>
I have mentioned the initial duties that Sir Ronald believed that a children's commissioner could undertake in Wales. A further duty was the publishing of reports, including an annual report, to the National Assembly.

<P>
The amendments and new clauses put into effect Sir Ronald's recommendations regarding the children's commissioner, in so far as they can within the scope of the Bill. They do so for a range of children's services, not only those involving children looked after by local authorities, but those involving domiciliary care, private hospitals, clinics, day care, child-minding services and children living away from home.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I welcome everything that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has said so far. This is an historic day for children in Wales, and for children in general.

<P>
In my hon. Friend's discussions with the Welsh Assembly about the further scope of the children's commissioner, will he ensure that the position of children living away from home-children who are looked after by a local authority, and those living in residential schools-is given due regard? Those children are in an especially vulnerable position. It is essential that the role of the commissioner in Wales is accepted-and we also need a commissioner in England to extend that service to children here. Does my hon. Friend accept that particular attention needs to be paid to those groups of children?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his contribution. The National Assembly for Wales is keen to examine ways in which the role of the children's commissioner can be extended to cover a range of issues. It has recently completed its considerations, and raised a range of other issues that it wishes the House to consider when a suitable legislative opportunity arises. We are having discussions with the Assembly, and looking sympathetically at its proposals. I hope that we can continue to do so. It has made a fulsome approach, examined the issues carefully and undertaken widespread consultation. It has also engaged in discussions in committee on a range of issues, some of which will be given statutory backing by today's amendments. Other questions are still open to further discussion and consideration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Following the intervention of the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson), will the Under-Secretary make this matter absolutely clear? He seems to be saying something slightly different from that we have heard in the past.

<P>
On 17 March, the Minister of State for Health, the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>we will also use the Care Standards Bill to implement Sir Ronald Waterhouse's first recommendation, that an independent children's commissioner for looked-after children in Wales should be appointed.-[Official Report, 17 March 2000; Vol. 346, c. 629.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary confirm that that is an incorrect interpretation by his hon. Friend of Sir Ronald's recommendation? Will he also confirm that today's proposals are in contrast to Ministers' attempts over the past few months to argue that Sir Ronald's comments should be interpreted as applying only to looked after children?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to make difficulties where none exists. I have said clearly and concisely that the Government have acted on Sir Ronald's recommendations as quickly as we could, within the scope of legislation before the House. We have tabled amendments that give powers to the National Assembly to establish the post of children's commissioner. Obviously, there are areas in which the National Assembly wishes to go further, and Sir Ronald's comments could also be interpreted as wishing that. The Government are continuing to hold discussions with the National Assembly about how we can sympathetically and urgently introduce further proposals at a suitable opportunity to give additional powers to the Assembly. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question. There is no conflict between my hon. Friend the Minister and myself. We are at one in working together, as we have on the task force, to ensure that the Waterhouse report's recommendations are accepted and implemented.

<P>
The amendments will, in summary, establish the office of children's commissioner in Wales. They will also set out the commissioner's core functions in respect of children's services in Wales regulated by the Bill: the review and monitoring of arrangements for complaints, representation procedure, procedures for dealing with whistleblowing, and advocacy procedures effectively to safeguard and promote the rights and welfare of children.

<P>
The reforms will give the children's commissioner the power to examine individual cases involving children who receive the services that will be regulated by the Bill and to help a child to make a complaint about such a service. They will also give the commissioner the power to require the disclosure of information and explanations and assistance from prescribed persons, and they will ensure that he or she can make reports and recommendations, and do anything that he or she considers necessary, to expedite his or her functions. Our reforms also contain financial and audit arrangements for the office and the technical provisions that are necessary to establish the position.

<P>
In conclusion-

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Before the Under-Secretary begins his final comments, will he clarify a technical matter? What exactly is the scope of the regulated services that are referred to the new clauses? Will those provisions involve education, for example, or will they simply concern the social services functions that will be regulated by the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The answer involves the regulated services that fall within the Bill's scope. We are now on our 18th sitting, and we have spent the previous 17 sittings discussing the Bill's scope. In Wales, the services that will be provided by the children's commissioner will involve the regulated services that we have discussed, including the care commission responsibilities and provision for the regulation of services for under-eights. The provision relating to England involve the regulation of similar care standards services.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am driving at the fact that the Under-Secretary's latest comments suggest that-to move on to another topic-children who leave care would be outwith the scope of the commissioner. The definition that the Under-Secretary has just given of the commissioner's scope may be narrow-it appears, from the limited scope of services that will be covered by the Bill, to relate only to children who were fostered or who are in children's homes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> If I may help the hon. Gentleman, the full range of children's services in the Bill involves children who are looked after by authorities, and those in domiciliary care, private hospitals, clinics, day care or child-minding services, and those who live away from home in boarding schools. Our reforms will ensure that the children's commissioner will initially cover the services in the Bill.

<P>
I stress, for the benefit of Committee members-and Opposition Members in particular-that Sir Ronald Waterhouse's report was published on 15 February and that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales examined current legislative opportunities, in view of the commitments in last year's Queen's Speech. Following discussions between my right hon. Friend, the National Assembly and me, we established that it was possible to table the relevant amendments to this Bill. The National Assembly and others welcomed the fact that we can establish the post. When the Bill is agreed to, a children's commissioner will be established, and the scope of the Bill will be relevant. I emphasise again that we are discussing how to progress the matter sympathetically and urgently if a suitable opportunity arises.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am sure that the Under-Secretary feels that this matter is being laboured but, last Tuesday, the Minister for Employment and Equal Opportunities, the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge), was asked explicitly whether child minding would be covered by a commissioner in Wales. She said no. Her precise words are recorded clearly in Hansard. Was the Minister correct in saying that to the Committee last Tuesday, or will the commissioner in Wales cover child minding and child care? It is not clear from the amendments whether it is counted as a regulated service.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I will certainly discuss my hon. Friend's comments with her. I am not sure that I was present when she made them. I can say categorically that child minding in Wales is covered. I hope that that clarifies the issue for the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
I know that many hon. Members wish to speak, and we want to hear the comments on Opposition amendments, so I shall conclude. The National Assembly for Wales has worked well. This is an early example of how Parliament and the Assembly can work in partnership on legislation. It is a test of how the devolution settlement will work. It has been interesting and exciting to listen to and work with colleagues in the National Assembly in the development of policy and to see how the Government can respond with legislation to give effect to that policy. We have agreed a position on the Bill, and to consider sympathetically and urgently any further representations from the National Assembly when suitable opportunities for legislation arise.

<P>
That has been a positive experience. I pay tribute not only to National Assembly officials but to Jane Hutt, the Health and Social Services Secretary, and the members of the Health and Social Services Committee, who scrutinised the issue and helped with the development of policy. I also pay tribute to the many voluntary agencies that have participated in the consultation process, putting forward their own suggestions as a contribution to the debate. This morning, Catriona Williams of Children in Wales said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Children in Wales welcomes today's amendment to the Care Standards Bill to establish a statutory children's commissioner for Wales, the first in the UK. We have campaigned for ten years for this and are delighted that the UK Government has acted to implement the recommendations-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in conjunction with-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the National Assembly for Wales.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Today we have an opportunity to break new ground in the establishment of safeguards. We have kept to the spirit of Sir Ronald's report and we have worked on the amendments with my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Health, and the task force. We have also worked in partnership with the National Assembly. I commend the amendments to the Committee, and I may speak later on a couple of amendments relating to specific Welsh matters. My hon. Friend the Minister of State will consider the debate in his concluding remarks.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we embark on the debate, I would remind the Committee of a ruling that I gave when we began our work, when the world was a much younger place. On advice, I told the Committee that the question of the scope of a commissioner, other than for children in care, was outside the Bill. That being so, I shall rule out of order any attempts to widen the debate to include issues that are beyond the scope of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> This morning, we have heard the Under-Secretary announce, with a great fanfare, the insertion of the provision to create the children's commissioner for Wales. We must now consider what the provision will mean in practice and ask ourselves whether it justifies the fanfare. If so, we need to know how it goes beyond the Bill's existing provisions in respect of England.

<P>
I have no problem with Governments improving their Bills as they listen to what is said on Second Reading and in Standing Committee, but this Government have tabled hundreds of amendments, including 20 new clauses, to a Bill of 100 clauses. Most of those new clauses are much longer than many of the original clauses. The Bill has been lengthened by some 20 to 25 per cent. in the course of the Committee's deliberations. Thirty-seven Government amendments were tabled on Friday.

<P>
As members of the Committee, we are entitled to ask why the Government thought it necessary to pull the melodramatic stunt of tabling this bunch of new clauses and amendments right at the end of the Committee's proceedings. As a result, they have had to be referred to obliquely throughout our deliberations, with veiled implications about what they would contain.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Given the comments that Ministers-and the Prime Minister himself-have made in the House, many of us expected that the Under-Secretary would, at the end of the Committee's proceedings or on Report, present a dramatic proposal that extended the scope of the children's commissioner in Wales beyond dealing merely with children who are looked after. Indeed, when I was told that the Government had tabled a raft of new clauses on the children's commissioner in Wales, I assumed that that was what had happened. It was only when I read the new clauses that I discovered the relatively limited scope of the Government's proposals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman discussed the matter with his colleagues in the National Assembly? The Assembly has given cross-party support to accepting and agreeing with the measures; that includes the Conservative party. Is not he trying to throw cold water on this positive statement by the Government?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I can satisfy the Under-Secretary's curiosity. I have discussed the proposals with David Melding, who confirmed that the Conservative group in the National Assembly recognises them as a first step. He also said that the cross-party aspirations in the Assembly that he described when I met him a few weeks ago remain cross-party aspirations.

<P>
The Under-Secretary referred to legislative opportunities that will arise shortly to expand the role of the commissioner in Wales. We are not, of course, privy to what those opportunities may be, but he is perhaps a tad optimistic in expecting that more parliamentary time will be available during the next Session for the extension of a measure that was introduced in this one. I am not sure how Government business managers will react to that.

<P>
The large group of amendments and new clauses seeks to address two substantive issues: first, the extent of the role of the children's commissioner-or, in England, the children's rights director-and, secondly, the discrepancy between what is intended for England and for Wales. I want to go back a step to the position before the Under-Secretary tabled the new clauses. The Bill provides for a children's rights director to be appointed for England. My understanding of the role of the children's rights director-I stand to be corrected by the Under-Secretary if I am wrong-is that it is more or less in line with the role that the new clauses give to the children's commissioner in Wales, which is in relation to regulated children's services: children looked after, children in care and children who are the responsibility of the statutory authorities.

<P>
The Under-Secretary pulled a face when I used the term ``stunt'' earlier. However, one is bound to ask why, if it was possible to include in the Bill a provision that gives effect to the same measure in England, it was necessary to propose a different title and table a raft of new clauses at the last minute in respect of Wales. If I have got that wrong, and if the children's commissioner in Wales is to have significantly different and wider powers than the children's rights director appointed by the National Care Standards Commission in England, I should be grateful for clarification as to the nature of those wider powers. Will the Under-Secretary also explain why it was not appropriate or possible to include in the original drafting of the Bill proposals giving effect to such a relatively modest measure, which in broad functional terms mirrors the role of the children's rights director in England?

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I am unsure about the hon. Gentleman's line of argument. Is he working on the basis that he supports the idea of an independent children's rights commissioner as proposed in the Children's Rights Commissioner Bill that I presented in the House on 3 May?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Let me clarify the matter for the hon. Gentleman. We believe that there is a role for a children's commissioner who has a function in relation to children looked after by statutory services, but who should also have a wider function in relation to the work affecting children that the Government carry out across all Departments.

<P>
If one approaches the question from a point of view of philosophical first principles, children-almost uniquely in society-form a group that is not enabled to take part in the democratic process. We make legislation and regulations that affect them, both directly-in terms of provisions dealing with children-and indirectly, through the way in which we legislate to support the family. It is, therefore, appropriate that an independent person has the remit to examine legislative proposals, across the range of Departments, and to represent the interests of the children who will be affected by them. In that way, those interests will properly be taken into account in the workings of government and the legislative process.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> May I again help the hon. Gentleman by explaining why the amendments have been tabled at this late stage? He asked why we had not included the provisions in the Bill. The Bill was published on 2 December 1999. Sir Ronald's report was published on 15 February 2000. The Secretary of State for Wales announced his intention to table amendments to the Bill on 2 March. Had we incorporated the proposals into the Bill, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would have asked us why we had pre-empted the Waterhouse committee's recommendations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I do not have the dates in front of me.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> That is what they are.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I accept the dates that the Under-Secretary read out. I do not have all the dates in front of me, but I suspect that the Bill might still have been under deliberation in the House of Lords at that time. Why was it not possible to table this quite complex-by anyone's standards-raft of new clauses amendments earlier? One can only conclude that not doing so is a function of the information and news management exercise that we know goes on. The Under-Secretary shakes his head, but it will not have escaped the notice of hon. Members that we are in a different Committee Room today from the one that we have inhabited for the past 17 sittings. It will not have escaped the Under-Secretary's notice that, by making the announcement in this way, he has generated a certain amount of media attention in Wales. I do not suppose that he is disappointed by that.

<P>
To go back to the substance of the question, will the Under-Secretary explain what is different in functional terms about the provision for a children's commissioner for Wales as it will now appear in the Bill-assuming that the amendments and new clauses are accepted-from the provision for a children's rights director in England already in the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Before the previous intervention, the hon. Gentleman was describing from first principles the position that he and his party now take in relation to a commissioner for children's rights. Indeed, the Conservative Government deserved credit for signing up to the United Nations convention on the rights of the child in 1989. Given that they did so, why did they do nothing to implement such a proposal during the remainder of their time in office?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a question about our position now, and about the point that I am trying to make. He also asked a legitimate question about our views on the scope of a children's commissioner. I say openly that our children's commissioner would not go as far as he would like. I make no bones about that, and perhaps I will be able to discuss my concerns with him in due course. He might find that some of his right hon. and hon. Friends in the Government would also be concerned about going as far as he would like. Nevertheless, there is a significant role for the children's commissioner beyond that outlined by the Under-Secretary this morning. Immediate benefit could be derived by appointing someone to walk the corridors of power and exercise a cross-departmental role, ensuring that children's interests are taken properly into account when drafting legislation, whether primary or secondary.

<P>
The Children Act 1989, which looked at the world from the child's point of view, was a big step forward. However, even today, far too much legislation and regulation, particularly in relation to support for the family, fails properly to take into account the impact on the interests of children.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making himself clear, although I am sorry that his response to what is a genuinely positive move for children has been so churlish. Would the commissioner post that he proposes replace the post of children's rights director that the Bill will establish?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> We have tabled new clauses that are neither comprehensive nor perfectly drafted, but designed simply to secure today's debate. However, the hon. Gentleman will know that we have also tabled an amendment that would delete the role of children's rights director and establish separate English and Welsh children's commissioners on an equivalent basis. I shall discuss that amendment and the new clauses in a moment.

<P>
The first question is: where are the Government on the route that they have mapped out? The Under-Secretary will correct me if I am wrong, but as I understand it the Government are committed-not in explicit terms, but the matter is becoming clearer-to going further in relation to Wales, albeit with the parenthetic qualification ``as and when legislative time permits''. That may or may not deliver legislation quickly. The children's commissioner for Wales, which constitutes a relatively limited step, will have powers broadly similar to the children's rights director for England, but the Government are willing to go further, in accordance with the Welsh Assembly's wishes.

<P>
In England, the Government prefer the model of the children's rights director-an official with rather less clout than even the children's commissioner for Wales. Under the new clauses, he or she will simply be an employee of the National Care Standards Commission. The Government appear to think it inappropriate to go further with the expansion of the role in England. Again, if I have misrepresented the Government's position, I look forward to clarification from the Under-Secretary. However, to judge by the current track record, the main objective seems not clarification but obfuscation. As I have mentioned, the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness said that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>we will  use the Care Standards Bill to implement Sir Ronald Waterhouse's first recommendation, that an independent children's commissioner for looked-after children in Wales should be appointed.-[Official Report, 17 March 2000; Vol. 346, c. 629.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That has always been the crunch point for the Government: is it about looked after children or is there a wider remit? To some extent, it is an argument between the Government and the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre and some of his colleagues. I have no doubt that more will be said about that. I know that the hon. Gentleman is sensitive about having anyone jump on his bandwagon, so I assure him that I am not seeking to do so. Our vision of what a children's commissioner should be does not go as far as the vision that he has rolled out. It goes further, however, than that which the Government seem willing to accept.

<P>
My analysis is that the children's commissioner for Wales will have much the same function as the children's rights director for England, but that the office of commissioner will be independent and, perhaps, will have greater moral authority than that of the children's rights director, who will be an employee. If that is correct, what is the justification for having different structures for England and Wales? It would be logical to have similar architecture to achieve similar purposes. Thus, if the office were expanded in Wales, the route to expand it in England would also be clear, if Parliament so wished.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to have a problem with devolution. In Wales, following discussions between the National Assembly, representing the people there, and the Government, a particular route has been chosen. We have been able to give effect to that: that is devolution.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I will engage the Under-Secretary on that point, if he does not mind. Is it a different route, or a different name? Members of the Committee have heard that the office of children's commissioner for Wales is broadly similar to that of children's rights director. Why do we need two structures? Why is it right to have an independent children's commissioner in Wales, but wrong to have one in England? Why, when the children's rights director in England is an employee, is it wrong that that role should be performed in Wales by the same kind of person? What is the difference between children in Wales and children in England? If children in Wales need a certain level of protection, delivered in a particular way, why should it not be delivered in the same independent way in England? It is an essential issue, and the Government's amendments do not address it.

<P>
When the Under-Secretary winds up the debate, he should make it clear why it is not appropriate to have an independent children's commissioner for England, albeit with, in the first instance, the limited powers that the Under-Secretary has said will be available to the children's commissioner for Wales. That is what we propose in new clauses 41 to 43 and new schedule 2. The expansion of the commissioner's powers-in England and Wales-is something that can be considered at a later stage. The Under-Secretary talks about devolution, but it will be this Parliament that will decide. There will have to be primary legislation, passed by this Parliament.

<P>
As they consider such legislation, Members of Parliament who do not represent Welsh constituencies-the vast majority-may well ask themselves whether the expansion of the commissioner's role in Wales should not also be carried out in England. Why do it in Wales, but not in England? The emotional argument is that Waterhouse reported on events that took place in Wales. However, it is common currency that the fact that those terrible events took place in Wales is mere coincidence; they could have happened anywhere in the United Kingdom. For all that we know-the odds, I am afraid to say, support this view-they probably have taken place in England and Scotland. The matter came to light and was fully investigated only in Wales. The report of that investigation stimulated the approach that we are currently discussing.

<P>
When the Minister replies, I hope that he will suggest that there is something behind the noise that has been made about the introduction of the new clauses, which will apply to Wales. The Government should do more than simply replicate the role of the children's rights director. What is the road ahead in England for the children's rights director or, if new clauses 41 to 43 and new schedule 2 are agreed to, for the children's commissioner for England? If the Government explained that, it would give us an idea of the differences that they perceive between the needs of England and Wales. We need to be given an idea of what the future holds for both countries.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I shall speak to the Government new clauses and Government amendments, and to the Liberal Democrat amendments.

<P>
I should start by disposing of the amendments that we tabled some time ago, which sought to amend the title of rights director to commissioner. We have moved on since those amendments were tabled. Although they are still on the amendment paper, they are not the principle vehicle for a debate on the matter. We tabled them simply to explore whether the difference between Wales and England was one of titles or of substance and powers. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge explored that difference.

<P>
The Government new clauses and Government amendments make it clear that a difference of substance, which includes the relevant powers, is involved. There may not be as much difference as had been supposed but, without straying too far, the Government's approach does not go as far as we wanted. Nevertheless, the provisions are welcome and represent a step in the right direction. The difference is that there is a clearly defined independent position, although it is grounded on a narrow base because it deals solely with regulated children. That is the central weakness of the proposition. Having established the principle in Wales, it is that much easier to move on to the next stage, although I share the scepticism of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, who wondered whether the Government would find legislative time in the next or in any subsequent Session to give the Welsh Assembly the necessary additional powers to widen the remit further. A one-off opportunity is being missed.

<P>
I wish that the Government had sought further advice from the Parliamentary Counsel Office about how the legislation's scope could have been widened. Appropriate amendments could have established enabling powers, although the Government would not necessarily take them-when the post has been bedded down, the Government and the Assembly would have had the flexibility to give it the wider remit that many people in Wales, England and Scotland want such posts to have.

<P>
I have no problem with devolution, which is often offered up as a shield against criticisms of proposals that are not English. Different solutions in different places may be needed to meet local needs. In this context, however, the need is the same on either side of the border between England and Wales or between England and Scotland. We need a body-an independent person or institution-that can properly stand up for and advocate on behalf of the rights of all children, not simply those who will be the subject of the provisions that we are considering.

<P>
In the foreword to a report called ``Taking Children Seriously'', which was published earlier this year, Sir William Utting put it this way:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We lack an independent office mandated to protect the interests of children in general on all matters of public policy and administration that affect their lives.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is absolutely right. Sir William Utting is a gentleman who should be-and, I am sure, is-listened to by Ministers and others forming policy in this area.

<P>
The mandate that the Government have given the children's commissioner in Wales is narrow and constrained. Their writ will run as far only as children's homes, adoption and foster care and boarding schools and colleges. It was not even certain that it would cover child minding and day care-I welcome the Under-Secretary's assurances on that. The commissioner will not have a role in relation to the vast bulk of children who are outside the care system. That is wrong.

<P>
The catalyst for the amendments is the Waterhouse report, which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is currently looking through. That report contains a significant set of recommendations that needed to be acted on. However, it is not the only basis on which action to develop a children's commissioner should be taken. In 1989, the United Kingdom signed up to the United Nations convention on the rights of the child. That would be a good platform on which to build legislation and to construct the role of a commissioner.

<P>
The proposed role of the commissioner is similar to that of an ombudsman, in that he or she will be concerned with receiving complaints. The commissioner will deal only with matters that fall within the scope of this tightly defined Bill. That means, for example, that he can have a role in influencing policy makers and practitioners within the narrow confines of the Bill, but cannot go beyond it. He can promote compliance with minimum standards in the context of the Bill, but cannot go beyond it. He can promote respect for children's views, or promote children's knowledge and rights, but only in relation to those children who are covered by the Bill. All that the Bill offers in the way of additional powers is the ability of the commissioner to exercise the functions of a court in summoning people and placing them under oath, and applying the necessary contempt of court sanctions that the courts can administer if they do not comply with that. Although those extra powers are welcome, and differ from those granted to the director in England, I should have liked to have seen some with greater scope.

<P>
On Second Reading, it was suggested that the commissioner's powers would be extended later, and today we heard the Under-Secretary do his best to assure his colleagues that later will be sooner. However, many people outside the Committee would ask whether the Government are likely ever to use Government time to introduce the necessary extra powers of the kind proposed by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre in his ten-minute Bill earlier this year.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman may have noticed that new clause 38(2) prevents the commissioner from exercising

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any function which by virtue of an enactment is also exercisable by a prescribed person.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could greatly constrain the scope of his role, because most of the matters that he will want to look at are already, by definition, the responsibility of somebody else, who may not be doing his job properly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> That is an interesting point. The commissioner will have to employ tact and diplomacy in broadening out and using the powers that they are given, and will need to be creative and constructive in working with others who are prescribed under the new clause. New clause 34(4) makes it clear that the power to confer further functions is also constrained-necessarily so, because otherwise it would have fallen foul of the rulings about matters that are and are not within the scope of the long title of the Bill. That is a pity. Unless further amendments are tabled, additional primary legislation will be required if wider powers are to be given to this body.

<P>
The amendments tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) seek to pursue a different route to the same destination-at least, I thought that it was the same destination as that outlined by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. However, having listened to some of his comments, it appears increasingly that the Conservative position is to take on board that now being adopted in Wales and to change the title of the post holder in England. The hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest that the two posts should be equivalent but that we should not go further and cover all children. I should be interested to hear his comments on that.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity to clarify the matter.

<P>
We are seeking to create an equal platform in England and Wales. I have already mapped out, in response to a question from the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre, the role that we believe the children's commissioner should play. Its scope should be wider than that proposed by the Government, but not as wide as that proposed by the private Member's Bill introduced by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> That clarification is helpful. There are differences of opinion across the Committee, and also on the Opposition Benches, as to how to approach the question. It is welcome that the hon. Gentleman has embraced the idea of a commissioner. That represents a move since the previous Conservative Administration, but it is a great pity that they have not travelled all the way to the all-encompassing position that some of us would like to see.

<P>
We believe that there should be an equivalence between the positions in England and Wales. There is a strong case for saying that there should be a stand-alone, independent person in England, with the same powers as the High Court to gain access to people and papers, to place people under oath and to carry out the kind of inquiry work envisaged in Wales. We do not understand why, in this sensitive and narrow area relating to looked after children and children in care, the Government have not embraced the opportunity to adopt the good work that the Welsh Assembly have carried out in developing and refining policy on this matter, so that the provisions could be embraced by English Ministers dealing solely with English cases. England and Wales are comparable, and the Government should introduce a measure of that kind.

<P>
As the Bill stands, the director in England will be a member of the staff of the National Care Standards Commission, whose role has yet to be fleshed out. Ministers will have the power to prescribe and define that role, and I hope that, in responding to this debate, the Minister will be able to put a little more flesh on the bones, so that we can better discern how different the two roles will be. It would be helpful to many people in England to understand that better.

<P>
Members of the Committee will know that there is already a Bill before the House, introduced by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre, which would have created a fully fledged commission. That Bill was introduced under the ten-minute rule, and I was pleased and proud to have the opportunity to support it. The hon. Gentleman was right, in speaking to that Bill, to make it clear that it was important not to confuse that commissioner's position with the position of the children's rights director in England. They will not be the same entity; their scope and powers will be very different. It is important to reiterate that point today.

<P>
In 1998, the Health Committee recommended that there should be a commissioner for all children. That recommendation was made on an all-party basis, and is one to which the Government should respond. Such a measure would have wide support. I shall not be so churlish as to suggest that the Government's amendments are unwelcome. However, I regret that English Ministers, who will deal solely with English cases, have not sought to learn from Wales and to apply the lessons to our situation as well. That would have been most wlecome.

<P>
I shall end by quoting again Sir William Utting. He said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Children need a strong, independent national office to represent their interests comprehensively and to ensure that public and private agencies deliver what law and public policy require.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is required not only in Wales, but in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and the Bill should have been used to achieve that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> It is a pleasure to speak in this morning's debate.

<P>
It is right that the establishment of a children's rights commissioner for England, with linked offices in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, should not be discussed today. It does not form part of the Bill, which is concerned with improvements in registration and inspection, and the quality of care services in general. However, it has been implicitly acknowledged that a fully fledged children's right commissioner, who would be independent and advocate on children's behalf, would attend to the needs of all children in the United Kingdom. The office of commissioner would involve crucial concepts such as citizenship, and develop participation of children who are denied a voice in democratic structures.

<P>
Although that concept is not for discussion today, it has wide support among members of all parties and was supported by the Health Committee. The Bill has enjoyed the support of Back Benchers from all parties for a long time, and although it is not my bandwagon, I welcome the support of anyone who believes in this principle. The day will soon come when discrete legislation will establish a children's rights commissioner for England with linked offices. A Government who have shown a profound commitment to children and human rights, and established the independent Disability Rights Commission, will recognise the logic of those achievements and quickly bring forward relevant discrete primary legislation.

<P>
Today, we are discussing the Care Standards Bill and the children's rights director in particular. It is a shame that the importance of that office has been overlooked not only by those who want to develop the argument for an independent children's rights commissioner, but others who want to cloud the issue and undermine this major achievement for children. It is crucial that we have a children's rights director with responsibility for looked after children and children who live away from home. They are some of the most vulnerable children in our society. Because they are separated from their families and live in institutions that attend to all their needs, they are particularly vulnerable. The Bill, the establishment of the National Care Standards Commission, the funding and development of Voice, funding for local authority care services through the quality protects programme, and the establishment of a children's rights director constitute a coherent system that will vastly improve care for young people, whether residential or foster. However, that system needs enormous improvement.

<P>
When the Government came to power, the care system was in a parlous state. The children's rights director is a crucial part of our response, which will improve the care system. He will advance the cause of children through the National Commission for Care Standards, and he should be in constant touch with the relevant bodies and have a national voice. Crucially, he will also have oversight of all inspections of fostering agencies and children's residential care arrangements. He should have excellent contact with advocacy organisations for children and with children's rights officers and children's advocates in local authorities and voluntary organisations.

<P>
One element that is missing from that arrangement is the statutory right for all looked after children to have access to advocacy-we may discuss that later. The children's rights director is of fundamental importance-his role should not be ignored or abolished in the quest for a properly constituted basis for the position.

<P>
Conservative Members clouded some of the relevant issues in their quest for an arrangement that is different from that which was espoused by the many supporters of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, who wrote in their thousands to hon. Members.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman, who has talked about children's rights commissioners and children's rights directors. He accused me of clouding the issue. Does he find any significance in the fact that the children's rights director is so named but that the children's commissioner for Wales does not have the word ``rights'' in his title?

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Children's rights director is an excellent title. I congratulate the Government on that. It is important for children's rights to have such a focus.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> What about Wales?

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> To be honest, the title for Wales reflects the recommendation of the Waterhouse report. The word ``rights'' is important in the title of the commissioner for children's rights. That is one way in which the Opposition's idea of the office fails completely. Opposition Members made it clear on Second Reading that they do not think that the office should relate to all children-the line was drawn at children who were cared for in families. The fully fledged children's rights commissioner should work on behalf of all the 13.2 million children in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> We draw a distinction between the commissioner's role in the abstract, which involves promoting the rights and welfare of children in the governmental process in which they have no other representation, and his role in individual cases. We differ over how wide the remit should be in that context. There is no ambiguity in our position-we see a wide role for a children's commissioner that relates to the interests of all children and represents their views in the legislative and governmental process.
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I am still a little unsure about what the hon. Gentleman is trying to argue. The work of organisations such as Childline has shown that children in all circumstances have a need for advocacy and avenues by means of which their complaints can be investigated.

<P>
That is all that I wanted to say. The issue of how we deal with looked after children and children living away from home is crucial. The appointment of a children's commissioner for Wales will be a proper response to Waterhouse, and the way in which the post will, I hope, be developed-through discussion with the National Assembly-offers a perfect example of how devolution can work in the interests of citizens. I look forward to the day when the Government will bring forward a fully-fledged Bill for an independent children's rights commissioner for England, with linked offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman invited me to clarify how wide the Opposition thought the remit of a children's commissioner should be. We saw the remit as extending to all children, in the context of the legislative and governmental processes. The hon. Gentleman should invite the Minister of State to clarify how far the Government are prepared to go. He is implicitly chastising me for not going further, but the position of the Government is that the role of the children's rights director in England relates solely to looked after children.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I made the position clear at the start of the debate. I have endeavoured to accommodate hon. Members, because of the considerable degree of interest in the broader aspects of the subject. However, the Bill's remit-to use a word that has been used on a couple of occasions-is clear: it deals with children in care. That is the matter under discussion, and that is the issue to which the Minister will, in a few moments, respond.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I have no intention of chastising my hon. Friend the Minister. This is a day for praise. I hope that I have made clear the absolute importance of the children's rights director. We have made major gains with the creation of a children's rights director, and the children's commissioner for Wales will serve as an excellent illustration of how devolution can work in the interests of children. I look forward to further primary legislation from the Government, who have shown themselves to be committed to children's rights, including good quality care and independent advocacy.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton) We have enjoyed the benefit of a wide-ranging debate about the merits of the Government's approach to the improvement of safeguards and of the alternative models put forward by the Opposition parties. I shall highlight some of the areas in which there is a difference of approach between the Government and the Opposition, but we should also note those areas in which there is agreement.</B><P>

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked where we were on the road to increasing protection for children. We are much further down that road than we were in 1997. I am prepared to accept that the Conservative party has a strong interest in the issue, and the hon. Gentleman has given his support to many of the measures that we have taken. We welcome that support; as we have said repeatedly, such issues should be cross-party issues. Nothing is more fundamentally important, for all of us, than ensuring that children grow up safely, well and free from the risk of abuse, whether physical or sexual. That unites us as human beings and has always, in my experience, been a strong feature of our debates in this place.

<P>
Most of the party disagreements such as those that have arisen today have concerned technical, not substantive, matters. The hon. Gentleman probed us about the exact difference between the children's commissioner in Wales and the children's rights director in England. Specifically, he asked why the children's commissioner in Wales has been set up independently, whereas the children's rights director in England will be an employee of the National Care Standards Commission.

<P>
The answer to questions that reach that level of technical detail can generally be found in the background and origin of the relevant policy. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, Sir Ronald Waterhouse recommended in his report, ``Lost in Care'', that the children's commissioner in Wales should be independent. As we have debated at length, the Assembly will have the function in Wales that the National Care Standards Commission will have in England. We accept Sir Ronald's recommendation that the commissioner should be independent, and the only way to do that is to set up an independent post that is separate from the Assembly. That is the road that we have taken, which is why there is a difference, in legal structure, between the establishment of the post of children's commissioner for Wales and that of children's rights director in England.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I accept that Sir Ronald recommended an independent children's commissioner in Wales. However, does not the Minister think that if the investigation had related to events in England, it is likely that he would have recommended an independent children's commissioner in England? It is somewhat disingenuous to say that because Sir Ronald's recommendation was limited to dealing with the particular case in Wales we should not extrapolate his conclusions to England.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I would not want to speculate on what Sir Ronald might have said if the inquiry had concentrated on matters in England. The point that I am trying to make is that the post has to be established in this way in Wales to satisfy the requirements of independence. In England, the children's rights director will satisfy those requirements because the National Care Standards Commission will, as a non-departmental public body, be independent of Government. There is therefore no question but that the children's rights director in England will be able to function as an independent officer of the commission, thereby satisfying the requirements of independence.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> As I understand it, the commission is not independent, because it is required to act in accordance with directions in writing from the Secretary of State. That is not my understanding of the word ``independence.''

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We had that argument on a previous occasion. I cannot remember-I am sure that you can, Mr. Gale-whether it was during the first, second, third or fourth sitting.

<P>
I am satisfied that the commission will operate as an independent body, and I hope that I have persuaded at least my hon. Friends of that. When we debated the need for the Secretary of State to be able to issue directions where appropriate, we made it clear that the Government would not intervene routinely, or daily, in the functions of the commission. It will be an independent body that reports to the House and to the Secretary of State in accordance with the Bill.

<P>
In essence, today's argument has largely concerned the differences between the establishment of the children's commissioner for Wales and that of the equivalent position for England-the children's rights director of the National Care Standards Commission. I shall not respond to the points on Opposition amendments that have been raised purely on technical or drafting issues. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge thought that his amendment was clear, but it remains unclear to me whether it would cover the group of children that he identified.

<P>
Some misunderstanding has arisen-I accept that it might partly be my fault-about the precise range of responsibilities of the children's rights director in England. Some members of the Committee implied that his remit will cover only looked after children in the care of local authorities. That is not so, as should be clear from the Bill. The director's remit will cover the full range of regulated services that are the responsibility, under the Bill, of the National Care Standards Commission-including primary health care services, domiciliary care services provided to children who are not in the care of local authorities, and residential boarding schools and colleges.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Will the Minister confirm that the director's remit will not cover those services to be regulated by Ofsted? Secondly, what powers will the children's rights director have to blow the whistle and be a detective if he or she chooses?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right that the children's director in England will not have a competence in relation to under-eight provision. There is a reasonable explanation for that. It is not the case that we see no need for proper inspection arrangements for under-eight provision. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) dealt substantially with the Government's argument behind that part of the Bill when we debated those provisions last week. However, given that the children's rights director in England will be an officer of the National Care Standards Commission, it seems appropriate that he or she should focus his or her attention on matters that are the responsibility of the commission, and not those that are the responsibility of other regulatory bodies.

<P>
On the hon. Gentleman's question about whistleblowing and the complaints procedure generally, yes, we do envisage the children's rights director having the opportunity and the ability to take up such cases-individual cases, if appropriate-as are brought to his or her attention by individual children. That is an entirely appropriate function. He or she will also be able to exercise important functions in relation to whistleblowing. He or she will have the protection that will accompany the publication of reports by the National Care Standards Commission, with which we have dealt in another part of the Bill. The reports will attract qualified privilege, and I am sure that that will give the children's rights director the ability to say precisely what needs to be said-for example, when completing a section of the annual report-about the state of play of children's rights for which he or she has responsibility.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre said that the appointment of a children's rights director in England was an important one. The same applies-with knobs on-to the children's commissioner for Wales. I hope that such a phrase is technically in order, Mr. Gale. I would not wish to run into any difficulties as a result of using it. These are breakthrough appointments. I feel a certain frustration that we have ended up talking about job titles. That completely misses the point. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, for example, would both establish the position of a children's rights commissioner in England and leave the children's rights director in the Bill. That would not be a sensible way of going about the matter. The amendments tabled by Conservative Members would not have that effect, but the hon. Gentleman's certainly would.

<P>
In focusing on the title of the person, hon. Members completely miss the point. The essential point involves the functions that that person is to have. The Government see this person as a champion for children-someone who can provide a national oversight and perspective on the state of play of children's rights for the first time in England, just as the commissioner will in Wales. That is a hugely important first step.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre speaks with great authority and credibility on these issues, and I want to reassure him that we made it clear in our response to Sir Ronald Waterhouse's report that establishing a children's rights director was the right direction to take in England, for now, but that we would keep the issue under review. Many significant institutions and individuals have strongly argued the case for a children's commissioner. It is our responsibility to listen carefully to those arguments, and we are doing so.

<P>
We have set out our position on the question repeatedly, both in debates in the House and, most recently, in our response to Sir Ronald Waterhouse's report. Our approach couples a record new investment in children's services with this Bill and other legislation that we shall debate in Committee shortly. Those measures, in conjunction with the establishment of a children's rights director, provide a powerful new set of arrangements, structures and legal powers, which will advance much more proactively the interests of children, especially vulnerable children in our society.

<P>
Politics is the language of priorities; it always has been and always will be. Our priority is to establish better services for vulnerable children, focusing the available investment on those areas. That is the approach that we have adopted in England, and that is why we have come to the conclusion that the right way to proceed is to set up the commission, with a children's rights director, and to make long-term investments in improving the quality of children's services. In that way, we can hold out the prospect of significant advances in both the protection that we provide for children and the safeguards for their long-term interests.

<P>
I have tried to address some of the concerns that Opposition Members have expressed about this large group of amendments. Although the amendments present enormous technical difficulties, I am not asking my hon. Friends to reject them for that reason. Of course, we are serious about promoting children's rights-we have expended a huge amount of effort in trying to do so-but the important question is the immediate priorities. What are they, and how should we pursue them? What legal institutions and arrangements will best give effect to a decision on priorities?

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
I can reassure my hon. Friends that I am entirely confident that the provisions in this part of the Bill will provide an important opportunity to advance children's rights in the way that we all want to see. I have absolutely no qualms about advising my hon. Friends to support the Government's amendments, both in relation to Wales and the provisions in the Bill. I firmly believe that they constitute the right way to proceed at the moment. Clearly, the National Assembly may adopt a different approach in Wales from that adopted by the Government in England. However, no one should be concerned about such a difference-it is a celebration of diversity between our two nations, and we have no problem with that.

<P>
We are legislating to give effect to the National Assembly's cross-party agreement to establish a new office holder in Wales. That is an important demonstration of our commitment to devolution and ensuring that the National Assembly can do its job properly. There will be differences, but they should not mask the substantial progress that we are making. Different approaches in Wales and England are perfectly logical and can be explained by the background to these issues, the recommendations of Sir Ronald Waterhouse and the attitude of my party in Wales to its manifesto commitment to establish a children's commissioner.

<P>
The differences that have come to light in today's debate are technical and procedural, rather than substantive. I am pleased to say that the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam and for Runnymede and Weybridge were largely supportive of the Government's approach, and felt that the children's commissioner for Wales and the children's rights director for England were broadly equivalent posts. The differences that both hon. Gentlemen have highlighted do not detract from the broadly consistent approach that we are taking, and our shared desire to further the interests of children.

<P>
I thank those Opposition Members who have spoken, and in particular I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre for supporting the measures that we have outlined. I hope that Committee members will accept our amendments and reject those tabled by the Opposition.

<P>

<B>Mrs Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I do not want to detain Committee members unduly on this point, but it is very important. I should begin by apologising for missing the commencement of this morning's proceedings-I was attending the debate on Down's syndrome in Westminster Hall. I am reliably informed by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that the question that I want to ask has not already been discussed, so I hope that it will not prove superfluous to the debate.

<P>
I have listened carefully to the Minister, but I am not sure that he is right to say that we are debating a technicality, because there is the substantive point about independence. In effect, two models will be tested simultaneously in different parts of the United Kingdom, and in the long term the Government might decide in favour of one or the other. The Minister said that, as far as he is concerned, that is the right way to proceed for the moment, and I understand that. Where two slightly different models are in operation, one would want to see which works best. However, the Minister will understand that our thinking was heavily influenced by the deliberations of the Waterhouse inquiry. The inquiry took a long time, and we should be under no illusion that some of the problems that manifested themselves in Wales still, regrettably, manifest themselves in other parts of the United Kingdom. The solution proposed by the inquiry would have considerable merit for other parts of the United Kingdom.

<P>
My specific question is about independence, and it is more than a technicality. It arises from the helpful explanatory notes given to us by the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. The supplementary information was useful to us in our examination of the large number of new clauses that were introduced at relatively short notice. We understand what the first part of the explanatory note about new clause 38 means. Subsection (1) will restrict the commissioner's ability to

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>enquire into, or report on any matter that has been subject to legal proceedings.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is self-explanatory.

<P>
Subsection (2), however, precludes the commissioner from exercising any function that, under statute, is exercisable by another individual or body, if regulations so provide. The independence of the commissioner is, to some extent, compromised by that. The regulations, drawn up, I assume, by the Secretary of State, could restrict the powers of the commissioner. Will the Minister of State or the Under-Secretary comment on the type of regulations that could be drawn up? The commissioner's apparent independence is being chipped away by regulations that place restrictions on the functions that the commissioner would, otherwise, carry out.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The regulations relating to the children's commissioner in Wales will be Assembly regulations and will be within the terms of the Bill passed by Parliament. The Assembly has discussed the parameters of the regulations in Committee, but no regulations have been forthcoming as yet. The regulations will be debated in the Assembly, as they would be in this House.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> That is helpful. There is an interesting contrast between that situation, in which the regulatory body is the Assembly-an elected body-and the situation in England, where the regulatory authority will be the National Care Standards Commission.

<P>
I am not sure that the question of independence has been resolved as neatly as the Under-Secretary gave us to believe. Our view is that the position of an employee of the National Care Standards Commission, appointed at the direction of the Secretary of State, does not have the same independence as that of the children's commissioner for Wales. We still have to be convinced that we have not been sold a second-class model for England. We were persuaded by the arguments used by Sir Ronald Waterhouse, and, although we know that we cannot overturn the Government's majority and defeat the proposal, we believe that the parallel existence of the two models will, over time, show whether our fears are justified.

<P>
There is no question about the cross-party support for endeavours to improve protection for children. Despite some Back-Bench rewriting of history, we can see a continuum from the previous Government's Children Act 1989 to legislation produced by this Parliament that will improve safeguards for children. The Bill offers us the opportunity to do the best that we can. We are not persuaded by experience of devolved decision making that the result will not be a better model in one part of the United Kingdom and an inferior one elsewhere. It would only be a question of time before voices demanding a similarly good system were raised to a crescendo.

<P>
The amendment proposes our case for using a similar model for England. The Under-Secretary reassured us that what we sought will be contained in his alternative model for England. The test of time will show whether children in England will enjoy the same safeguards and protection as those in Wales will receive through the model that was inspired by the Waterhouse report, and which will be introduced with full cross-party support in the Welsh Assembly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I do not suggest that this debate is solely about titles on the doors of the respective positions-much more is involved.

<P>
The substantial issues in this context are independence, visibility and scope. On independence-yes, both the commissioner and the director will be independent, but their independence will be secured in different ways. The Under-Secretary gave some reassurances about the director's ability to write his own section of the annual report, for example, but that is different qualitatively from the independence that will be afforded to the commissioner in Wales. As the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman) said, devolution gives us an opportunity to experiment. We can see which experiment leads to the best outcome and adapt the mechanism that operates in other countries. Putting a director with a remit to deal with children's rights in the National Care Standards Commission has a narrower focus than the system that will be established in Wales. We welcome the wider remit that will be established in Wales, and we regret the narrower remit that will be established in England.

<P>
The Under-Secretary commented on the tenor of the debate. We should have very strange debates in this place if we only ever debated matters on which we agreed-they would probably be the dullest of debates, and we should probably soon say, ``Let's get back to debating what we disagree about.'' We inevitably focus on disagreements, even if they are small. In this context, however, the disagreement is more than small.

<P>
The differences in the independence of the two positions affect their visibility. An independent, stand-alone commissioner in Wales will be highly visible-it will be in his interests, and part of his job, to be visible. The director will be part of a bigger organisation with a broader remit. There is a real concern that he, and the people who work for him at a regional level-a series of directors-will not be as visible. We discussed the scope of the positions, and I shall not repeat those arguments.

<P>
We have had a useful debate, which has teased out the relevant differences. There is undoubtedly a broad basis of commitment between the parties to protect the rights of children in this country. The key question is about how quickly the Government will embrace the proposals in the ten-minute Bill that was introduced by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre. We hope that those proposals will be enacted in full at the earliest opportunity.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

We approach the summit of our activity in Standing Committee. Many of our amendments today are technical or deal with drafting matters. We think that we have spotted a mistake that has slipped through; there is one word too many in subsection (2). It reads:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The provision which may be made under subsection (1) includes or instrument provision amending or repealing any enactment or instrument<P>

which is, at least, awkward. Unless I have misunderstood, I should have thought that that was something that the vast army of civil servants at the Government's disposal should have picked up.

<P>

<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 493, in page 63, line 18, leave out ``prescribed''.

<P>
I understand that the Committee is anxious to get on, but the clause is an important one. We have referred to it often and the Government have given several undertakings to present changes to some of the definitions on Report. Some of our amendments are designed to make sure that that happens. The clause should not slip through with no record of our desire to be sure that some of the changes will be made. This amendment and some others that we have tabled are, if not probing, precautionary amendments.

<P>
Amendment No. 493 is an attempt to tackle the little word ``prescribed''. A comprehensive and sweeping definition of the term ``disabled'' is presented by subsection (2)(a) with the words

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>blind or deaf or substantially and permanently handicapped by illness or congenital deformity<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but it continues with the words

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or by any other prescribed disability.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why do the Government need to include the word ``prescribed''? Surely it is clear by any definition that someone who is permanently handicapped is disabled. It does not need a Minister to decide what is a prescribed disability. Such a heavy-handed approach to a comprehensive definition of disability is superfluous, but perhaps the Minister has a strong argument for why he should be able to prescribe disability.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Meriden for drawing attention to the problem. She is right to say that we undertook to reconsider this part of the Bill. We are actively deciding whether the definitions need to be tidied up. However, we have no intention of inadvertently using language that would be discourteous or offensive to people with a disability, which is why we are still considering whether there is a better way to proceed.

<P>
Several definitions of disability are given in a variety of statutes, such as the Housing Grants, Reconstruction and Regeneration Act 1996 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. However, in relation to social care, one definition has been used repeatedly and consistently, both in the Children Act and the Registered Homes Act 1984, which was introduced by the hon. Lady's party. We have continued, in broad terms to use the definition of disability in section 29 of the National Assistance Act 1948. I am sure that the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge would argue for consistency. The hon. Gentleman is especially keen on that. There is a consistent theme in legislation that contains a definition of disability, and the Bill's definition is couched in the same terms. The reference to prescribed regulations comes from the 1948 Act and the Registered Homes Act.


<P>
No Minister has used the regulations making power in section 29 of the 1948 Act or subsequent legislation to prescribe further definitions of the term disability. We do not currently intend to exercise that power; it is simply there to provide a consistent strand in social care legislation as it applies to disability. We do not have a secret agenda to narrow or expand the definition of disability. However, I reassure the hon. Lady that we are considering the wider issue of terminology in the Bill so that we avoid causing any obvious offence. We will introduce amendments, if necessary, on Report.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I am reassured to hear that the Government have the reworking of the definitions in hand. As Report stage is only a week away, we wish them good speed in preparing what is a sensitive definition. I would not dream of arguing for inconsistency. It was helpful to discover that the definition goes back to 1948 and interesting to discover that the power has not been used. Circumstances have changed since then. A great deal of legislation has come into force to assist disabled people and there are now more definitions of different types of disability. It is a classic example of how, 50 years on, a power may be virtually redundant because of subsequent legislation.

<P>
One problem is that many of the latter clauses entail a great deal of synchronisation with other legislation, with which they must cog together. I can well believe that trying to be consistent with all the different Acts is not the easiest task, although that is why the Minister has the forces of the trained civil service at his disposal, so we trust that he will be successful in achieving the degree of consistency that we would like to be in place. For that reason, I accept that the reworking of the clause will produce a wording that will be of greater satisfaction to us. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
Government amendment No. 474.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> At our first sitting, which now seems a long time ago, I said that the devil would not be so much in the detail of the Bill as in the definitions that it contains. During a subsequent sitting, the Minister rightly drew our attention to clause 100 and almost invited us to consider tabling amendments to it, especially in relation to the definition of personal care. I know that the Minister was not actually giving such an invitation, but I have nevertheless taken to heart his comments.

<P>
The amendments seek to clarify the Government's intentions on three issues. First, they deal with the definition of personal care. Many people who have considered the Bill and commented on it have concluded that the definition provided in clause 100 is deficient. All the games played by tribunals in assessing the definition in the Registered Homes Act and in developing and refining it, as well as in clarifying the intentions that underlie it, will be lost. I refer especially to the inclusive definition that is included in the Harrison judgment, which is a particular cause for concern. I shall return to that judgment in a moment, in relation to a particular question about Government amendment No. 474.

<P>
Secondly, a number of organisations-not least the National Housing Federation-have expressed concern that supported housing will be caught by the definition of personal care that is currently included in the Bill. I dare say that the Minister will tell me that the definition that I propose would also catch supported housing schemes. That is an unintended consequence. It appears that the Government have tabled an amendment to try to address that concern. To the extent to which it succeeds in doing so, I welcome it. However, Government amendment No. 474 appears to reintroduce section 20 of the 1984 Act. The problem with that section is its interpretation by the courts. In the Harrison case, which was heard in 1991, the courts decided on a very inclusive definition of personal care, as they did not define it very closely. The second opinion, which concurred with that of Lord Justice Dillon, was expressed by Lord Justice McCowan. The summary of his conclusions states that, in his opinion,

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it was not essential, in order that there be ``personal care'', that assistance with bodily functions should in fact be required or given. The definition was not exhaustive and embraced care in many forms, emotional and psychiatric as well as physical.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The definition to which their Lordships referred in that judgment is exactly the same as that which is proposed in the Government amendment. It would therefore be useful to know today whether the Government accept the interpretation in the Harrison judgment. Will the Minister give an answer, so there is no doubt in future? Unless the definition is clear and exhaustive, it may be possible for supported housing to be inadvertently included in a judgment such as that to which I have referred. I do not think that that is the Government's intention and it certainly is not ours, so it would be helpful to have separate definitions to clarify that.

<P>
My third point, and the reason why I tabled an amendment to include a definition of nursing care, is that those words pop up in the Bill on several occasions, sometimes as ``personal and nursing care'' or sometimes just as ``nursing care''. It is a serious weakness to omit such definitions in an enabling and framework Bill that will give Ministers the power to make lots of regulations. That will also cause a problem in interpreting the Government's intention at the time when the legislation was introduced. Therefore, we offer an attempt at a definition.

<P>
I know that previous Governments have offered clearer definitions in legislation and that guidance has been given. The Coughlan case last year highlighted the need for clarity in that area because there is too much uncertainty about what currently constitutes nursing care and what should be free, let alone what might be free when the Government publish their White Paper later this month-let us hope that it is a calendar month of July and not a civil service month.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is important to distinguish between the meanings of the terms nursing care, personal care and practical assistance, which is why we have also made an attempt to say what practical assistance might include. We know that when the royal commission published its recommendations last year, it offered a tight but comprehensive definition of personal care, which I considered to be an acceptable basis for policy development in that area. However, last year, the Royal College of Nursing conducted a survey to examine the implications of the Coughlan judgment. I know that the Government have some quarrel with the statistics, but in a detailed analysis of a sample of health authorities' criteria for continuing care, the Royal College of Nursing found that nine out of 10 health authorities were unlawful on the tests laid down in the Coughlan case.

<P>
In that case, the Court of Appeal made it clear that nursing care must be provided under the National Health Service Act 1977. The crucial part of the ruling hinged on Section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948, under which local authorities have a duty to provide accommodation and associated services for certain vulnerable groups. However, the Court of Appeal went on to say that social services departments can provide nursing services, but only if a couple of tests are met. The first test is if those nursing services are merely incidental and ancillary to the provision of accommodation. The second test depends on whether the service can usually be expected to be provided as part of a social services package. In effect, the court produced a two-part test relating to quantity and quality for defining what continuing care should and should not be paid for. The amendment attempts to clarify what progress the Government have made in consultations on the definition of nursing care; whether that issue will be dealt with by the royal commission, as I suspect it will, and what guidance will be necessary following the Coughlan case.

<P>
The amendments attempt to include in the Bill definitions that will remove uncertainty and the potential for further litigation. I cannot prejudge the White Paper, and we look forward with bated breath to what the White Paper will say. Last year, the royal commission offered one model of how personal care and nursing care should be defined. Many of our constituents will feel deeply resentful of the fact that, because of the lack of clear definitions and the inequities within the current arrangements for funding long-term care, there is a lottery. Someone in one part of the country has to pay for nursing care, whereas because of a more generous interpretation elsewhere, someone else receives it free. That cannot be right. Clear definitions should be settled on the face of the Bill, preventing such differences from arising.

<P>

<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> Amendments Nos. 494 and 495 are more of our precautionary amendments, as I described the previous one. We know that the Government have undertaken to rework the subsection in question, and we want to put down a marker, as we did before, to show what we hope might be changed.

<P>
We are trying to be helpful. The definition under subsection (3) of ``personal care'' as extending to ``advice and encouragement'' is so wide-ranging that there could be considerable implications for the authorities that would exercise the relevant functions. We are sure that the Government, in reworking the subsection, will take account of that.

<H4><center>[Miss Julie Kirkbride in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment No. 494, which would remove the definition of ``nursing or personal care'' is also intended to remind the Government of the considerable difficulties in defining nursing care. We know from our lengthy conversations with representatives of the Royal College of Nursing that they are very concerned about how it should be defined, because that has implications for trained nurses. Too wide a definition draws in other health care workers and assistants performing nursing care, while too narrow a definition might have implications for those who need it. The services that those people require might be placed outside the boundary of what is regarded as nursing care. That is important and the spotlight will be on the Government as they deal with this definition, particularly in the light of what the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam has mentioned-the imminent White Paper on long-term care; at least we hope that it is imminent, after more than a year of waiting for it. Social services departments and nurses will watch what happens closely, because of the considerable implications for their professions.

<P>
The amendment is intended to remind the Government, if they need reminding, that we expect a better definition in the Bill.

<H4><center>[Mr. Roger Gale in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
When the subject of personal care has arisen in debates on previous clauses, we have pointed out that too loose a definition, in terms of advice and encouragement, would include the activities of many people who would not for a second think of themselves as providing personal care in the strict sense of assistance to someone who needs support with bodily functions. That is the classic definition of personal care in our mind, towards which, presumably, the Government draftsmen are striving.

<P>
I want to draw attention to the ruling in the Harrison case, which contained an interesting observation on the practical definition of personal care. Reference was made in the court ruling to a memorandum of guidance produced by the Department of Health and Social Security at the relevant time. That draws attention to an aspect of the definition of personal care on which I have so far not touched. The guidance defines personal care, with reference to elderly people, as assistance with their emotional and physical needs, including help with washing, bathing and so on. The Government should take note of one aspect of the guidance. Will such provision be measured against the standard that personal care will be

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the kind of attention someone would receive in his own home from a caring relative under guidance of the general practitioner or nurse member of the primary health care team?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an interesting consideration. It is difficult to provide that support for a relative, but people strive to do their best for a loved one. It sets a high standard against which to judge the personal care provision that the Government envisage. I hope that such a standard will be reflected in the form of words that they introduce on Report to clarify the definition of personal care.

<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I want to add my voice to the debate. The issue of whether people receive personal care or nursing care is important in all our constituencies, especially Worcestershire, which suffers greatly from Government underfunding. No doubt I will be told that that is a different issue, but the budget for social services and definitions of personal care and nursing care are relevant. Who pays for what-the social services department or the health authority-when people go into nursing homes is important. It would help to have a clearer legal definition of what relatives can expect when their loved ones go into care. They need to know what should be provided and who should pay for it, not least because of the problem of bed blocking, which I read about in my constituency post this morning. Bed blocking is a symptom of the underfunding that social services departments experience. They often cannot decide what budget should be used to pay for different types of care.

<P>
The definitions of elements of care are unclear. We welcome the fact that the Government want to be clearer in their definitions. I should like to be able to interpret the guidelines. Members of Parliament are sometimes called on to offer a view for constituents who are in dispute with their health authority and social services department over who should pay for care. It is tremendously difficult to know where the dividing line is drawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady raises an important issue. She is asking for clarity on the definition of nursing care. Will she remind the Committee which amendment her party has tabled to clarify the definition of nursing care, because I do not think that there is one?

<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I fear that the Minister, although very able, is falling into the common trap of believing that the Conservatives are responsible for government even though the Labour party is in power. It is not my role to produce a definition without the benefit of civil servants' advice. I act on behalf of my constituents to highlight areas of law that should concern the Government. They have the benefit, at the considerable expense of taxpayers, of advice not only from civil servants but from their political advisers. It is not unfair of us mere Back Benchers who work for our constituents to expect Ministers to deploy the resources at their behest to produce relevant points of law and detail that benefit Members of Parliament and our constituents. I am sorry to disappoint the Minister, but it is about time that Ministers accepted that they are meant to govern and that other hon. Members are here to point out where they are lacking in carrying that responsibility to govern on our behalf.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
One of the Bill's most important aspects should be clarification of the law in relation to nursing care and personal care. I find it difficult to advise constituents on the difference between them, so I am obliged to accept the definition and interpretation provided by the local health authority and by the social services department of Worcestershire county council. However, they can provide only their own interpretation. It would be helpful if I could refer to legislation and ask, ``Could you please explain why you hold that view when this says something different? Why are you unable to give my constituent financial support for the care that should be available for the person about whom he or she is concerned?''

<P>
I should like to chide the Minister a little, as the problem will become even more relevant when Ministers finally, but finally, get round to doing what they promised to the electorate that they would do: put together a proper policy on payment of nursing home fees. The Opposition recognised that the matter was of considerable concern before we lost the previous election. We included in our manifesto proposals to tackle what we perceived to be a problem.-[
Interruption.] The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) says from a sedentary position that we were in power for 18 years. He will find that issues change over 18 years. The issues that we dealt with back in 1979 were different from those which we faced in 1997. He will find that issues change and Governments have to respond to them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend think that it is curious, in the light of the reaction of Labour Members, that the royal commission on long-term care, which was conducted under the chairmanship of Sir Stewart Sutherland, was given just 12 months to report, but it has taken the current Government 17 months-and counting-to respond?

<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> With his usual attention to detail, my hon. Friend rightly points out that the Government have exceeded the shorter time scale imposed on the commission. They are paralysed on taking decisions that they think would be controversial. I shall not pursue that point, as I would be straying from the subject of the debate, and you, Mr. Gale, would call me to order, but I should point out the importance of the matter. As and when the Government finally create a different framework for the payment of nursing home fees, after much promising that they would do so, with a different view on where the state-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As the hon. Lady rightly said, it is time for me to call her back to order. The definitions of nursing care are clearly within the remit of the clause, but the matters about which she is speaking are not.

<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Forgive me, Mr. Gale, if distractions have caused me to lengthen my remarks. It is widely believed that the question of what constitutes nursing and personal care will be germane to what is paid for by the taxpayer and by the individual citizen, who may be selling his or her home in order to provide care. The reason why I wanted to chide the Government for their inaction on advancing their proposals for the future funding of nursing home care is that one of the definitions that they are about to create will be significant in the framing of the new rules. The definitions of personal and nursing care will make a difference to the price tag that is attached to any proposals that the Government make. The way in which Ministers decide the issue and what funding will become available-as and when they make a decision-is therefore of considerable interest to us. I add my concerns to those expressed by my Front-Bench colleagues. We are pleased that the Government believe that it should be their job to clarify matters, and that it is not exclusively our job to make suggestions that they can plagiarise.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Follow that! It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Lady. She has certainly livened up our proceedings. I was not asking her to do the Government's job; indeed, we would not do so. I was slightly curious, however, because she suggested that she agreed with the hon. Member for Meriden about giving greater clarity to the definition of nursing care. However, neither hon. Lady has tabled such an amendment.

<P>
Two issues were raised during the debate. First, given the scope of the Bill, it is entirely appropriate that we should focus our attention on the definitions of personal or nursing care, because they would affect the registration process. That is dealt with in Government amendments Nos. 473 and 474. Secondly, the hon. Member for Meriden and other Opposition Members spoke about who should pay for what sort of care. You, Mr. Gale, have reminded the Committee that the Bill does not cover that. We shall deal with the matter when the time comes, but it is not here and now. I shall therefore concentrate on the amendments.

<P>
First, however, on behalf of all my hon. Friends, I must point out to the hon. Member for Meriden some of the realities about the need to tidy up the mess on the funding of long-term care that was left behind by the Conservative party. She was right to say that, during the election, the Conservative party outlined a set of proposals to deal with the matter. She may care to read chapter 5 of the report of the royal commission on long-term care to find out what Sir Stewart Sutherland and his fellow commission members said of those proposals. In royal-commission-speak, he described them as a load of old cobblers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> As the Minister is now regurgitating what he said on the Floor of the House, he may recall what I said in answer to that. Is he telling us that the Government are so impressed by all Sir Stewart Sutherland's recommendations that they intend to implement them in full? If so, when can we expect that to happen?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is a little like Dr. Spock on these occasions. He attempts logically to extrapolate everything to point where none of us would exist. The answer is no; but he should remember that the royal commission was directing its comments to the Conservative party's election proposals. As I understand it, they would affect only a small number of the hundreds of thousands of people who go into residential care each year. It is difficult to see how those proposals would make an appreciable difference to the problems generally experienced by people going into care.

<P>
The hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Meriden repeatedly chide us-it was a pleasurable experience to be chided by the hon. Lady; it is the way that she speaks that I find so beguiling-but we shall respond later this month. Most hon. Members know the time scale that we are working to. The issues of funding have been explored by the Opposition and by those of my hon. Friends who have similar concerns. Our proposals will be set out effectively in the next few weeks.

<P>
I want to deal with Government amendments Nos. 473 and 474 before I respond to some of the concerns that have been raised by Opposition Members, especially to some of the technical points relating to Harrison v. Cornwall county council raised by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. He was right to focus on that case in relation to our amendments.

<P>
Both our amendments relate to the meaning of personal care. Personal care is a fundamental concept in the Bill because it affects some important definitional aspects. For example, it may be used to determine whether an establishment is registrable as a care home, and whether an agency falls within the definition of a domiciliary care agency. As I have already made clear, we are committed to extending regulation to day centres, and that concept is likely to be a deciding factor in determining whether a day centre is registrable. The same may be true of other establishments and agencies that might be brought within the scope of regulation in future using the powers in clause 39. For that reason, we decided not to set out in the Bill a single definition of personal care, which might not be precisely right for all the circumstances in which it is used and in which it might be used in future in regulations made under the Bill. We have given considerable attention to the matter and concluded that it is best to retain the flexibility to adapt the meaning of personal care according to context. That is what our amendments will achieve.

<P>
Amendment No. 473 is straightforward. Under the amendment, personal care will retain its ordinary meaning, but it will be possible to exclude through regulation particular activities that might be considered to amount to personal care. It will be possible to tailor those regulations to regulate a particular service so that the activities that are excluded from the definition of personal care could vary according to the service provided. That power to make regulations in relation to different services is contained in clause 97, subsections (5) and (6), which the Committee has already approved.

<P>
I now wish to speak about the meaning of personal care in the Bill in the context of a care home and domiciliary care agency. A care home is defined in clause 3 as an establishment that provides accommodation and nursing and personal care for persons who are or have been ill, who are disabled or infirm or who are or have been dependant on alcohol or drugs. In that context, personal care covers four main types of care.

<P>
The first is assistance with bodily functions, such as feeding, bathing and toileting. The second is care that falls just short of assistance with bodily functions but which might still involve physical and intimate touching. That covers activities such as helping a person to get out of the bath and helping him or her to get dressed. The third type of personal care given in a care home is non-physical care that relates to the activities that I have already mentioned. It might cover advice, encouragement and supervision in connection with those activities. It would include prompting a person to take a bath and supervising that person during bathing. The fourth type of care given in a care home that would count as personal care is emotional and psychological support. That would include the promotion of social functioning, behaviour management and assistance with cognitive functions.

<P>
Therefore, I hope that it is clear that the meaning of personal care in clause 3 is very wide and covers a whole range of care, both physical and emotional. However, if we were to leave clause 3 as it stands, there is a danger, to which the hon. Member for Meriden referred, that we would include in the definition of a care home all sorts of establishments that could be seen as providing accommodation and personal care in the wide sense that I have outlined to the Committee. For example, without any further limitations, hostels for homeless people, many of whom have drug and alcohol problems, may be required to register as care homes. Equally, an enormous range of establishments that provide any sort of general counselling and psychological support on a residential basis might count as care homes. That is not our intention. We could have dealt with that problem by excluding such places in regulations under clause 3, but we have received many representations on the issue and are aware that it is causing considerable concern. Therefore, we decided that it was best to table an amendment to narrow the definition of a care home, which is why we tabled amendment No. 474.

<P>
Amendment No. 474 makes it clear that, for an establishment to count as a care home, it must provide assistance with bodily functions, where such assistance is required. It is very important to understand that that does not mean that the personal care provided by the home is limited to assistance with bodily functions; as I have already made clear, the meaning of personal care is to be interpreted more widely than that. The amendment will simply mean that that type of assistance must be available and given if required. Clearly, the amount of such assistance that is actually given will depend on the needs of the residents. In a care home for frail elderly people, it is likely to be given fairly often, but in a care home for people with learning disabilities. it might be given only very rarely. However, for an establishment to be registrable as a care home, assistance with bodily functions must be available, even if it is rarely provided. The same requirement is contained in the Registered Homes Act 1984, and, as the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam rightly said, that requirement was clarified by the court in the case of Harrison v. Cornwall county council.
