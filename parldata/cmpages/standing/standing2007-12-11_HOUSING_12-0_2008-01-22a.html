						</b> Good afternoon, Mr. Benton. In this
morning&#146;s sitting, I touched on the concerns expressed by the
hon. Member for St. Ives about which providers will be covered by new
clause 25, and I hope that I provided reassurance that the new clause
will apply to all providers in a protected
area.</div>
					<a name="08012371000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also mentioned concerns about the new clauses being a
top-down approach, with the Secretary of State being in the front seat
on any designation order. I hope that the Committee will not mind my
reiterating what I said in moving new clauses 24 and 25: the local
authority will be able to designate specific sites in a particular
area, and the Secretary of State will then make the order.</div>
					<a name="08012371000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">This brings
me to the fundamental theme of the line of questioning this morning. My
right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich wisely queried
the definition of a rural area. He mentioned the current definition of,
I believe, 3,000 inhabitants. I am in the same place as my right hon.
Friend and do not want to indicate that the area should be drawn too
tightly. The area should be appropriate, and I have an open mind on the
point. My right hon. Friend&#146;s point about 3,000 inhabitants is
valid, and it is a good starting point. As I mentioned this morning, I
am keen to look at the matter in the context of consultation and
discussion 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div>with stakeholders. The question whether the rural definition can be
applied to an urban setting&#151;obviously, with regard to different
concerns and considerations&#151;is a good starting point. I hope
that that reassures
him.</div>
					<a name="08012371000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for St. Ives has mentioned concerns about section 106 agreements. The
new clauses will not affect any existing agreements, such as planning
or nomination rights. I hope that that reassures
him.</div>
					<a name="08012371000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have addressed all concerns raised by hon.
Members.</div>

							<b class="B">Andrew
George</b> (St. Ives) (LD): As someone who is keen to ensure
that local communities drive the process as far as possible with the
Secretary of State taking a back seat in endorsing and ensuring that
they operate within the purpose of the regulation, I want to be clear
on how the Minister envisages a local authority drawing up or making
recommendations on drawing up the boundaries of the protected area. In
many rural areas, it is difficult to define whether the parish boundary
should be drawn around the 3,000 population or whether the boundary
should be drawn around a clear community within that parish, as many
parishes have a large number of communities within their boundaries.
Such issues need to be resolved. I know that many local authorities
will be keen, quite rightly, to draw these protected areas as widely as
possible.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000471"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the process
should be driven locally, as a lot of housing developments should be. I
do not want to pre-empt the consultation on criteria, but it is
important that this is a locally driven process where local authorities
take the leading role and then apply to the Secretary of State for the
order. Local circumstances will demand what local authorities will do.
I am a big fan of that approach, and I hope that reassures him. We can
see this as another powerful tool to make sure that affordable housing
remains affordable in
perpetuity.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000474"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> New clause 26 and new schedule 1 will add a new
schedule to the Housing Act 1985. They build on a measure introduced in
the Housing Act 2004 to tackle exploitation of the right to buy and
compulsory purchase compensation rules by some tenants. The 2004 Act
added properties that are to be demolished during the next two years to
the exceptions that apply to the right to buy under schedule 5 to the
Housing Act 1985. In practical terms, the right to buy is no longer
available on properties where the landlord has followed the approved
and prescribed notification process by serving a final demolition
notice. The 2004 Act also gave landlords the power to serve an initial
demolition notice, which suspends the right to buy&#151;again,
landlords must follow a prescribed notification
process.</div>
					<a name="08012371000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Initial or
final demolition notices must set out the reasons and the intended date
for demolition, and landlords must also publicise that information
locally. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div>Notices may be extended or revoked by the Secretary of State. The aim of
allowing landlords to suspend or end the right to buy was to address a
loophole in previous legislation. Before the 2004 Act, when a tenant
knew that demolition was likely, they were able to buy their home under
the right to buy at a discount provided by the taxpayer knowing that
when it was repurchased under compulsory powers, they would be entitled
to full market value plus home-loss compensation&#151;in other words,
they would make a profit, sometimes a sizeable profit, at
taxpayers&#146; expense. That affected the financial viability of
regeneration schemes, because landlords had to find the money to buy
out such right-to-buy owners. The demolition notice procedure means
that landlords will be able to prevent tenants from taking advantage of
the time that it takes to plan and implement a regeneration
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08012371000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, there are safeguards for tenants. Landlords must notify tenants
when and why they intend to demolish. An initial demolition notice
expires after five years, and another cannot be served in respect of
the same property for five years, unless the Secretary of State agrees.
An initial demolition notice can be extended, but, again, only if the
Secretary of State agrees. If a tenant has incurred conveyancing costs
before a demolition notice is served, he is entitled to compensation. A
final demolition notice cannot be served unless arrangements are in
place to acquire any neighbouring properties that also need to be
demolished.</div>
					<a name="08012371000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
provisions are also available if the landlord employs another
body&#151;for example, an arm&#146;s length management
organisation&#151;to manage the demolition scheme on their behalf
while retaining ownership of the property, but they are not available
if the landlord sells or transfers the property to another landlord.
The new clause and new schedule will enable initial or final demolition
notices to remain in effect, if a landlord sells or transfers a
property to another landlord who intends to continue with the
demolition plans. However, I should make it clear to the Committee that
all the safeguards for tenants that I have mentioned will
remain.</div>
					<a name="08012371000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
power to issue initial and final demolition notices will be available
if demolition is to be carried out by another landlord to whom the
social landlord has transferred the property, but only if the second
landlord also intends to demolish the property. That will work as
follows: the second landlord will have to revoke any demolition notice
served by the first landlord, unless the second landlord serves a
continuation notice confirming that they intend to continue with the
demolition plans. The continuation notice must be justified on one of
the same grounds as the original demolition notice, and it must be
served and publicised in the same way. It may not vary the planned
demolition date or the date on which the original notice will expire.
The intention is to enable social landlords to manage demolition and
regeneration schemes as flexibly as possible.</div>
					<a name="08012371000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
124 is purely technical. It adds a repeal to schedule 10&#151;the
removal of &#147;and&#148;&#151;and amendment No. 130 ensures
that the repeal is commenced automatically. Amendment No. 129 ensures
that new clause 26 and new schedule 1 are commenced automatically two
months after Royal Assent, which will allow social landlords to make
use of the new provision on demolition 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div>notices without delay. I hope that I have explained the intention of the
amendments
clearly.</div>

							<a name="08012371000475"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="08012371000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
is technical. It aims to ensure that clause 264 applies to all relevant
institutions.  Clause 264 is designed to reduce the regulatory
burden on lenders, who currently have to apply twice to different
Departments for what is, in effect, the same approval, which is, as I
am sure that Committee members agree, both bureaucratic and pointless.
At the same time, the clause clarifies the protection afforded to
right-to-buy providers.</div>
					<a name="08012371000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will spend a moment providing
the background. If a tenant buys their home under the right to buy and
resells it within five years, their former landlord may require them to
repay some or all of the discount that they received. That obligation
is secured by a charge on the property. The same obligation applies to
the right to acquire from registered social landlords under the Housing
Act 1996 and to voluntary sales at a discount by both local authorities
and RSLs. The landlord&#146;s charge protecting the discount payment
would normally have priority. However, if the owner has a mortgage and
is unable to keep up the payments, approved lending institutions are
entitled to recover what they are owed ahead of the landlord&#146;s
entitlement&#151;in other words, they have first charge on the
property. That protection has been in place since the introduction of
the right-to-buy scheme in 1980.</div>
					<a name="08012371000405"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">We know from
recent consultation, and from comments on a slightly removed point at
the oral evidence sitting last month, that lenders in the right-to-buy
market regard that protection as important. Lenders with ALI status are
specified in various pieces of legislation: first, in section 156 of
the Housing Act 1985 with respect to right-to-buy sales, which also
applies to right-to-acquire sales; secondly, in section 36 of the same
Act with respect to voluntary sales by local authorities; and, finally,
in section 12 of the Housing Act 1996 for voluntary sales by
RSLs.</div>
					<a name="08012371000406"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">That specification also
applies to sales by housing action trusts under the Housing Act 1998
and where properties have been sold under the rent-to-mortgage scheme,
which is no longer available. Although some financial bodies are
automatically ALIs, at present others only become ALIs on being
specified as such by the Secretary of State. As I alluded to earlier,
such lenders have to come to the Government twice: first, to the
Financial Services Authority for authorisation to conduct lending
business, and, secondly, to my Department for approval as a
right-to-buy lender. The clause and the amendments will remove that
unnecessary
duplication.</div>
				
					<a name="08012371000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
Department has no powers of expertise in financial regulation and, as
somebody who did his tax return at the weekend, I have no financial
expertise whatsoever. Approvals under sections 156 and 36 are given on
the advice of others, including the Office of Fair Trading and
Companies House. All lenders accorded ALI status under the current
system meet the requirements of FSA authorisation and
regulation.</div>
					<a name="08012371000435"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08012371000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
November 2006, the Treasury Committee recommended that responsibility
for approving lending institutions for right-to-buy purposes should be
transferred 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>to the Financial Services Authority. The Government agree that the FSA
is better equipped than my Department to oversee the market and
therefore propose to combine right-to-buy approval with FSA
authorisation. The initial assessment of suitability will be made by a
fully qualified regulator, and the lenders&#146; activities will
subsequently be monitored by that regulator, where specialist staff
will be alert to potential problems.</div>
					<a name="08012371000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 264 removes the
Secretary of State&#146;s powers under sections 36 and 156 to specify
bodies as approved lending institutions and to revoke that status.
Instead, it adds the term &#147;an authorised mortgage lender&#148;
to the relevant lists of automatically approved lending institutions.
An authorised mortgage lender means one authorised for that purpose by
the
FSA.</div>
					<a name="08012371000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause alters references in section 622(1) of the Housing Act 1985
to schedule 3 to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 in respect
of the terms &#147;authorised deposit taker&#148; and
&#147;authorised insurer&#148; to ensure that the definition of an
ALI is consistent with the regulatory regime established by the 2000
Act. The alteration consists of referring to paragraph 12 of schedule 3
to the 2000 Act rather than to paragraph 12(1). The FSA has advised me
that the wider reference is correct. Clause 264 makes that alteration
for the definition of an authorised mortgage lender, and this new
clause makes the same alteration for the definitions of authorised
deposit taker and authorised insurer.</div>

Shapps</b> (Welwyn Hatfield) (Con): I beg to move, That the
clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="08012371000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
feel that we have been here before. When we were debating HIPs last
week, the Minister said that we were flogging a dead horse, but if only
it were so. The legislation has been virtually pointless, and its
useless implementation has been matched only by its introduction. It is
worth reminding the Committee that the legislation followed a troubled
path into operation across numerous pledges and manifestos. It was
eventually introduced, but the home condition report is the critical
point. When the home condition report&#151;effectively a survey
produced by the seller rather than the buyer of a property&#151;was
dropped, it rendered the HIP virtually useless. However, rather than
recognising the difficulties 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>that the legislation had run into, the Government
pushed forward, which is the point that new clause 5 seeks to
address.</div>
					<a name="08012371000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
the watered-down home condition report, there were incredible delays in
the rest of the implementation, including a staggered introduction. The
measure was delayed until August, which was followed by separate
introductions for four-bedroomed properties, three-bedroomed properties
and one and two-bedroomed properties. There were also delays in the
legislation, which, even to this day, does not require, for example,
leasehold documents to be included in a HIP or, for that matter, for
the HIP to be obtained.</div>
					<a name="08012371000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
requirement of the current bureaucratic legislation only that the HIP
is ordered. If a house is sold before it is obtained, it does not
matter, because of an exemption called first-day marketing, which means
that somebody can market their home on the first day that they have the
idea to put it up for sale. It seems to most onlookers that if the
first-day marketing exemption were scrapped&#151;so far, it has been
extended on two occasions, most recently last week to 1 June&#151;it
would be almost impossible for the HIPs system to operate. If it were
scrapped, one would need to have received a HIP to put one&#146;s
house on the market, which is not as straightforward as this Minister
and the Minister for Housing like to pretend. I say that from personal
knowledge, because, as I reported to the House last week, I have
ordered a
HIP.</div>
					<a name="08012371000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000477"></a>Mr.

							<a name="08012371000478"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> Well, I am pleased to report to the
Minister&#151;I think that I told him this at the time&#151;that
the energy performance certificate was supplied within 72 hours, and I
have it here. Eleven days later, however, the HIP has yet to appear. If
I had purchased the HIP with the intent of selling my house and the
exemption to first-day marketing had not been extended till 1 June, I
would be legally forbidden from putting my house on the market, which
is nonsense. The idea that the legislation is fine, but only because it
has a massive hole in it&#151;the first-day marketing
exemption&#151;makes a mockery of the entire
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08012371000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue
involves more than the time taken, although I understand that if one
happens to live in an area supplied by Southern Water, the delays are
such that someone who ordered their HIP in October last year will still
not have received it, because the search details will not have come
through. That water company wrote to conveyancers in the area
explaining that it could not supply the water searches for two months.
Those people would be unable to sell their homes, if it were not for
the first-day
exemption.</div>

						</b> I am being slightly flippant, if not cheeky, and I
run the risk of being ruled out of order. If the hon.

Shapps:
						</b> Thank you for your intervention, Minister, which
is significant, because it demonstrates the extent to which it has been
hard to get the Government to focus on the true issues. It is easy for
them simply to provide a sneering look and move on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>with business, but the reality is that if one orders a HIP and it does
not come, one would not be able to sell one&#146;s house without the
exemption. If that is not the case, I challenge the Government to get
rid of the exemption straight away, but they know that that is the case
and that the problem is significant.</div>
					<a name="08012371000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,
the problems do not end there. The difficulty with the HIPs legislation
is that it goes against the grain of human nature. When one buys
something as big as a house, one would be insane not to want to carry
out one&#146;s own searches. My neighbour put their home on the
market a year ago. Due to a slowing housing market and possibly some
other factors, that house has not sold. Had they been required to get a
HIP, it would probably have been replaced on two occasions by now. It
would be insane to trust search information so far out of date, if one
were buying that house. That, in a nutshell, is the fundamental flaw in
asking the seller to commission the work that is required at the time
of purchase by the
buyer.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): The hon.
Gentleman has said that it would be insane to purchase something as
significant as a house without obtaining all the relevant information.
How many people under the old system commissioned a survey before they
purchased a house&#151;entering into probably the biggest financial
transaction in their life without adequate information about what they
were making an offer
on?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000482"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> The reality is that the information that the buyer
gets depends on the buyer. I think that the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point is that most people do not commission a full
survey on their homes, which is entirely up to them. The home condition
report would never have been a full survey on the house. Home condition
reports are available, but only 4 per cent. of people who have ordered
a HIP to date have bothered to get a home condition report, including
those paid by the Government to order HIPs&#151;the &#163;4 million
trials. That home condition report is not of the same standard and
quality as a home condition report that one would get if one were to
survey one&#146;s home, which would be carried out by an entirely
separate body.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman will recall making a
pejorative remark about the survey being commissioned by the seller,
not the buyer, and implying that that somehow tainted it. The reality
is that the surveys will be carried out either by approved inspectors
or, in the case of the old system, by surveyors. The crucial thing
about the HIPs system is that the liability will allow the purchaser of
the property to seek redress, if the survey is not accurate, which is
the key thing. Will he explain to the Committee how he justifies his
party&#146;s support for the old arrangements, where &#163;1
million was lost to consumers every day of every year because of
inherent inefficiency and delays?</div>

							<a name="08012371000486"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, whose
knowledge of the housing market is usually impeccable. The actual
figure is &#163;320 million a year, which is not quite &#163;1
million a day, and those costs have not, of course, disappeared because
of HIPs. Furthermore, he should be aware&#151;I am sure that he is
aware&#151;that a home inspector who has studied for a period of time
is not equivalent to a chartered surveyor. The people who normally
carry out home inspections for the purposes of a survey are different
from the people who are invited to carry out a home condition report.
The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument is not, in fact, with me,
but with his own Front Benchers, who scrapped the requirement for a
home condition report. It is not, after all, part of what is happening
in the marketplace&#151;nobody is bothering to get an HCR because
they recognise it has very little value to the purchaser, who will want
to purchase that survey
themselves.</div>
					<a name="08012371000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Gentleman asked a two-part question, the first part of which
concerned the survey or home condition report and the second part of
which concerned searches. The searches will sometimes be in place
following the introduction of HIPs, which leads to the question whether
any solicitor worth his salt, acting on behalf of the buyer, is going
to trust information provided some months earlier. House sales take
time&#151;from the moment when a buyer and seller agree in principle
to the sale, it is typically a three-month process&#151;so most
solicitors acting for a buyer are simply not going to trust that
document. I am not sure why it is so difficult for the Government to
see and understand the reality that people are paying the costs twice.
The seller is now having to commission this information, much of
which&#151;even most of which&#151;is repeated by the buyer, which
is the problem with
HIPs.</div>
					<a name="08012371000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government repeatedly misquote the cost at &#163;300. I invite the
Minister to come clean, because we know that VAT is added. Tax is
involved in the additional bureaucracy, so at the very minimum the cost
is &#163;350, and experts in the marketplace are saying that average
costs are coming out nearer &#163;400 or &#163;500, which does not
take into account running HIPs or the situation if home condition
reports are included. The body of evidence makes it clear that the
delay is unacceptable. The Government know that the delay is
unacceptable, which is why they have had to skewer their own
legislation with an exemption to allow people not to receive their
HIPs, because it is sufficient to order a HIP under the first-day
marketing
exemption.</div>
					<a name="08012371000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
my HIP, it is 11 days and counting. With the permission of the
Committee, I will report back when it eventually comes through. As
things stand, however, I would be unable to sell my house. New clause 5
seeks to resolve that problem. Energy performance certificates are, as
we have said all along, a good idea, because they will enable people to
make the comparison between their own houses and those of friends and
neighbours, if they wish to share that information. It is absolutely
sensible to liberate the energy performance certificate from the shell
of a HIP. By cutting away the bureaucracy that surrounds EPCs and
allowing them to stand on their own, we will enable them to spread
faster and wider, to become more generic and to achieve our common
objective of greener
homes.</div>
					<a name="08012371000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
is an attempt to do just that. It is time that the Government admitted
that they made a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>mistake with the legislation, which experts have
ridiculed, the industry does not want, the market does not need and the
new clause would

confirm that the vested interests of whom he speaks are the same people

Raynsford:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend recall that when the HIPs
scheme was first trialled, it commanded the support of almost all the
professional bodies, which could see the clear benefit of reforming an
inefficient system under which, every time a buyer commissions a survey
and the sale falls through, the fee is lost? If it takes three, four or
five times for the sale to go through, the surveyor does very well,
because he sells the survey again and again. That was the absolute
waste of money in the old system, which the Opposition continue to
defend. Is not their position
untenable?</div>
					<a name="08012371000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000495"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Absolutely. The biggest losers in all this tend to
be first-time buyers, who are at a disadvantage in any case because of
spending power, and we are trying to address that. Government Members
recognise&#151;I thought that Opposition Members did too&#151;that
the current house buying and selling process is confusing, expensive,
stressful and opaque, and we need to do something about it.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 433</div>
					<a name="08012371000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why, frankly, I cannot
quite understand why the Opposition have tabled a new clause that would
do away with HIPs, when all the indications are that the measure is
starting to work incredibly well and is doing what it was intended to
do. The introduction of HIPs brought information up front in the
process for the first time, and transferred costs from the buyer to the
seller, making it easier for first-time buyers to get on the housing
market ladder.</div>
					<a name="08012371000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thought that the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield would share my
aspirations and ambitions for first-time buyers, but clearly that is
not the case. Now that HIPs are operational and working well in the
marketplace, with all the indications showing so far that they are
bringing the intended positive benefits, I cannot quite believe that
the Opposition still want to pull the rug from under first-time
buyers&#146; feet. We should all be committed to improving the home
buying and selling process, not looking
back.</div>
					<a name="08012371000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012371000496"></a>
							<b class="B">Margaret
Moran</b> (Luton, South) (Lab): I wholeheartedly agree that
this is all about the protection of potential or existing
owner-occupiers, and I happen to think that the HIPs process has
brought in greater protection. If the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield
is genuinely concerned about protecting those people, he should make
greater efforts to look at the other end of the scale. Unscrupulous
financial institutions push elderly people to sell their homes and then
rent them back, and there are some dubious transactions that put those
elderly people and their homes at risk.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000497"></a>Mr.

						</b> My hon. Friend has raised an important point. We
have all seen the adverts on television that tell people they can stay
in their own homes for the remainder of their lives, but that financial
penalties will be involved. The Conservatives should be considering
that, but they do not seem to be.</div>
					<a name="08012371000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will give the hon. Member for
Welwyn Hatfield the benefit of the doubt. I think that he wants
energy-efficiency measures for housing, but the effect of the amendment
would be to withdraw all the positive work that is going on. Last time
I checked, that was being done very successfully as part of the HIP.
More than 270,000 energy performance certificates have been produced to
provide information to sellers and prospective buyers alike on measures
to improve the energy efficiency of homes. I was about to refer to my
hon. Friend regarding oral questions last week, but I am happy to give
way to him.</div>

and hard-working families, why they are trying to protect vested 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div>interests and why they are trying to scrap energy-efficiency measures.
Given that the stock market is vulnerable and that we have the most
turbulent housing market for 15 years, why do they want to derail
things and to create further stress and uncertainty? That is to play
politics in a devious manner, and I will have no part in
it.</div>

that we are not planning to scrap EPCs and would like them furthered,
the Minister slipped into a tirade as if scrapping them were our
policy. I hope that he accepts that the truth is that, if HIPs were
removed and EPCs did not apply only in respect of moving home, more
EPCs would be
issued.</div>

that he had an F or G-rated home so that I could have offered him the
help of the green homes service that I mentioned to my hon. Friend the
Member for Edmonton at oral questions and which we announced in
November. To every householder who gets an F or G-rated EPC for a home
being sold or bought, the green homes service will make an offer of
discounted or free help with energy efficiency. We expect some 10
million households to benefit from energy efficiency measures in the
first and subsequent phases of the energy efficiency commitment. We are
seeing a tremendous amount in terms of energy efficiency. Given that
something like 27 per cent. of all the UK&#146;s carbon emissions
come from domestic dwellings, we need to do something about this. This
is up and running now: we are curbing carbon emissions and improving
energy efficiency as part of the HIPs process now. If the new clause
goes through, we just scrap that, we provide nothing and almost go back
to square one.</div>
					<a name="08012371000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

part of the process for the phasing in of EPCs across all sectors of
buildings. Commercial buildings of more than 10,000 sq m are scheduled
to require them from April; in July this will extend to those of more

or would-be purchasers to feel that HIPs are the right way 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 436</div>forward? Why is there such concern about them, and why was the recent

							<a name="08012371000511"></a>Mr.

						</b> I think the hon. Gentleman is referring to the
Select Committee report, which mentions HIPs. What I took from the
report was that we did not go fast enough, but that the policy of
improving transparency and helping first-time buyers and other
hard-working families in buying and selling houses was spot-on. It was
right to phase the policy in a turbulent housing market. The potential
judicial review from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors meant
that we had to do something about home condition
reports.</div>

					<a name="08012371000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have throughout my debates with the hon. Gentleman, I maintain
strongly that, in the turbulent housing market of the summer, with the
sub-prime problems across the Atlantic, Northern Rock, rising interest
rates and some uncertainty&#151;&#151;which is important in housing
markets&#151;&#151;it was absolutely right and proper that the
Government took a prudent approach and did nothing that would further
undermine confidence or jeopardise the stability of the housing market.
Much to the annoyance of the Opposition, the phased approach remains
robust in a turbulent world and has not been compromised as a result of
HIPs. The Europe Economics report showed that. We took the right,
considered, reasoned, pragmatic approach; we are not going to play fast
and loose with the housing market. That is what responsible Governments
do. In the recession of 1991-92, when the Conservatives were in office,
one in nine people lost their homes. We will never go back to
that.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): The key point that my hon.
Friend made was that EPCs relate only to homes being sold, which leaves
95 per cent. without them. The key issue for debate is what we are to
do about the homes that are not on the market, many of which require
improved energy efficiency if we are to meet the 2050 targets by
reducing carbon emissions from homes.</div>

up to &#163;70,000 a year if they trained as home inspectors, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column437" />Column number: 437</div>as opposed to the domestic energy assessors who do EPCs? They should

						</b> I have listened carefully to the Minister, and as
he rightly points out, we have debated this on numerous
occasions&#151;three separate occasions in Delegated Legislation
Committees&#151;not least because of the way the Government
introduced the legislation in a hotch-potch fashion: hardly something
he can blame this Front Bench for, when it was his own Government who
produced these statutory instruments to debate the
legislation.</div>

am still not hearing any answer to the question that has been hanging
over the Government&#146;s implementation of HIPs all this time, and
that is, what on earth happened to the &#163;4 million of public
money that was spent on trialling this HIP legislation? What is the
point of trials and pilots if it is not to test the results and publish
that outcome? Without that information, we are none the wiser as to
whether, in those trials, this worked or did not. The Minister has
never told us what the point of those trials was if it was not to
produce information that could be used as a basis to decide whether
this legislation should be pushed through in
full.</div>
					<a name="08012371000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think
there is a satisfactory answer to the question for those people who
trained as HIPs inspectors and spent &#163;10,000 or &#163;12,000
of their money, or even for those who thought there would be a lot more
work available as domestic energy assessors, having spent several
thousand pounds, when the work is not there. The fastest and easiest
way to ensure that the market is there for them would be to run with
new clause 5 and liberate the energy performance certificate so it
could be used much more widely, and not just when someone buys or sells
a house. I am not convinced by the Minister&#146;s lack of arguments
and cannot therefore withdraw the

							<b class="B">Sir
George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): As I understand
it, the new clause would extend the right to buy to tenants of
registered providers of social housing. As my hon. Friend knows, at the
moment local authority tenants have the right to buy with all the
associated discounts, and there is a preserved right to buy when the
housing stock is transferred under large-scale voluntary transfer, but
new tenants do not at the moment have that entitlement.</div>
					<a name="08012371000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe what my hon. Friend
was seeking to do when he tabled new clause 8 was to develop the
argument that within the social housing sector there is an element of
inequality, in that some have the right to buy and others do not. I was
looking forward to hearing him develop the argument that the existing
right should be extended to tenants of social
housing.</div>

							<a name="08012371000536"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> When I say I am most grateful to my right hon.
Friend for intervening, I cannot exaggerate the extent. I think he is
entirely right, now that I have found my notes on new clauses 8 and
22.</div>
					<a name="08012371000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right to buy
has been one of the most significant elements in the last 50 years in
extending social mobility to vast sections of the population. It is a
policy that, while controversial, has delivered in a way that almost
nothing else, no other sort of social engineering, has been able to do,
in mixing communities as it has.</div>
					<a name="08012371000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">One thing
that unites Government and Opposition Members on housing&#151;other
than the fact that we all want to end the housing crisis by building
more homes&#151;is the idea that communities would perform better,
that society would work better, if communities were mixed. Rather than
having single-tenure or single types of community there could be a
cross-section of society living within the same or similar space. The
right to buy has perhaps more than anything else enabled that, creating
a situation that is now widespread throughout the country, though, as
we are about to discuss, not quite as widespread as it should
be.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Andy Slaughter</b> (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush) (Lab):
If we are all indeed in favour of building more homes&#151;and I
think the hon. Gentleman should look round at his colleagues on the
Back Benches next time he is in the Chamber to see if they are all
nodding in approval&#151;how can that be achieved by disposing of
existing social housing without seeing like-for-like
replacement?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000538"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> That is an interesting intervention, because it
leads on to the next point. The right to buy was tremendously
successful in mixing communities but&#151;and I think this is the
point the hon. Gentleman is driving at&#151;it did not do enough at
the time to create sufficient new social housing, though the record was
better than it has been recently. The reasons included a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div>concern that local authorities would not spend the money in the best
possible way, so the money was best ring-fenced and left
alone.</div>
					<a name="08012371000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">When this
Government came to power they chose not to allow the money from right
to buy to be spent on developing new properties. Instead they allowed
the money to be used to improve the standards of existing homes. That
is welcome, but the problem with that policy is that standards have
only improved by about 15 per cent. We have some research coming out
soon that will back this point. It has not improved standards as much
as it might have done but, worse
still&#151;</div>

							<a name="08012371000539"></a>Mr.

						</b> I am following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument extremely closely. On the subjects of money and research, will
he inform the Committee whether his party has carried out any costings
on the financial effects of the new
clause?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000540"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> One of the interesting things about getting this
right is that allowing people to purchase the properties in which they
live and then taking that money to build more housing creates a
virtuous circle. The problem that one could characterise easily with
the original right to buy was that the money was ring-fenced, for good
reasons, because of concerns over the councils at the time. When the
Government came in, the money was spent, but it was spent on
refurbishment and better home standards. The new clause proposes that
money can be spent in ways that would include improving and enlarging
the housing stock. As we discussed earlier in the day, that has not
happened sufficiently in the past few
years.</div>

							<a name="08012371000541"></a>Mr.
Love:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that with the
significant discounts available under the right to buy using money
raised through that process will never replace, on a one-to-one basis,
the accommodation that is lost? How does he intend to replace those
properties lost under the right to buy through this new
clause?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000542"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman should understand that the
homes are still there. When a  home is sold at or discounted
from market rate, quite often, the money is available to not just
replace on a one-to-one basis but on a two-to-one basis. I have been
looking at a case recently where a housing association has been able to
sell one of its properties and with the proceeds they built six
residential properties in a housing association setting, thereby,
expanding the supply of affordable housing. It is a virtuous circle. It
will not always be six, but it was with this particular property. It is
a virtuous circle if it means that by moving people into different
types of tenancy, by moving them up and along the property ladder
and  by creating more housing we can help to resolve the
housing crisis. It is the Government&#146;s failure to recognise
those basic facts that has led to less social housing being built for
the past 10 years than for the previous 18.</div>

							<a name="08012371000543"></a>Alistair

						</b> Is it not the case, as he is finding out in
Committee and as we have seen in the House, that the hostility to the
right to buy from many Members 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column441" />Column number: 441</div>opposite is of serious concern to the Front Bench? Given a free vote on
the other side, I wonder how many Members opposite would vote to
extinguish the right to buy altogether? That is what they really want
to
do.</div>

has a strong point, which is that there is almost a psychological
dislike of the approach. If that is not the case, I will give way the
hon. Lady, who was trying to intervene first, to tell us
why.</div>

							<a name="08012371000545"></a>Margaret
Moran:
						</b> I have just brought to my hon. Friend&#146;s
attention that it was this Government who introduced the right to
acquire; an issue that he appears to have missed in his debate so far.
He also appears to be confusing disposal by RSLs to create more housing
with disposal to individuals. Given that the right to buy resulted in
the loss of about one third of council housing stock, is on the other
side of the coin and arguing that there needs to be an increase of
about a third or more&#151;from his arguments&#151;of new
building?</div>

Shapps:
						</b> I respect the hon. Lady&#146;s input as a
previous chief executive of a housing association, but I am slightly
mystified by the maths. Those houses have not disappeared. They are
still there. They have people living in them. The point of expanding
our housing stock is to keep the existing houses and to create more.

George:
						</b> I am as intrigued as many other Members are. The
hon. Gentleman refers to a &#147;virtuous circle&#148;, I wonder
whether he should rephrase it as a &#147;magic circle&#148; in
which rabbits are pulled out of hats and properties, which are sold at
below market value, are replaced by properties that have to be built
within the market. Can he illustrate his example, with calculations, of
being able to sell properties at a discount and to replace them while
meeting all the building and land
costs?</div>

							<a name="08012371000548"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> One thing that I thought we were all agreed on is
that it is desirable to prevent housing stock from seizing up, in other
words, to enable people to move on and up. Right to buy is one
brilliant way of achieving that
goal.</div>
					<a name="08012371000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem with
housing is that, while it costs money to build a house, the real cost
is of the land itself, which is one of the reasons why umpteen people
have come forward to back the idea of a &#163;60,000 home as launched
by the former Deputy Prime Minister, but of course finding the land to
put that home on is an entirely different matter. That is why community
land trusts, for example, should play such a vital role. I am pleased
with what is in the Bill about those trusts, but we can go much
further. We should make it the norm rather than the exception, so that
the cost of the land is stripped out of the equation as soon as it is
used for housing, and the property-only part of it is transferred from
one tenant to another, or even sold by one person to
another.</div>

here and now the sums and maths behind the example that I was citing,
but I will provide the Committee and the Minister, if they are
interested, with the Circle Anglia example, where one property was sold

against my proposal, I will be interested to hear
it.</div>

							<a name="08012371000551"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has praised community land
trusts. Does he recognise that the right to buy does not apply to them,
precisely because it would otherwise deplete the benefit to the
community?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000552"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> The right hon. Gentleman will know that, as a
result of this legislation and the Committee&#146;s refusal to accept
a new clause that we tabled, there is no legal definition of a
community land trust, so he has no basis on which to say that they do
not do certain things. Some of the trusts&#151;I can show him
examples&#151;are considering doing some incredibly innovative
things, including allowing shares in the properties to be sold, which
in effect&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;Shares.&#148;] Well, we can have a debate about whether 100
per cent. of the shares means ownership, and I readily concede that it
does not include the land itself, which is the key, and answers the
intervention from the hon. Member for St. Ives, but it none the less
ensures mixed tenure, which is the crucial
point.</div>
					<a name="08012371000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going back to
the last intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Bedfordshire, the scale of the dislike on the Government Benches for
anything that mentions the words &#147;right to buy&#148; is
evident. I can only conclude that that is why there are so many hands
in the air right
now.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000553"></a>Mr.
Slaughter:
						</b> This is voodoo economics, and the sacrifices
tend to be people in housing need. The antipathy on this side is not to
the right to buy but to reducing the stock of social housing. The new
clause exposes not our problem with the right to buy but the
Conservatives&#146; problem with social housing. It is just another
cheap trick to reduce the stock, which is exactly what happened in the
Thatcher years, and exactly what my Conservative council is doing
now.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000554"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> I could not disagree more. What really betrays
those in the greatest housing need is housing waiting lists, which are
so much longer than they were 10 years ago, and the failure to build as
much social housing as was built when my right hon. Friend the Member
for North-West Hampshire was in the role and during the 18 years before
this Government. That is what betrays people on the lowest rung of the
ladder who are struggling, without a house, to get housed&#151;the
homeless people with whom I have been working in recent months. The
idea that building more homes betrays people is simply poppycock, and
it is unbelievable to hear it being pressed in this
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08012371000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clauses are designed to ensure that the right to buy is extended in a
way that enables more housing, including affordable housing, to be
built. I would have thought that that would be roundly welcomed by the
Committee.</div>

Shapps:
						</b> We are going round in circles, on a debate that
started at some point in the &#146;80s and is continuing today. I
simply asked the Minister to look at the facts. As I have said many
times&#151;during the debate on new clause 8 and previously in
Committee&#151;the failure to build social housing is the reason why
the people who need social housing do not have it. They can spin this
any way that they like, but if they do not build more social houses and
do not use the receipts from right to buy to help that happen, they
will be forever stuck in the quagmire of failing to build sufficient
social housing but wringing their hands and talking about their desire
to do so. New clause 8 provides a practical application, a real way to
make it happen. I would have thought that that was something the whole
Committee ought to be
welcoming.</div>
					<a name="08012371000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000557"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> New clause 22 has been tabled by my hon. Friend
the Member for Montgomeryshire and me. It would allow individual local
authorities to take decisions about the level of discounts that they
would wish to offer under right to buy. Setting the level could be
operated so as to discourage or restrict purchases, but could also help
where the prices are low, and the desire for the available housing was
low&#151;setting the level could be used to contribute to the
regeneration of that community. That is something that could be decided
by the local authority at
hand.</div>
					<a name="08012371000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before going
into a little more detail, although I will not detain the Committee for
an undue length of time in view of the progress we have failed to make
so far, I will comment on the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield&#146;s
contribution to the previous debate. Since 1980 more than 1.7 million
properties have been sold under right to buy, yet fewer than half of
these have been replaced through social house building. Not even all
those will have been funded by the receipts of those property
sales&#151;during the Conservative tenure of 18 years, the ability of
local authorities to use such receipts was somewhat restricted as well.
We also have to consider whether the Conservative legacy was
acceptable.</div>
					<a name="08012371000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly
the calculations of the income generated from the receipt of sales
under right to buy have never been sufficient. I am not aware of any
local authorities that are champing-at-the-bit keen to sell their
properties because, as a result of selling one property, they are able
to accrue to themselves or to registered social landlords more than one
property&#151;nay, six in one case. The magic circle&#151;rather
than a virtuous circle&#151;painted by the hon. Gentleman has to be
taken with a severe pinch of
salt.</div>
					<a name="08012371000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
new clause 22, as I said, is to allow individual local authorities to
take decisions about the level of discount available. They would have
the freedom to revise the level of discount available on a regular
basis, to take into account the changes in the conditions of housing
needs and the levels of demand 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div>for right to buy in their areas. That freedom would allow them to
discharge more effectively the strategic place-shaped function
envisaged in the local government White Paper of 2006 and in the Lyons
report. A number of recent changes to the policy and legislative
landscape have aimed to strengthen the role of local authorities in
strategic planning. The local authorities are intended as
place-shapers. Sir Michael Lyons stressed in his final report the
importance of allowing local communities flexibility and choice, so
that they can respond to local conditions. One of the report&#146;s
main conclusions was that greater flexibility was required,</div>
					<a name="08012371000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;both over finances and to enable
local government to manage local services in response to local
needs.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012371000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The local
government White Paper in 2006 and its subsequent updates also stated
that local flexibility and &#147;devolving more power locally&#148;
are key Government priorities for reforming local government.</div>
					<a name="08012371000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would request that the
Minister looks again at the affordability index that was used to decide
which local authority areas should have restricted discounts applied to
those areas. Certainly, we need an update of that index and a provision
to allow local authorities to apply the index appropriately, and to
guide them in their decisions when apportioning the level of discount
that they intend to
apply.</div>

George Young:
						</b> I am following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument closely. I wonder whether the new clause might have a perverse
consequence. If a local authority could reduce the discount or
eliminate it, the first thing that local authority tenants would
do&#151;if they could&#151;if they felt that their local authority
was about to use that power, would be to buy their home under the
existing regime. Perversely, the new clause could accelerate the loss
of social

George:
						</b> The manner and speed at which decisions are taken,
the implementation and management of those decisions and the
forecasting of the decisions that are likely to be taken by a local
authority are matters that need to be considered when rolling out such
a proposal. In the same way, the Government no doubt took those issues
into account when they allocated the 41 local authorities for which
there would be a restricted discount of a maximum of &#163;16,00 on
each property. Those matters would then exercise the local authorities
in the manner in which they applied the discounts. I do not seek to
diminish the fact that, just as businesses in the City making decisions
over investment try to predict the decisions of the Bank of England
over the setting of interest rates, the same would apply to local
authorities, so the right hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point. I
would hope that the implementation of this reasonable measure would
allow devolved decision-making to reflect the circumstances within each
of the local authority areas. That is something that can be overcome
and taken into account during
implementation.</div>
					<a name="08012371000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Housing Act 2004 introduced some welcome reforms to the right to buy,
extending the qualifying and discount repayment period, during which a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>proportion of the discount must be repaid if the property is sold on.
Those reforms have helped to limit the exploitation of the right to buy
by property companies and others. Similarly, the restrictions on the
right to buy under the original Act, which was amended later in the
1980s, limited the right to buy in certain circumstances, in 26 rural
areas. That provides an example that differential geographical
decisions can be made in local circumstances. For the measures that I
have described&#151;the 41 local authority areas where discounts are
varied and the rural restrictions on right to buy re-sales&#151;those
decisions are taken by the Secretary of State. With the new clause,
however, we are asking the Government to allow local authorities to
have that discretion themselves and I hope that the Minister has taken
that point on board. Given his welcome for the idea that decisions
should be taken at a more local level in other aspects of the Bill, and
that the Secretary of State should not be so overbearing, I hope that
he will take that on board when conveying these powers to local
authorities.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000560"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I have thoroughly enjoyed the debate as I think
have other hon. Members.</div>
					<a name="08012371000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I say at
the start that the Government&#151;and me personally&#151;support
the right to buy? It has helped thousands of families, including my
own, to realise the aspiration of owning their homes and has helped to
create stable, mixed-tenure communities. I want to mention an important
point about the right-to-buy discounts. I get letters about this issue
on both sides of the argument. Some people think that right-to-buy
discounts are already too high and should be reduced whereas others
argue that maximum discounts should be raised to reflect rising
property prices. We believe that the present limits strike a reasonable
balance between helping people into home ownership and helping those
who need social housing. We therefore have no plans to change the
current right-to-buy
discounts.</div>
					<a name="08012371000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government want to widen access to home ownership as much as possible
and help more people, including social tenants, to build up assets.
With the greatest of respect to the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield, I
do not think that the proposals before us are the most sensible way of
achieving
that.</div>
					<a name="08012371000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Seventy per
cent. of tenants of registered social landlords already have a right to
purchase their home under the right-to-buy and right-to-acquire
schemes. The Government introduced the pilot social homebuy scheme to
help tenants of RSLs who do not have a right to buy or right to
acquire, or who cannot afford it, to buy a share in their rented home.
Under social homebuy, tenants may buy from 25 per cent. to 100 per
cent. of their home at a discount and landlords can keep the sales
proceeds for reinvestment in social and affordable
housing.</div>
					<a name="08012371000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000561"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> I wonder if the Minister can tell us how many
homes have been sold under the much-trumpeted social homebuy
scheme?</div>
					<a name="08012371000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000562"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I do not have that information to hand, but I can
tell the hon. Gentleman that my right hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 446</div>Friend the Minister for Housing announced on  12 December that
social homebuy will continue and that we are encouraging landlords to
improve affordability and develop an option under which maintenance
costs are shared. Our approach is to work with landlords to develop a
scheme that is more affordable for tenants and more viable for
landlords.</div>
					<a name="08012371000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
intervened on the hon. Gentleman to ask about costing. That is the main
theme of my opposition to the new clause. Compelling registered
providers of social housing to sell their stock at a discount would be
very costly. It would require full consultation. Registered providers
faced with large-scale sales might find it more and more difficult to
borrow to fund new provision and their repair and maintenance
programmes. If the taxpayer, through the Exchequer, was to fund the
discount, as is the case for the right-to-acquire scheme for tenants of
registered social landlords, we estimate that extending the right to
buy to those tenants who currently do not have such a right would cost
&#163;268 million a year. I suggest to the Committee that that would
have a significant impact on the resources available to provide
investment in new social
housing.</div>
					<a name="08012371000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000563"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> My hon. Friend is making a very persuasive
case. He said at the outset that he has enjoyed the debate. I enjoyed
the debate, but was puzzled by the absence of contributions from the
right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire and the hon. Member for
North-East Bedfordshire. Had they given a speech, rather than the
helpful and kindly intervention that the right hon. Gentleman made to
help his Front Bench colleague, the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield,
they would have had to explain why the Conservative Government in which
they both served, accepted the very clear evidence that it was
inappropriate to require charities and other voluntary organisations to
sell compulsorily, as they are now proposing. That would in effect be
expropriating the assets of charities. That was the fundamental reason
why the other place rejected the proposition when it was put
forward.</div>
					<a name="08012371000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000564"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> As ever, my right hon. Friend makes an amazing,
fantastic and accurate point. All I would say in response is that,
during the debate we all saw the looks on the faces of Opposition
Members when the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield was on his feet. I
will leave it at
that.</div>
					<a name="08012371000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is
uncosted, which is irresponsible on the part of Her Majesty&#146;s
Opposition. The large sum of &#163;268 million a year could be going
towards our ambition for 45,000 new social homes per year, as part of
our overall target of 3 million homes by 2020. In that respect, I would
ask the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08012371000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
22 almost flows in the opposite direction to new clause 8. As the hon.
Member for St. Ives quite rightly and eloquently said, it would free
local housing authorities to set whatever levels of right-to-buy
discount they choose, including no discount at all, subject to a limit
specified by the Secretary of State, if she chose to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08012371000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the new clause
was explained by the hon. Gentleman, I think that that is undesirable.
Tailoring 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 447</div>right-to-buy discount would not necessarily be an effective way of
addressing local housing matters. I agree with the point that local
housing considerations are best decided locally. For example, the
landlord could decide to lower the maximum discount to curb
right-to-buy sales locally; but, on learning what was intended, tenants
might decide to apply for the right to buy before it happened, in order
to beat the ticking clock, as pointed out by the right hon. Member for
North-West Hampshire. The right hon. Gentleman referred to it as a
&#147;perverse
incentive&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012371000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a former life, I worked for an accountancy firm where we used to audit
ourselves. We audited large-scale voluntary transfers and we would see
people become somewhat nervous and apprehensive when changes were
introduced. One could chart the spike of right-to-buy applications just
before transfer of stock from a local authority took place. Naturally,
people felt apprehensive and thought that something might alter in
their security of tenure. That would be the unintended consequence of
the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08012371000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000565"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> The Minister&#146;s logic is that the currently
available discount would be available for all time, and that no
decision could be taken, whether at Government or local level, because
he fears a perverse incentive and outcome. That logic presupposes that
the tenants would know whether the decision would increase or decrease
the discount. It could create a perverse incentive that would be acting
against the tenants&#146; best interests if the local
authority&#146;s decision was to increase the
discount.</div>
					<a name="08012371000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000566"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> But, the requirement for consultation would
establish the apprehension that would still lead to a rise in the
number of right-to-buy applications, which would reduce the discount
still further.  There would be unintended consequences to the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08012371000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman mentioned the possibility of no discount, which would be a
somewhat radical departure from the principal of the right-to-buy
scheme. For most tenants, I would suggest that, in practical terms, it
would mean ending any availability of right to buy whatsoever. I cannot
support such an extreme
measure.</div>
					<a name="08012371000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman said that the new clause would enable the Secretary of State
to specify the maximum discount that a local housing authority may set
in its area. I suggest, with gentle joshing, that that is at odds with
his approach in an earlier debate on new clauses 24 and 25. I would
also suggest to him that it is unnecessary, as the Secretary of State
already has the power under section 131(2) of the Housing Act 1985,
which states that:</div>
					<a name="08012371000218"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The discount shall not
in any case reduce the price by more than such sum as the Secretary of
State may by order
prescribe.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012371000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power is
already
there.</div>
				
					<a name="08012371000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that some who are involved in housing would welcome the kind of
local flexibility that we have discussed during consideration of the
new clause and earlier clauses. However, there is potential for
confusion, perverse incentives, and repercussions, and therefore I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000567"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> Of course the new clause was intended as a probing
amendment and I intend to withdraw it in a second. I wish first to make
two points to the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="08012371000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">One is on
the joshing point that he made. Of course there was a reference to the
powers of the Secretary of State. That was because, following the
debate on new clauses 24 and 25, I would not want to denude the
Secretary of State or the Minister of all their powers. That would be
wrong. Hence the reference to giving the Secretary of State some
role.</div>
					<a name="08012371000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
most substantial point that the Minister, backed rather oddly by a
former Housing Minister, the right hon. Member for North-West
Hampshire, can make is that the new clause would create a perverse
incentive for tenants and work against the objects of what a local
authority might be seeking to achieve by varying the discount level.
However, it would discourage any decision at any level, be it creating
a perverse incentive at the local authority level, or across the
country if a Secretary of State were to decide or consider deciding to
vary the discount
level.</div>
					<a name="08012371000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not accept
that argument. I hoped that the Government would consider the
provision. After all, they have accepted variations of discount in some
circumstances&#151;available in 41 areas, mainly in the south-east.
The principle therefore is not one that the Government find
unacceptable. I hope that in such circumstances the Minister will
consider that the right to buy, the impact that it has and the level at
which it is set, has varying impacts in different parts of the country.
He should therefore allow local authorities to set and vary the rate. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the new
clause.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000568"></a>The

clause as it is being discussed along with new clause
8.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000569"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> It has been an interesting debate and I am sure
that most members of the Committee would agree. I remain grateful to my
right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire for giving me the
opportunity to make up for the failure of my filing system and get onto
the new clause. It revealed some interesting thoughts, attitudes and
almost inbuilt reactions to just the three words, &#147;right to
buy&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012371000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the most interesting aspects is the simple maths involved. The
Minister seems to take the approach that simply says: when one sells a
house and builds another only one additional house has been created.
One has to recognise that somebody is living in the original house and
therefore the housing stock has been expanded. We may have gone a long
way to understand why there has been such difficulty in building the
required number of homes in the past 10 years and why as a nation we
will probably end up building fewer homes this year than last year.
That basic misunderstanding of mathematics has led to confusion within
the Government about the best way to go about building more homes. All
the facts and statistics are on our side. We built more homes, in
particular more social homes. New clause 8 proposed a way of building
even more. I hope that the Minister will reflect on that and give it
further consideration on Report.</div>

					<a name="08012371000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">If nothing
else, the debate was worth having because it gave the Minister the

Hampshire&#151;to paraphrase&#151;&#147;I thank you and
Mrs. Thatcher for the right to buy&#148;, which he
revealed has helped his family, as well as millions of
others.</div>

George Young:
						</b> We now sail into slightly calmer waters with
new clause 9, which has a breadth of political support denied to the
last two new clauses which we debated. This new clause deals with the
building regulations, and these regulations apply to all housing, not
just social housing. The new clause seeks to bring forward the
amendments to part M. The conditions I would like to see as part of
these amendments are set out in the new clause, and the new clause
suggests that these be implemented within six months of Royal
Assent.</div>
					<a name="08012371000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause touches on some of the arguments adduced in our debate a
fortnight ago on the first set of amendments. This can be found in
column 154 of the <i class="I">Official Report</i> and focused on the remit of
the HCA to promote accessibility of new housing. In that debate, in

					</div>
					<a name="08012371000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
very different from what is in the new clause, which has a much earlier
start date without the restriction to public sector homes. The right
hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, my hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Bedfordshire and the hon. Member for St. Ives also
intervened in our debate on January 10. I do not want to rehearse in
any detail the arguments I put forward then, but I will summarise the
present situation.</div>
					<a name="08012371000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current regulations are, in part, approved document M, which deals with
access to an use of buildings. This contains a requirement that for new
private dwellings, reasonable provision shall be made for disabled
people to gain access to and use the building. That is to say there is
a requirement to make sure all new private dwellings can be visited by
the disabled and other such individuals. There was an exchange as to
whether the regulations went further than covering people who visit. I
looked at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation website, and in particular a
page called &#147;The impact of Part M on the design of new
housing&#148;, which summarised the conclusions and found
that:</div>
					<a name="08012371000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Part M
is half-hearted and does not address the real housing needs of disabled
people, namely for liveable rather than visitable
housing.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012371000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the amendments introduced by the right hon. Gentleman<b class="B">;</b>
they are of real benefit to those who visit houses, but they do not go
quite as far as those in the new clause, which is why I have tabled it:
in order to press the Minister as to the Government&#146;s
intentions. The revisions that were introduced represent a step
forward, and I apologise if I did not pay a fulsome tribute to the
right hon. Gentleman in the earlier debate. They make accommodation
more accessible to those with disabilities, to young mothers with
buggies, to teenagers with broken legs, to visiting grandparents, and
to many others. It is good to have those facilities in-built when the
house is being constructed. These new controls, however, do not go the
go the whole way towards introducing the full lifetime home standards,
and further work is now needed to introduce and implement the remaining
elements.</div>
					<a name="08012371000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2003,

					<a name="08012371000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at a reply given by a
Minister in another place in December, it seems to me that the
Government are not planning to take forward the building regulations
but are relying on a non-regulatory code. I quote Baroness Royall of
Blaisdon:</div>
					<a name="08012371000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On the
lifetime home standard and housing for people with disability, the
Government have decided to take forward lifetime homes, at least in the

consider the code to be extremely important. Its aim is to give
developers a non-regulatory means of improving the sustainability of

went on to say:</div>
					<a name="08012371000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nor does
putting it in the code rule out making lifetime homes part of the
regulatory base in the long run. This is an issue which government will
continue to keep under close
review.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012371000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful therefore if the Government defined more clearly
whether they see the building regulations as the agency for driving
forward progress or whether they are going rely on non-regulatory
means. If they do have plans for further amendment to the building
regulations, what exactly is the time scale for them against the
background of the answer of four years ago I quoted from Lord
Rooker?</div>

							<a name="08012371000573"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> I wish to add two points to embellish the
excellent case made by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire.
First, before I was elected to this House, I sought in a previous life
as a professional officer to encourage registered social landlords and
local authorities to develop in new schemes the capacity to adapt
properties for those who may have a disability or who for other reasons
need to be able to adapt that property in future. I have welcomed the
lifetime homes standard. The new clause 9 brings this forward and seeks
to implement it as quickly as possible. I would hope that, given the
spirit in which the Government has moved this agenda on quite
significantly in the last ten years, they will accept this amendment
and the spirit in which this amendment is brought forward. I hope they
can find a way of speeding up the capacity to achieve this.</div>
					<a name="08012371000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point covers the role
of disabled facilities grants, as referred to by implication in
amendment  No. 9, which is grouped with new clause 9. I
strongly endorse the speedy introduction of these measures. The problem
is&#151;I am sure that many hon. and right hon. Members here have the
same experience as I do in my constituency&#151;the limitations of
the disabled facilities grants. The Government are seeking quite
rightly and with all-party support to do what they can to encourage
greater independent living for disabled people, for elderly people and
for others who may in the past have been living in institutional care.
We are encouraging people to live in their own homes and to enable them
with adaptation to achieve that. The disabled facilities grants are
part of the means by which this can be achieved. The waiting list to
achieve those adaptations is so great, however, that often that is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column452" />Column number: 452</div>extremely difficult and for those people waiting for those adaptations
it means that they are in quasi-institutional care or certainly
imprisoned in their own houses and unable to use all the facilities of
their home, including washing facilities.</div>
					<a name="08012371000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the amendment were accepted,
it would quite rightly put pressure on the Government to ensure that
the resources are in place to deliver disabled facilities grants and to
enable people to, quite rightly, live independently in their own
property. I hope that the Minister will take on board the spirit in
which the amendments have been tabled and, even if he is unable to
accept them as drafted, I hope he can find a way for the Government to
introduce some redrafts to achieve the same
objective.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000574"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I shall not detain the Committee for long, but
there are a number of issues that should be mentioned. I broadly
support the objectives of the right hon. Member for North-West
Hampshire in wanting to highlight the importance of improving the
standard of new housing, especially the provision of access for
disabled people. However, I fear that his new clause is defective in a
number of ways.</div>
					<a name="08012371000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first provision&#151;paragraph (a)&#151;is actually a statement of
the existing requirement in part M of the building regulations, so the
new clause would not take us beyond that. Indeed, the right hon.
Gentleman cited part M in his comments. He also quoted the Joseph
Rowntree Foundation as being rather defamatory about part M. In fact,
it warmly welcomed part M when it was introduced in 1999, and its then
chief executive, Lord Best, played a key role in brokering an agreement
between the disability lobby and the house builders&#151;indeed, he
paved the way for it. There had previously been some resistance on the
part of the house building industry towards the introduction of part M,
and I remember the Joseph Rowntree Foundation hosting an event in which
I participated on the day that the new part M came into force. At the
time, I had been heavily criticised by some of elements of the media
for doing away with the great British doorstep, and I well recall the
full support of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and many others,
including the disability lobby, for the introduction of part M in 1999.
As I said in a previous debate, part M had not been introduced by the
previous Conservative Government, despite strong pressure from the
disability lobby.</div>
					<a name="08012371000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I do not think that
paragraph (a) is needed, paragraph (b) is crucial because it refers to
lifetime homes. However, as the Minister has already made clear, the
Government are committed to the implementation of lifetime homes by
2011. The rushed implementation implicit in the new clause tabled by
the right hon. Gentleman is not appropriate. As a former Minister, he
will recall that an important but lengthy consultation process is
required to consider changes to building regulations. That is necessary
for a variety of reasons: to ensure that all relevant parties are
consulted; to consider all relevant technical issues; and to ensure
that the interface among proposed changes in one area of building
regulations and other areas are fully tested. Changes that might seem
desirable in one respect can have unfortunate consequences in
others.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000575"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> It is a pleasure to listen to a ministerial
reply being delivered from the Back Benches. The lifetime homes
standards apply only to public sector homes&#151;that was the
commitment. What length of time does the right hon. Gentleman think is
appropriate to make progress along the lines of paragraph (b), given
the need to consult with the house building
industry?</div>
					<a name="08012371000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000576"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I was about to describe the process and to say
that one of the conclusions that the Building Regulations Advisory
Committee has come to as a result of several recent changes is the
importance of better co-ordination of changes. Indeed, Local Authority
Building Control has pressed the Government not to introduce one-off
changes to individual regulations because that can cause a difficulty
with implementation. The right hon. Gentleman might recall that when
the latest change to part L was introduced, it was done in a way that
caused anxiety in the industry because people were not prepared and did
not have time to get the necessary arrangements in place for full
implementation.</div>
					<a name="08012371000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Six
months after the Act comes into force is a completely unrealistic
timetable in which to amend part M, particularly in a climate where
there is concern to achieve better co-ordination among the different
parts of the building regulations and to adopt a proper considered
approach towards the cumulative effects of changes on
buildings.</div>
					<a name="08012371000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
(c) of the new clause seems completely unfeasible. Anticipating the
changing needs of any occupiers of a building over their lifetime would
require the wisdom of Solomon. The right hon. Gentleman might have
that, but when he and I were born, we had no idea of the scope that
there is now for electronic contributions to so many aspects of our
lives. I am sure that other technological changes that no one can
possibly anticipate now will be made in an equivalent period, but that
is optimistic crystal ball
gazing.</div>
					<a name="08012371000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon.
Gentleman was right to raise the issue. It is important for us to
continue looking at ways in which we can improve standards coherently,
sensibly and in a way that the industry can implement. I hope that my
hon. Friend the Minister will give some assurances about the
Government&#146;s commitment to achieve that, while probably
rejecting the amendments and new
clause.</div>
					<a name="08012371000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000577"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I rise to discuss the sentiment behind the new
clause that was so ably moved by my right hon. Friend. I well remember
the pressures described by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich and the approaches of the disability lobby on this issue when
I was Minister for Disabled People. Their arguments reminded people
that this is about not only disability, but ageing. There is the cost
of adaptations to homes and the issues raised when people are happily
living somewhere with the feeling that they might have to leave and go
somewhere else. I found the argument that we should consider how
society gets older right at the beginning of the process of housing,
and think about these things in a rather different way, very
persuasive. I have always described involvement disability work as a
benevolent ratchet&#151;it always moves forward. Sometimes it does
not go quite as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 454</div>quickly as the lobby would like, but with a succession of Ministers,
both Labour and Conservative, it has moved in the right
direction.</div>
					<a name="08012371000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right
hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich was also right to indicate that
the general reaction of those asked to make changes, whether that is in
transport, government or private development, is usually to say no
first and to stall. We then see adaptations coming through as we are
doing with transport and the like. It might not be possible for the
Minister to accept the new clause, but the arguments behind it are
still valid. If we do not make changes quite like this, what will we
do? Will we continue to have a process whereby due to the pressure of
building new houses, we build them with smaller spaces for people? We
are living in smaller units than we used to and the problem could get
worse.</div>
					<a name="08012371000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">To what extent
are the Government prepared to give guidance and, even if they cannot
accept such a new clause, to say that there will be some changes and
that they will be thinking about this sensibly for the future? This is
about not future costs, but saving future costs in the long run. My
right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire presented his
case extremely well and the sentiment of the Committee is clear. I will
be interested by how the Minister responds and what reassurances he can
give us for the
future.</div>
					<a name="08012371000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000578"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> This has been a high-quality debate, and my right
hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich has already made many
of my points. I cannot really stand up, following the consideration of
the last new clause, without commenting on what the hon. Member for
Welwyn Hatfield said in praise of Mrs. Thatcher. One of the
reasons why I am in the Labour party is because of Mrs.
Thatcher, who decimated the north-east and my constituency. Forgive me
for that little rant, Mr. Benton, because we have had a
well-meaning and high-quality
debate.</div>
					<a name="08012371000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I point out to
the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire that we made significant
improvements in access to, and the use of, buildings in the last update
of part M of the building regulations in 2004. Further measures to
improve access and use have been developed through the lifetime homes
standards, as we have mentioned on several occasions during our
consideration of the Bill, not least today. As I said, lifetime homes
standards are now included in the code for sustainable homes.</div>
					<a name="08012371000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our response to the public
consultation on the code for sustainable homes, we clearly indicated
our intended direction of travel and our speed, with lifetime homes
standards required at code level 6 from 2008, code level 4 from 2010
and code level 3 from 2013. Moreover, from 2011, all new publicly
funded housing will be built to include lifetime homes standards, and
many schemes now starting on site will include those standards once
they are completed.</div>
					<a name="08012371000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
visited a development in Newcastle upon Tyne&#151;another area that
was decimated by Mrs. Thatcher&#151;where houses with
lifetime homes standards were being built. Their density and size and
the amount of space were incredibly impressive. We continue to work
with stakeholders in the private sector to encourage further uptake of
the lifetime homes standards.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column455" />Column number: 455</div>
					<a name="08012371000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">We said that by 2012 we would
review the uptake of LHS in all sectors to assess whether legislation
was required to meet our long-term targets, which brings me on to the
subject of possible regulation. In March 2004, a commitment was made to
review the feasibility of including LHS in part M of the building
regulations. That was done, and one of the findings of the review was
that the standards were not in a form suitable to support legislation
and that they required updating  and refining.</div>
					<a name="08012371000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since then,
we have supported steps to address the issues. For example, on 11
January, the British Standards Institution published a draft for
development on accessible homes, which will provide the basis for the
review and development of the existing lifetime homes standards. We
will ask the Building Regulations Advisory Committee to form a working
party to contribute to the consultation on the draft for development,
and it is envisaged that the working group will include a number of
main BRAC members and seconded experts. We are committed to working
with stakeholders to develop the most economic and robust way of
delivering the benefits of lifetime homes
standards.</div>
					<a name="08012371000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a vital process, as it is widely recognised that the existing
standards are not applicable to all housing types and that the
technical guidance needs to be clarified and updated. Legislating on
the basis of the current lifetime homes standards would be imprudent as
they might lead to a significant number of appeals and disputes if they
were translated into regulatory form.</div>
					<a name="08012371000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important that we take
this opportunity to ensure that the guidelines on lifetime homes
standards are robust and will succeed in delivering the accessible and
adaptable housing that is needed. That will also ensure that the
lifetime homes standards are fit for regulation, if that proves
necessary in the future.</div>
					<a name="08012371000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon. Friend the Member
for Greenwich and Woolwich rightly mentioned the process for amending
building regulations and he made his point very well. The process is
lengthy and detailed, and it requires the formal amendment of the
building regulations&#151;the secondary legislation made under the
powers in section 1 of the Building Act 1984.</div>
					<a name="08012371000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the right hon. Member for
North-West Hampshire is aware, to amend the regulations, we are obliged
by law to follow a procedure that is likely to involve a review of
existing legislation, a public consultation on proposed changes
following the review, and the notification of draft and final amended
guidance to the European Commission, in addition to the time required
for the drafting and review of a highly technical subject. On that
basis, I hope that the Committee will agree that the proposed time
scale of six months is unrealistic.</div>
					<a name="08012371000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must also ensure that the
industry has sufficient time to adapt its practices and designs to
incorporate lifetime homes standards. That is particularly true for
smaller developers and house builders that will be working to the
standards for the first time and might not have the resources of larger
organisations. As the draft standards mature during 2008 and 2009,
builders will have the opportunity to visit early adopting schemes and
to review emerging housing typologies. That will help to provide the
entire house building 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column456" />Column number: 456</div>industry with the necessary confidence and understanding to adopt and
implement lifetime homes
standards.</div>
					<a name="08012371000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer
to the right hon. Gentleman, as a result of the considerations, I think
that regulation is not the best way to proceed. Amendment No. 11 would
add the word &#147;accessibility&#148; to clause 173(1)(a) so that
it would read:</div>
					<a name="08012371000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The regulator may set
standards for registered providers as
to&#151;</div>
					<a name="08012371000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) the
nature,
extent,&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012371000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">accessibility</div>
					<a name="08012371000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
quality of the social housing to be provided by
them&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012371000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no doubt
that we will discuss clause 173 in more detail in the future. I
understand that a large number of amendments have been tabled on that
important part of the Bill. The aim of clause 173(1) is to specify in
what general activities the regulator may set standards, namely the
nature and extent of social housing, and the nature, extent and quality
of accommodation facilities and services provided in connection with
social housing. That means that only issues connected with social
housing are
covered.</div>
				
					<a name="08012371000442"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div>
					<a name="08012371000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Standards for
the design of new homes and the wider built infrastructure will not be
a matter for the regulator, although they might be of concern to the
Homes and Communities Agency. There are activities to do with
accessibility of social housing where it would be appropriate for the
regulator to set standards. I suggest to the right hon. Member for
North-West Hampshire that those are covered by clause 173(1)(b), which
permits</div>
					<a name="08012371000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the nature,
extent and quality of accommodation, facilities or services provided by
them in connection with social housing.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012371000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, a specific mention of
accessibility would be an unnecessary level of detail in subsection
(1).</div>
					<a name="08012371000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 9
would also amend clause 173, and would add to the list of areas where
standards may by issued. It would add a new paragraph (m), which says
that standards may cover the timely facilitation of adaptations to
tenants&#146; homes for the disabled. We are back to the list
principle that we have mentioned many times. The measure is not
necessary because clause 173(1)(b) already allows the regulator to set
standards in the area&#151;for social housing only&#151;and it can
do so when it is appropriate and necessary. The new clause would not
compel the regulator to set standards. It is the regulator&#146;s
decision what to set standards on, through consultation with
stakeholders on what those should be.</div>
					<a name="08012371000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is no Housing
Corporation regulation, choosing to regulate in the future would be an
additional burden on housing associations. We are committed to reducing
the burdens on the sector, and it is a clear objective of the regulator
to regulate with minimal interference. Housing associations currently
meet the cost of small adaptations from their own resources, but larger
ones require outside funding.</div>
					<a name="08012371000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">We strongly
encourage the adaptation of suitable homes. Our disabled facilities
grant, which we may discuss in subsequent new clauses, enables people
to continue to live independently in their own homes, by funding
adaptations to meet their needs. It is highly successful, with
Government funding increasing from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 457</div>&#163;57 million in 1997 to &#163;126 million
last year. In 2008-09, funding will increase by 20 per cent., bringing
the disabled facilities grant budget to &#163;146 million per
year.</div>
					<a name="08012371000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite the
success of the disabled facilities grant, we accept that the programme
is still in need of improvement. That is why we launched a
cross-departmental review of the programme, and a package of changes to
improve it will be announced shortly. I believe that the Housing
Corporation currently expects associations to provide tenants with
adaptations where required, and it is expected to make provision for
this in its business plans. If so, that might be an issue for the Homes
and Communities Agency to address in grant provisions.</div>
					<a name="08012371000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have addressed
that thoroughly enough for the Committee, and on that basis I hope that
the right hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
motion.</div>
					<a name="08012371000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000579"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> It would be unduly aggressive of me to do
what the hon. Gentleman implied and press the matter to a vote. I want
to make a number of short points, however.</div>
					<a name="08012371000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that the Blair Government was able to do things that the Major
Government did not do in this sector. I need to reassure people that
the Cameron Government will do things that the Brown Government was not
able to do. If one looks at the development of improved facilities for
disabled people, there is a continuum through all parties beginning, in
my political lifetime, with Alf Morris, which has gone right through
and has been apolitical. My anxiety is that there should not be a loss
of momentum.</div>
					<a name="08012371000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich mentioned that in 1999 he
introduced the regulations that we have referred to. That is what he
achieved between 1997 and 1999. My concern is that the trail should not
now go cold. Here we are in 2008, and the building regulations do not
seem to have moved forward enormously. A working party is going to
consult, but the Minister was not able to give specific dates on the
building regulations. I welcome what he said about sustainable homes
and lifetime homes standards, but I think that that is all
non-statutory. It is voluntary and does not have the teeth that the
building regulations will have. If we do not achieve the progress that
we want, it may be necessary to revive the building regulations as the
engine of progress.</div>
					<a name="08012371000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been a useful debate.
The Minister has shed some light on the matter and his heart is clearly
in the right place, but it is an area that we may have to keep an eye
on to maintain the momentum. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div>

Bill&#151;the HCA and the regulator of social housing. The Committee
will know that disability discrimination legislation came into force in
December 2006. It places a duty on certain public authorities to
produce a disability equality scheme. The HCA&#146;s predecessor,
English Partnerships, has been under specific duties to promote
disability equality. The Minister implied that the Government were
going to do what the new clause does when he
said:</div>
					<a name="08012371000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We will

public authorities.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Housing

							<a name="08012371000583"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The Minister for Housing has written to the
Committee explaining our intentions regarding the equalities duties in
primary legislation, following a degree of probing in the oral evidence
sessions in December. She was clear that, in relation to the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995, there is no need for further legislative
amendment as the Act contains a general duty that applies to all public
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08012371000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
like to reassure the right hon. Gentleman and hon. Members that we also
intend to amend the Disability Discrimination (Public Authorities)
(Statutory Duties) Regulations 2005 by order during the transition
period from the existing bodies to the Homes and Communities
Agency&#151;that is the key point on timetabling. That will ensure
that the Homes and Communities Agency is subject to the specific duty.
Primary legislation is not necessary to do that. We also intend to
amend the regulations pertaining to sexual discrimination, so that the
agency is subject to the same specific duties under those regulations.
I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column459" />Column number: 459</div>imagine that the same timetable will apply. I hope that he will see that
we intend to do very much as he wishes and more in the
future.</div>
					<a name="08012371000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may be
some confusion regarding amendment No. 10. It would certainly not
achieve its outlined purpose as currently worded. Clause 173(1)
outlines the general area in which the regulator can set standards,
which is basically on social housing and services connected to social
housing. The amendment would not impose a statutory duty. It would not
require the regulator to do anything. It is also far too detailed to be
included in clause
173(1).</div>
					<a name="08012371000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may also
be some confusion over the status of housing associations and the
coverage of the disability equality duty. This applies only to public
authorities like the regulator; it does not apply to housing
associations, which the right hon. Gentleman knows are independent,
non-public bodies. I lay that down as a marker for consideration next
week.</div>
					<a name="08012371000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">Housing
associations therefore have no duties under the section 49A of the
Disability Discrimination Act. The Housing Corporation currently
encourages them to voluntarily follow that duty and produce a
disability equality scheme. Its regulatory code addresses disability
and equal opportunity
issues.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000585"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a
Second
time.</div>
					<a name="08012371000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I hope that this debate need not be too protracted. The new clause
would introduce choice-based disability housing registers. Disability
organisations are very keen on that and they want local authorities to
set up accessible housing registers as part of choice-based lettings.
Accessible housing registers would gather consistent data on vacant
accessible or adapted homes and ensure that the properties are let to
disabled people who need those features and that they are given
priority over others in the bids for them. This would save money by
ensuring that more efficient use is made of existing accessible and
adapted housing. Unless local authorities operate something like that,
all the evidence is that disabled people in housing will wait longer
than non-disabled people for a property that meets their needs.
Disabled people can be placed in residential care or face longer stays
in hospital while an accessible property is found. Many adapted houses
are let to non-disabled people as a housing department strives to meet
some of the targets that the Government invite them to meet in void
turnaround times. Often that is because they cannot locate a suitable
prospective tenant within the time
limit.</div>
					<a name="08012371000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Research shows
that for lettings in the social housing sector, on average only one in
six wheelchair-standard dwellings was let to a household containing a
wheelchair user despite an overwhelming demand for wheelchair-standard
property from wheelchair users. That is a frightening statistic and an
economic and social waste. If adapted property is not used efficiently,
it leads to adaptations being ripped out and thrown away, in contrast
to the ballooning demand for disabled facilities grants, to which the
Minister
referred.</div>
					<a name="08012371000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a nutshell, operating one of those registers would enable a more
efficient allocations process by more accurately matching people to a
property that meets their needs. It would provide more accurate
information on future and current housing demand, and that information
would inform the local authority&#146;s assessment of future housing
need in their area. It would save money by enabling a disabled person
to move out of a hospital or residential care more quickly. It would
also enable the recycling of adaptations as the register would identify
those who needed them. The late Disability Rights Commission calculated
that if all local authorities in England had operated one of those
registers in 2006, more than &#163;70 million could have been saved,
money that could have been reinvested in meeting housing
need.</div>
					<a name="08012371000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that the Government do not know how many local authorities have these
registers. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column461" />Column number: 461</div>disability equality scheme includes a commitment to establish what the
role is for AHRs within the context of choice-based letting. It seems
that there is a mismatch between properties available and the needs of
those looking for them. There should be more of these registers. It
would help if the Government could shed some light on where they are
heading in this important
area.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000586"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I rise to support the general tenor of my right hon.
Friend&#146;s remarks. I am not aware that local authorities have
quotas for the number of houses that should be available. I had an
issue recently with one of my own local planning authorities on behalf
of a constituent where it was difficult to ascertain whether there were
sufficient properties in the area available for those with
disabilities. The council quite properly believes it is providing for
the reasonable needs of those in the area but it was difficult to work
out quotas or anything else because no accurate figure
exists.</div>
					<a name="08012371000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">This all fits
with remarks I made earlier about the issues of an ageing society where
more people are in need of that sort of property. Our general approach
is to try to be transparent and permissive and the proposal would help
by making information available for organisations and individuals. It
would assist local authorities without necessarily demanding or
requiring that they adhere to a fixed number, which might change at any
stage. We could all do with such information.</div>
					<a name="08012371000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister is not minded
to amend the legislation perhaps he might indicate how, through some
other form of guidance, the information might be made available to the
public, because it would help developers, local authorities and those
with responsibility for the provision of housing in the future. It
would certainly help individuals or families who are looking for
information about what is available in their area and would give a
general sense of the sort of issues we face, and the number of
properties that might be needed. It would be valuable information, some
of which might surprise the general public. If they were aware of just
how acute the need was, they might realise that provision was not
nearly as great as they
thought.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000587"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> I hope the Minister will address the question of
what legal restrictions under present regulation there are on local
authorities to apply such a disability housing register&#151;in other
words, to favour someone with a disability for whom a property would be
appropriate even though otherwise they have a lower housing need than
someone else on the housing register. In implementing a decision to
favour someone with a lesser housing need, and thus a lesser rating,
what are the restrictions on local authorities at present?
</div>
					<a name="08012371000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully endorse
everything that the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire said but
it would be very helpful if the Minister could give clarification,
which could be conveyed to many local authorities that do not much
differentiate in their decisions on properties&#151;often scarce
properties&#151;that are already adapted to meet the needs of a
disabled person.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column462" />Column number: 462</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000588"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I rise with trepidation to respond to a debate
which includes a former housing Minister, the right hon. Member for
North-West Hampshire, and a former Minister for Social Security and
Disabled People, the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire&#151;very good Ministers, given their political
complexion.</div>
					<a name="08012371000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
enjoyed the debate and understand and appreciate fully the sentiments
behind the amendment. I recognise that, as the right hon. Gentleman and
others have eloquently said, it is of enormous importance that people
with disabilities and access needs are housed appropriately.</div>
					<a name="08012371000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have mentioned the
disabilities facilities grant a number of times today. Each year, that
programme helps about 35,000 disabled and older people to live safely
and independently in their homes by making adaptations and improvements
such as wheelchair ramps, stairlifts and downstairs bathrooms. I have
mentioned the increase in funding from &#163;57 million in 1997 to
&#163;138 million in 2007-08, rising to &#163;146 million next
year.</div>
					<a name="08012371000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate how important it is that disabled people looking for social
housing have the right level of priority for housing that meets their
needs, and I hope that addresses the point that the hon. Member for St.
Ives touched on in his contribution. That is why the Government
recently amended the legislation governing how housing authorities
allocate social housing to make it clear that giving reasonable
preference for an allocation&#151;giving priority for local authority
housing to people who have medical and welfare grounds for moving
house&#151;includes people who have to move because of a disability.
The amendment in section 223 of the Housing Act 2004 came into force in
April 2005 and was intended to meet concerns that the term
&#147;medical grounds&#148; was being interpreted too narrowly by
some local authorities and that people with disabilities were being
disadvantaged as a result.</div>
					<a name="08012371000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government want local authorities and social landlords to make the best
use of housing stock, including accommodation that is accessible or has
been adapted. I recognise that the so-called accessible housing
registers can be useful in that regard. However, I frankly do not
believe that forcing local authorities to compile registers is the
right way forward. I believe that it would be burdensome and could be
counterproductive; rather, it should be for local authorities&#151;to
return to the point about local discretion&#151;to decide whether a
register would meet their local needs and, if so, to set it up in a way
that best suits those
needs.</div>
					<a name="08012371000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
although I appreciate that information about the overall stock of
accessible housing can be useful, I believe it is more important for
disabled people to have information about suitable, accessible property
that is actually available to them. The Government see the merits of
disabled housing registers and have taken a number of steps to
encourage local authorities to adopt that approach. The current code of
guidance on allocations recommends that housing authorities maintain
lists of properties that are suitable for disabled people and other
special needs groups.</div>
					<a name="08012371000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">The draft choice-based lettings
code of guidance, which we issued for consultation last year, builds on
that approach and provides detailed advice on how to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 463</div>incorporate accessible housing within a choice-based lettings scheme and
encourages local authorities to maintain lists and databases of
accessible housing. It also advises on the type of information that
should be contained in such databases.</div>
					<a name="08012371000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">My Department&#146;s
disability equality scheme, which was published last December, included
a commitment to examine the role and effectiveness of disabled housing
registers within the context of our choice-based lettings policy. My
officials will commission that work in the next few weeks, with a view
to issuing good practice by the end of the year. The
Department&#146;s disability equality scheme is also committed to the
development of the national register of social housing, which sets a
national standard for measuring accessibility and calls on social
housing landlords to produce consistent accessibility information for
each dwelling by April
2010.</div>
					<a name="08012371000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
anecdotal information suggests that local authorities are recognising
the benefits of accessible housing registers and that take-up is
increasing. We have just announced that we are making available an
extra &#163;168,000 to assist in implementing a London-wide
accessible housing register as part of the pan-London choice and
mobility scheme called Capital
Moves.</div>
					<a name="08012371000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">The London
accessible housing register was launched last September and will be
implemented over the next 18 months. I pledge to the Committee and to
the hon. Member for St. Ives that I will ensure that good practice
emerging from that exercise is spread to other social landlords to
encourage and assist them in implementing an accessible housing
register.</div>
					<a name="08012371000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
recognise that it can be useful to have information about the stock of
accessible housing in a district, I have found that disabled people
really want to know whether the house or flat that is available to rent
meets their access needs. The key lies with social landlords adopting
letting schemes that offer tenants more of a say in choosing where they
live. Under a choice-based lettings approach, landlords can ensure that
the advert for an accessible vacancy specifies the type and level of
adaptation and who was allowed to bid for the property. Local
authorities could thus ensure that accessible housing was prioritised
for disabled people, who could then choose housing that met their
individual and specified access needs. That is the best way to make
sure, as far as possible, that disabled people are matched to suitable
housing.</div>
					<a name="08012371000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would require local authorities to put in place a service to
support disabled people in bidding for properties on the register of
accessible properties. We recognise that some people with disabilities
may need additional assistance or support to take part in a
choice-based letting scheme, which is why we introduced a provision in
the Homelessness Act 2002 that required housing authorities to ensure
that such assistance is available free of charge. The draft statutory
CBL code of guidance, to which I referred a moment or two ago, provides
detailed advice on how local authorities can support disabled people
and enable them successfully to take part in CBL schemes. The good
practice that we are commissioning will back that up with practical
guidance, drawing on the experience of choice-based letting schemes,
so, with the greatest respect to the right 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column464" />Column number: 464</div>hon. Member for North-West Hampshire, that aspect of the new clause adds
nothing to what the Government are already
doing.</div>
					<a name="08012371000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
new clause envisages local authorities maintaining a register of
disabled people. In the Homelessness Act 2002 the Government repealed
the duty to maintain a register of housing applicants. It would seem to
go against the grain of moving towards minimum regulation and minimum
added burdens, to introduce an obligation on housing authorities to
maintain a register of disabled applicants
only.</div>
					<a name="08012371000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have set out the Government&#146;s intentions in detail&#151;we are
probably on the same page with both the right hon. Gentleman and the
hon. Gentleman. On that basis, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman
will withdraw the
motion.</div>

					<a name="08012371000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
moving new clause 12 I shall take a vow of silence&#151;for the rest
of the day. The new clause is important as it would prevent tenants on
assured tenancies from being evicted when the reason for the eviction
was a failure to pay housing benefit. I am sure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column465" />Column number: 465</div>that all hon. Members have constituents who are
given notice by their landlord because the local authority has failed
to pay their housing benefit on
time.</div>
					<a name="08012371000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would amend ground 8 in schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1988.
Before someone jumps up to say that I want to amend an Act that I put
on the statute book, in 1988 there was an important discontinuity in my
ministerial career because of the poll tax&#151;someone else put the
Act on the statute
book.</div>
					<a name="08012371000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Private
landlords and housing associations can use ground 8 to seek possession
of accommodation let on an assured tenancy where the tenant is behind
with the rent by two months or more. Unlike other grounds for
possession, this one is mandatory. The court has no discretion whatever
to deny the order for possession if the rent is in arrears. My new
clause would give the court some discretion in cases where housing
benefit issues are outstanding. The discretion does not extend to other
reasons, only where housing benefit is the reason for the
arrears.</div>
					<a name="08012371000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">About 2.5
million households are in receipt of housing benefit to help them with
the rent. While many local authorities administer housing benefit
efficiently, sadly there are elements of poor administration in many
local authorities. That, in turn, leads to debt and rent arrears for
tenants. Research by Shelter across three county courts found that
arrears were linked to problems with housing benefit in 70 per cent. of
possession cases.</div>
					<a name="08012371000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said a moment ago, ground 8 is mandatory. It requires the court to
grant outright possession when the tenant has two months rent arrears
both at the time of the notice of possession and at the time of the
court hearing. If those conditions are satisfied, the court has no
discretion to refuse an order, whatever the reasons for the arrears, or
even to adjourn the claim. The ground is open to private landlords and
housing associations who use assured shorthold tenancies, but it is not
available to local
authorities.</div>

					<a name="08012371000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">A survey was
carried out into how 116 of the largest housing associations were using
ground 8. In 2000, the National Housing Federation found that 16 per
cent. of possession orders were granted on the basis of ground 8. Some
associations have policies stating that they will not use ground 8, and
many have adopted positive alternative strategies to deal with rent
arrears in order to manage them rather than evict. However, in
Shelter&#146;s experience, some associations are using ground 8 in
cases in which housing benefit claims are outstanding in order to show
improvements in the collection of rent arrears. They are not taking
appropriate steps to liaise with the housing benefit departments or to
help their tenants to resolve the housing benefit or the debt
problem.</div>

Gentleman. He will not be alone in experiencing heavy criticism of this

exercise discretion when they ought to; and by landlords, who may use
the provision in order to try to speed up the local authority 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column466" />Column number: 466</div>but then discover that they have unleashed a process that is
irreversible because the court does not have any discretion. The right
hon. Gentleman makes a very strong point. I intervene simply to say
that he has a great deal of sympathy from my side of the Committee.

George Young:
						</b> I am much obliged to the right hon.
Gentleman; I value his endorsement of my new clause.</div>
					<a name="08012371000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">A rent arrears protocol came
into effect in 2006. It is part of the civil procedure rules, and it
sets out measures that social landlords should take before starting
possession proceedings on the basis of rent arrears. Theoretically, the
protocol applies to ground 8 claims, but it will have no practical
effect because the court does not have the power to dismiss or adjourn
claims. The Scottish Executive have already introduced measures to
prevent eviction of tenants for rent arrears caused by housing benefit
problems. Section 12 of the Homelessness etc. (Scotland) Act 2003
amends ground 8, as I propose in the new clause.</div>
					<a name="08012371000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not a theoretical
problem. I refer briefly to the case of North British Housing
Association Ltd <i class="I">v</i>. Matthews and others in 2004. The housing
association brought proceedings under ground 8 despite being aware that
the tenant had an outstanding housing benefit claim. The county court
judge decided that he had no choice but to grant an outright possession
order. Miss Matthews subsequently received a backdated payment of
housing benefit that cleared her arrears completely and put her rent
account into credit. None the less, the possession order still
stood.</div>
					<a name="08012371000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Court of
Appeal held that when ground 8 was involved, the county court had no
power even to adjourn the hearing to await a housing benefit payment
unless there were exceptional circumstances. Understandably, the Court
of Appeal was troubled by the situation. Lord Justice Dyson
said:</div>
					<a name="08012371000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
acknowledge that this conclusion will lead to tenants who are in
receipt of housing benefit having no defence to a claim for possession
in circumstances where they are not at fault. The statutory scheme is,
therefore, potentially draconian in its
application.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012371000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
far, all my pleas have fallen on deaf ears. However, I have hopes that
this, the last new clause that I shall
move&#151;</div>

							<a name="08012371000593"></a>Margaret
Moran:
						</b> I, too, rise to support the right hon. Gentleman.
It is a long-standing aberration. The fact is that some social
landlords have deliberately used the tenant in a ploy to force the
local authority to improve its housing benefit administration through
ground 8. It is an absolute travesty of the intention behind all the
work that we have been discussing.</div>
					<a name="08012371000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it not the case that even
when a local authority acknowledges that it has erred in its
administration and tries to make a hardship payment&#151;something
that it can do under the housing benefit remit, although it cannot to
do so to prevent possession&#151;it will in effect cause them further
expense, as they will have to pick up the homelessness
costs?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000594"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> The hon. Lady is right. The court cannot
take into account what the local authority might be doing to remedy the
position. If my oratory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column467" />Column number: 467</div>failed to move the Minister, I am sure that he will have been touched by
that intervention&#151;as well as by the powerful advocacy from the
right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000595"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> How can I possibly refuse the last amendment from
the right hon. Gentleman? I will do my best to do so. I have a great
deal of sympathy for his contribution. I think he made his case
extremely well. I do appreciate the intention behind the amendment is
to protect tenants from being evicted where, frankly, failure to pay
the rent that is due is not of their own making.</div>
					<a name="08012371000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I am reluctantly
forced to say to him that the proposed amendment is not a necessary
change. Landlords have a reasonable expectation of receiving rent for
their property in good time. It would not be fair to expect landlords
who let to tenants on housing benefit to be treated differently from
those who do not. Where tenants rely on housing benefit to pay their
rent, local authorities should process claims efficiently and in good
time and landlords should not be penalised by their failure to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08012371000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate what
the right hon. Gentleman was saying, but I am concerned that the
unintended consequence of this amendment could be that a greater number
of landlords would be disinclined to let to tenants on housing benefit.
The Government are doing their best to address the perception of some
landlords that housing benefit claimants somehow pose a higher risk
than other tenants because of difficulties they have experienced with
housing benefit administration.</div>
					<a name="08012371000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Department for Work and
Pensions has put in place a number of measures to improve housing
benefit administration, including the introduction of clear national
performance standards, regular monitoring and inspections, measures to
intervene in poor-performing authorities, and a &#163;200 million
standards fund to help local authorities invest in training and new IT
facilities. As a result of this, standards of administration have
started to improve, both on average and for the poorest performing
local authorities.</div>
					<a name="08012371000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government will continue to
place a high priority on improving the administration of housing
benefit. The introduction of the Local Housing Allowance last April is
also likely to shorten the time tenants have to wait for assistance
with their rent. Since the LHA is a flat-rate payment, based on the
size of the household and the area it is in, there will no longer be a
need for individual rent determinations, which contribute to a delay in
processing claims. In addition, the LHA figures for each area will be
published in advance, which means that tenants will be able to make an
informed choice about the level of rent they can
afford.</div>
					<a name="08012371000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000596"></a>Mr.
Love:
						</b> I welcome my hon. Friend&#146;s comments on the
LHA and some of the changes that have been made to speed up the housing
benefit delivery from local authorities. Does he accept, however, the
concern that exists on both sides of the Committee today that if the
only reason we can give for rejecting this amendment is that we are
improving the delivery of housing benefit, the experience of all
Members of what is actually 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column468" />Column number: 468</div>happening in housing benefit administration would not allow us to accept
that that is likely to do enough to protect affected
tenants?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000597"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I understand what my hon. Friend has said. In
reply, I would say that if the roll-out of the LHA is successful, this
amendment should not be required. If it were to be accepted, the
amendment could still deter landlords from letting to tenants who
receive the LHA. The concerted effort by the DWP in trying to improve
matters will have an impact. However, I have taken on board the
sentiments of the Committee and I can take them away and have a look;
but as I said, that push toward improving standards and performance is
a key
point.</div>
					<a name="08012371000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000598"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> Can I leave this final thought with him? On
Thursday, we will be debating the social housing regulator. The Bill
states that the second objective of the regulator
is</div>
					<a name="08012371000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to ensure that actual
or potential tenants of social housing have an appropriate degree of
&#151;</div>
					<a name="08012371000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) choice,
and</div>
					<a name="08012371000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
protection.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012371000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would it not
be unfortunate if our new regulator, when established, decided that as
a result of existing landlord and tenant powers, tenants do not have an
appropriate degree of protection because the mandatory grounds for
possession in such cases means that, through no fault of their own,
they can be evicted due to the failure of a body to administer housing
benefit efficiently? That cannot be a satisfactory position. It would
be most embarrassing for the Government if the regulator were to reach
that conclusion.</div>
					<a name="08012371000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
urge my hon. Friend to give further thought to this matter in the
ensuing period because however much the administration of housing
benefit improves, there is always the risk of error and delay in such a
complex scheme. It is clearly unwise to leave individuals so vulnerable
when no discretion is available to the
court.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000599"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My right hon. Friend makes a good point.
Notwithstanding the points that I was trying to make about the
Department for Work and Pensions and improving performance, my right
hon. Friend, the Minister for Housing, has recently commissioned a
major review of the private rented sector. That will take place in the
next couple of months. The review will look at the experiences of
landlords and tenants. I will instruct the review to look at this
matter closely and keep the Committee informed. On that basis, I hope
that the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire will not press the
motion.</div>
					<a name="08012371000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000600"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> Well, the fact is that in Scotland, it has
already been decided that the courts will have this discretion. As far
as I am aware, it has not had a hugely adverse impact on housing
benefit. It has not led to tenants falling into arrears or to landlords
being reluctant to let to people on housing benefit. We are talking
about a measure that a judge has described as draconian. I would like
the Minister to say that in the light of the debate on the new clause,
he will go away and see whether there are ways of letting the
courts  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 469</div>have the discretion that all members of the Committee would like them to
have. He might have said that already, but I would like to hear him say
it again.</div>
					<a name="08012371000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause
says:</div>
					<a name="08012371000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If the
court is satisfied ... that some rent is in arrears as a
consequence of a delay or failure in the payment of relevant housing
benefit, it shall not make an order for possession unless it considers
it reasonable to do
so.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012371000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the thrust
of the new clause and I cannot for the life of me see what is
objectionable about it. If the Minister says that between now and the
Report stage, he will have another look at this issue so that if there
is another debate about it on Report he might have something more
constructive to say, I will not press the motion. A little bit of body
language from the Minister would assist. We now have that, so on that
basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div>

time.</div>
					<a name="08012371000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
tabled the new clause, along with my hon. Friend the Member for
Montgomeryshire. We have not left the province of legalese. The new
clause is in an area of highly complex law and technicality&#151;for
me, if not for others. A tenant can become a trespasser in their own
home, but until a court order is executed&#151;in other words, they
are evicted&#151;they are know as tolerated
trespassers.</div>
					<a name="08012371000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
can become tolerated trespassers in two situations. First, a court
could make a suspended possession order against a secure or assured
tenant stating that the landlord should recover possession of the
property on a certain day, but that enforcement of the order should be
suspended on terms. Those could include the payment of the current rent
plus weekly instalments of the arrears. Secondly, when a court makes an
outright possession order, the landlord could allow the former tenant
to stay on and not enforce the order on the basis that payments are
kept up.</div>
					<a name="08012371000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once a person
becomes a tolerated trespasser, they enter into a state of limbo, in
which they cease to have any of the contractual or statutory rights
that they formerly enjoyed as a secure tenant. The new clause would
abolish that state of limbo and the entire concept of the tolerated
trespasser by ensuring that the tenancy does not end on the date when
the possession order takes effect, but only on actual eviction from the
premises, in other words, the execution of the possession
order.</div>
					<a name="08012371000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a tolerated
trespasser, the loss of the tenancy agreement, with all of its rights
and obligations, can have far-reaching implications for a tenant.
Tolerated trespassers cannot require their landlord to carry out
repairs; they cannot exercise any of the charter rights in the Housing
Act 1985, such as the right to a mutual exchange or the right to take
in lodgers or the right to consultation on matters of housing
management and of course, the right to
buy.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08012371000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately
for members of the tolerated trespasser&#146;s family, rights of
succession on death are also lost. The tolerated trespasser can revive
their former tenancy by applying for a further court order varying or
discharging the original possession order, but where a warrant of
possession has been issued, the tenancy will not be revived by an order
suspending the warrant on terms. As I have said, the situation is
highly complex and technical&#151;hence I am sticking to my notes
assiduously&#151;and most occupiers in this situation do not realise
that they have lost their tenancies or, if they do, do not understand
how to revive
them.</div>
					<a name="08012371000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause adopts a form of words recommended by the Law Commission in
its draft rented homes Bill. The Bill would abolish the concept of the
tolerated trespasser by ensuring that the tenancy did not end on the
date when the possession order takes effect, but only on the date of
the actual eviction from the premises. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div>The new clause would also act to revive the tenancies of all those
tolerated trespassers who are still in their homes, as if those
tenancies had not ended. Where a tolerated trespasser pays off all the
arrears and costs due under the order, the new clause provides that the
tenancy will revive automatically, when the rent account goes into
credit. I hope that the state of limbo that is created by law at
present can be dealt with in that manner, and I hope that the Minister
has taken on board the considerations and proposals within the new
clause. I look forward to his
response.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000602"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I had my fingers burned during consideration of
the last new clause, so I will tread a little more carefully this time.
I fully appreciate the motivation behind the new clause, which as the
hon. Gentleman has eloquently pointed out, seeks to deal with the
problems caused by tolerated trespassers. The Government&#146;s
concern is to protect the interests of both landlords and tenants and
to ensure that a good balance is maintained between them. I recognise
that the creation by the courts of tolerated trespasser status causes
serious problems for tenants and landlords alike. In the first place,
neither landlord nor tenant can rely on the provisions in the relevant
Housing Acts or on the terms of their tenancy agreement. For the
tenant, probably the most serious consequence is that no succession
will be possible on death. For the landlord, problems will include
uncertainty about entitlement to rent, particularly annual increases in
rent, and about whether tolerated trespassers should be allowed to vote
in such things as stock transfers and tenant management
ballots.</div>
					<a name="08012371000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
remedies already exist to restore tenancy status individually to
existing tolerated trespassers. A tenant can ask the court to exercise
its discretion to amend the original possession order by resetting the
date for possession in the future. However, that can only occur on a
case-by-case basis, which, as the Committee will be aware, is both
costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, tenants are usually unaware of
the remedy, as they are of the fact that they have become tolerated
trespassers.</div>
					<a name="08012371000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not underestimate the size of the problem. Government statistics
suggest that there could be about 250,000 to 300,000 people in social
housing who are now classed as tolerated trespassers. It is not an
insignificant matter, and it needs to be tackled. Although we have made
it clear, I wish to put on the record again that we take the matter
seriously. That is why we issued a consultation paper in August
canvassing views on how to deal with the tolerated trespasser problem
now and in the
future.</div>
					<a name="08012371000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Respondents to
that consultation exercise were overwhelmingly in support of remedying
the situation for the future. The majority of respondents also favoured
rescuing all existing tolerated trespassers, rather than just those who
have complied with the terms of a possession order, although that was
generally on the proviso that landlords should be protected from any
liability for damages. I believe that that proviso is important, and I
shall return to it.</div>
					<a name="08012371000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">In light of that clear
response, the Government are committed to resolving the tolerated
trespasser problem. We must resolve the contradictions in the current
law, so that it is consistent with the wide discretionary powers that
Parliament gave to the courts 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column472" />Column number: 472</div>to protect tenants. While I am sympathetic to the aims of the new
clause, I am not convinced that it fully delivers what is needed and
what it intends to deliver. In particular, it fails to recognise the
complexity of the situation of existing tolerated
trespassers.</div>
					<a name="08012371000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would effectively revive or restore former tenancy status to all
existing tolerated trespassers who remain in a property. That is to say
that it would be as though existing occupants had never become
tolerated trespassers. I believe that that could be problematic,
particularly for landlords who are likely to have based decisions
regarding individual occupants on their status as tolerated
trespassers. In reference to the point that I made a moment ago, that
is likely to include decisions associated with stock transfer ballots
and repairs, as the statutory right to repair does not apply to
tolerated
trespassers.</div>
					<a name="08012371000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the legislation were to be changed with retrospective effect, so that
tolerated trespassers are restored to tenancy status, I believe that we
must look closely at the implications for landlords, including the need
to ensure protection from any legal consequences. The new clause, as
currently drafted, does not do that, and for that reason alone, I
cannot support it. However, I commit now to considering the
introduction of an amendment at a later stage of the proceedings to
resolve the matter of tolerated trespassers. On that basis, I hope that
I have again secured the support of the Committee, and I hope that the
hon. Member for St. Ives does not press the new
clause.</div>

because it seems to have worked. I am grateful to the Minister for that
reply. He acknowledges that many tenants will not be aware of the
complexity or cost of remedying their situation, where they have the
ability to do so.</div>

Minister mentioned the fact that up to 300,000 families were affected
by that state of limbo. The situation is clearly not tolerable and must
be addressed. He suggested that, after having canvassed views, the
Government are resolved to address it. I am grateful to the Minister
for his response. There may well be some

time.</div>
					<a name="08012371000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look forward
to the Minister&#146;s response to the proposal, on the basis of his
response to the last amendment. We are back to the territory of
political tribalism, which the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield enjoyed
so much in an earlier debate on the right to buy, and I am sure many
more colourful adjectives and accusations will fly as the debate
proceeds. The purpose of the new clause was in part addressed during
that debate, as it relates to the difficulties in rural areas where the
sell-back clause in respect of the right to buy does not
apply.</div>
					<a name="08012371000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rural
homelessness and housing need are widely recognised as key factors that
undermine the sustainability of rural communities. The loss of council
properties through the right to buy has a direct impact on the number
of re-lettings becoming available. The new clause would allow the
Secretary of State, by regulation, to exempt local authority housing in
designated areas with populations of 3,000 or below. The existing rural
exemptions under the right to acquire&#151;the scheme available to
housing association tenants&#151;should also apply to council tenants
under the right to buy.</div>
					<a name="08012371000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">As background to the proposal,
the Minister should be aware that in 2003 the rural group of Labour MPs
said:</div>
					<a name="08012371000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
right to buy from councils or registered social landlords should not be
available to tenants in settlements of below
3,000.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012371000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">They conceded
that that may cause difficulties for those who already have that right,
but they argued that as people realised the effect of the right to buy
on their own families, they would understand why it might be
withdrawn.</div>
					<a name="08012371000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its 2004
report on the draft Housing Bill, the Office of the Deputy Prime
Minister Committee recommended that the Government should seriously
consider extending the Bill with regard to exclusions in rural areas.
The home ownership taskforce recommended that restrictions on the right
to buy and right to acquire in rural areas be
aligned.</div>
					<a name="08012371000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
must bear in mind that the way in which housing is structured is
differentiated between rural areas and urban areas: 86 per cent. of
rural housing is owner-occupied or privately rented compared with 77
per cent. in urban areas. Social rented housing accounts for 13.4 per
cent. of the total housing in rural areas, compared with 22.4 per cent.
in urban areas. In my part of the world, social housing represents less
than 10 per cent., which is about the same proportion as second homes
in a constituency such as mine. Average house prices rose faster in
rural areas between 2000 and 2006 than in urban areas, which has
significant implications for broader housing availability in the
countryside.</div>
					<a name="08012371000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">Housing
affordability, based on the relationship between average wages and
average house prices, is far worse in many rural areas. The scarce
council housing and housing association housing in rural areas is often
occupied for long periods by the same families, and it becomes
available only in very limited circumstances. The cost of developing
new social housing makes it difficult to develop a new supply of
affordable housing in rural areas.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08012371000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">The homes in
the private rented sector are few and far between, and where they
exist, they are extremely expensive. In its report, &#147;Sustainable
Communities: Building for the Future&#148;, the then Office of the
Deputy Prime Minister acknowledged
that</div>
					<a name="08012371000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
availability of housing, especially social and other affordable
housing, is a critical issue in many rural areas...Rural housing
is often in high demand from in-comers, long distance commuters, people
moving in to retire, and owners of second homes and holiday homes. This
can squeeze out local people on lower
incomes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012371000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to
the Countryside
Agency,</div>
					<a name="08012371000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;people on modest
incomes, including young and pensioner households and local first-time
buyers, are being priced out of many rural districts. This has
implications for the maintenance of viable, inclusive rural
communities, with some areas becoming increasingly exclusive,
comprising only wealthy households. The balance of communities is
disrupted, families are separated, increased pressure is placed on many
rural services, and the local economy may be forced into
decline.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012371000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will take into account the difficult
circumstances in which people in many rural areas find themselves. The
right to buy has a disproportionate impact on many rural areas. That
was recognised by the Conservative Government, who recognised that
there were some communities&#151;26 designated rural areas, I
think&#151;where there are restrictions on the resale of properties
available under the right-to-buy
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08012371000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are many parts of the country, including my constituency, where former
council houses are now second homes. That highly prized, expensive
accommodation has simply not been replaced in areas where housing
waiting lists are long and the prospect of local people ever being able
to get a house of their own is remote. I hope that the Minister will
take that on board and accept the new clause in the form in which it is
drafted. If not, I hope that he will recognise that the issue needs to
be addressed and that it should be addressed in the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000607"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> We have discussed the right to buy at some length
already this afternoon. That important issue affects a lot of people,
but I do not want to detain the Committee for too long in that regard.
I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern about housing in rural
areas. To get quickly to the crux of my argument, however, it seems
that the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire want to
tackle that in a rather blunt way by depriving tenants who live in
rural areas of the right to buy. In practice, the new clause would deny
rural tenants the chance to become home owners unless they are wealthy,
which seems rather harsh. Those people will have a strong connection
with the locality and, without the right-to-buy facility, would have to
move away to become home owners, which is not
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="08012371000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are well aware that there are significant housing issues in
rural areas. Our aim is to ensure that more of the existing housing in
rural areas is available to local people. We have had a great debate
today on new clauses 24 and 25, in which hopefully we have teased out
that there will be help to ensure that shared ownership properties are
retained for future purchases in areas were replacement would be
difficult. However&#151;this is the crucial point&#151;it is
important to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column475" />Column number: 475</div>note that people will not be prevented from buying homes in rural areas,
but just prevented from buying them outright, which will allow us to
retain affordable housing in perpetuity.</div>
					<a name="08012371000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right-to-buy scheme has
always sought to balance the benefits of helping social tenants into
home ownership with the need for affordable rural housing. As the hon.
Member for St. Ives has mentioned, tenants who buy their homes in areas
designated as rural by the Secretary of State, national parks and areas
of outstanding natural beauty may not resell them to whomever they
wish.</div>
					<a name="08012371000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s view is that the new clause as currently drafted
would be too inflexible and would take away a long-standing right,
thereby taking away the chance for rural tenants to become home owners
in the areas where they might have lived for many years. On that basis,
I cannot accept the new clause and hope that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw
it.</div>
					<a name="08012371000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012371000608"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> Of course, I fully understand that the new clause
is effectively a blunt instrument that would remove in total the right
to buy from many tenants. However, I hope that the Minister recognises
the difficulties in many rural areas, because I did not entirely detect
that in his
response.</div>
					<a name="08012371000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">For rural
families, the association with a particular parish or village is
extremely strong. Moving many miles away to find accommodation can
uproot a family, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 476</div>who may have had local associations for many years, if not for many
generations. I hope that the Minister will recognise the problems of
small rural communities, and even small towns, where the stock of
affordable accommodation is extremely small. A magic circle is needed
so that every property that is sold is replaced. Because affordable
properties are so highly valued by the community as a whole, and
because they are often the only route for local families on local
incomes to ever get any kind of home of their own, a mechanism is
required to protect that stock. If it is not protected by this
admittedly blunt measure, we need to find a more sophisticated measure
that enables those communities to replace the stock that is
lost.</div>
					<a name="08012371000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just as on the
previous new clause, I hope that the Minister will take away the
matter, consider it and introduce his own amendment on Report. I hope
that he will at least acknowledge that there is an issue that needs to
be addressed. In the present circumstances, it is not being addressed
in many rural areas, which is something that the Government will have
to deal with. On the basis that we have had the opportunity to debate
that substantial issue and that we will have an opportunity to return
to it, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div>
