<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000234"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
this morning, Mr. Benton. I shall speak to amendments 2 and
4 and the group of measures before us. I shall see whether you let me
get away with making some wider remarks on the clause or whether you
wish me to hold them over for a stand part
debate.</div><a name="09061161000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
2 is straightforward. It deals with how the Government have decided to
set out the public authorities to which the clause relates. The
strategy they have adopted is to list a number of authorities, but
clause 2 gives Ministers the power by regulations to amend primary
legislation. The Conservatives are reluctant to allow Ministers the
power to amend primary legislation by order and the amendment sets out
a different
approach.</div><a name="09061161000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would set out a power for Ministers of the Crown by regulations to list
public authorities to which the measure applied. If they wished to add
or remove public authorities from that list, they would simply change
the secondary legislation. That is a better way to go about things,
rather than allowing Ministers to amend primary legislation by order.
This is a technical amendment.</div>
<a name="09061161000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 4
would remove subsection (4), which applies the measure to partner
authorities of local authorities &#147;in relation to&#148;
their</div>
<a name="09061161000196"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;preparation and
modification of a sustainable community
strategy.&#148;</div><a name="09061161000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
explain the purpose of the amendment, I need to explain our concerns
and objections to the measure. Ministers are a little confused about
the difference between discrimination and disadvantage, which point my
hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare has made
before.</div><a name="09061161000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ministers
appear to be confusing the poor opportunities of socio-economically
disadvantaged communities with discrimination. That is a wrong-headed
approach because the solution to sorting out socio-economic
inequalities is to deal with their root cause, and for Ministers and
other public authorities to tackle them. For example, the reason for
the educational disadvantage experienced by those who come from poor
areas is often that they do not have access to good schools. The duty
in the Bill is not the solution; rather, it is for bodies to do
something to arrange the provision of good
schools.</div><a name="09061161000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern about the measure, and the argument for the amendment, is that
Ministers are in danger of setting expectations that are destined to
fail&#151;it is as if the clause says, &#147;Everyone has the right
to a good life.&#148; We do not solve such problems simply by passing
a law. A good example is the fuel poverty legislation that the House
passed a number of years ago. It effectively said that fuel poverty
would no longer exist. Of course, several years after that legislation
was passed by the House and the other place, fuel poverty still
exists&#151;indeed, it is getting worse, not better. That is a
fundamentally wrong-headed approach to solving some of those
problems.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div><a name="09061161000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061161000235"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): On that specific point, is
it not the issue that although it may well suit Ministers to place on
public authorities high-sounding obligations that look tremendous on
paper, in the absence of sanctions that could in an extreme case apply
to individual members of those authorities, as in the example of fuel
poverty, they amount to
nothing?</div><a name="09061161000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000236"></a>Mr.
Harper</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="09061161000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000237"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman replies, may I
take the opportunity to refer to his opening remarks? It is perfectly
all right to allow as broad a scope as possible for debate on the
amendments, but I remind the Committee that in relation to clause stand
part I have the power to circumvent any further discussion if, in my
opinion, the clause has been discussed adequately. I just point that
out, but there is no harm at all in what is going
on.</div><a name="09061161000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000238"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr.
Benton.</div><a name="09061161000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Daventry made a good point and it goes
wider, because if we put responsibilities on a range of
authorities&#151;we are talking about a significant list and there
are amendments that would widen it&#151;we must think about not only
the duties that we are placing on them, but the resources that we grant
them. If we place a lot of responsibilities on public authorities
without the concomitant resources, we may be setting up not only
Ministers, but that significant list of authorities, to fail. From a
public policy perspective, that is not
sound.</div><a name="09061161000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us consider the partner authorities and the sustainable community
strategy, which raise another issue. The authorities listed fall into
two categories. Some are unelected quangos, which are in effect at some
point responsible to central Government. Others, however, such as
county and district councils, the Greater London authority and London
borough councils, are elected authorities. The decisions to be taken
about the extent to which they take into account socio-economic
inequalities and disadvantage and the extent to which they make
judgments about resource allocation are legitimate judgments, but they
are judgments for political
discourse.</div><a name="09061161000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is for electors to make decisions when they elect different members of
those authorities and it is for those authorities to make the decisions
in debate, weighing up all the factors concerned. It is proper for that
to be done at that level and not for Ministers to seek to put duties on
them.</div><a name="09061161000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
4 relates to the authorities drawing up their sustainable community
strategies. They would, by their very nature, be better drawn up at a
very local level by those authorities that know their areas best, know
the people the best and know the relevant factors. They are very
familiar on the ground with the disadvantage and the socio-economic
factors, and it is for them to draw up the strategy, recognising that
they are accountable to the people who elect
them.</div><a name="09061161000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a different argument, and Ministers perhaps have a stronger case
when they talk about bodies that are subordinate to Ministers, but even
then it is really for Ministers to make political judgments about
socio-economic inequalities and resources and how they allocate them,
and for those arguments to take place in the House and the other
place.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div><a name="09061161000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061161000239"></a><b class="B">Sandra
Osborne</b> (Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock) (Lab): Does the hon.
Gentleman accept that the equality duty, be it in respect of gender,
race or whatever, should apply equally to all authorities? If so, what
is the difference between that and the disadvantage caused by
socio-economic
inequalities?</div><a name="09061161000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000240"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The hon. Lady comes back to a point that I made at
the beginning about stamping out discrimination and confusing
discrimination with disadvantage. They are not the same thing at all.
The socio-economic inequality referred to is different qualitatively
from the protected characteristics and stamping out
discrimination.</div><a name="09061161000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think I am right in saying that in the evidence-taking sessions the
hon. Lady was concerned that the clause does not apply to the Scottish
Government. One thing I thought while she was making those points was
that, particularly in relation to those hon. Members who supported
Scottish devolution, the decisions that the Scottish Government make on
their policies and resource allocation and how they go about tackling
disadvantage are surely for Scottish electors to consider when they
choose who represents them in the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish
Government have to make those decisions when they weigh up their public
spending priorities and other decision making. It is surely in that
forum that those challenges should be addressed. If the Scottish people
feel that the Scottish Government are not making the right decisions,
they have the opportunity to throw them
out.</div><a name="09061161000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000241"></a>Sandra
Osborne:</b> I totally agree. I am a firm supporter of
Scottish devolution&#151;I would even say that I am one of its more
ardent supporters among my colleagues&#151;but there is the capacity
to adopt the duty in Scotland through a Sewel motion. It would then be
up to the Scottish Government and the Scottish public authorities to
decide how to implement it. I think that the Scottish people want
Westminster and the Scottish Government to work purposefully
together.</div>
<a name="09061161000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000242"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The hon. Lady makes a good point. Clearly, I would
have no objection if the Scottish Government decided to do that. It
would be a matter for them, and if they wished to adopt the duty, that
would be absolutely fine. My point is that devolution implies that
authorities will tackle things differently.</div>
<a name="09061161000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061161000243"></a><b class="B">John
Penrose</b> (Weston-super-Mare) (Con): Does my hon. Friend
agree that an additional distinction can be made between disadvantage
and discrimination? The grammar of discrimination is rightly all about
perpetrators and victims&#151;people discriminating unfairly against
others, who lose out as a result. Disadvantage is an important concept,
and the Government have rightly made efforts to wipe it out, but it is
very different. It is not about perpetrators and victims in the same
way that discrimination is; it is about systematic problems and
failures and about assisting, helping and supporting. By definition,
the public policy solutions required to deal with disadvantage are very
different from those required to deal with discrimination, which is why
disadvantage does not fit so well in such a
Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000244"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point when he says
that the solutions to socio-economic disadvantage are quite different
from those required to stamp out discrimination. Indeed, one reason why
we tabled a reasoned amendment on Second Reading was that although we
were happy with the bulk of the Bill&#151;indeed, the simplification
and codification in it are welcome&#151;we did not think that this
part fitted well with the rest. Indeed, it looks like it has been
squeezed in at the beginning or tagged on, albeit not as an
afterthought, but not elegantly.</div>
<a name="09061161000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061161000245"></a><b class="B">Lynne
Featherstone</b> (Hornsey and Wood Green) (LD): The
Bill&#146;s title is the Equality Bill, and given that socio-economic
disadvantage is the greatest inequality there is, it would have been
negligent of the Government not to include it. My criticism is that
their proposals are a weak way of including it. Does the hon.
Gentleman
agree?</div><a name="09061161000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000246"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> No, I do not. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Weston-super-Mare said, the remedies and powers in the rest of the Bill
to prevent discrimination are quite different from the solutions to
socio-economic disadvantage.</div>
<a name="09061161000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
avoidance of doubt, I should say at this point that we are in no way
saying that there are no issues with socio-economic disadvantage.
Indeed, on Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Member for
Maidenhead (Mrs. May) made it clear in her opening speech,
as I did in my winding-up speech, that there are issues with
socio-economic disadvantage. Ministers and former Ministers have been
frank about that. Indeed, the Home Secretary, when he had
responsibility for education, said:</div>
<a name="09061161000197"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
actually getting harder for people to escape poverty and leave the
income group, professional banding or social circle of their parents.
In fact, it&#146;s harder to escape the shackles of a poor upbringing
in Britain than anywhere else in Europe, and about the same as in
America.&#148;</div><a name="09061161000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
clearly is a problem with lack of social mobility and people being
trapped in disadvantage, but we do not think that the solution is to
include these measures in the Bill. Clearly, the Government, of
whichever party, will have a big job dealing with the reasons for
disadvantage, whether by improving families&#146; ability to stay
together or looking at the educational opportunities available to
people to give everybody an equal opportunity to succeed. However, the
proposals are a profoundly mistaken way to deal with the
issue.</div><a name="09061161000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
mentioned fuel poverty legislation, and the Government also plan to
introduce a Bill to eliminate child poverty. To be fair, the Government
had some success in dealing with the issue, but child poverty figures
are now going in the opposite direction. We cannot solve such problems
by passing a law; we solve them by tackling the root causes. A number
of those who appeared before us in our evidence sessions were fairly
relaxed about the proposals and supportive of them, but most did not
think that they would make a huge difference. That is the flaw and why
this is not the way to tackle socio-economic
disadvantage.</div><a name="09061161000204"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000247"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Vera Baird):</b> In fact, almost everybody
who was asked about the provision&#151;they were repeatedly probed by
members of the hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>Gentleman&#146;s party&#151;was immensely supportive. The hon.
Gentleman makes the point that it is not the solution; of course it is
not, because the problem is entrenched and difficult. However, what is
the harm of it? It will help. EDF has 50 members, each with a large
membership, and they all think that this will help. ROTA, which also
gave evidence in favour of the proposal, has 1,500 member
organisations, each with many hundreds of members, and therefore with
many discrimination strands, and they think that it will help. What
does the hon. Gentleman say is wrong with the
proposal?</div>
<a name="09061161000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000248"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I do not think that it will make much difference,
if any. Bills are not about sending messages; they are about changing
the law. If one is going to put a duty on public sector authorities,
and if that duty is not meaningful and will not make a significant
difference, it sets expectations that simply will not be delivered. It
also puts a burden on authorities. There will be lots of compliance
that authorities will have to tackle. There will be lots of words in
annual reports and people doing reports about how they are complying.
If the reality is that it will not make any difference, an awful lot of
money will be spent with an awful lack of
outcome.</div><a name="09061161000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061161000249"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): Will the
hon. Gentleman confirm that he said he does not believe&#151;I think
he is right, actually&#151;that legislation should be solely for the
purpose of sending out a message? It must be shown to fulfil another
need or be effective in itself, and arguing that it sends a message is
not a good basis for legislation, whether in this area or any other
area, such as criminal
justice.</div><a name="09061161000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000250"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Yes, I agree. Legislation ought to be effective.
From the conversations that I have had and the evidence that I have
seen, I do not think that this is the way to go about it. The issue is
serious, and there is a real problem. One could argue that setting out
ways in which every member of our society has an equal opportunity to
succeed&#151;it does not mean that we will have equal outcomes, but
everyone will have a fair chance&#151;is probably one of the most
important parts of public policy. But this is not how one goes about
doing it. I do not think that it fits well within the Bill&#151;it
detracts from the Bill rather than adding to it&#151;which is why we
oppose
it.</div><a name="09061161000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 2, will the Minister comment on the approach, because we do
not think that giving Ministers the power to amend primary legislation
is welcome? It would be better to set it out differently, but I
recognise that that is a technical point, which we can discuss.
Amendment 4 is an opportunity to discuss where the appropriate level
for the decisions sits and the appropriate forums. We do not think that
this particular approach is a sound
one.</div><a name="09061161000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000251"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> May I say what a pleasure it is to sit on a
Committee where you are the Chair, Mr. Benton? I look
forward to working on the Bill and probing and improving the
legislation, where
possible.</div><a name="09061161000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
rise to discuss our amendments 108, 109 and 181, amendments 2 and 4
tabled by the Tories and amendment 107 tabled by the SNP. It is quite
clear that partner organisations, regulators and a whole range of
authorities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div>and agencies could have the duty, and I want to find out which of them
might be included in the lists. Amendment 108 relates to the partner
agencies as part of the Greater London authority. Transport for London,
the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, the London
Development Agency and the Metropolitan Police Authority are clearly
strategic authorities and partners involved in pursuing, delivering and
implementing
policy.</div><a name="09061161000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause does not make it clear whether those GLA family members are
covered by the socio-economic duty. Schedule 19 lists them individually
for the general public duty, but that is not so in the clause. My
purpose is to get the Minister to elucidate whether they should be
named as individual partner bodies. Their roles are extremely strategic
and they act independently of the Mayor, although in the matter of
political direction, the Mayor of London is at the top. The bodies in
question cover some of the areas of highest inequality in the
country.</div>
<a name="09061161000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The list in
clause 1 includes police authorities, but fire and rescue authorities
constituted by a relevant scheme are not included in the same way, and
amendment 109 would provide for those to be included in the
socio-economic duty. Those are single-function authorities, but a
socio-economic duty would ensure the consideration that the Government
have deemed it important for all bodies to have regard to. Social
inequality in the question of where and how to give fire cover is very
important. The authorities cover huge areas&#151;West Midlands fire
service, for example. The situation is anomalous in relation to police
authorities, and we cannot see why police authorities but not fire
authorities should be
included.</div><a name="09061161000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
181 is supported by Citizens Advice. We think that the provision should
require bodies with inspection or regulatory duties also to have regard
to socio-economic inequalities. Regulators play a huge part in the
provision of public services that matter, and they sit in judgment, so
it is right that they should consider the socio-economic duty. The
example given by Citizens Advice is Ofgem. It argues that if Ofgem had
had such a socio-economic duty, it would have acted much sooner to deal
with the issue of poorer customers being charged more for metered
electricity, which is obviously an important
point.</div><a name="09061161000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
forgot to say in beginning, Mr. Benton, that I want to deal
with the wider issues on clause stand part.</div>
<a name="09061161000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
discuss the Conservative amendments 2 and 4. We agree with amendment 2
to the extent that the list in the clause is imperfect, as I hope that
I have shown. However, the Liberal Democrats would much prefer a
prescriptive list to the delegation to Ministers or a future Government
of the power to list authorities. Delegation of the power would make
the application of socio-economic duty subject to the whims of
Ministers or the Government of the day, which would mean uncertainty in
the Bill. As to amendment 4, there are many examples of partner
authorities that should be covered, because of their strategic nature
and their potential impact in reducing socio-economic
disadvantage.</div><a name="09061161000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000252"></a>The

been thinking about what she has said about not discussing the broader

ruling, we may not have a stand part debate, and it would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>helpful&#151;I do not say that it must happen&#151;if she were to
address the broader issues. That is a suggestion, not a

the ball is entirely in the hon. Lady&#146;s

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000256"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Benton. The
hon. Member for Forest of Dean, who speaks for the Conservatives,
raised a number of general points, but my understanding is that the
points that my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green wishes
to raise are wholly different from and unrelated to the issues relating
to public bodies in this group of amendments. Because they are
specific, finite points relating to the question whether there is
alternative way of doing what the clause seeks to do, they would fit
best in a separate debate. Will you, Mr. Benton, reflect on
your current advice&#151;it is obviously your ruling to
make&#151;to see whether separating things out would aid
debate?</div><a name="09061161000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000257"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am glad the hon. Gentleman has mentioned
&#147;advice&#148; as opposed to &#147;ruling&#148;. It will
depend precisely on how proceedings go during the discussion of the
amendments. I was merely pointing out that it would be helpful. It is
not a ruling and you can leave the advice. It does not necessarily mean
that there will not be a clause stand part debate, but if the hon.
Member for Hornsey and Wood Green is so disposed to talk in general
terms, it might be helpful. It is entirely a matter for her, and it is
not a
ruling.</div><a name="09061161000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000258"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I thank you, Mr. Benton, and I am
happy to be helpful on this
occasion.</div><a name="09061161000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
on to some wider issues associated with amendment 4, the Liberal
Democrats think that the socio-economic duty is generally a good and
important thing. There may not be enough similar measures in the Bill.
Because the measure came in at such a late stage, there was not
adequate time to consult all the relevant bodies. There is no greater
inequality than the socio-economic divide, and I regret that the duty
in the Bill is so weak. We fully support its aims, but we feel that the
measure is more about sending a message than imposing an actual duty.
In reality, most authorities and agencies have some regard to the issue
already, certainly at local council and government
level.</div><a name="09061161000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
much consultation were the Government able to do on the socio-economic
duty? The measure was introduced very late, but it is one of the most
important elements of the Bill. It is in clause 1, so the Government
have given it some import, but I would have liked that to have been
reflected in the depth of the consultation. Had that happened, there
would have been ramifications. The measure might not simply have been
an attempt to deal with the symptoms rather than the
cause.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div><a name="09061161000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061161000259"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): As this is the first time
that I have spoken in Committee, may I say that I appreciate your
chairmanship, Mr. Benton? I want to make some general points
to begin with before specifically discussing amendment 107, which is
similar to the proposals that we have heard about this
morning.</div><a name="09061161000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Scottish National party and the Government of Scotland very much
support the Bill and welcome the fact that different strands of
inequality are being brought together. A lot of good has been done in
recent years, but much remains to be done, for example, on equal pay
for women. Also, are the reasonable adjustments for disabled people
moving forward fast enough? That I and others will table amendments to
the Bill does not take away from the fact that we very much support
it.</div>
<a name="09061161000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very
supportive of the socio-economic duty. One reason why I am in politics
is to try to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. I asked
about that last week in what was my first question to the Prime
Minister in the House. My first question on this specific duty is this:
are we going far enough? There is little power of redress. Will the
Minister explain exactly what will be different under the legislation?
For example, the city that I am most familiar with is Glasgow. My
experience of Glasgow is that both the local authority and health
services take poverty into account when allocating resources. For
instance, in the east end of Glasgow, there is a lack of breastfeeding
and a particular problem with smoking, and the NHS and the council have
targeted that
together.</div><a name="09061161000205"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000260"></a>Sandra
Osborne:</b> I do not disagree with anything that the hon.
Gentleman has said. In Scotland, extensive measures are taken to tackle
disadvantage, but before 1997, the link between poverty and ill health,
for example, was not recognised by the Government and support did not
filter down to that level as it does today. If he supports the power,
will he urge his party to put sectional interests aside and adopt a
socio-economic duty in the Scottish
Government?</div><a name="09061161000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000261"></a>John

question.</div>
<a name="09061161000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000266"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Perhaps the Solicitor-General was being a bit
roundabout. I suspect she was really wondering&#151;given that the

power, and given that his answer focused particularly on the difference
it might make to his constituents in Glasgow&#151;why the Scottish
Government do not want it to apply in
Scotland.</div><a name="09061161000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000267"></a>John
Mason:</b> I will answer both those points eventually, as I
have a letter here from the Minister for Housing and Communities, Alec
Neil MSP. The basic position of our party and the Scottish Government
is that we are totally committed to challenging socio-economic
inequality. It is a question of the best way to go about it and whether
the Bill goes far enough, as has been
mentioned.</div><a name="09061161000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
letter
says:</div><a name="09061161000198"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Scottish Government has supported the principle of the Equality Bill
from the outset and continues to support it. A number of provisions in
the Bill require the legislative consent of the Scottish Parliament,
and the Scottish Government introduced a Legislative Consent
Memorandum... on 7
May.&#148;</div><a name="09061161000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that is working its way through the
process.</div><a name="09061161000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister for Housing and Communities goes on to mention the
socio-economic duty,
saying</div><a name="09061161000199"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
is correct that the socio-economic duty... will not extend to
Scotland. Scottish Government officials have only had limited contact
with the Government Equalities Office (GEO) on the proposals for a
socio-economic
duty&#148;.</div><a name="09061161000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
suggestion seems to be that the Government in Westminster have not been
doing a lot of talking to the Scottish Government to explain the duty
and whether we should take it
through.</div><a name="09061161000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000268"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I have no idea where that suggestion
comes from. I have been to Scotland several times and given evidence to
the Scottish Parliament, and officials have been in pretty constant
contact. We would be pleased if we persuaded the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s party to take on the duty, and we have done our
level best to do so. Compare and contrast Wales, where we have had far
less trouble persuading the Government that it will be helpful to their
people.</div>
<a name="09061161000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure the
hon. Gentleman that we have had an enormous amount of contact. He is in
a funny position&#151;I acknowledge that straightaway&#151;in that
he seems to support the measures, although he does not think they go
far enough, but his own Government will not have anything to do with
them.</div><a name="09061161000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000269"></a>John

Thornberry</b> (Islington, South and Finsbury) (Lab): Does the

problem.</div><a name="09061161000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000271"></a>John
Mason:</b> In one word, yes. Let me read the next paragraph of
the letter, because it might clarify things
further:</div><a name="09061161000200"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Within
our devolved powers we are able to carefully consider how we can direct
our efforts to tackle poverty, reduce inequality, and promote social
mobility in a way that is most appropriate to Scotland. As it is, we
are completely committed to reducing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>socio-economic inequality in Scottish society. Our Solidarity and
Cohesion targets commit us to taking serious action to reduce the gap
between the rich and the poor, both at an individual and an area level.
Achievement of these targets will be supported by a wide range of
measures already in
place.&#148;</div><a name="09061161000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take that to mean that the Scottish Government remain to be convinced
that the proposed power has
teeth.</div><a name="09061161000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000272"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I confess to being confused. If we take my view,
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments make perfect sense. He has set out
his view that the Scottish Government have wide-ranging targets and
measures to deal with socio-economic disadvantage. In that case, they
are getting on with it, and presumably the electorate are happy with
that, because the Scottish National party did well in the last
elections. It seems, therefore, that he should be supporting my view
too.</div><a name="09061161000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
if the hon. Gentleman accepts the view that he has already
expressed&#151;this power is appropriate and the only thing wrong
with it is that it does not go far enough&#151;it seems strange that
he does not want the Scottish Government to adopt the proposed power.
Most of his remarks appear to agree with what I am saying, but coming
from him, they do not seem consistent or
logical.</div><a name="09061161000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000273"></a>John
Mason:</b> I am sorry if I am not explaining myself well
enough. Let me try again: I, the Scottish Government and our party are
totally committed to challenging socio-economic disadvantage, and I
believe that we are more committed to that than the Westminster
Government&#151;</div><a name="09061161000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061161000274"></a><b class="B">Jim

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000275"></a>John
Mason:</b> Let me finish my sentence. I believe that we are
more committed to that than the Westminster Government, so we want to
find something better than this socio-economic duty. As has been said
by the Conservative party, it seems to have been tagged on a bit, even
though it is at the beginning of the Bill. We want to find the best
solution. We can use this measure, for now, but we should try to find
something
better.</div><a name="09061161000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000276"></a>Jim

have been in power for two years. Will he tell me one measure that they
have introduced to address socio-economic

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000277"></a>John
Mason:</b> I think we are probably straying from the subject.
However, I would suggest that reducing prescription charges is one. I
know that the Welsh are ahead of us on that&#151;they have free
prescriptions&#151;but we are reducing charges, while in England they
are
increasing.</div><a name="09061161000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not as familiar with the situation in England as I am with that in
Scotland; perhaps Scotland is simply slightly further ahead on some of
these issues. Another slightly different factor in Scotland is the
concordat between central Government and local government&#151;I
assume from the comments of the hon. Member for Forest of Dean that the
Conservative leader would agree with this kind of measure. Instead of
central 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>Government imposing lots of new duties on local government, they very
much work in agreement. That has certainly been welcomed by the Labour
party in
Scotland.</div><a name="09061161000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000278"></a>Sandra
Osborne:</b> To put it very mildly, the concordat is on a
shaky peg and might well break down, although I accept that it did
happen. In my area, the Tory and Scottish National party council is
shutting things down and making cuts left, right and centre. The
concordat means little to the people I represent. However, does the
hon. Gentleman agree that this is a missed opportunity? The Scottish
Government simply want to plough their own furrow. They do not want to
co-operate with Westminster. As usual, they want to pick a fight with
it, instead of being
constructive.</div><a name="09061161000106"></a>

to Citizens Advice for its help on amendment 107. Clause 2 provides for
the list of authorities in clause 1 to be added to through regulations.
I believe that it is important for the duty to apply clearly to key
regulators, Executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies,
particularly those with an economic impact. Would it not be better to
include those in the Bill now to ensure fairness as we come out of the
recession, rather than waiting for a Government to include the bodies
at a later date? That would mean regulators taking the duty into
account when setting regulatory policies and
strategies.</div><a name="09061161000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

more&#151;this is just for starters. The Liberal Democrats have
mentioned a few other bodies and similar arguments apply to each of

them should strengthen their
resolve.</div><a name="09061161000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

constituency are struggling with fuel bills, paying more for
electricity and paying in advance through a pre-payment meter. That is
a real problem. Extending the socio-economic duty to Ofgem would
reinforce its ability to deal with that issue and justify the regulator
prioritising its work on socio-economic inequalities ahead of other
matters, such as certain competition issues. The amendment could bring
about a slight difference in emphasis.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000282"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I have a great deal of sympathy with what the hon.
Gentleman is saying. Particularly because so much of the direction of
public services has been delegated to regulators such as these, away
from elected Governments, it is important that we use every opportunity
to give them a steer when there are certain public policy outcomes,
such as the elimination of disadvantage, that we would like to be
delivered through utilities or public services, without putting too
much of a burden on industry. That is why his amendment and the Liberal
Democrat amendment, which says much the same thing in respect of
regulators, are so
important.</div><a name="09061161000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000283"></a>John
Mason:</b> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
intervention and agree with his
point.</div><a name="09061161000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000284"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am being as sympathetic as I can, but
our concern is that there is no point putting a duty on regulators if a
duty cannot be put on the people they regulate. It cannot, because we
are talking about the private sector, so what is the
point?</div><a name="09061161000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000285"></a>John
Mason:</b> One suggestion is that the regulator must
prioritise the work that it does. Specifically giving the regulator the
socio-economic duty as well would, we hope, push that up its agenda. I
know that in many cases the regulator is struggling with a wide agenda,
but I believe that the point of the Bill is in some cases to
double-underline duties that may or may not apply to other authorities.
If this duty applies to other authorities, it should apply to the
regulator as
well.</div><a name="09061161000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000286"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Let me try to help the hon. Gentleman. Does he
agree that a consideration in this respect might be whether the
regulator would require the introduction of a particular social tariff
to meet the problems of disadvantage? That at least, whatever the
merits of the clause, might be a perfectly proper steer that the
regulator could be obliged to
give.</div><a name="09061161000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000287"></a>John
Mason:</b> That is an extremely good example and there are
probably others. I appreciate the intervention. If the duty already
applied to Ofgem, the regulator, following its conclusion that
consumers on pre-payment meters were subject to unfair price
differentials, might have been able to act more swiftly and take
decisive
action.</div><a name="09061161000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
well as regulators, certain Executive agencies and non-departmental
public bodies should be subject to the duty. Although it may be argued
that those public bodies will be covered by the duty applying to
Departments, it should be made clear whether that is the case. I would
appreciate the Minister clarifying that. One example would be Jobcentre
Plus, in the same way that the duty under the Disability Discrimination
Act 2005 to promote disability equality applies to certain Executive
agencies and non-departmental public
bodies.</div><a name="09061161000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I oppose Conservative amendments 2 and 4 and support amendments 108,
109 and
181.</div><a name="09061161000206"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000288"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> May I also welcome you to the Chair,
Mr. Benton? I think that we will have a positive and
constructive Committee. I promise to speak about some of the general
aspects of the amendments and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>clause without straying on to the issue of Scotland. However, it is just
conceivable, in view of my wife&#146;s nationality and certain
involvements that I have in Cardiff, where I come across the Welsh
Assembly Government, that I may advert to that body. That is not a
threat; it is simply that we have heard a lot about the different
implications of devolved
Administrations.</div><a name="09061161000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not indulge myself at length, but it comes as a wake-up call
telling one that it is time to go when one finds that Cabinet Ministers
were born after one had left higher education. I was shocked to
discover that the other day, but it also prompts my first general
remark. Forty-five years ago, I had the first&#151;and probably
only&#151;lesson in moral philosophy that I can remember, which was
to the effect that there is a distinction between saying that something
should happen and saying that there should be a law that something
should happen. That is the general issue raised by this
place.</div><a name="09061161000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Solicitor-General has been very kind to me on occasion, and I hope that
there will be no argument about whether we are interested in
inequalities. There could have been that argument, and there could
still be in respect of certain members of my party and other parties,
but we need to be alert to such
factors.</div><a name="09061161000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Among
local authorities in my county and most others, and even among
regulators, which we recently discussed in relation to an amendment,
there is a disposition to even things up and, to use a phrase that I
used on Second Reading&#151;I am interested in the human rights side,
as well as the discrimination and equalities issue&#151;to treat
people decently. That is really why we are in business in Parliament,
and we should not have an argument about that. The issue, however, is
how we deliver that and whether it is appropriate to have a general
duty.</div>
<a name="09061161000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I
interrupted the excellent speech by my hon. Friend the Member for
Forest of Dean, who was making a perfectly reasonable distinction
between inequality and discrimination, I adverted to my concern that
the proposals did not amount to much, particularly when there was no
opportunity of litigating in private to correct failures by a public
authority. There are no teeth, although that does not necessarily mean
that we should never have
legislation.</div><a name="09061161000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
our evidence sessions, the Solicitor-General objected to my slight
penchant for principles clauses, which we may have occasion to discuss
later. She said that such a clause would not add value and that it was
not clear how it would operate in practice. However, one could
reasonably turn her argument against her and say that if she does not
like principles clauses, she should accept that clause 1 is, in a way,
a clause of generality or principle, which may not have many teeth or
substance and which may serve a political rather than a purely
functional
purpose.</div><a name="09061161000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
add another general concern, which strays forward into clause 2. It
relates to the operation of so-called Henry VIII clauses. The only
other reminiscence that I will relate to the Committee is that the
first house I grew up in was a farm house. It was nothing very grand;
indeed, it had previously been used to store onions. It was called
Bull&#146;s lodge. Bull was in fact Boleyn, as in Anne Boleyn. It was
a small hunting box that had been owned by Sir Thomas Boleyn. It was
next to New hall, which happened to be one of Henry VIII&#146;s
palaces. Indeed, we found evidence that he and Anne had been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>courting, because there was a secret passage between the two. That is
the early memory, but I was going to say that Anne Boleyn had a nasty
time at the hands of Henry VIII, and we should resist Henry VIII
clauses in
principle.</div><a name="09061161000128"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000289"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I will not try to try to top my hon.
Friend&#146;s penchant for reminiscing, and I certainly cannot come
up with anything that wonderful. However, does he agree that the danger
in the clause, and the objections to it, as laid out by my hon. Friend
the Member for Forest of Dean, relate not so much to a Henry VIII
clause problem as to a King Canute clause problem? The Government are
trying to stand in front of the advancing waves of inequality and order
them to retreat. If they are to deal with inequality via disadvantage,
they need to build some sea walls or a dam to hold them back, rather
than just standing there ordering the waves to go back. That is the
problem with the
Bill.</div><a name="09061161000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000290"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> That was a helpful intervention although I would
go further. What might be termed hard defences against
inequality&#151;I have some experience; I do not make much of it, but
I used to be the Minister with responsibility for sea
defences&#151;are not always better than what might be called soft
defences, which try to change culture and explain that certain things
are not acceptable. Nevertheless, the intervention was
helpful.</div><a name="09061161000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000291"></a>Emily
Thornberry:</b> I am getting confused and I wonder whether the
hon. Gentleman will enlighten us. If Opposition members of the
Committee think that this is a King Canute clause, with my hon. and
learned Friend the Solicitor-General standing before the sea and
ordering it to go back, what alternatives do they suggest? What are the
hard defences that we are not using?</div>
<a name="09061161000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000292"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady. She reminds me of
the anecdote about a gentleman went to a conference, which a friend had
advised him to attend, because he was confused. On his return, his
friend asked how he was. The man replied, &#147;Still confused, but
at a somewhat higher
level.&#148;</div><a name="09061161000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000293"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Perhaps I can help the hon. Lady. I alluded to a
specific issue. One of the clear disadvantages that many people from
poorer backgrounds face is the lack of availability of excellent
schools. They cannot offset the disadvantage of their parental income
by going to a good school that enables them to reach their full
potential. The solution is for central Government and local authorities
to implement policies that ensure that there are more good schools and
that those children have access to them. That is the solution, but it
will be achieved not by putting this measure into law, but by political
action and the necessary steps being taken. That is how we tackle
socio-economic
disadvantage.</div><a name="09061161000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000294"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He prompts me to
make one point, but I promise to reply in substance to the hon.
Lady&#146;s question in a minute. In my constituency, I have a
continued, strong concern that in pursuing what might be
called&#151;perhaps unfairly&#151;an urban agenda, the Government
tend to overlook the fact that there are areas and pockets of rural
deprivation that can be just as intense, and are often aggravated by
relative affluence alongside them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div><a name="09061161000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">In rural areas
such as my constituency and that of my hon. Friend, there are issues
such as whether or not young people have access to wheels and can get
about and get a job or further education. It is incumbent on us all,
whatever our politics, to take those matters seriously, and I hope that
that is not a matter that divides us.</div>
<a name="09061161000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prompted by
the hon. Lady&#151;I would have said this anyway&#151;there is some
analysis to be done on the clause. The Bill is about equality and
dealing with discrimination, and it reflects and consolidates a body of
law that aims to protect the individual from discrimination. However, I
am concerned that the clause sits ill with that, as it is an injunction
to public authorities at a strategic level. The essence of
discrimination is that it is at a tactical level&#151;there is one
exception, which I will perhaps come on to&#151;and not at a
strategic level. The exception might be institutional
deprivation&#151;not racism&#151;in some local authorities that
prevents them from dealing with issues for their less disadvantaged
persons. If the Government are arguing that, I would like the
Solicitor-General to say so. My view is that if that is happening, the
ballot box is the answer, not a Government intervention or a clunky
legal process. Unless that is the case, however, it is better for local
authorities to make decisions.</div>
<a name="09061161000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I apologise
for not having spotted this earlier and put down an amendment, but
clause 1(1) refers
to</div><a name="09061161000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;making
decisions of a strategic
nature&#148;.</div><a name="09061161000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not clear whether those are intermediate decisions. I could
understand it if the clause mentioned drawing up a strategy, as that
would be similar to having ministerial guidance about a strategy for a
local or public authority, but this is somewhere between high strategy
and a tactical decision, which I suggest is the main focus of
discrimination in practice. Somewhere along the line, every time people
make a decision, there is a difficult evidential problem of how to
decide as a local or public authority whether that is a strategic
decision. If it is not a strategic plan and something appears to come
out of that, then they have to decide whether it deals with
socio-economic inequalities.</div>
<a name="09061161000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">It needs to
be recorded that there are other considerations for public authorities,
which may need to balance other factors, including the welfare of the
majority of their inhabitants, for example, and overall economic
development, if that is not consistent with dealing with socio-economic
inequalities. Those are fundamentally political decisions. Unless there
is some equivalent of institutional racism&#151;I am interested to
know whether there is any evidence for that; I do not think that there
is&#151;those decisions are better left for local and public
authorities and our other administrative mechanisms, such as
inspection.</div><a name="09061161000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inequality
has to be dealt with locally. There is a national issue of concern,
which is why we are here trying to get this right. But delivery will be
at local level and that means making, as I have suggested, a tactical
decision, perhaps when siting a school or a clinic, or something like
that, or the involvement of a non-governmental organisation to try to
extend the efficiency of the public sector. Again, it is appropriate
that such decisions are made
locally.</div><a name="09061161000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the motives behind the clause and it is just conceivable
that it might do some good as a kind-bully pulpit, but that is the only
argument for this clause, which is not well articulated. The remedies
and sanctions under it&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div><a name="09061161000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000295"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> My hon. Friend says that the clause is a bully
pulpit, which means that there is a danger of passing laws to send
messages, which we discussed earlier. If a clause is going to be used
to send a message, the message needs to be clear. There is a fleck of
clarity in the first part of the clause. I talked earlier about
disadvantage and the need to increase equality of opportunity, but the
clause mentions inequalities of outcome. There is a significant
difference between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome. If
a piece of legislation is going to be passed to send messages, there
needs to be clarity about the message that is
sent.</div><a name="09061161000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000296"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> That is an honourable and proper stricture. If
one is looking for ways of dealing with redressing the inequality of
outcome, I suggest a measure of redistribution within the tax system.
[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;] I
thought I would get some results with that. At least then we could have
a discussion about it. There is the slight danger that the message
being sent by the clause is, &#147;Oh dear. We&#146;ve got an
unequal society and we&#146;re going to legislate to stop
it.&#148;</div><a name="09061161000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000297"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Do it take it from what the hon.
Gentleman has said that he is on board for the 50p tax rate and off
board for inheritance
tax?</div><a name="09061161000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000298"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I hope that the Solicitor-General will not go too
far down that line, because it might distress you to know,
Mr. Benton, as she well knows, that the 50p rate is likely
to have a negative real yield and that measures to ameliorate
inheritance tax have been encouraged by the Government themselves in
response to Conservative initiatives. But we will leave the issue of
redistributive
taxation.</div><a name="09061161000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would feel happier with a society where people had opportunity and were
not frustrated, discriminated against or humiliated. Whether the
clause, with its high-sounding rubric and poor, questionable and
indirect delivery, will achieve that is a matter that we may wish to
test later
on.</div><a name="09061161000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061161000299"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): I, too, welcome you to the Chair,
Mr.
Benton.</div><a name="09061161000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to follow a couple of comments made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Daventry and mention my recent experience as a county
councillor&#151;I was in that role until last week&#151;during
which time I held the portfolio on equalities for three years. With
that portfolio, I was keen to move away from the output-based duties
and tick-box exercises that had led to the exercise of the duties in
question becoming discredited, and towards a more outcome-based series
of plans, on which action could be
taken.</div><a name="09061161000195"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000300"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I do not want to interrupt my hon.
Friend&#146;s argument, but perhaps I can tell him something that
will be some consolation to him: he may not know that the leader of his
excellent county council lives a mere whisker across the constituency
boundary, about a mile from me. So near am I to that constituency
boundary that I regularly receive missives from Oxfordshire county
council through the postal system, telling me how well it is doing. I
can say that those are genuine achievements, which I welcome and
encourage people in Northamptonshire to
emulate.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div><a name="09061161000207"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000301"></a>John
Howell:</b> I thank my hon. Friend. I have learned in my year
here that flattery comes rarely in one&#146;s parliamentary life, so
it is always nice to have it unprompted from an hon. Friend.</div>
<a name="09061161000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">In changing
to outcome-based plans, one of the most crucial things to understand is
that the choices are political. Whether they are called strategic,
tactical or tactically-strategic is neither here nor there; they are
political choices in relation to what outcomes are wanted. It is
impossible to achieve a large number of outcomes, so there is a need to
be selective about them.</div>
<a name="09061161000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">In reality
there was a significant overlap between the socio-economic
disadvantages in the county and the groups covered by the existing
equalities duties. Paragraph 42 of the explanatory notes
gives an example from the health sector about targeting specific groups
where health inequalities existed and the messages might not have got
home for a variety of reasons. That was already being done as a
political priority, and there was no better example of it than the
joint appointment of a director of public health between the county
council and the primary care trust, precisely so that there could be a
focus on such disadvantages across the area, and so that the equality
duties that already existed could be used as a significant lever for
achievement. My question, therefore, is what additionality the measure
brings to that system, which is already working.</div>
<a name="09061161000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
question arises from experience of unintended consequences. I am
thinking of the Building Schools for the Future programme in my
constituency, where there are pockets of deprivation, despite its
description by <i class="I">The Guardian</i> as &#147;opulent&#148;. There
are enormous areas of deprivation, some of which are semi-urban but
some of which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry mentioned
earlier, are places of obvious rural deprivation.</div>
<a name="09061161000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Building
Schools for the Future programme places a clear emphasis on building
schools where there is socio-economic deprivation&#151;I do not have
a problem with that. However, the orientation and limits that have been
set have produced results that do not match need, meaning that although
one can visit a school and, on leaning accidentally against the wall,
come away with bits of wood in one&#146;s hand, because it is so
rotten, one can still be told that the school deserves nothing because
it is not in a socio-economically deprived area.</div>
<a name="09061161000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
unintended consequence, and we need to be careful when we include the
type of duty in question with much harder&#151;stronger, rather than
more difficult&#151;duties which, in my experience, are being
exercised with great fairness and awareness, including political
awareness, of what is happening in a council
area.</div><a name="09061161000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000302"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for
Henley, who is my neighbour. He has made a fine contribution to the
House in his short time here and I remember his maiden speech. My
feelings about him are somewhat strengthened by the fact that I spent
weeks, ultimately fruitlessly, wandering around villages in the north
of his constituency during the by-election seeking to prevent his
election&#151;I still have the blisters.</div>
<a name="09061161000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a few
points to make in respect of clause 1, and I wish to ask the Minister
to reconsider a couple of things in respect of the amendments that deal
with regulators, one of which was tabled by my hon. Friend 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green and I, and the other, which is
more detailed, by the hon. Member for Glasgow,
East.</div><a name="09061161000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that although she thought that there might be merit in
imposing a duty, such as it is, on inspectors and regulators, it would
not be consistent or rational to do so because one could not impose the
same duty on the bodies they regulate. She might therefore consider
that such a measure might be fruitless in some way. I question that,
because the duty in clause 1 is that the bodies to which it applies
must, when carrying out their
functions,</div><a name="09061161000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have
due regard to the desirability of exercising them in a way that is
designed to reduce the inequalities of outcome which result from
socio-economic
disadvantage.&#148;</div><a name="09061161000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister explained on Second Reading that that was as far as she could
go.</div>
<a name="09061161000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
talking about any sort of guarantee on socio-economic disadvantage, so
it is not right to say that simply because the duty to bear
socio-economic inequalities in mind cannot be imposed on the private
sector, one should not impose a duty on the inspectors of the private
sector. It would not do any harm if the inspectors of utilities, for
example, concentrated on the duty or were to make a point of it by
giving advice or making representations, in a non-binding way, to those
they inspect. The fact that someone is not bound to follow advice, that
there is no legal duty for them to do so, or that there is no duty to
implement advice&#151;or even to have regard to it&#151;does not
mean that that advice should not be given. Advice can be a steer for
those who are regulated, and regulators could set out their priorities
and focus. Will the Minister reconsider her opposition to the thrust of
the proposals, if it is based only on the fact that the duty does not
apply to all those regulated by the inspector? It does not need to do
so to obtain the benefit set out by the hon. Member for Glasgow,
East.</div><a name="09061161000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes
public and private sector bodies are subject to regulation and
inspection by regulators and inspectorates. Health service
inspectorates, for example, cover private and public sector
organisations. The same defence of the Minister&#146;s opposition
does not apply in those circumstances. Indeed, given that organisations
in the health service are subject to so many demands, including,
rightly, those in the clause, it would be helpful if health service
inspectorates had to have regard to socio-economic inequalities in
their inspections of organisations. Otherwise, there will be a
concentration purely on other matters, such as quality and efficiency.
They are important, but we might lose an opportunity to deal with
equity, which is a big issue for primary care trusts, which are rightly
listed. It should also be an issue for providers, because their
policies on the cost of car parking, for example, can have serious
equity
implications.</div><a name="09061161000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather
than list all the providers, as the Minister has chosen not to do in
the Bill, we could deal with the problem by ensuring that the health
service inspectorates have regard to socio-economic inequality in the
advice they give to, or in the metrics they develop for judging, health
service providers. They would be able to point to the Bill and give a
clearer steer. I hope the Minister deals with that in her
response.</div>
<a name="09061161000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also wanted
to make a point on the need to send a message. I agree with the hon.
Member for Forest of Dean that we should not legislate solely for the
purpose 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>of sending a message, especially when such messages are usually not
received and understood by the recipients, so that becomes a waste of
legislative time. I do not even think that it is a good supplementary
reason. My hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green and I
support the clause&#151;with reservations, because we think that it
is not the best way to do things and that it does not go far
enough&#151;not because it sends a message, but because it might have
an impact. I asked the hon. Member for Forest of Dean to confirm his
view because many of us are sick and tired of hearing politicians in
this House say in the criminal justice field, for example in relation
to the criminalisation and classification of drugs, that the point of a
provision is to send a message, when even the Government&#146;s
advisers are clear that there is not a shred of evidence that that
message is received or understood. I will take the opportunity, if I
have one, to quote his view to his colleagues on his party&#146;s
home affairs team who do not share it, at least on that
issue.</div><a name="09061161000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
there is the question of whether this is the best way to achieve the
Government&#146;s genuine intention of dealing with socio-economic
inequalities. I do not believe that it is simply a way to provoke the
Conservative party into arguing that there is some form of class war,
and I was glad that the hon. Member for Forest of Dean did not rise to
that bait in the tone and tenor of his remarks. I do not believe that
that is the Government&#146;s intention; the Government&#146;s
intention is to tackle the problem.</div>
<a name="09061161000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I do
not think that there is a choice between the clause and, for example,
dealing with taxation. My party is untainted by what the hon. Member
for Daventry called the Government&#146;s collusion in the
inheritance tax arms war that took place 18 months ago. We think that
that was a regressive step. It would be a regressive tax change, and it
is far better to make progressive tax
changes.</div><a name="09061161000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to our fundamental point, there must be alternative and better
ways of dealing with the problem. The Government should at least have
considered that through formal consultation, rather than leaping
straight for such provisions at the last minute. That was why my hon.
Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green asked whether the
Government had consulted on the question of whether socio-economic
disadvantage should be a protected characteristic. Why not argue that
that might be a way forward, whether or not we deal with it at a later
stage, as we might well do? It would be interesting to know whether the
Government considered a range of options before arriving at the present
one.</div><a name="09061161000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is very much a clause stand part debate. In relation to my earlier
point of order, most of the clauses in the Bill are restatements of
existing laws that we all support on race and disability
discrimination, and clause stand part debates are unlikely to be sought
on any of them. On brand new legislation, where a principle is
involved, it is likely that a clause stand part debate will be sought,
certainly by Liberal Democrat Members. We will seek to engage with the
Government behind the scenes. I ask the Minister and the Conservatives
to consider engaging us in conversation about what debates they wish to
have on clause stand part. There will be isolated areas where we,
separately from the Conservative party, will want to agree with the
Government, or to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>disagree because we do not think that they have gone far enough. It is
slightly easier to make such points in a separate stand part debate, if
they are made briefly.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000303"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Mr. Benton, I do not know
whether you are now in a position to decide whether we will have a
clause stand part debate. It seems to me that everybody has fed into
our debate on the amendments all that they want to say about the
general principle. However, I assume that we will not overlook the
presence of amendment 110, which will follow separately&#151;thanks
for that
indication.</div><a name="09061161000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton, and look forward to
your wisdom, which has already been helpful, on how to run the
Committee sensibly and fluidly and, with a bit of luck, with a touch of
fun occasionally. I have been groping for a historical story to tell
back, but have failed
miserably.</div><a name="09061161000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
2 proposes to replace the list of organisations to which the duty
applies with a power to list the public authorities in regulations. I
just cannot see the point, really. It is a new duty covering only a
limited number of organisations, so it is important that they are
listed as early and clearly as possible. We think that we have them
more or less right, and it is not a long list because it is intended to
apply only to high-level strategic bodies taking key
decisions.</div>
<a name="09061161000208"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div>
<a name="09061161000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think that
we should make it clear to the public and to everyone else to whom this
will apply that we do not intend to add significantly to that list, but
of course one cannot future-proof the clause, so it is necessary to
have an element of flexibility, which is what we have sought in the
drafting. We respectfully suggest that there is not much point in
amendment 2, although it has helpfully probed the way our minds have
worked on the matter. In a sense, oddly enough, and in contrast with
most of the other amendments, the proposed subsection would extend the
clause&#146;s scope, so I am pleased to assume that most Members see
the value of the duty, because they want to broaden its
ambit.</div><a name="09061161000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will now deal with the other amendments in what I think is the most
appropriate order. Amendment 107 was tabled by the hon. Member for
Glasgow, East, who impressed me with his commitment to ending
socio-economic equality and whom I invite to try to persuade his
colleagues on the matter, as he offered to be a go-between and speak to
us and the currently intransigent Scottish Government. We would welcome
his mediation and anything he could do to encourage his colleagues to
see what we think is
sense.</div><a name="09061161000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman said that he supports the clause as far as it goes,
which I am glad to hear. If the Scottish Government want to go further,
that is fine, but the amendment prompts us to ask why they do not also
support the clause as far as it goes and make a clear statement that
they seriously intend to tackle socio-economic
inequality.</div><a name="09061161000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the hon. Gentleman did not vote on Second Reading. I do not
know whether that indicates that he was confused about the position
then, but that would be entirely
understandable.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div><a name="09061161000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000304"></a>John
Mason:</b> To clarify for the Minister, I was in fact at a
conference that day and unable to attend the
debate.</div><a name="09061161000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000305"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Well, we missed the hon. Gentleman. I
know that the amendment is well-intentioned. It would apply the duty
set out in clause 1 to certain inspectorates and regulators that he has
pinpointed, including those covering financial services, communities
and utilities, which are essential to people&#146;s lives and lack of
fair access to which is likely to influence socio-economic
outcomes.</div><a name="09061161000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty is the one I put to the hon. Gentleman to reflect on while
he advocated his case: extending the duty to the regulators would have
no effect on those bodies, which cannot have the duty extended to them
as it applies to strategic public authorities, so that is where it
would stop. If a body has no duty to abide by clause 1,
giving the inspectorate the duty to abide by that clause cannot drive
the statutory obligation into the recipient of the inspection. It
simply
cannot.</div><a name="09061161000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000306"></a>Sandra
Osborne:</b> The Minister makes a good point in logical terms,
but many people would be sympathetic to the intention of the amendment,
because we all know that many of our poorer constituents are adversely
affected by, for example, fuel prices and pre-payment meters. Has she
had discussions with Citizens Advice about that and what does she think
made it feel that the amendment was
viable?</div><a name="09061161000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000307"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I assume that it is the line of
reasoning the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon put forward,
but I think that it is defective in exactly the way I have said: if one
puts a duty on someone, an inspectorate can drive it, but if they have
no duty, putting the duty on the inspectorate cannot drive that duty
through. We have to do it in different ways, which of course we are
doing.</div><a name="09061161000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I do not know what the Scottish Government are doing about this, but we
are trying to get rid of the penalty on pre-payment meters. We have a
consistent, strong and immediately applicable plan to replace all
pre-payment meters with smart meters so that the penalty will, as soon
as is practical, be driven out of our poorest sections. Many things are
being done broadly to assist action against fuel poverty, as the hon.
Member for Glasgow, East knows, and it is slightly odd that he seeks to
drive in that indirect way bodies that cannot be driven in such fashion
while saying, &#147;Well, actually, my Government do not think that
the clause is worthwhile.&#148;</div>
<a name="09061161000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000308"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Is the Minister saying&#151;I think she is, but
it would be useful to have confirmation&#151;that if there is a
disturbing practice or outcome in private sector delivery, the
regulator of that private sector is at least not precluded from making
comments to encourage improvements in the practice, even if it is
outside the statutory duty, just because the delivery is entirely
within the private
sector?</div><a name="09061161000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000309"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> That is done, as the hon. Gentleman
knows, and there is an agenda, which everyone has talked about, to try
to use those powers to minimise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>socio-economic inequality, among other things that regulators try to do.
My point is reasonably clear. It is about statutory
duty.</div><a name="09061161000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000310"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="09061161000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000311"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Of course, but the hon. Lady&#146;s
amendment is slightly different and I will come to it in a
moment.</div><a name="09061161000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000312"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> There is a disconnect or illogicality about
saying, as the Minister did to Conservative Members, that something
does no harm, so what is the objection? I ask her the same question:
what is the harm in giving the duty to a regulator when it can only do
good if its advice is to &#147;have regard to&#148;, even if it
cannot compel? The clause is not one that
compels.</div><a name="09061161000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000313"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It does no harm to include a provision
such as clause 1. Even under the Tory position that it does not go far
enough and will not be effective there is no harm in it. We believe
that it is quite a strong measure, but from the Tory position there is
no harm in it because it is bound to push things in the right
direction.</div><a name="09061161000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point is simple, and I have made it three times. If there is no
statutory duty, people cannot be compelled to comply with it by putting
a statutory duty on inspectorates. The matter is straightforward, and I
do not understand why the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon is
shaking his head. Otherwise, we simply could not reach the electricity
suppliers and so on. The argument, with which I am hugely sympathetic
because the intention is obviously to drive the agenda, just does not
work.</div><a name="09061161000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000314"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I do not understand why the Minister believes that
it would not be worth ensuring that regulators of, for example, the
utilities&#151;the case in respect of health workers is separate, but
even stronger&#151;could pass comment on the performance of the
people they regulate, whether or not they have a statutory power to
enforce that or whether or not there is a duty on those who are
regulated to take
note.</div><a name="09061161000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would still be useful, not least for transparency and understanding,
that the public authority concerned&#151;inspectorates are public
authorities&#151;could judge utilities&#146; performance in that
way. Utilities are not prevented from taking heed of what the
inspectorate says, even if there is no statutory duty to do
so.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div><a name="09061161000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000315"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> They can, they do and they will carry
on doing so. That specific statutory duty cannot be driven by the
regulators, but they may make whatever comment they want about how
suppliers deliver. The health service is very different, and I will
turn to
that.</div><a name="09061161000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000316"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Before the Minister does so, I want to pick her up
on how she characterises our approach. We are not saying that the
provision does not go far enough. It is the wrong approach for solving
these significant problems. Other hon. Members have said that they
agree with the approach but that it does not go far enough; we believe
that it is simply the wrong way to approach some of the issues. I want
to clarify that for
her.</div><a name="09061161000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000317"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I was trying to deal with the separate
point that the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green raised, and I am
sorry if I misrepresented the hon. Gentleman. He is right, and he did
not say that the measure does not go far enough. He said that there are
better things to do, but we will do this, because we believe that it is
a compelling way forward and that it will help immensely in driving
socio-economic inequality from our public
services.</div><a name="09061161000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the whole, regulators do not take pre-strategic decisions about service
planning or commissioning, nor do they expect to do so, but those are
the decisions that we want to influence.</div>
<a name="09061161000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061161000318"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> May I pick the Minister up on that, because I am
not sure that it is true? Ofwat, the regulator for the water industry,
is not mentioned in the provision, but it certainly takes key decisions
because it is responsible for considering the capital programmes
suggested by the water companies and weighing up against a range of
objectives the implications of those plans for water prices. Those are
significant and strategic for the industry. Clearly, the regulator
receives guidance from the Government on what it is supposed to
achieve, but it makes significant decisions about the price of
water.</div><a name="09061161000209"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.25
