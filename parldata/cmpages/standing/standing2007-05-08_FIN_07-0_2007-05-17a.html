							<a name="07051790000285"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):
						</b> We are
pleased to have you back in the Chair, Mr. Gale. You missed
a most illuminating and lengthy sitting this morning. I hope that we
can reach a swifter conclusion on this clause, not least because of the
turnout so far on the Opposition
Benches.</div>
					<a name="07051790000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several
points were raised this morning, and I hope to give the Committee
further reassurance on a couple of points of detail. At the end of the
sitting, I was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>explaining the importance, which paragraph 13 of the guidance stresses,
of considering all the circumstances in the round. I explained two
examples in which a fall in the value of FTSE 100 shares gives rise
genuinely to a loss, which can be offset elsewhere on gains, where the
tax advantages are incidental but the transactions are genuine. I also
explained the straightforward way in which statutory tax relief can be
passed between husband and wife in a way that allows a loss to be set
against a gain. The clause does not interfere with that normal tax
practice and
planning.</div>
					<a name="07051790000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was
much discussion about whether the guidance provides sufficient clarity.
As I said this morning, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs is
working with the representative bodies on improving the guidance, and
we will publish revised guidance before Report. However, it is
important to remember that for the vast majority of people, the
guidance will not be relevant, as they will not be caught by clause 27,
which contains a targeted anti-avoidance rule to counter tax-avoidance
schemes that make use of contrived capital
losses.</div>
					<a name="07051790000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation was first published in draft with the pre-Budget report. At
the same time, HMRC also published a statement setting out why it was
necessary and the key principles that underpinned it. The key principle
is that relief for capital losses should be available only if a person
has suffered a genuine commercial loss and a real
disposal.</div>
					<a name="07051790000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
was recognised this morning, there is always a grey area, a question of
debate, in dealing with tax avoidance. The HMRC statement of principle
and guidance makes that area for debate as narrow as possible. It is
necessary to do that in guidance in order that we have flexibility.
These things cannot all be tied down in the Bill. However, as I said
this morning, the person entering into the arrangements is best placed
to decide whether gaining a tax advantage was a main purpose of the
arrangements. The sort of arrangements that the clause is aimed at are
not entered into by accident. People know when they are setting out to
avoid tax, and the clause is intended to catch them if they
are.</div>
					<a name="07051790000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments,
taken together, would simply weaken the targeted anti-avoidance rule in
the clause. They would introduce uncertainty for those who do not seek
to avoid tax and would leave loopholes for those who seek to avoid
paying the right amount of tax, while introducing unnecessary
regulation-making powers for HMRC. I therefore ask the Committee to
reject the amendments, and I reaffirm my commitment to providing all
members of the Committee with the detailed and updated guidance before
Report, which I am sure will make for interesting reading for all, but
especially for the hon. Member for Braintree and Mrs.
Newmark in case there is nothing decent to watch on
telly.</div>
					
					<a name="07051790000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07051790000286"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): It is a pleasure to see you in
the Chair this afternoon, Mr. Gale. I am sure that
Mrs. Hoban and I will find something much more interesting
than the guidance to read, regardless of what is on television during
the recess. However, I thank the Economic Secretary for his comments on
the guidance, because it had crossed my mind that it would be helpful
for the guidance to be available before Report, so that if we felt that
it was still not quite right, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>
						we would have the opportunity to probe further on
Report. In a sense, the withdrawal of my amendments this morning was
predicated on the adequacy of the guidance, so the present approach is
an appropriate way to try to resolve the problems before Report. It
will give us and the representative bodies the opportunity to think
again and consider whether there are further areas of doubt or
ambiguity about which we want to probe the Government&#146;s
intentions.</div>
					<a name="07051790000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
debate on &#147;main purpose&#148; had some interesting elements. I
had always thought that there could only be one &#147;main
purpose&#148; until I got involved in Finance Bills. However, the
Economic Secretary mentioned earlier that there can be many main
purposes. Clearly, therefore, the rules of grammar and of English usage
are suspended somewhat when it comes to finance legislation.</div>
					<a name="07051790000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Economic
Secretary said also that he did not wish there to be any ambiguity in
the drafting of legislation. That is a fair comment, but it is
important that ambiguity is not introduced in the guidance either, so
we want to ensure that that guidance is clear. In mentioning the
avoidance of tax liability, he made a point that had eluded me in my
remarks on the earlier amendments; he mentioned schemes that would give
rise to repayment, and his argument was I think
correct.</div>
					<a name="07051790000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the eager
expectation of the revised guidance becoming available, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07051790000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051790000287"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Before we proceed, it might be helpful to say
that I do not propose to have a stand part debate on the clause, given
the copious debate that took place on it under the guise of earlier
amendments, and given also that we are about to debate amendment No.
37.</div>

							<a name="07051790000288"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 37, in
clause 27, page 17, line 34, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1A) This
section does not apply where the aggregate of a person&#146;s
allowable losses does not exceed &#163;25,000 in the year of
assessment.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07051790000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am disappointed that we shall not have a stand part debate,
Mr. Gale, but I shall bear my disappointment manfully. In
his remarks on the previous group of amendments, the Economic Secretary
said that there was an expectation that very few people would be caught
by the clause. That is absolutely right; one hopes that taxpayers will
not need to have resort to an understanding either of the clause or of
the guidance notes, and the details to which we have applied ourselves.
However, bearing in mind the breadth of the clause, it might be helpful
to taxpayers&#151;particularly those with small capital
losses&#151;if we introduced a de minimis limit. The amendment would
introduce such a limit, thereby disapplying the clause in cases where
the aggregate of a person&#146;s losses in any one year did not
exceed &#163;25,000.</div>
					<a name="07051790000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Economic Secretary
indicated earlier, and we concurred, that much of the focus of the
clause is on expensive, marketed, tax avoidance schemes. I assume that
the cost of most such schemes, and the fees that people pay to tax
advisers to implement them, means that they relate to fairly
significant amounts of money and to the generation of fairly
significant capital losses. I assume that someone whose losses were
less than 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>&#163;25,000 would not adopt such a scheme&#151;whether it be
contrived and complex, or simple&#151;and the intention of the
amendment is to make it clear that, in the case of relatively small
losses, taxpayers need not bother to understand the details of the
clause or of the guidance.
</div>
					<a name="07051790000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its comments on
the clause, the Chartered Institute of Taxation
said:</div>
					<a name="07051790000234"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At the
Open Day, HMRC stated that, if a transaction was caught by the rules,
it would be incorrect to then exempt it due to it being less than a de
minimis amount. However, we consider that, in view of the uncertainty
as to how the rules will be implemented, and that a wide range of
ordinary transactions could potentially be caught, giving rise to a
significant administrative burden, a de minimis amount should be
applied per person, below which losses are not
disallowed.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051790000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
institute suggested a de minimis amount of &#163;100,000. I have been
somewhat less generous, but I should be grateful if the Economic
Secretary would comment on the proposal.</div>

Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): I wish to make a
comment in passing, and I will be interested to hear what my hon.
Friend the Economic Secretary says about it. The hon. Member for
Fareham rightly pointed out that the CIOT suggested a de minimis limit
of 100,000, but I say to my hon. Friends that the amendment and the way
in which he carefully moved it indicate the different worlds in which
we live, particularly those of us from parts north of
Watford.</div>
					<a name="07051790000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning
the hon. Gentleman referred to &#147;relatively small&#148; losses
and he used the same term this afternoon when moving the amendment. He
also mentioned &#147;small capital losses&#148;. I say to him and
his hon. Friends that I have had the great good fortune for most of my
working life to be a higher-rate taxpayer, along with less than 10 per
cent. of the population. That said, the concept of &#163;25,000 being
a relatively small loss is beyond my financial ken, as it would be for
the vast majority of my
constituents.</div>
					<a name="07051790000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the concept of a de minimis limit and how it might help in
certain circumstances. However, to point out to the Committee the
different ways in which Members from different parties view such
things, if I were to suffer a capital loss of &#163;25,000, or
&#163;20,000, I would regard it not as a relatively small or a small
capital loss but as pretty catastrophic. Fortunately, because I am not
a speculator and do not play the casino economy on the stock market, I
am unlikely to suffer any such capital loss. If I did, it would not be
relatively small to me, and it would not be to my constituents or to
most of those who vote
Labour.</div>

								Ed
Balls:
						</b> I note my hon. Friend&#146;s comments on
the&#151;how can one put it?&#151;rather elastic concept of middle
England that is sometimes employed in these tax debates. I fear that
you might rule me out of order, Mr. Gale, so I shall come to
the detail of the amendment. It would alter clause 27 by prohibiting
the anti-avoidance rule from applying in any tax year in which a
person&#146;s loss does not exceed &#163;25,000. The intention
behind the amendment, as the hon. Member for Fareham set out, is to
make things simpler for the majority of individuals who do not use
avoidance schemes involving capital losses, by allowing them to ignore
the new rule in the clause if their losses are modest. It is a
reasonable aim, with which we sympathise.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div>
					<a name="07051790000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The hon.
Gentleman is right that the overwhelming majority of individuals are
likely to have no capital losses in any one year and that most of those
engaged in such schemes have losses substantially in excess of
&#163;25,000, but there will be a small number of individuals who
fall in the middle. I understand his desire to see whether something
can be done to simplify matters for that group of people but, having
examined the amendment in detail, our conclusion is that it is rather
unattractive. It would allow contrived losses of &#163;25,000 to be
manufactured and then rolled up each year. That could let a tax avoider
stock up tax losses for use when the opportunity arose. For instance,
after four years of careful planning, it would be possible to
accumulate &#163;100,000-worth of artificially contrived losses to
set off against a properly taxable gain made in a later year.</div>
					<a name="07051790000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should warn the Committee
that one avoidance scheme of which HMRC is aware could easily be
adapted for the mass market and used to generate losses of
&#163;25,000 per user per year. That loss could be set against
income, giving a maximum income tax saving of up to &#163;10,000 per
annum for a higher-rate payer. Such a scheme would clearly have a
serious impact on the Exchequer, potentially costing millions or even
billions of pounds. We would then be into difficult territory and I am
sure that we would be forced to revisit the de minimis
limit.</div>
					<a name="07051790000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
are a small number of individuals for whom there is a question whether
losses below &#163;25,000 are contrived or not. Given the potential
for the amendment to be abused and marketed in the contrived way that I
have set out, at substantial Exchequer cost, our conclusion is that it
would introduce an unjustified loophole to tax avoidance. I hope that,
given that explanation, the hon. Gentleman will understand why we
propose to reject the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07051790000291"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I will not go into the semantics of what relatively
small losses are and what their impact is on various Members&#146;
constituents, because I think that that is a slightly pointless route
to go down.</div>
					<a name="07051790000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking
back at the way that the debate has unfolded, the Conservatives have
sought to stick to the principle, which we support, of clamping down on
contrived capital losses, while at the same time ensuring that, for
people who perhaps have relatively small share portfolios, a second
property or some other assets, there is a relatively straightforward
way for them to navigate these rules.</div>
					<a name="07051790000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I made the point that we have a
broadly written clause and people are untaxed through the guidance.
What we have sought to do is to provide greater clarity in the clause,
to ensure that taxpayers&#151;relatively straightforward
taxpayers&#151;can work their way through all the provisions and not
feel obliged to seek the professional advice of my former colleagues in
the accountancy profession. I am always keen to ensure that people do
not have to pay compliance costs if they are unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="07051790000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I sense that
the Minister understands those concerns and he has tried to allay some
of them by refining the guidance, and I am grateful for that. However,
I sense that those taxpayers who will incur modest losses will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>still need to go through the full rigour of the procedure, and they will
need to understand what their transactions are doing. I am not sure
that we have made any real progress in trying to alleviate those
burdens for taxpayers with relatively small
losses.</div>
					<a name="07051790000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we
have made some progress, we have not made substantial progress. Having
said that, in the context of the de minimis limit, I am intrigued by
the concept of a mass market capital losses avoidance scheme. It
certainly would not be of much use in Wolverhampton, South-West and if
it does not meet the market needs in Wolverhampton, South-West, where
will it meet market needs?</div>
					<a name="07051790000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the
Minister&#146;s concern about how the de minimus limit could be
abused. On that basis, I shall ask the Committee&#146;s leave to
withdraw the amendment. However, I would hope that the Minister might
consider, between now and Report, whether we can take any other
practical steps to reduce the burden on people with relatively small
capital losses who wish to take responsibility for their own affairs
without having to be burdened by understanding complex statements of
principle and
guidance.</div>

								Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> Again, this is one of those areas where I think
that there is consensus, not just between the Opposition and the
Government, but between the various professional bodies, too. The
consensus is that there are schemes that misuse life insurance and the
practice of rebating commission to create an untaxed gain.</div>
					<a name="07051790000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I want to ask
the Minister two questions about the clause. As we both know, and
welcome, most financial advisers are moving away from commission-based
remuneration towards fee-based remuneration. That might be achieved by
an adviser rebating the commission back to his customer, who would then
pay a fee instead. Alternatively, the adviser may augment the amount
that is being reinvested on behalf of his client. Does the Economic
Secretary believe that such a course might slow down the shift from
commission-based to fee-based remuneration? Might it act as a
barrier?</div>
					<a name="07051790000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
anti-fragmentation rule asks people to see whether the total value of
three years&#146; life assurance policies exceeds &#163;100,000.
There has been some concern about how easy that will be to administer.
Will the Economic Secretary confirm whether the &#163;100,000 de
minimis limit&#151;depending on how it crops up in successive
clauses&#151;will apply only to life policies for which commission
has been waived? Or will it apply to all life policies that an
individual might
have?</div>

						<a name="07051790000293"></a>
							<b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): I shall be
brief, because there is consensus on this matter. The Association of
British Insurers welcomes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div>the clause as a targeted anti-avoidance measure that has been introduced
after it was informally consulted. The Chartered Institute of Taxation
said that the proposed changes appear reasonable, and the Institute of
Chartered Accountants for England and Wales
said:</div>
					<a name="07051790000235"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
understand and support measures to counter tax
avoidance&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051790000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a recurring theme of concerns about the complexity of the
provisions, however. Both the Chartered Institute of Taxation and the
Institute of Chartered Accountants for England and Wales suggested that
the complexity reflects the wider need for a process of corporation tax
reform. In particular, the ICAEW
said:</div>
					<a name="07051790000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It would
have been more comprehensible to have made a fresh start and for the
existing legislation to be replaced by a better targeted alternative,
preferably in Tax Law Rewrite style. We would welcome a commitment that
these provisions are reworked at an earlier stage to make them more
comprehensible.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051790000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether the Economic Secretary has any comments in response to those
suggestions.</div>
					<a name="07051790000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						During the
consultation process and at the Finance Bill open day, the Chartered
Institute of Taxation highlighted circumstances in which genuinely
commercial transactions could be caught, such as those in which
commission has been waived or where there is a professional obligation
not to take commission. HMRC agreed to examine cases of individuals who
have taken out a policy with the intention of drawing down not more
than 5 per cent, but whose circumstances have changed with regard to
their care, for example, and whose costs have increased by more than 5
per cent. They then suddenly find themselves having to draw down more
than 5 per cent. The question is whether there should be a motive test
to distinguish people who try to avoid tax from those who may
inadvertently be caught in such a
situation.</div>

							<a name="07051790000294"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> For the sake of completeness, I should say that I
am shortly going to a dinner of the Association of British Insurers,
although that will principally be to discuss the effects on the
insurance industry of climate change. It is worth underlining what the
hon. Lady said: the ABI, which represents 400 insurers,
covering 94 per cent. of domestic insurance, said that it broadly
welcomes the clause as drafted.</div>
					<a name="07051790000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to give the Government a
pat on the back. All too often, for understandable reasons, we sit in
the Committee with submissions from various bodies that have concerns
about the import of certain measures or the way that they are
introduced. This measure is broadly welcomed, however, and the ABI has
taken the trouble to circulate&#151;to all members of the Committee,
I suspect&#151;a message to the Government saying, &#147;Well
done.&#148;</div>
					
					<a name="07051790000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051790000295"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> As we have heard, clause 28 is an anti-avoidance
measure that tackles schemes marketed to wealthy investors who seek to
avoid tax on savings. Under a typical scheme, the investor takes out a
large, short-term life insurance policy, which is cash-based to
guarantee investment performance. The avoidance arises because the
financial adviser, who arranges the investment, rebates to the
policyholder a significant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div>proportion of the commission on the policy, so that in effect all or
virtually all the investment return on the policy is made up of
commission that is passed on to the policyholder, free of income tax,
by the adviser. The hon. Members for Fareham and for Falmouth and
Camborne, and my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West,
all reflected an industry consensus that that is an abuse of the
system. Indeed, <i class="I">Money Marketing </i>magazine<i class="I">&#151;</i>regular
evening reading in our household for us and our three
kids&#151;states:</div>
					<a name="07051790000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
change can hardly be a surprise, but the sector must hang its head in
shame. To take such a wide view of the commission taxation rules could
only lead to this kind of reaction from
HMRC.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051790000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
tax adviser from a senior accounting firm said that that
amendment</div>
					<a name="07051790000238"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ratifies what
people have thought for a long period of time, which is that it was
abusing a tax concession.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051790000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, there is a consensus for
acting. Some concern was expressed, which I think was allayed in
discussions with the industry, the ABI and others, that this part of
the clause might also apply to ordinary commission reinvestment
arrangements in which the adviser agrees to take a lower level of
commission in return for the insurer enhancing the investor&#146;s
policy. The clause would not apply in those circumstances, nor is it
the intention for it to do so.</div>
					<a name="07051790000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">In ordinary commission
reinvestment arrangements of this type, the value of the policy is
enhanced, but there is no increase in the premium. Also, the adviser
would not have a strict entitlement to the commission that they forgo;
they are not rebating any commission to which they would be entitled,
and so the clause would not apply. The outcome is that the full amount
of premium paid by the policyholder remains allowable in computing any
taxable gain, just as it has always been. It would not have to be
reduced by the amount of commission that the adviser had forgone and
the policy holder would therefore not be taxed on a gain that they have
not realised. I hope that that provides a final reassurance on some of
those concerns.</div>
					<a name="07051790000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause also includes the power to change the premium limit and minimum
holding period through regulations. That will enable the targeting of
the rules to be changed quickly if new schemes are devised in an
attempt to side-step the current criteria&#151;for instance, if
schemes become economic for premiums below &#163;100,000. I hope that
that also reassures the hon. Member for Fareham. A lot of change is
happening in the advisory world and a distribution review is being
conducted by the Financial Services Authority. There is no desire
through this legislation to slow down or impede shifts from commission
to fee-based remuneration schemes. It is our intention that ordinary
arrangements, and the kind that I have just set out, would apply in
this case. Once again, I hope that that gives some
reassurance.</div>
					<a name="07051790000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Fareham also asked about the &#163;100,000 de minimis
limit. Arguably, people should know the premium levels that they are
paying, especially in a situation in which &#163;100,000 or
thereabouts is involved. The aim of the measure is to stop the abuse of
commission arrangements that offer a tax-free return on investment over
a short period, and it is targeted carefully at the type of policy that
is used in those arrangement. As I have said, the measure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div>
						includes the power to change the premium limit if
avoidance schemes become economic for premiums below
&#163;100,000.</div>
					<a name="07051790000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
I explained, it is not our intention to catch innocent taxpayers who
did not take out a policy for avoidance motives but cashed them in
early for an unforeseen reason. The clause provides a clear objective
test to identify and target the largest short-term policies used in the
commission rebate
schemes.</div>

Balls:
						</b> The amendments will make a slight extension to the
scope of one of the anti-avoidance provisions in schedule 5 to stop
avoidance scheme promoters introducing even more contrived arrangements
to circumvent the effect of the measure.</div>
					<a name="07051790000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 15 of the schedule is
aimed at schemes that create artificial losses from a company&#146;s
holdings in offshore funds or similar collective investment schemes.
The losses are generated by the scheme making an investment that is
bound to decline in value. Shortly after the Bill was published,
disclosure was made to HMRC of a scheme that attempts to get round the
provisions by arranging for the collective investment scheme to take on
a liability for the same purpose, ensuring that the value of the fund
declines. The amendments will frustrate such an attempt by broadening
paragraph 15 so that it refers to a liability as well as to an
investment. The rule in paragraph 15 as a whole will have effect from 6
March, when the measure was announced, but the extension brought about
by the amendments will apply from 9
March.</div>
					<a name="07051790000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it is
appropriate to do so, Mr. Gale, I want to make a further
remark about the broad scope of the schedule. The purpose of the clause
and schedule is to close down a number of marketed avoidance schemes of
a type for which disclosure is required under the avoidance disclosure
regime, and to ensure the comprehensive working of certain
anti-avoidance provisions. The total tax protection of the measures is
estimated as being in the low billions of pounds.</div>
					<a name="07051790000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule tackles avoidance
schemes mainly used by companies, which fall under 10 different
categories. It also amends the structured finance arrangement rules

rules working. There is also a relaxation of the conditions for
obtaining capital gains tax exemption on assets that are sold under

						Draft
legislation, as I have mentioned, and detailed explanatory commentary,
were published with the pre-Budget report and on 6 March. Publication
before the Budget was intended to give business an opportunity to
comment on whether the draft measures could affect legitimate business
transactions. In the event, reaction has been low key, and respondents
have not identified any instances in which the provisions might affect
legitimate transactions. I have, however, identified the need for the
Government amendments, which deal with one particular matter that arose
in consultation.</div>

							<b class="B">Mrs.
Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con): I am grateful
for your guidance, Mr. Gale. I, too, hoped to deal with the
schedule in that way.</div>
					<a name="07051790000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 5 seems to me to be a
pretty accurately targeted measure, focusing on what are, as the
Economic Secretary said, highly complex and artificial transactions
undertaken solely with tax avoidance in mind. It seems to the
Opposition entirely reasonable for HMRC to move against those schemes.
As ever, it is worth pointing out that there will be yet more
complicated legislation, but I must concede that, in that context, it
will be difficult to come up with simple legislation to deal with the
problem. My research has not managed to expose any significant
technical flaws that would concern the Committee, and like the
schedule, the amendments that the Economic Secretary has proposed seem
to be similarly targeted, so we will not oppose them.</div>
					<a name="07051790000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consequently, I have for the
Economic Secretary just a couple of questions about the schedule.
First, in the explanatory notes to paragraphs 9 and 16, HMRC does not
think that the respective schemes, which the paragraphs target, work
anyway. Essentially, the new legislation before us is only a caution. I
should be interested to find out whether that means that the Government
do not have the same certainty about the transactions targeted in the
rest of the schedule. Are they holding their hands up or are they still
challenging those transactions?</div>
					<a name="07051790000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I have a question
about paragraph 18, which is intended to extend the anti-avoidance
provisions in paragraph 26 of schedule 26 to the Finance Act 2002 in
order to cover all relevant situations in which a company fails to
exercise in full all its rights under an option, rather than just the
situation in which it abandons an option. There have been attempts to
circumvent paragraph 26 of schedule 26 to the 2002 Act, which bites on
the abandonment of an option by utilising schemes that involve partial
exercise. </div>
					<a name="07051790000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is not that
situation also covered by paragraph 23 of schedule 26 to the 2002 Act,
which denies tax relief for debits related to an &#147;unallowable
purpose&#148;? I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary could
explain whether the situation covered by the further legislation that
we are considering&#151;paragraph 18 of schedule 5 to the
Bill&#151;is actually already covered by paragraph 23 of schedule 26
to the 2002 Act. Is paragraph 18 yet more precautionary
legislation?</div>

perhaps not as well as she does. The answer to her wider question is
that the measure is not an over-reaction&#151;there is tax risk. We
have been persuaded to act by the number of avoidance schemes that have
come to our attention. In the judgment of HMRC, most schemes are
covered by paragraph 23. However, the judgment of HMRC experts is that
that measure does not cover all potential schemes or those that are
already in operation. The Bill gives us confidence that we will cover
all such schemes in the future. We are ensuring that the gaps in
paragraph 23 are well and truly closed. Most schemes hit by the
schedule are being challenged in court, but not all. Whether we
litigate will depend on legal advice. The changes will mean that any
gaps in paragraph 23 will be comprehensively

							<a name="07051790000314"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> The provisions in clause 30 and schedule 6 are
largely uncontroversial, as are a number of the matters that we will
look at this afternoon. The two exceptions to that are highlighted in
amendments Nos. 67 and 66. They would make changes to the definitions
in proposed new section 343A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act
1988, which concerns company reconstructions involving a business
leasing plant or
machinery.</div>
					<a name="07051790000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 66 relates to the definition of the concept of the
&#147;principal company&#148; contained in proposed new section
343A. The measure is designed to prevent companies from undermining the
provisions in schedule 10 to the Finance Act 2006. Hon. Members may
recall the debate on that&#151;it dealt with avoidance involving the
sale of leasing businesses. The schedule aims to counter a scheme that
sought to use the tax-neutral transfer provisions in section 343(2) of
the 1988 Act. Those provisions were intended to cover transfers within
a group and to counter the schemes that sought to use them for
transfers out of a group.</div>
					<a name="07051790000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The proposed
new section will prevent thesection 343(2) tax-neutral
transfer from applying in certain situations in which a company
reconstruction involves the leasing of plant or machinery, which is to
say the transfer of leased assets between companies. Schedule 6 will
essentially disapply the carry-over of capital allowances under 343(2)
from one company to another unless certain conditions are
met&#151;the companies are called the &#147;predecessor&#148; and
the &#147;successor&#148; respectively in the Bill. One of the
conditions is set out in proposed new section 343A(2)(a), which
provides that the principal company and the predecessor immediately
before the transfer must be the same as the principal company of the
successor immediately after the transfer.</div>
					
					<a name="07051790000244"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07051790000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not
controversial, and does not cause problems that I am aware of in which
one subsidiary transfers its leasing business to another subsidiary of
the same parent. However, the section does not seem to work effectively
where a subsidiary transfers its leasing business to its parent, as
defined in paragraphs 11 and 12 in schedule 10 to the 2006 Act. That is
because the provisions of the schedule that we are considering do not
provide for any company to be its own principal company.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>
					<a name="07051790000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The best way to look at the
issue is by an example. Adopting the terminology used in schedule 10 to
the 2006 Act, where company B is the principal of company A, because A
is B&#146;s qualifying 75 per cent. subsidiary, if A hives up its
leasing business to B, the condition contained in paragraph (a) of the
new section 343A(2) is not met, because company B has no principal
because it is itself the principal. The same problem would occur if a
parent company hived down its leasing business to its own subsidiary.
Horizontal transfers within the group are fine, and can use the
tax-neutral provision in proposed section 343A(2), but vertical ones
are not, and cannot use that tax-free transfer provision.</div>
					<a name="07051790000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to me that the
legislation goes beyond the intent of preventing the transfer of a
leasing portfolio out of the group, while still managing to use the
tax-free transfer provisions in section 343A(2). That is the mischief
that it is designed to address, but it goes beyond that. As well as
targeting transfers out of the group, it also seems to prevent upstream
or downstream transfers within a group from being tax-neutral. Thus,
under the guise of preventing avoidance, the current drafting prevents
a tax-neutral reorganisation within a group, even where there is no
change in the ultimate beneficial ownership, when no tax advantage is
being sought, and no economic profits being made.</div>
					<a name="07051790000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">There seems to be no rational
reason that I can see to disapply the carry-over contained in
proposed section 343A(2) in the vertical transfer situations, if the
Government are prepared to apply it in the horizontal transfer
situations. There may possibly have been a drafting error, which
amendment No. 66 would correct, by amending the definition of
&#147;principal company&#148; to provide that where the predecessor
or successor has no principal company at the time of the transaction,
it is deemed to be its own principal company. That minor change would
ensure that hiving up a leasing business to a parent, or down to a
subsidiary will be treated in the same way as transfers between
subsidiaries in a
group.</div>
					<a name="07051790000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						If
the Chief Secretary is not happy to accept the amendment, perhaps he
could explain why these two different types of transactions should be
treated differently. It is a particularly important issue at present,
because changes to the capital allowances regime in respect of leased
assets have removed the requirement for lessor groups to have a number
of subsidiaries with accounting periods spread throughout the year. As
a result, many leasing groups are currently in the proves of
rationalising their corporate structures to hide their leasing trades
into two or three companies, having had a significant number
before.</div>
					<a name="07051790000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of those
restructurings have already taken place, and some are under way at
present, or took place between the effective date of the legislation,
and the publication of the detailed rules. I am told that considerable
disruption could be caused by the arbitrary distinction that the
legislation seems to draw between vertical and horizontal transfers
within the group. I would be grateful if the Chief Secretary could
address that
point.</div>
					<a name="07051790000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
67 seeks to amend the definition of market value contained in
subsection (5) of proposed new section 343A. It does not quite have the
urgency 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div>and significance of the previous amendment, but it is important to give
the Committee the opportunity to test the reasons behind the choice of
definition contained in subsection (5) of the proposed new section
343A.</div>
					<a name="07051790000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The relevance
of the definition is contained insubsection (4), which
provides that, where a carry-over in section 343A(2) is disapplied, the
leasing business shall be treated as having been sold by the
predecessor company to the successor for an amount equal to its market
value on the day of the transfer. The definition of &#147;market
value&#148; that is contained in subsection (5) of proposed new
section 343A refers to paragraph 41(8) of schedule 10 to the
Finance Act 2006, which is similar but not identical to the definition
in section 70YI of the Capital Allowances Act 2001. Both are predicated
on the idea of a notional disposal of the assets in the leasing
portfolio by the absolute owner, free of any leases or encumbrances. So
the focus is on the hypothetical market value of the underlying asset.
However, realistically, that value could be difficult to
determine.</div>
					<a name="07051790000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Arguably,
when one is considering leased assets, it is artificial to focus on the
theoretical underlying value of the base assets, free of leasehold
interest. The property in question here is the leased interest, not the
absolute interest free of encumbrances. Arguably, the more appropriate
definition of &#147;market value&#148; is contained in section 577
of the 2001 Act, which focuses on the price that the book of leased
assets would fetch on the open market. Thus, amendment No. 67 would
remove the reference to section 41(8) of the 2006 Act and replace it
with a reference to section 577 of the 2001 Act, which would value the
portfolio being transferred at its actual worth, rather than at a
hypothetical base asset value. To deem assets to have different values
for tax purposes than their actual value always risks creating
anomalies and unfairness. I would be interested to hear the Chief
Secretary&#146;s rationale for choosing the definition from section
41(8) of the 2006 Act rather than the one from section 577(1) of the
2001 Act.</div>
					<a name="07051790000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I close by
emphasising that the leasing industry is a significant industry for the
UK economy, therefore it is vital that we get this issue right and, in
respect of these two amendments, if we do not, it could cause some
disruption to the restructuring that is already under
way.</div>
					
					<a name="07051790000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051790000315"></a>The
Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):
						</b> I too welcome you back to the Chair,
Mr.
Gale.</div>
					<a name="07051790000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before setting
out the background to clause 30 and schedule 6, I should like to
acknowledge the point made by the hon. Lady about the importance of the
leasing industry and the importance, therefore, of getting these
matters right. As she told the Committee, schedule 6 introduces
anti-avoidance legislation in response to disclosures that we have
received about avoidance schemes being used that are designed to get
round measures in the Finance Act 2006 to combat the loss of tax from
the sale of companies leasing out plant or machinery.</div>
					<a name="07051790000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the early years of a
profitable lease, lessor companies generated losses but in the later
years the situation reversed: the lease became profitable, but tax was
being lost because groups were selling lessor 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div>companies to loss-making groups at just the time that the leasing
transaction was about to become tax-profitable. The relevant provisions
in the 2006 Act prevent a loss of tax when a lessor company leaves a
profit-making group and becomes a member of a loss-making group by
bringing into charge an amount that prevents the loss of tax when a
lessor company is sold.</div>
					<a name="07051790000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The disclosures that we
received indicated that groups were avoiding the rules in two ways. One
type of scheme was using legislation that enables a group to transfer
leasing businesses without tax effect, rather than selling the lessor
company and the other manipulated the balance sheet value of leased
assets in a way that would reduce or eliminate the charge that
should be brought into account to prevent the loss of tax.</div>
					<a name="07051790000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 6 stops both types of
scheme. First, it makes changes to the rules allowing groups
to transfer businesses without tax effect; those rules are in section
343 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Changes to
section 343 will mean that only transfers of assets between
subsidiaries of the same parent company&#151;and certain transfers
involving consortium companies and partnerships&#151;will benefit
from tax neutrality. Where the new rules apply so that a transfer falls
outside the existing section 343 provisions, the disposal of the assets
of the business is treated as taking place at a value equal to the
value of the asset unencumbered by the lease: that is, as if the lease
did not exist. That creates a charge broadly equivalent to the effect
of schedule 10 to the Finance Act
2006.</div>
					<a name="07051790000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
schedule adds two new paragraphs to schedule 10 on the sale of lessors.
New paragraph 38A requires a company to ignore the consequences of
arrangements entered into to secure a tax advantage, and new paragraph
38B requires a company to ignore liabilities when determining the value
of its assets. Those changes will ensure that the sale of lessors
legislation works as
intended.</div>
					<a name="07051790000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady&#146;s two amendments are directed at the first of those
anti-avoidance measures introduced by the schedule on the action that
limits tax-neutral transfers. Amendment No. 66, as she explained, seeks
to preserve tax neutrality for transfers between a subsidiary and its
ultimate parent company&#151;a group&#146;s principal company. I
shall explain why I shall ask the Committee to reject it, but I assure
her that it is not because of any drafting
error.</div>
					<a name="07051790000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
suggest that the amendment is unnecessary. In the vast majority of
cases, leasing businesses are conducted via wholly-owned subsidiaries,
and I am certainly not aware of any pressing commercial reasons for
transferring a leasing business to a principal company. In contrast,
the transfer of leasing businesses to a principal company increases the
risk of tax avoidance for two reasons. First, while we are aware that
some leasing is conducted through principal companies, we know that
transfers of businesses to holding companies have featured, not
uncommonly, in tax-motivated arrangements enabling groups to utilise
tax losses more
efficiently.</div>
					<a name="07051790000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the transfer of a leasing business to a principal company could dilute
the leasing business so that the holding company would not be treated
as a lessor company. If that were to happen, the sale of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>lessors legislation would not apply and the business could be
transferred from the principal company without triggering the
anti-avoidance rules. The amendment does not provide any protection
against abuses along those
lines.</div>
					<a name="07051790000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue that
the hon. Lady has raised was raised by us with the industry. We asked
it in January to provide evidence that the restriction that is being
introduced here on transfers to and from principal companies will
hinder normal commercial transactions. No such evidence has been
provided to us.</div>
					<a name="07051790000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are real worries about tax avoidance, and I shall give an example. For
some foreign banking groups, the principal company is the main bank,
and the UK branches are, not infrequently, loss making. Some such
groups have purchased lessor companies, but rather than transferring
the business to existing leasing subsidiaries, they transfer it to the
branch so as to use its accumulated tax losses against the leasing
profits. I have not seen any evidence that those transfers are anything
other than tax motivated, and I do not think it would be right to
preserve what are, in such instances, clearly tax avoidance
opportunities. I have certainly not seen any evidence that transfers to
and from holding companies are necessary for the commercial operation
of a business, but in contrast, there is evidence that such transfers
have offered and could continue to offer potential for avoidance. On
those grounds, I hope that the Committee will reject the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07051790000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment
No. 67 would, as the hon. Lady explained, change the value at which
plant or machinery is treated as transferred for tax purposes, and the
asset would be treated as transferred at the price it would fetch on
the open market, encumbered by the lease, rather than the value of the
asset unencumbered by the lease, which is the value provided for by the
schedule as it stands. Those values are often similar, but the crucial
problem is that it is possible that the value of the asset encumbered
by a lease could be manipulated in a way that would reduce or even
eliminate the impact of the anti-avoidance measure, whereas the market
value unencumbered by the lease cannot be manipulated in that way. That
is why we wanted that to be the value to which the legislation
refers.</div>
					<a name="07051790000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
could, inadvertently, mean that the measure does not meet its aim. I
hope that, given that explanation, the hon. Lady will feel able to
withdraw it, but if not I will certainly ask the Committee to reject
it.</div>

						</b> Although there is broad consensus for schedule 6,
it seems that we now have three and a half more pages of tax
legislation prompted by the fact that some bright sparks have already
found a way around the measures that were passed in, I think, schedule
10 to the Finance Act 2006. I pay tribute to their inventiveness, and
it is part of the innovation that we salute in this country, in one
sense, although I would rather it were channelled into scientific
endeavour rather than finding tax loopholes. While the Opposition
understandably frequently raise concerns about the length of what they
now call the tax code&#151;the number of pages in Tolley&#146;s tax
guide and so on&#151;this is a classic example of how, within less
than six months of passing fairly lengthy legislation, a loophole is
found and we then have to pass another three and a half pages of

								Mr.
Timms:
						</b> The main purpose of clause 31 is to close another
tax avoidance scheme that has been disclosed to Her Majesty&#146;s
Revenue and Customs and that could be used to defeat the aim of a
targeted anti-avoidance rule introduced in the Finance Act 2006. That
rule stops tax avoidance schemes that seek to secure a tax advantage,
whereby a company is sold from one group to another primarily to
transfer the benefit of capital losses between the two groups, and so
reduce tax. We have also taken the opportunity to relax a provision of
the 2006 legislation that affects only a small number of groups of
companies that realised capital losses before the legislation came into
effect.</div>
					<a name="07051790000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now realise
that the softening of the targeted anti-avoidance rule provided by the
clause goes a little too far, and would result in the rule failing to
prevent all cases of loss buying involving those protected losses,
hence the need for the Government amendments.</div>
					<a name="07051790000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 79 and 80 make
the necessary changes to the text of the clause. They remove
the protection that the losses enjoy from the effects of the loss
buying targeted anti-avoidance rule where the parent company in the
group is taken over as part of a loss-buying scheme. The clause still
allows relief for the losses within the original group of companies if
the takeover is for commercial purposes. It prevents relief 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div>only where one of the main purposes of the takeover is to secure a tax
advantage from the losses for the new
group.</div>
					<a name="07051790000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
81 provides that the changes apply only to assets disposed of on or
after 9 May this year, the date when the amendments were laid. The
amendments have also been published on the Treasury website.</div>
					<a name="07051790000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are three reasons why I
will urge my hon. Friends to resist what is proposed in
amendment No. 83, but I look forward to hearing the case that
the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet makes for
it.</div>
					
					<a name="07051790000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051790000322"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> The Opposition broadly welcome clause 31 and its
underlying intention. The additional anti-avoidance provisions in
subsections (1) to (3) do not appear to cause any obvious problems and
none have been brought to my attention. The further tweaks to the
anti-avoidance regime provided in Government amendments Nos. 79 to 81
broadly appear to hit an appropriate target, so we will not be opposing
those.</div>
					<a name="07051790000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The relief
granted by subsections (5) and (6) is welcome as far as it goes. I
tabled amendment No. 83 to highlight a concern relating to the extent
of the relief that those subsections provide.</div>
					<a name="07051790000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsections (5) and (6) are
aimed at correcting a problem with the anti-avoidance rules introduced
by section 70 of the Finance Act 2006, which inserted sections 184A to
184F of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. An incidental effect
of those rules was that they caught groups that had crystallised losses
via de-grouping transactions taking place prior to the announcement of
the 2006 Act measures in December 2005. Such de-grouping transactions
are undoubtedly controversial, but they were considered acceptable at
that time. The legislation could thus have operated retroactively to
apply to transactions already undertaken prior to the announcement of
the new measures.</div>
					<a name="07051790000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Transitional measures were
therefore included in the 2006 Act to prevent the rules from operating
in that way and having that retroactive effect. In particular, the
transitional arrangements were intended to cover the technique in use
before December 2005 that allowed a group to crystallise loss on an
asset that had fallen in value without actually selling the
asset.</div>
					<a name="07051790000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, those
transitional rules have since proved to be unduly restrictive. They
included the condition that company B, which left the group as part of
the relevant crystallising transaction, had to continue to be
controlled by the principal company of the group that it had left. That
denied relief under the transitional provisions in a number of cases,
including when the company leaving the group had been sold to another
group in an ordinary commercial transaction. It also denied relief
where the company in question had been
liquidated.</div>
					<a name="07051790000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Another
situation that was excluded from transitional relief was where the
principal company of the original group was taken over or involved in a
merger. Clause 31 amends the transitional arrangements in the 2006 Act
so that they provide relief in a wider range of circumstances. They
appear to be effective in extending the transitional 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div>provisions in the 2006 Act to capital losses crystallised prior to
December 2005, and the Opposition broadly welcome that move.</div>
					<a name="07051790000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it had been expected
that the extension of the transitional arrangements and the relief that
they provide would allow relief in all affected cases since December
2005. Instead, clause 31(9) provides that the relaxation of the rules
takes place with effect only from 21 March 2007. Therefore, any gains
realised between 5 December 2005 and 20 March 2007 will not
receive relief under clause
31.</div>
					<a name="07051790000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 83
would remedy that problem by providing that the changes made in
subsections (5) and (6) of clause 31 applied in relation to disposals
made on or after 5 December 2005, rather than just to those made on or
after 21 March 2007.</div>
					<a name="07051790000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall refer to an example that would be an issue in these
circumstances. A group entered into a crystallising transaction prior
to 5 December 2005, with the result that company B within the group
carried a loss. The group then made a capital gain between 5 December
2005 and 20 March 2007. Clause 31 would not allow the group to
use the losses crystallised in company B to offset that gain, because
it occurred prior to the implementation of the relaxation of the
transitional arrangements. Amendment No. 83 would permit the
crystallised losses to be used in relation to gains after 5 December
2005, rather than only those made after 20 March
2007.</div>
					<a name="07051790000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge
that that is not a wide-ranging point&#151;only a few companies would
be affected&#151;but it would be useful if the Minister considered
whether the relief granted by the clause should be extended in the very
limited way proposed by amendment No.
83.</div>
					<a name="07051790000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to
make a further point on the clause and add a few final words on the
amendment of section 184B of the Finance Act 2006. The Opposition
believe that it would have been useful to have further clarification in
statute of the test set out in subsection (1)(c) of section 184B
regarding the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the
relevant arrangement. We had an extensive debate on the main purpose
test this morning, and I highlight the matter only to indicate yet
another context where the test is used and questions must be
answered.</div>
					<a name="07051790000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recall, in
particular, that the Economic Secretary indicated that the Opposition
had never previously raised concerns about the main purpose test, but I
recall my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe having raised similar
concerns on the main purpose test last year, and I believe that it may
have been considered on other occasions. The test is of concern to the
Opposition. We see that in this context, just as we saw it in the
context of this morning&#146;s
discussion.</div>
					
					<a name="07051790000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051790000323"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for welcoming the
Government amendments, but, as I indicated, I have a number of
difficulties with the amendment that she
proposes.</div>
					<a name="07051790000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the
amendment is technically defective as it would insert a repetition of
the phrase</div>
					<a name="07051790000240"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unless the
gains accrue to the company on a disposal of a pre-change
asset&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051790000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">in section 184A(2)
of the 1992 Act. Secondly, and perhaps more substantially, it would
remove a relief 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div>that is of value for some companies. A change made by subsection (5)
removes references to section 184B of the 1992 Act from section 70 of
the Finance Act 2006. Section 184B is about gain buying and the
references in section 70 provide relief to some companies that allows
them to use capital losses against certain
gains.</div>
					<a name="07051790000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The references
are being removed because they are needed only on a transitional basis,
unlike the equivalent rule for losses&#151;unused losses can be
carried forward to later years, but gains are taxed in the year that
they arrive. An undesirable effect of the amendment would be to remove
the ability to set off losses against gains for a few affected
companies and to remove that relief
retrospectively.</div>
					<a name="07051790000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
and perhaps most significantly, the amendment could create an
opportunity for tax avoidance of the type that the Government
amendments are aimed at preventing. The Government amendments apply
from 9 May this year. If the Opposition amendment was not technically
defective, it would mean that the tax treatment of transactions in the
18 months from December 2005 onwards could be revisited. That would
give a small number of companies an opportunity to try to obtain relief
where they had bought losses from other groups. Given those three
difficulties, I hope that I have persuaded the hon. Lady not to press
the amendment to a
vote.</div>
					<a name="07051790000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to
comment on the point about the main purpose test, which the hon. Lady
raised at the end of her remarks. Revenue and Customs has published
extensive guidance that incorporates examples of arrangements that are
likely to be caught by the legislation. In addition, the guidance,
which was well received, has been extended and clarified as a result of
discussion with business and professional advisers. Therefore, I hope
that it is not going to cause
difficulty.</div>
					<a name="07051790000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments extend protection to encompass a small number of
groups holding capital losses that the targeted anti-avoidance rule
might not otherwise affect, and ensure that we retain a high level of
protection against some rather aggressive tax avoidance, whereby one
group of companies seeks to reduce its tax liability by buying the
capital losses of another. I commend those amendments to the
Committee.</div>

						The
clause adds a new section to the special tax rules dealing with
corporate members of the Lloyd&#146;s insurance market. It aims to
counter a loss-buying scheme reported to Revenue and Customs under the
avoidance scheme disclosure rules. The scheme involves companies buying
tax losses from loss-making corporate members of the Lloyd&#146;s
insurance market, thus ceasing their underwriting activities. The
clause will close that window by requiring that the group relationship
between a corporate member and company that claims group relief to
exist from the last day of the year in which the insurance business was
written to the first day of the year in which the claim to group relief
is made. The rule is narrowly targeted and will apply only to losses of
a corporate member&#146;s final year of writing insurance business.
The rule will restore the usual group relief principle that relief for
losses incurred in a year will be available only to companies related
to the corporate member in that same year, but it will not affect
ordinary commercial acquisitions in reorganisations when the newly
created group relationship is part of ongoing economic
activity.</div>

					<a name="07051790000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
arose from discussions with Lloyd&#146;s. It will refine the
definition of &#147;reinsurance to close premium&#148; so that it
includes &#147;other consideration&#148;. &#147;Reinsurance to
close&#148; is the mechanism by which a Lloyd&#146;s syndicate
closes its account. The commercial definition of &#147;reinsurance to

Mr. Gale, that you do not mind that I have put the amendment

consultative exercise on tax matters that we have had with
Lloyd&#146;s and with representatives of the wholesale insurance
market over the past six months. Representatives of the Lloyd&#146;s
market will not be surprised that we have proposed bringing
Lloyd&#146;s syndicates into line with other companies. Industry
commentators agree that the provision is narrowly targeted and not
unreasonable. It was discussed with Lloyd&#146;s experts in advance
of the publication of the detailed clauses.</div>
					<a name="07051790000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As I have
said, the provision is part of a wider context under the auspices of
the high-level group on City competitiveness, which has discussed a
number of tax measures and wider market reforms aimed at enhancing the
competitiveness of the Lloyd&#146;s market&#151;an important part
of the City of London. I am therefore grateful for the work of the
Lloyd&#146;s market and particularly to Lord Levene for his
leadership on that issue and for wider co-operation over the past eight
months or so. Within the context of that productive work to enhance
competitiveness, the change is necessary to bring the Lloyd&#146;s
market into line with our wider approach to taxation in that area and
the amendment will close a loophole to ensure that the legislation is
properly effective. On that basis, I commend the amendment and the
clause to the Committee.</div>

slightly more technical way of saying it, but they are probably the
same. I apologise for slipping away from the complexity of tax jargon

					<a name="07051790000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051790000331"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> The Opposition support the principles underlying
the clause. In the circumstances, and given the wording of existing
legislation, it seems to be a reasonable and proportionate measure. I
will therefore mention only a few queries and background points so that
the Committee has the opportunity to debate the policy objective behind
the clause and how best to bring that
about.</div>
					<a name="07051790000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
will raise two points. The legislation at issue is schedule 24 to the
Finance Act 2003 and sections 38 to 44 of the Income Tax
(Trading and Other Income) Act 2005. Although introduced by the current
Government, those Acts built on an approach first established by Nigel
Lawson when introducing provisions to crack down on &#147;potential
emoluments&#148;&#151;deferred bonuses and benefits&#151;in the
Finance Act
1989.</div>
					<a name="07051790000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is,
therefore, some common ground between our parties on the principles at
stake. Like the 2003 Act that succeeded it and will be amended today,
the 1989 Act sought to ensure that an employer gets a tax
deduction on a payment or benefit provided to an employee only when
they receive it in a form that constitutes employment income. In other
words, the employer gets the deduction only when the employee has got
the benefit. In effect, the point of the 1989 Act was to prevent
employers from obtaining the corporation tax benefit of paying out a
large bonus before the employee had paid the tax on it. I
understand that the Government introduced schedule 24 to the
2003 Act out of concern that certain planning schemes involving
employee trusts were being marketed as a means of circumventing the
1989 Act and accelerating the corporation tax deduction in the
unacceptable way that I have outlined.</div>
					<a name="07051790000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 33 tackles some of the
more recent schemes that have emerged since the 2003 Act. The clause
appears to be appropriately targeted at those schemes, which would be
fairly described as aggressive tax planning. I have received no
representations that would indicate that any collateral damage would be
caused to transactions that are not motivated exclusively by tax
considerations.</div>
					<a name="07051790000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that some schemes have been developed to exploit the fact
that the 2003 Act only catches situations where the employer transfers
assets or makes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>payment to a third party. Attempts have been made to circumvent the
anti-avoidance provisions by having the employer who wishes to make the
deferred payment declare themselves a trustee over certain assets or
money. In this case, there is no transfer of legal ownership to a third
party. Alternative arrangements sought to get around the rules by
increasing the value of existing trust assets and arguing that no
payment or benefit had been transferred into the trust. Consequently,
it was at least arguable that the 2003 Act did not bite in such
cases.</div>
					<a name="07051790000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Clause
33 would make it plain that such situations would be caught, and that
is one of the reasons why we welcome it, although I want the Chief
Secretary to consider two points. First, why have we ended up in this
situation? Why has it proved necessary to have yet more
legislation&#151;and clause 33? If the Chancellor had not decided to
meddle with the law in 2003, the Government might well have been
successful in arguing in court that the original 1989 Act covered these
latest avoidance schemes anyway.</div>
					<a name="07051790000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I have in
mind the very robust approach taken by the House of Lords in the Dextra
case, which was decided under the 1989 Act. In it, their lordships
seemed to signal clearly that they would have limited patience with
those who put forward hair-splitting interpretations of the statute to
seek to get round the clear objective of the law: not to allow the
employer to accelerate the deduction before the employee has received
the payment. Assuming a consistent approach from the courts, the
Revenue might well have been able to challenge these new schemes in
court as contrary to the intention that Parliament made plain in
introducing the 1989 Act.</div>
					<a name="07051790000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should put it on the record
that the Dextra judgment seems to make it clear that the 1989 Act was
an effective statute that achieved the policy goal of catching deferred
payments through employee trusts. It probably would have caught the
schemes that clause 33 seeks to close down, so the scope for these new
avoidance schemes was only created because the Government decided to
junk perfectly good legislation introduced by Nigel Lawson. The revised
form of wording that they chose in the 2003 Act was narrower than the
wording in the 1989 Act, and room was thus created for the aggressive
tax advisers to move in.</div>

							<a name="07051790000332"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> I sat on the 2003 Finance Bill Committee, and,
although this may be due to my memory, I do not recall the hon.
Lady&#146;s party raising the issue of the schedule being a narrowing
of the 1989 legislation. Did her party raise it
then?</div>

							<a name="07051790000333"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> I cannot answer that because I was not in the
House then, so I did not take part in that Committee. That issue is a
concern, and I can certainly check <i class="I">Hansard</i> to see whether or not
we raised it. If we did not do so, we should have done.</div>
					<a name="07051790000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have frequently made the
point that the Government&#146;s anti-avoidance legislation has often
been used as a sledgehammer to crack a nut&#151;in some cases, the
Chancellor takes a sledgehammer to miss a nut. We support their efforts
to shut down these schemes, but feel that the clause would not have
been necessary were it not for the changes to the legislation made in
2003.</div>
				
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div>
					<a name="07051790000247"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07051790000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
briefly want to ask about the interaction between schedules 23 and 24
to the 2003 Act, which are crucial in how the anti-avoidance schemes
work. Although, as I have said, I very much support the intention
behind the 2003 Act, it is not a problem-free piece of legislation. My
question is about the distinct difference between the two
schedules&#146; treatment of share-based and cash-based
remuneration.</div>
					<a name="07051790000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tax
deductions under schedule 23, which covers share-based remuneration,
are determined by the value at receipt at the hands of the employee. If
an employer funds a trust to acquire shares to be awarded to employees
at a later date and the shares have gone up in value by the time the
deduction takes place, the deduction for the employer becomes larger,
so the value during the deferment is given to the employer. If, on the
other hand, the shares have gone down in value, the employer has made a
bad bet and only a reduced deduction can be claimed when it is
eventually due, when the employee receives the benefit.</div>
					<a name="07051790000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Deductions under schedule 24,
however, which broadly covers anything that is not share based or to do
with pensions, are based on the value on contribution by the employer,
so that when the employer finally gets the deduction at the appropriate
time, when the benefit gets into the employee&#146;s hands, they are
denied any growth in value during the deferral period, even if the
employee is taxed on the higher amount. Does the Chief Secretary agree
that different approaches are being taken? If so, why does the law
treat those different types of benefit differently? The lack of
neutrality between those approaches disadvantages employers such as
mutual societies that cannot forward shares to their employees. It
would be useful to hear him explain why the deferred benefit is treated
differently in those
cases.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051790000334"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> I think that I understand the first limb of the
hon. Lady&#146;s argument&#151;that the 1989 legislation covers the
mischief that developed after 2003 and that is addressed in clause 33.
However, I am at a loss to understand why she has not tabled an
amendment to go back to the status quo ante the 1989 position if she
thinks that that would cover the mischief. That would, presumably,
produce the simplification and shortening of tax legislation that she
and her party want.</div>
					
					<a name="07051790000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051790000335"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> That is certainly an interesting idea, which I
shall consider for next year. As I have said, clause 33 deals with the
problem, but we have had to go around the houses with yet more
tax legislation to do so.</div>
					
					<a name="07051790000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051790000336"></a>Mr.
Timms:
						</b> The hon. Lady has correctly set out the aim of the
clause, and I am grateful to her for supporting what we seek to do.
There have been a number of attempts to use employee benefit trusts as
a means of avoiding tax&#151;another example, sadly, of very bright
people misapplying their talents&#151;and legislation was, as she
said, introduced in 2003 to deal with the abuse.</div>
					<a name="07051790000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady has a point when
she says that there is a sound case for arguing that what was being
done was illegal anyway, but the Dextra case that she mentioned 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>was won in 2004, after the change in the legislation. It was thought to
be appropriate to put the matter beyond doubt, and those moves were
successful in stopping much of the avoidance that was going on and
being attempted. However, there is evidence of a recent increase in the
marketing and take-up of schemes to get around the legislation, which
is why we need to take action again to stop the abuse.</div>
					<a name="07051790000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Employee benefit trusts are
used quite properly by employers to provide remuneration and other
benefits to employees through, for example, share-ownership trusts,
which the Government have encouraged to good effect. From the
mid-1990s, however, the trusts have been used as a mechanism for
obtaining deductions from taxable profits that would not otherwise be
due. Such usage has often been coupled with other kinds of
avoidance.</div>
					<a name="07051790000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Finance
Act 2003 restricted the deduction available to employers. As a result
of those changes, an employer can only deduct the amount that is paid
out of the trust to employees in a form on which income tax and
national insurance are due within nine months of the end of the
accounting period. There is no impact on genuine users of employee
benefit trusts.</div>
					<a name="07051790000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new avoidance schemes, known as &#147;employer self trust
schemes&#148;, attempt to avoid the restrictions introduced in 2003.
The employer declares a trust over assets that he already holds. It is
claimed that the action does not amount to making a payment or
transferring an asset into a trust and therefore the existing
anti-avoidance legislation does not apply. They seek to allow employers
to manufacture deductions artificially without the need to provide real
benefits to
employees.</div>
					<a name="07051790000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government do not accept that employer self trust schemes bypass the
existing anti-avoidance legislation that was put in place in 2003.
However, given the scale of activity in that area, we have decided to
clarify the position and put it beyond doubt that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>employers are not entitled to a deduction under such schemes. I think
that the hon. Lady will accept that, if we can do that in a reasonably
straightforward way and avoid several cases of litigation, it will
probably be in everyone&#146;s
interests.</div>
					<a name="07051790000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
extends the existing legislation to include any act or omission that
results in money or assets being held for the benefit of employees or
in an increase in the value of those assets. It makes sure that the
same restrictions apply to all trusts that are used as vehicles for
employee remuneration, regardless of whether the trust is administered
by a third party or by the employer. An employer will be able to make a
deduction for the contribution to that trust only to the extent that it
is actually paid to employees in a taxable form within nine months of
the end of the relevant accounting period. The clause will apply to any
act or omission, including a declaration of trust, made on or after 21
March. That will prevent not only those schemes we are aware of, but
further attempts to use a similar method to sidestep the
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07051790000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady asked about the interaction of schedules 23 and 24 in the Finance
Act 2003. Schedule 23 seeks to promote share ownership;
schedule 24 is anti-avoidance legislation. I hope that I have outlined
the difference that she wanted clarified.</div>
					<a name="07051790000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause strengthens existing
legislation to counter a further abusive avoidance scheme that uses
employee benefit trusts to obtain a tax deduction not otherwise due.
The Government will continue to tackle avoidance of that sort to make
sure that all employers pay their fair share of tax. I commend the
clause to the
Committee.</div>
