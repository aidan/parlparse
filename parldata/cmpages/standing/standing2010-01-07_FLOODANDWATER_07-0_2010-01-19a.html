<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000383"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Huw Irranca-Davies):</b> Mr. Chope, it is
very good to be back under your chairmanship here in the second week of
the Committee&#146;s deliberations. Welcome back, as well, to the
hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire. It is good to see him back,
although his colleague did well in his
stead.</div><a name="10011984000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I respond to the comments made during the clause 17 stand part debate?
Before we adjourned, the hon. Members for Cheltenham and for Vale of
York asked questions about the scope of local levies and who will pay
for them. Particular concern was expressed about their being used in
place of funding from central Government. I will answer those questions
in full, but let me first clarify the funding levels for flood and
coastal erosion risk management, as hon. Members appear to be under the
impression that funding has decreased.</div>
<a name="10011984000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government now expect to spend more than &#163;2.15 billion on flood
and coastal erosion risk management over the current three-year period.
In 2007-08 total expenditure by central and local government was
&#163;580 million; in 2008-09 it was &#163;660 million;
this year spending will be &#163;715 million. Next year, spending by
central and local government is expected to be &#163;780 million. As
part of the fiscal stimulus package, &#163;20 million was brought
forward from 2010-11 budgets to 2009-10. The hon. Member for Cheltenham
referred to the &#163;660 million fund next year; that figure relates
only to spending by the Environment Agency, not to the combined
spending by central and local
government.</div><a name="10011984000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to clause 17 and the matter of the local levy. The clause
provides a route for local authorities to invest in risk management
schemes that would otherwise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div>not be taken forward. The hon. Member for Vale of York is right that the
funding system changed in 2004, with most funding since then directed
through a central grant to the Environment Agency. However, the local
levy has continued since then and, for example, has raised &#163;27
million for locally important projects in 2007-08. The clause extends
the scope of the levy to include coastal erosion risk management
projects, to provide greater flexibility to authorities, and to bring
the levying arrangements into line with the scope of the new
committees. To be absolutely clear, the local levy is not an
alternative or a substitute for flood defence grant in aid, but an
optional additional investment, voted for by local authorities to fund
locally important works. We will provide funds to reform the grant to
allow the levy to be increased by 10 per cent. The levy is tied to the
Environment Agency&#146;s functions, which do not extend to surface
water management as that will be the responsibility of the
authorities.</div>
<a name="10011984000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
is also right that the same people always seem to fund flood defence
work in this country. However, she is mistaken in her assertion that
landowners and local authorities are shouldering the costs. Landowners
do not pay the RFDC levy; they pay drainage rates totalling about
&#163;15 million per year to internal drainage boards. In return,
they directly benefit from the water level management services that
internal drainage boards provide. About &#163;3 million is paid by
farmers to the Environment Agency, which, again, pays for additional
maintenance work that benefits their land. Local authorities pay the
RFDC levy as well as a special levy to internal drainage boards. To
clarify, the special levy is separate from the RFDC local levy and is
not affected by the Bill. Both those levies are compensated by formula
grant from central Government, so, in the main, neither the local
authority nor the council tax payer ultimately funds that important
work.</div>
<a name="10011984000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Along with
the block grant in aid paid to the Environment Agency, taxpayers across
the country are funding almost all activity by the operating
authorities, even though five out of six properties are not at risk of
being flooded. If anything, there is a case for greater cost sharing
with those that benefit from flood risk management activity, especially
as overall investment needs to
rise.</div><a name="10011984000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also useful to set the RFDC levy in the context of the overall
funding picture for local authorities. The need for local authorities
to spend more&#151;perhaps as much as 20 per cent. more&#151;on
flood and coastal erosion risk management was foreseen at the last
spending review in 2007. That led to more funding being provided within
formula grant, including to pay for levies to internal drainage boards
and RFDCs as well as to fund local authorities&#146; own work in
maintaining coastal defences and managing local flood risk. Under
current assumptions, and taken together with the funding we are
providing for the Bill, overall local authority spending on flood and
coastal erosion risk management would have to increase from &#163;90
million to more than &#163;160 million a year in the early years
after commencement, before it is clear that such involvement is more
than anticipated and provided
for.</div><a name="10011984000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000386"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Good morning, Mr. Chope. May I
welcome you back to the Chair? I would like to have a short debate on
clause 18 stand part, so I will speak only to the amendment and new
clause, which are not insignificant. The Committee will be aware that
one of the key recommendations of the Pitt review was that maintenance
should be not just done but seen to be done. I had one point of
difference with the Pitt conclusions overall in relation to many of the
flood visits that I made&#151;those of 2000, 2005, 2007 especially,
and last year&#146;s floods in Cumbria. Although it is difficult to
prove, anecdotally we were told that there is not now the level of
maintenance that has been undertaken in the past. The amendment and new
clause would rectify that.</div>
<a name="10011984000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that the agency places annually on its website a
maintenance programme. Obviously, that is a bit of a moveable feast,
but if we are to address the issue and public concerns, the main thrust
of the Bill should be to ensure that there is less opportunity to flood
main watercourses in future. The Minister referred to the role of IDBs
and how they are funded substantially by local farmers and landowners,
many of whom hold positions of responsibility on them. We are told that
it is very much the case that IDBs undertake a significant programme of
maintenance that is public and there for all to see&#151;as a
vice-president of the<b class="B"> </b>Association of Drainage Authorities, I
take that on good account. From the levies that they raise, they also
make substantial funds available annually to the Environment Agency for
the specific purpose of carrying out maintenance.</div>
<a name="10011984000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
incontrovertible that the Government have increased capital spending on
floods, although the insurance industry and flood victims would argue
that the annual capital programme is simply not enough and does not go
far enough. As a result of skilful parliamentary questioning, however,
the Government have admitted that the maintenance programme has slipped
in comparison with the capital programme. We want to rectify that. We
want to hold the agency to account; it is a body that we hold in high
regard and we believe that the amendment would help them and their
reputation enormously. It will put to rest a fear, which has been
expressed to us, so we are very much aware of it, that maintenance is
not being undertaken at certain times of the year because of
biodiversity, birds nesting and so on. That is also the case with the
internal drainage board, but one can work around that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div><a name="10011984000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
17 would insist that, instead of having an annual rolling programme,
the agency publish on a quarterly basis its programme of regular
maintenance work carried out on main watercourses. Obviously, since
2004-05 the number of enmained watercourses has increased. Another
purpose of amendment 17 is to ascertain whether the agency&#146;s
maintenance programme is less vigorous than it was previously, and
whether main watercourses are being dredged and maintained. I have seen
physical evidence of that. For instance, self-planted willow trees that
had not been removed contributed very much to the floods of 2007 in
particular, and to other floods. If the main watercourses are not being
dredged and maintained, water will back up into the minor watercourses,
which are the responsibility of the internal drainage boards. That is
what is making them so angry. They have a full programme, to which they
adhere. Their work is being undermined by a lack of maintenance and
dredging on the scale that we would like. If we are to implement Pitt,
he was clear that maintenance should be not just done but seen to be
done. New clause 10 is a helpful technical amendment to a different
part of the Bill.</div>
<a name="10011984000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, our
fervent wish is that the Minister will look favourably on the amendment
and new clause and make them part of the Bill. I hope that he will
address the issues that I have raised: not least, that the maintenance
programme is not as vigorous as it was prior to 1997. As a Back
Bencher, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition made
political history by securing, for the first time, an Adjournment
debate on that issue. He called for a better balance between spending
on big capital projects in urban areas and spending on maintenance,
from which rural areas benefit more. The issue touches the heart of all
local communities, which are central to the internal drainage board.
Given the Government&#146;s catchment management systems and some
other programmes, flooding of farmland will increase as existing rural
flood defences on minor watercourses are allowed to fail, because the
Government will argue that there is no money to maintain them. The
amendment and new clause address serious issues, and I hope that the
Minister will be minded to adopt them.</div>
<a name="10011984000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011984000387"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Laurence Robertson</b> (Tewkesbury) (Con): Briefly, I want to
support the amendment and new clause. Although a number of Opposition
Members have welcomed the Bill, we have said frequently that it needs
strengthening if it is to have the desired effect and impact, which the
amendment and new clause attempt to provide. My hon. Friend would
probably also want to tie them in with new clause 11&#151;on which I
hope to catch your eye, Mr. Chope&#151;which relates to
schedule 3, on smaller watercourses, private drains and
sewers.</div><a name="10011984000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last
night, I had a meeting with Lord Smith, the chairman of the Environment
Agency. We discussed this very issue, among others. Prior to the new
regime at the Environment Agency, it was universally the view that
dredging of rivers was not necessarily beneficial. The new chairman
said that that was not necessarily his view; each river had to be
assessed differently, and although it might not be beneficial on some
rivers, it might be on others. Will the Minister let the Committee know
what his approach and attitude would be towards the maintenance and
dredging of main watercourses? Each and every main watercourse needs
assessing properly.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div><a name="10011984000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I hope to address new clause 11 later this morning, let me say that
repairs and trying to catch up when a flood has happened are essential,
but are not the best method of flood prevention. It is too late then.
Maintenance, which so often gets neglected, is important. As with
servicing one&#146;s car, it is easy to put it off for several
months; nobody notices until things start to go wrong. In requiring
reports to be given on maintenance, my hon. Friend&#146;s proposals
would prevent such delay. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000388"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am pleased to respond to the debate on
amendment and new clause, which would require the Environment Agency to
undertake an annual programme of maintenance work on major
watercourses, with quarterly reports to the Houses of Parliament. With
regard to devolved matters, the implication is that reports would also
need to go to the National Assembly for
Wales.</div><a name="10011984000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Vale of York asked whether the Government concede that
the maintenance programme has slipped&#151;I assume that she refers
to parliamentary questions. Although the maintenance programme has not
slipped, what has changed is that there is a focus on risk management,
and more assets are in target condition now than in 2007. The risk
management approach reflected throughout the Bill and in our general
approach is pivotal. Things have not slipped&#151;they are more
targeted.</div>
<a name="10011984000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are committed to the risk-based approach to maintenance and
that has been endorsed by the Pitt review in recommendation
25:</div><a name="10011984000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Environment Agency should maintain its existing risk-based approach to
levels of maintenance and this should be supported by published
schedules of works for each local authority
area.&#148;</div><a name="10011984000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
therefore agree with hon. Members that, in terms of both public
confidence and accountability, it is crucial for the Environment Agency
to be transparent and open in its planning of maintenance, and to
consult on its plans with people who have an interest in how and how
often it is done. The Environment Agency recognises that, and as a
result is already going further than Sir Michael recommended. The
Environment Agency consults with landowners and local groups on its
main river maintenance programme each year. The regional flood defence
committee approves the programme of works, which are now published on
the regional pages of the Environment Agency&#146;s
website.</div>
<a name="10011984000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
EA&#146;s progress on the maintenance programme is reported to
regional flood defence committees. Such meetings are held quarterly and
open to the public, and the minutes from each are available from each
regional committee services team, details of which are on its website.
That transparency allows anyone, including Parliament, to take an
interest in maintenance schedules if there are concerns or a desire to
do so. Information on any coast protection work undertaken by the EA
will in future be made similarly available from the new regional flood
and coastal
committees.</div><a name="10011984000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
should be noted that the Environment Agency has a publication
scheme in line with section 19 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000,
and much of the information that it holds is already published as a
matter of routine. Where information is not published, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>it may be available from the EA and other risk
management authorities under existing freedom of information and
environmental information legislation.</div>
<a name="10011984000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill also
provides improved tools for local authority scrutiny of flood and
coastal erosion risk management activities. Those include the duty for
all risk management authorities to co-operate, the power to request
information, which we have dealt with, and the provision in
schedule 2 for risk management authorities to comply with
requests made by overview and scrutiny committees and to have regard to
their reports and recommendations. That is consistent with the relevant
recommendations in the Pitt review. It is right that authorities are
held to account by local, democratic
bodies.</div><a name="10011984000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
additional legislation on the matter is not necessary. To require the
EA to maintain all major watercourses to a common or minimum standard
would run counter to the risk-based approach and could divert resources
from locations where they are most needed. As maintenance schedules do
not change frequently, a requirement to publish quarterly, particularly
to both Houses of Parliament, appears burdensome and unlikely to result
in any improvement to the maintenance of major
watercourses.</div><a name="10011984000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the past, navigation authorities dredged some rivers to allow free
passage for boats. That is still carried out on some critical occasions
on navigable rivers, but the practice has ceased where navigation has
declined. However, that type of dredging work was not carried out for
flood management purposes. The EA&#146;s risk management approach
would take that into account where dredging needed to occur.</div>
<a name="10011984000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
I have covered all aspects, so on that basis and with the reassurances
on publication and accountability &#151;I think that we are aiming at

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000405"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I have just a few comments to make. There has
been some concern about the reporting process under subsection
(1):</div><a name="10011984000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Environment Agency must report to the Minister about flood and coastal
erosion risk management.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div><a name="10011984000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Local Government Information Unit believes that the lead local flood
authorities will not be reporting floods, and I wonder whether there is
an argument that they should be required to report as well. They will
have responsibility to investigate and determine the risk management
assessment and delivery of flood and coastal erosion risk management.
In the event that an authority fails to exercise its
function&#151;that is, whether it is in accordance with national and
local strategies&#151;the Minister can direct that function to
another authority, and yet recover the costs from the original
authority. Obviously, that is a cause of some concern to local
authorities. Has the Minister considered that possible scenario and
what the outcome would be?</div>
<a name="10011984000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The lead
local flood authorities must also establish and maintain a register of
structures and features that are likely to affect flood risk in an
area, including their ownership and state of repair. I will have more
to say about that when we discuss clause 30, under the definition of
features in that regard. The Environment Agency must ensure that key
third-party assets are registered and protected. Those are structures
or features in private hands that provide an important public flood
risk management function.</div>
<a name="10011984000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Association of British Insurers welcomes the clear areas of
accountability defined by the Bill. However, it believes that there
needs to be further clarity around how various authorities will
operate, and how transparent their performance in their areas of
responsibility will be. It wishes to see a clear process, open to
public scrutiny, that will involve monitoring and transparent reporting
of how the Environment Agency, national Government, local authorities
and other responsible bodies perform in their areas of
accountability.</div><a name="10011984000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill sets out in clause 18 how the Environment Agency will report to
the Minister and, under clause 19, the local authorities have a duty to
investigate and report on risk management, and to enable the Minister
to direct, as under clause 30. However, the Bill seems to omit a very
serious matter, in that it does not place an explicit duty on the
Environment Agency to report publicly on its performance or monitor and
publicly report on local authorities&#146; performance in reducing
flood risk. Is that a deliberate omission on the part of the Minister?
Will the Minister see fit to return to this at a later stage? Once
again, transparency is key to the involvement of the Environment
Agency.</div>
<a name="10011984000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
water companies have expressed their concern at the Environment
Agency&#146;s overall role. If the Environment Agency reports as set
out under clause 18, will that be debateable either by the relevant
Select Committee or on the Floor of the
House?</div><a name="10011984000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
insurance industry goes further and asks whether the Minister would
consider asking the Environment Agency that, not less than every three
years, it reviews its overall performance and its relationships with
local authorities. I await the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="10011984000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000406"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> As Members understand, this clause
requires the Environment Agency to report to the Secretary of State in
England and to Welsh Ministers in Wales about flood and coastal erosion
risk management. That report has to include information about the
application of national flood and coastal erosion risk management
strategies under clauses 7 and 8. In order to provide these reports,
the Environment Agency will have to monitor the application of the
strategies, as required by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>clauses 7 and 8, for England and Wales respectively. It is likely to
need to request information from risk management authorities as well as
collecting it
directly.</div><a name="10011984000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall now respond to the questions asked by the hon. Member for Vale of
York. It is worth clarifying that, in terms of lead local flood
authorities gathering information, it is intended that existing
reporting arrangements be relied upon wherever
practicable&#151;examples include the current local government
performance framework of national indicators, floods directive products
and reports prepared for and by local authority scrutiny committees and
the Audit Commission. Additional information and clarity would be
sought on a case-by-case basis, relying on clauses 13 and
14&#151;duties to co-operate and powers to request
information.</div><a name="10011984000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
respect of water companies, let me clarify that as well: water
companies undertake an annual reporting cycle, the June returns, and
the Environment Agency will be able to draw on those, for example, to
seek to ensure a streamlined and joined-up approach to reporting
progress of flood risk management.</div>
<a name="10011984000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall now
discuss how the Environment Agency would pull together reviews of other
operating authorities and other stakeholders to make sure that we have
a balanced view. The Environment Agency has drawn on a variety of
sources, as I have indicated, from the range of bodies involved to
produce the report for Ministers. Those information sources, which also
include Audit Commission reports, will already have undergone a
consultation
process.</div><a name="10011984000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
respect of the duties that the hon. Lady mentioned on the EA to report
to a local authority, that is already covered by the EA&#146;s
performance monitoring, which is published on the website. Local
authorities are also addressed through the national performance
framework indicator NI 189 on
flooding.</div><a name="10011984000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that the Select Committee on Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs can consider those reports under clause 18. It is also
important that ministerial direction is given on the issue of whether
lead local authorities are required to report. That information may be
included in the EA report and the information may also be considered by
the local scrutiny committee, as described within schedule 2. With this
report we intend to monitor progress in the management of all sources
of flood risk and coastal erosion. It is also expected to be used to
inform policy development and to review priorities to make sure that
effective and efficient flood and coastal erosion risk management is
being delivered across England and Wales. I hope that the Committee are
satisfied with these
comments..</div><a name="10011984000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000409"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> It is a pleasure to be serving under your
chairmanship again this morning, Mr.
Chope.</div><a name="10011984000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
103 and 104 address the national oversight role of the Environment
Agency. There is a fear that the expectation taken from the Pitt
review, that there would be a clear national oversight role that would
have real teeth, that would establish a &#147;buck stops here&#148;
responsibility, is not fully implemented in the Bill. We want everyone
to know that there is one organisation that carries that active
responsibility for all forms of flooding. Amendments 103 and
104 address the interesting power present in clause 19 that allows
investigations into the carrying out of flood risk management
responsibilities by other agencies. That power is given only to local
authorities. If it is reasonable for lead local authorities to exercise
this power in pursuit of their lead local responsibility for flood risk
management, why is it not a reasonable power for the Environment Agency
to exercise at a national level, with their even more important
national oversight role?</div>
<a name="10011984000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The risk is
that this national oversight role&#151;in this clause and in other
clauses in the Bill&#151;may be rendered rather toothless. Who is
going to judge whether flood risk authorities, such as water companies,
which are clearly outside the remit of a single lead local authority,
are really acting consistently and with regard to, or in obedience to
the national flood risk management strategy? It would be a major risk
for even a large local authority such as a county council to pursue a
water company, given the resources available for almost anything to
local authorities these days. It would be a great deterrent for them to
launch an investigation into, or try and pursue, an organisation such
as a water company in order to try and insist on their exercising their
responsibilities fully. In practice, an important national agency such
as the Environment Agency would have the resources to carry out a
proper investigation. They could address areas on a much wider level
than a single local authority. Instead of the risk of a rather
toothless national oversight role, the amendments seek to apply a
little dentistry to the Bill and make the role more toothy and
effective.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div><a name="10011984000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
42 seems to water down these investigative powers in the case of local
authorities. It will be interesting to hear what the hon. Member for
Newport, East says in support of it. It seeks to substitute
proportionate action for investigation by the lead local authorities. I
am not sure how it is possible to take proportionate action if one has
not been able to investigate. However, I am certain that the hon. Lady
has very good arguments in favour of that and I look forward to hearing
them.</div>
<a name="10011984000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 105
is in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and
Radnorshire. It seeks to ensure that any investigations that are
launched and paid for out of public funds will not lie on a dusty shelf
somewhere but will be brought fully into the public domain. It asks for
the reports from those investigations to be laid before Parliament, or
in Wales, before the National Assembly. That adds an additional level
of transparency and openness to the Bill, so I am sure the Government
will welcome it with open arms.</div>
<a name="10011984000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011984000410"></a><b class="B">Jessica
Morden</b> (Newport, East) (Lab): I am speaking to amendment
42; the reason for it has been identified by the Local Government Flood
Forum. Clause 19 could be understood to mean that local authorities
have to investigate and publish results for all floods, even where it
is clear who is responsible or where the costs of investigating would
be much more than that of the damage caused by the flood itself. A case
might be a river with a bridge blocked by debris, causing temporary
flooding of a neighbouring field. It would be a simple case for a
farmer to sort out without the need for the local authority to step in
and perform a full investigation. The amendment proposes to make it
clear that local authorities need only take proportionate action to
clarify who is responsible. It would also mean that a local authority
would need to do something only if it was not clear who was
responsible, and if it did, the cost should not be
excessive.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000411"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I take the opportunity to welcome back the hon.
Member for Brecon and Radnorshire; I hope he has fully recovered. I
hope it was not the excitement of the Committee proceedings that took
him away. I find some sympathy with the amendments moved by the hon.
Member for Cheltenham and wait to hear the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>
<a name="10011984000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to make one comment on clause 19 stand part. While we agree with the
duty that a lead local flood authority must investigate in the event of
a flood, it is unclear which risk management authorities have relevant
flood risk management functions and whether each of those authorities
has exercised, or is preparing to exercise those functions in response
to the flood. The Minister was minded to look more closely at the
catchment management and the co-operation of local authorities in that
regard. That is very pertinent here. I wonder what mechanism he
envisages for local authorities to co-operate. I am mindful of the word
that was used in an earlier
clause&#151;&#147;partnership&#148;&#151;and whether that has
any legal meaning in this regard.</div>
<a name="10011984000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">While an
investigation should be undertaken in those circumstances, the scale of
the flood would presumably have to be significant, in keeping with the
earlier clauses. Would the purpose of the investigation be to establish
who was responsible in order for the remedy to be delivered? Would it
not be important that the Secretary of State in this country or, in the
case of Wales, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>Welsh Ministers be informed of the result after such
an investigation, so that we could all learn from it and ensure that
the necessary remedial action had taken place? The issue of the
Cumbrian floods spring to mind. It returns to the theme of roads being
the responsibility of the highways authorities. Cumbria is not a
unitary authority so it will have this problem.</div>
<a name="10011984000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
particular instance of Cumbria, from my memory, the debris after the
river floods subsided was left on farm land. If the land was public
property, the cost of removing the debris would fall to a public
agency. The land may also be contaminated if it has had sewage and
other foul water in it. In those circumstances, could the Minister take
the opportunity to elaborate for our better understanding on what the
investigations would be and what their purpose is in regard to clause
19?</div><a name="10011984000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000412"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Amendments 102, 103 and 104 extend the
duty to investigate to the Environment Agency and the Welsh Minister in
the case that the local authority response needs to be investigated or
the flood affects more than one area. I agree that it is important that
a lead authority&#146;s response can be questioned if it is not
properly exercising its functions. However, the effect of these
amendments would actually defeat the principal purpose of this clause,
which is to give the public that single point of contact when it is
uncertain which risk management authority should be taking
action.</div>
<a name="10011984000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir Michael
Pitt&#146;s review identified the need to have a single organisation
so that members of the public are not passed around without resolution.
The suggested amendments could actually result in duplication of effort
as well, in which lead authorities and the Environment Agency or Welsh
Ministers are all required to investigate a flood event. The
explanatory statement by the hon. Member for Cheltenham suggested that
the authorities&#146; response may need to be investigated. But there
is already provision in clause 20 for the Minister in England and Welsh
Ministers to direct the Environment Agency or another risk management
authority to act on behalf of a defaulting authority, if the Minister
is satisfied that it has indeed failed to exercise its functions. In
addition, where a flood affects more than one local authority area,
clause 13 provides a requirement for the affected local authorities to
co-operate with each other and ensure that investigations are
co-ordinated.</div>
<a name="10011984000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Members have also tabled amendment 105 to require the results of any
investigation to be laid before Parliament or the National Assembly for
Wales,</div><a name="10011984000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
ensure that any investigation report is publicly available and drawn to
public
attention.&#148;</div><a name="10011984000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the Bill already requires the authority to both publish the results and
notify any relevant risk management authority. The local scrutiny
function provided through schedule 2 will enable the results of
investigations to be considered locally. But requiring the results to
be laid before Parliament is likely to be unduly bureaucratic and to
impose additional burdens on the local authority for little practical
effect.</div>
<a name="10011984000333"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">A
similar requirement proposed by stakeholders for the Secretary of State
to be informed is also unlikely to be proportionate and the same effect
will be achieved by summarising the information in the report from the
Environment Agency set out in clause 18. But there is, of course,
nothing to prevent authorities or others of notifying Ministers and MPs
about any concerns that they have, particularly if urgent action is
needed.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div><a name="10011984000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">So let me
clarify: in terms of the investigation, this is intended to apply to
flood events rather than general local authority performance. Local
authority overview and scrutiny committees can consider all flood risk
management in their areas and it is important that there is
accountability at this
level.</div><a name="10011984000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the question of who will judge whether water companies are acting
consistently, it is for the EA to monitor the application of the
national strategy. As we have said, water companies will need to act
consistently with this, so the EA will have a role in that respect. On
the question of who will judge in an investigation whether water
companies are acting consistently with the strategy, water and sewerage
companies have a regulator&#151;Ofwat&#151;for their water supply
and sewerage functions, but the scrutiny committees will also be able
to scrutinise a water company&#146;s exercise of its flood risk
management functions.</div>
<a name="10011984000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Vale of York asked whether the Secretary of State and Welsh
Ministers should be informed of any investigation. A large number of
incidents could occur and it is not appropriate to refer them all to
the Secretary of State or to Welsh Ministers. We would expect to be
notified of investigations into major incidents, though. Some of these
cases, such as the Cumbrian example, to which the hon. Lady referred,
would also be investigated by the EA, and they can and would be
summarised, of course, in its annual report.</div>
<a name="10011984000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
also asked about mechanisms for local authorities to
investigate in the context of the partnerships to which the Bill
refers. Authorities can work together; there are co-operation
arrangements in clause 13 and provision for the ability to request
information. There is no formal mention of partnership specifically.
However, we have made it clear that the duty to co-operate is in the
spirit&#151;and will be the effect&#151;of the Bill. That includes
the investigation
function.</div><a name="10011984000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that amendment 42 is in response to representations that
have been made to my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, East. There
is, understandably, concern from a number of local authorities and
others that the requirements as currently proposed could be&#151;and
I emphasise &#147;could be&#148;&#151;interpreted as excessively
onerous on them. My hon. Friend mentioned that the Local Government
Flood Forum, in particular, raised the issue in the written evidence to
the Committee. It suggested that
a</div><a name="10011984000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;common
sense approach should be taken with registers, strategies and
designations. They should be completed with regard to need, risk and
the value that they
add.&#148;</div><a name="10011984000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
expressed particular concern that the definition of flooding is broad,
stating:</div><a name="10011984000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
many cases it's not in doubt who is responsible so the LGFF suggests
that a qualifying statement be inserted that makes it clear that the
lead local flood authority only need investigate where it's not clear
who was
responsible.&#148;</div><a name="10011984000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that hon. Members will understand that there is a standard
requirement for public bodies to act reasonably, as I mentioned and as
has been discussed in Committee.</div>
<a name="10011984000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, my
hon. Friend has tabled an interesting and potentially helpful
amendment. It would make it clear that the lead local authority should
take proportionate action to clarify rather than investigate which
flood risk management authorities have relevant flood risk functions.
That could go a long way to ensuring that local authorities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div>take a common-sense approach, which provides good
value for money and adds value. However, I should like to consider
further how we can most successfully address the issues raised and
clarify the intended scope of the duty. With those remarks on
clarification, I ask hon. Members to consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div><a name="10011984000355"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15

Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): I thank the Minister for his
remarks. I take the point that some of the other scrutiny arrangements
in the Bill may render amendment 105 unnecessary. In a sense, I agree
that the most important level at which to have transparency about lead
local authority investigations is local. However, I was not
particularly reassured by his remarks regarding the national ability to
launch investigations for the Environment Agency, which we seek to
include. He talked about a single point of contact being very
important, and implied that that would be the lead local
authority.</div>
<a name="10011984000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last week,
the Minister told us, in reply to one of our other amendments, that the
single point of contact was to be the national Floodline, which is
operated by the Environment Agency. He cannot have it both ways. To
start with, that is two single points of contact and I can imagine
that, if there is more than one single point of contact, there will be
disagreements between them about exactly who is responsible for what,
and the whole system starts to break down. This is precisely the kind
of confusion about which everybody was worried, and which many of us
experienced in the aftermath of the floods. The amendment seeks to
rectify
that.</div><a name="10011984000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that, rather than the Environment Agency&#146;s
launching its own investigations, it was clear in the Bill that the
Secretary of State would have the power to direct flood risk management
authorities, which were not carrying out their functions properly, to
do so. However, that implies that the Minister would act on the advice,
principally, of civil servants, and without an Environment Agency
investigation. That rather suggests that the Department would be trying
to do the Environment Agency&#146;s job for it, further confusing
exactly who is responsible. This is a poorly thought-out part of the
Bill. The confusion of responsibility was one of the main complaints
after the
floods.</div><a name="10011984000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000414"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I just thought that an intervention might
help to expand upon my earlier explanation. One thing I did not remark
on was that we anticipate that local authorities will make use of the
EA&#146;s Floodline service in providing the local service,
particularly for the reporting of incidents, so there is a
synchronicity between the
two.</div><a name="10011984000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000415"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I do not remember &#147;synchronicity&#148;
being the word that the Pitt report used; I think it said single point
of contact. I think that that is what many organisations, like the
National Flood Forum, have emphasised is absolutely
necessary.</div>
<a name="10011984000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I was
concluding, our discussion has revealed a rather poorly thought-out set
of interlocking responsibilities in the Bill. Those responsibilities
need to be invested, at national level, in one body with the power to
investigate and go after authorities that are not carrying out their
functions properly. All members of the public should

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000431"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I have a question for the Minister. The clause
gives the Minister the right to direct a risk management authority to
exercise a flood and coastal erosion risk management function. Under
what circumstances might such a direction be given?</div>
<a name="10011984000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also,
subsection (4) states:</div>
<a name="10011984000348"></a>&#147;The
Minister
must&#151;<a name="10011984000349"></a>(a)
send a copy of the direction to the defaulting authority,
and<a name="10011984000350"></a>(b)
publish the
direction.&#148;<a name="10011984000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
that be published on the website and be again debatable in both Houses?
Presumably, a precedent is being set to other local authorities in
similar circumstances going forward. So it could be a matter of some
significance, a direction in its own right.</div>
<a name="10011984000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000432"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> To clarify, the power within the clause
can be exercised only where the Minister finds that a risk management
authority has failed to carry out its flood or coastal erosion risk
management functions or has acted in a way that does not accord with
the national local strategies. Therefore, it is intended that this
power be exercised in accordance with established protocols and local
government&#146;s performance, and that, where feasible, the
authority with primary responsibility is first given the opportunity to
rectify any failing. We expect the power to be used only as a last
resort.</div>
<a name="10011984000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
various default provisions in the current legislation which do not
require a ministerial direction. The decision to exercise default
powers lies in the hands of different authorities. For example, the
Environment Agency has default powers in relation to internal drainage
boards. The intention of this new clause is to create a common approach
applying to all bodies and to ensure that decisions about the exercise
of default powers are subject to ministerial direction.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div><a name="10011984000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
allows for the direction to include a provision for the directed
authority to recover costs from the defaulting authority for works
carried out on its behalf. The clause also requires the Minister to
publish and issue the defaulting authority with a copy of the
direction, except where this may be contrary to the interests of
national security. As to whether it would be published on the website,
it would be dealt with as per normal with the normal Government
performance framework protocol. This in effect means that it is highly
likely that it will also be published on the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
website.</div><a name="10011984000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000435"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I hope the Minister will be minded to support
our proposals. I understand that there will be a separate clause stand
part debate, in which we can raise one small
point.</div><a name="10011984000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister is aware that we have set great store by maintaining and
supporting the register. This amendment is what the Minister might call
a technical amendment. It relates to our amendments which follow,
relating to the clause and schedule regarding sustainable drainage
systems. We are asking that the lead local flood authority must
establish and maintain a register which will particularly include
information on mapping.</div>
<a name="10011984000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will recall our earlier debate and the emphasis that we placed on
mapping by the lead local flood authority. Regarding the structures or
features that in the opinion of the authority are likely to have a
significant effect on flood risks and sustainable urban drainage
systems in the area, it is implicit within the amendment that the lead
local authority, if it is a county council, will have cognisance of the
highways and the road system. It is implicit within the amendment that
the lead local authority will have discussed with the lower-tier
authority&#151;district councils where there is no unitary
authority&#151;who will be best placed to talk about major housing
developments. Will the Minister confirm that that is his understanding
if he was minded to support this?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div><a name="10011984000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000436"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Those who want to converse should go
outside.</div><a name="10011984000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000437"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am most grateful, Mr. Chope.
Obviously we are reaching a tense and exciting stage of the
Committee&#146;s proceedings. I referred to SUDS and immediately a
buzz goes around the
room.</div><a name="10011984000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will be aware that there is huge concern that, if it is to
serve its purpose, the register will be a register of all the assets.
In his response to, and, I hope, acceptance of, this little set of
amendments the Minister may wish to remark on the fact that we do not
know where SUDS currently are. The lead local authority probably will
know where the ponds relating to an overflow from a road will be, but
there is deep concern that we do not know where the ponds and the urban
drainage relating to new developments currently are. Going forward, if
the Bill works effectively and if it does its job we will know where
new SUDS are being created and we will move on to discuss who will be
best placed to adopt and maintain them at that
time.</div><a name="10011984000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clauses 17, 18 and 19 are consequential in that regard. The Minister
will be aware of the series of parliamentary questions on critical
infrastructure that I pursued with him and I want to take the
opportunity to express our disappointment. One of the primary
recommendations of the Pitt review was that, as a matter of priority,
there should be a full audit of critical infrastructure, not just
stands and reservoirs. The Minister will recall that on a number of
occasions the Government have said that the audit should have been
completed by the summer of 2009.</div>
<a name="10011984000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is fair to
say that that audit of critical infrastructure has still not been
completed. As we speak I am mindful of the substantial damage caused in
the constituencies of the hon. Member for Copeland and his hon. Friend
the Member for Workington (Tony Cunningham)&#151;I am mindful of the
fact that, had the wind not moved at the right time, that mountain of
water may have fallen on North Yorkshire. So, if you like, we are all
in this together. The critical infrastructure must be dealt with as a
matter of urgency, and that is the purpose of new clause 17. I am
mindful of the damage suffered by various parts of the country in 2007,
in areas such as the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for
Tewkesbury and other parts of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Yorkshire
and Humberside. It is vital that we proceed as a matter of urgency with
this critical infrastructure. The critical infrastructure that we have
in mind includes pumping stations relating to utility
companies&#151;water companies, electricity companies and gas
companies. If their pumping stations are not above the flood risk
level, the level of damage caused by flooding can become much more
substantial; as we saw in Gloucestershire, where there was a serious
threat to the drinking
water.</div><a name="10011984000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is intended to be a helpful amendment. We would like it on the face of
the Bill for the Secretary of State to have the power to require
utility companies to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>report on their critical infrastructure and their ability to withstand
future floods. That report would be laid before each House of this
Parliament so that it may be
debatable.</div><a name="10011984000356"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="10011984000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a matter of regret and disappointment that the audit of the critical
infrastructure has not been completed. That risks serious consequences
for the management of present and future flood risks; I am mindful of
the fact that flood warnings are in effect at the moment due to the
current thaw and the heavy rain that has fallen in recent
days.</div><a name="10011984000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 18 builds on that. As regards the resilience of individual
properties, households and businesses, we are asking the Government to
insist that the Environment Agency submits an annual report to the
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and that the
report includes information on the take-up of flood warnings by
property owners and tenants. In reply to the previous debate, the
Minister placed great emphasis on the importance of Floodline, but I am
amazed that in some parts of the country the recent take-up of flood
warnings in many areas was only 40 per cent. I include North Yorkshire
and Yorkshire and Humber in that.</div>
<a name="10011984000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
also problems if the phone number held by the Environment Agency only
relates to the household or business, and that person is on a mobile
some way away. There are all sorts of problems with relaying flood
warnings. This subject should be kept under constant review. It is in
all our interests to ensure that the take-up of flood warnings by
business property owners, householders or their tenants in each case
should be an opt-out rather than an opt-in. The Minister at one stage
seemed to be looking at that, but we seem to have gone away from that
proposal.</div>
<a name="10011984000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would also
like to insist that there should be a take-up of additional anti-flood
measures on properties previously flooded before reoccupation. There is
a certain tension at the Environment Agency, which expects that when
houses are reoccupied, resilience measures have been taken. Where that
house or business is in an area at risk of flooding, more resilience
measures should have been taken, such as putting plugs higher up, not
reinstating carpets, or putting tiles in where appropriate. If the
property is flooded again, that house or building can be reoccupied
more quickly. One would have thought that it was in the insurance
companies&#146; interests to insist that such resilience measures are
taken.</div>
<a name="10011984000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can quite
understand that there is resistance to taking such measures from
householders and some business people, particularly where they own the
property. They believe that it looks as though the house is going to
flood&#151;because it probably will&#151;and they feel that the
house will not be as easy to sell. The Bill must address that tension
and I hope the Minister will look favourably on these
provisions.</div>
<a name="10011984000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would also
like to see a provision that could be adopted regarding any
developments with insurance companies on anti-flood measures, which
would reduce the insurance premiums for properties at risk of flooding.
If we do not make it in the interests of the business, householder or
tenant to make good these resilience measures and if we are asking them
to pay substantial amounts of money, then why is it in their interests
if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 247</div>they are not going to have a reduced insurance
premium? We would like to press the Minister and find out what
discussions his Department has had, and what he has personally
discussed with the industry to ensure that these resilience measures
lead to a reduced flood premium.</div>
<a name="10011984000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 19
follows on from that. We believe the British Standards Institution
should be the body that says that the particular product the
householder or business is being invited to use is fit for purpose. I
pray in aid the example of the householder who owned two properties to
let in Pickering, which was in the news once again over the Christmas
period because of the snow. We now hear from the Environment Agency
that Pickering is at risk of flooding because of the thaw, and we may
still get more snow. That property owner spent &#163;20,000 on
flood-proofing the two flats to let, on the basis that the water would
no longer penetrate. In fact, in 2007, having spent &#163;20,000 the
water went in just as quickly as if he had not done so. My question is,
what come-back does that property owner have? We believe that currently
there is none.</div>
<a name="10011984000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would like
the Government to accept new clause 19 to ensure that there
are annual reports from the British Standards Institution that include
information on what the burden of proof is to ensure that any product
that receives the kitemark for flood-resistant products is fit for
purpose. I have received a series of answers from the Minister and the
Minister in the Department for Communities and Local Government who has
responsibility for this matter, and the kitemark is the
key.</div><a name="10011984000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a product is not fit for purpose and a property floods, does the
householder, the property owner or the tenant who has spent the money
have grounds for an action against the holder of the kitemark or the
producer of the product? At the moment, that is a great omission and
there is no come-back. People are spending thousands of pounds each
year to make their properties more flood-resilient and the products are
simply not fit for purpose. I am sure that the Minister and other
Committee members have been asked by many producers to approve their
products. I believe that is the role not of a Member of
Parliament&#151;perhaps I am doing us a great injustice&#151;but of
the British Standards Institution. At the moment, there is no action
after the kitemark is
issued.</div><a name="10011984000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like the Minister to agree to include new clause 19 in the Bill
or to satisfy us that those who have spent money to make their
properties more resilient have an action they can take. The report we
are asking for the BSI to publish would give the number of kitemarks
issued in the year and the number of products issued under the
kitemark</div><a name="10011984000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which
fail to meet the test of resistance which led to further flooding of
any particular
property.&#148;</div><a name="10011984000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 19 is key to filling the gap in the law whereby we
ask property owners to spend substantial amounts of money but if the
products fail they are left out of pocket and have no come-back. We
believe that the Secretary of State should lay before Parliament a copy
of the report and that it should be debatable because it would have to
be approved by a resolution of each House of
Parliament.</div><a name="10011984000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
little group of proposals goes to the core of what the Bill should be
doing to make good the Pitt review recommendations. We believe it would
satisfy property owners who have spent substantial amounts of money. It
would satisfy the Environment Agency that people
are coming back into their homes and that their
properties 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>are more flood-resilient. It would satisfy insurance companies and we
hope that they would offer reduced insurance cover and perhaps lower
excesses in these circumstances. This is an important group of
proposals, which we hope the Minister will
support.</div><a name="10011984000184"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000438"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am pleased to join in this debate, which I
agree is as tense and exciting as any of our discussions last week on
cross-border internal drainage boards. I will deal with the proposals
in
turn.</div><a name="10011984000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
26, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Vale of York, is entirely
sensible. It underlines the need to clarify the continuing
responsibility for SUDS after they have been installed. A weakness that
is emerging in our discussion of SUDS is what happens after they have
been put in and who is responsible for maintenance. The mapping and
recording of SUDS would aid with that responsibility and I happily
support the
amendment.</div><a name="10011984000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
106, which I tabled, addresses the important issue of the resilience of
critical infrastructure, which was an important consideration of the
Pitt report. Recommendation 53
stated:</div><a name="10011984000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
specific duty should be placed on economic regulators to build
resilience in the critical
infrastructure.&#148;</div><a name="10011984000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, in Gloucestershire we had two very clear examples of that. The
flooding of the Mythe water treatment works resulted in the loss of
fresh water for thousands of people for up to two weeks. I lost my
water supply because of that. That was bad enough in the warmth and
light of midsummer. Walking the streets of Cheltenham trying to find a
bowser with water in it would have been a quite different experience
had it been cold, dark and raining. There was a kind of camaraderie in
the streets as people swapped information about which bowser actually
had water and where the latest supplies of bottled could be picked up.
It would have been much less funny if it had carried on for much
longer. It was already less funny for vulnerable people such as
pensioners. It is a serious issue.</div>
<a name="10011984000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">It could have
been more serious if the Walham electricity substation had been lost,
and it very nearly was. That would have meant the loss of electricity
to some 600,000 people, some as far away as Wales, and meant the loss
of electricity for refrigerating fresh food and for water
pumping&#151;so we would probably have lost the fresh
water&#151;and the loss of the main electricity supply to hospitals,
schools and all sorts of vital businesses. The cost would have been
stupendous. Gold command briefly discussed, and rightly dismissed, the
evacuation of Gloucestershire. Oxfam always used to advise people to
keep within the villages in emergencies. That something as drastic as
evacuation was even contemplated in the event of Walham being lost
shows what an enormous catastrophe losing that critical infrastructure
would have been.</div>
<a name="10011984000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000439"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> The hon. Gentleman lists many of the things
that could have happened if we had lost the electricity supply. In
addition, one thing that could have been lost, frighteningly, was the
power of communication &#151;the ability to get information to
people. That would have been terrifying.</div>
<a name="10011984000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000440"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. All the computers
switched off would have cut most of Gloucestershire off the internet.
In this day and age that would have been a shock. The telephone
system  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>has its own power supply but that could have been
compromised as well. What could have happened is a frightening prospect
and Sir Michael Pitt was right to address it. However, in a sense, he
was a little kind and the review was a little limited. He was kind in
the sense that the Government were told in 2004 that a national review
of critical infrastructure was needed. Because nothing was urgently
pressing that they needed to take action on and there was no immediate
example of what goes wrong when critical infrastructure is lost, the
issue drifted and the review did not happen. By the time the floods
hit, the national review had not been carried out. We are all aware of
how great emergencies dominate the headlines for a few days or weeks
and then drift out of the media&#146;s attention, and out of
Ministers&#146; attention from time to time as
well.</div><a name="10011984000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Pitt review was limited because I do not think that Sir Michael
appreciated that critical infrastructure is far more than the
utilities; they are more or less all that he addresses in his report.
Recent events in Cumbria underline the fact that bridges are pretty
critical infrastructure and having your town chopped in half could be
disastrous&#151;at one stage, that was potentially going to be for
months for people in some towns in Cumbria.</div>
<a name="10011984000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 106
covers not only utilities, but
also</div><a name="10011984000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;critical
railway lines, roads and bridges...telephone exchanges and other
critical communications sites and structures...general hospitals,
and...any other local sites and structures considered critical by
the
authority&#148;</div><a name="10011984000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">so
that we have a comprehensive register, maintained locally by the people
with an interest in knowing where that critical infrastructure is. One
slightly alarming thing that emerged from the experience of gold
command in Gloucestershire was that until both Mythe and Walham were at
risk, it was not aware of how important they were. For instance, the
idea that when one substation was lost there was no back-up or
alternative supply came, I think, as a shock to the chief constable in
charge of gold command and as a shock to many of the rest of
us.</div>
<a name="10011984000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to the Minister for his letter of 11 January to the
Committee, which points out a great deal that has been done on critical
infrastructure since the floods of 2007. I am not alleging inaction.
However, we are suggesting that the Bill does not create statutory
duties, which the Pitt review expected it to. Should we find one day a
less active and conscientious Minister taking the place of the hon.
Member for
Ogmore&#151;</div><a name="10011984000195"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000442"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> He is not going to be there for life&#151;that
would be a burden and a half.</div>
<a name="10011984000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000443"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The hon. Gentleman should have read new
clause 70.</div>
<a name="10011984000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000444"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I would not put it past a Labour
Government.</div><a name="10011984000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should
a less conscientious Minister take his place and should flooding drift
off the political agenda, as it might do and as happened between 2004
and 2007, it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>possible that the good intentions and the good
record so far would start to drift away. The statutory duties are
important, but the maintenance of a register relating to flooding at
local level is a brilliant opportunity at least to put pressure on
those responsible for those sites to be aware of the importance of them
to the general population and to address the issue of their resilience
to flooding.</div>
<a name="10011984000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 107
is complementary to the earlier one. It is obvious that we need to
reduce the causes of flooding. However, as mentioned, flooding is a
natural process and the intelligent and sustainable way to address it
is to increase our resilience to it as well as defend ourselves against
it. The requirement under the Bill for local authorities to establish a
flood register offers the opportunity to promote resilience. Amendment
107 is designed to take those bodies, sites, or structures that we
addressed in the previous amendment and ensure that there is some
register of their state of resilience to possible failure due to
flooding or coastal erosion. That is important for reducing the public
cost of the emergency response. It is also important for insurance
companies and for providing the public information that will act as a
powerful incentive for owners of that infrastructure to ensure its
ready state for flood events of the kind that we experienced in
Gloucestershire, or might have experienced in other parts of the
country.</div>
<a name="10011984000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might also
resolve the question that unfortunately sometimes arises of who is
culpable when things go wrong. There was a particular issue in
Gloucestershire that I raised on a number of occasions, where Severn
Trent&#151;perhaps compared with other water companies&#151;did not
seem to have built in resilience at the Mythe in the way that it might
have been expected to. Compared, for instance, with national grid at
Walham, it did not inform gold command quickly enough. When one closely
examined, side by side, the accounts of who told what to whom, it
emerged that even as local staff at the Mythe were warning Severn Trent
management that the water pumping station was at high risk, it still
had not informed gold command that there was an urgent need to act as
it later did to save Walham&#151;and so the Mythe was lost.</div>
<a name="10011984000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that
situation it is not clear who was at fault. There is an automatic duty
and compensation scheme for water companies; where they are responsible
for the unplanned interruption of water supply, they are supposed to
compensate consumers. My argument&#151;in fact Severn Trent&#146;s
initial acknowledgment&#151;was that the compensation scheme should
have come into play. Probably over &#163;10 million should
have been paid to consumers in Gloucestershire for the inconvenience of
having lost their water supply, for which Severn Trent was in large
part culpable. I am afraid, however, that it tried to wriggle out of
that responsibility; it offered a much smaller amount in contribution
to the emergency response work and its shareholders got away
scot-free&#151;I am afraid Ofwat let them get away scot-free. Had
there been a register that detailed the level of resilience, it would
have been much clearer whether or not Severn Trent had made that site
resilient enough to meet the requirements of the flooding
threat.</div><a name="10011984000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000445"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> On that point, I think that the water company
should have realised that something might happen to the works because
the surrounding roads and fields flood regularly. Just this weekend the
police put up signs because the road had flooded, although not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div>badly. It is situated in a place that frequently floods, so it should
have clicked with the water company that something bad might
happen.</div>
<a name="10011984000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000446"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right and he has a good
local knowledge of that part of our
county.</div><a name="10011984000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am very interested in new clause 28 and I look forward to
seeing whether the Minister&#146;s remarks on that offer any
reassurance. New clause 6, like the other new clauses tabled by the
hon. Member for Vale of York, is designed to address the issue of
resilience at household level. The route that we have chosen is to
amend the code for sustainable housing. The issue is pretty simple. We
are simply not building flood resilient homes in areas of high flood
risk. I had a look at the way the code for sustainable homes is
currently interpreted on the architects&#146; website
&#147;Building Design&#148;. It
states:</div><a name="10011984000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Architects
and designers will be judged on the provision of rainwater holding
facilities ... and the attenuation of run-off either to natural
water courses or to municipal systems.</div>
<a name="10011984000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">Where houses
are sited in areas of flood risk, designers can gain extra points for
constructing the ground level of buildings above the flood level, or
designing the house with resilience against flooding to limit
consequential
damage.&#148;</div><a name="10011984000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Points
may occasionally mean prizes, but they certainly do not guarantee
resilience. That is a conscious admission by the architectural
profession that at the moment the code allows people to build houses
for clients that place them in a position of risk. That will then lead
to insurance problems if they are charged higher premiums, or if they
have to make a claim that will probably lead to higher premiums for all
of us. It seems to be part of a head-in-the-sand attitude to the
building of flood defences which is not shared in other
countries.</div><a name="10011984000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other countries there are standard building regulations stipulating,
for example, that, in flood risk areas, power sockets should not be in
skirting boards. They are put at waist or chest height where they are
easier to use for quite a lot of elderly people. That is a perfectly
sensible change which should be automatic in a flood risk area. The
more extreme examples in the Netherlands are of houses that rise up on
stilts; the whole house floats upwards if there is a flood. That might
be a slightly extreme variation, but all of these things could be
looked at. The current situation is clearly inadequate.</div>
<a name="10011984000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to
Conservative new clauses 17, 18 and 19. The hon. Member for Vale of
York is clearly on a bit of roll. We will happily support all three of
those. New clause 17 offers another layer of resilience planning to
Ministers. It is not too prescriptive. It only
says:</div><a name="10011984000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may by order require utility companies to report on
their critical
infrastructure&#148;</div><a name="10011984000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
may not believe that that is absolutely necessary, but it seems to be a
desirable addition to ministerial powers, so we would happily support
new clause 17.</div>
<a name="10011984000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 18
addresses the interesting interlocking issues of household flood
defence, flood alerts and insurance, which are also addressed in our
new clause 4. We all want to reduce damage from floods and claims from
households, but quite apart from reducing the human misery, there is an
important function here in reducing the cost of insurance for
everybody. Better flood defences and management of the water in the
landscape are important, but there are other ways to reduce the damage
from flooding.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div><a name="10011984000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are novel ways of protecting individual households. The hon. Member for
Vale of York talked about some products being available that perhaps
were not up to standard, but suppliers have shown me some extraordinary
new products in the past couple of years. One system involves
lightweight pillars that simply click into the ground next to a
vulnerable opening such as the front door. Artificial planks are then
slotted in and there are rubber seals, so when the water rises up
against the front door the whole thing becomes watertight. It can be
put up in minutes. It is very lightweight, so even an elderly person
could do it at a pinch. It seems to be exactly the kind of thing that
might qualify for the kitemark that is suggested in new clause
19.</div>
<a name="10011984000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">In order to
use such systems, especially those that one has to physically put in
place when there is a flood warning, one needs a flood alert, so it is
important that flood warnings are part of the mix. We need to address
the whole issue of flood warnings and alerts. We currently have
generalised alerts covering broad areas. Moreover, the alerts are
issued days in advance, as was the case in Gloucestershire, and are
not, in practice, a huge amount of
help.</div><a name="10011984000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
one really needs to know is that a particular level of flooding is
about to happen in a particular area. That would necessitate people
rushing home from work and spending the last 10 minutes before the
flood water arrives putting a system in place. That could prevent a lot
of loss of property and, in turn, a lot of losses to insurance
companies. It is also practical, because Met Office technology is now
much more specific. In terms of predicting rainfall on a much narrower
resolution, the potential exists to precisely predict extreme rainfall
events, but that does not seem to have translated into the flood alert
system. The new clause is therefore welcome in trying to bring those
things
together.</div><a name="10011984000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 19 takes a slightly different approach from new clause 4, which
we will debate later. The British Standards Institution&#146;s
kitemark scheme would be an entirely appropriate way to address the
issue of finding a national accredited scheme for flood defence
technology. I am not sure how the BSI&#146;s responsibilities can be
enforced in primary legislation, but I am sure that the Minister will
expand on that. The intention behind new clause 19, however, is good
and addresses similar issues to other new clauses that we have tabled.
We would like to see those issues
addressed.</div><a name="10011984000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011984000447"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship again, Mr. Chope. I rise to ask my
hon. Friend the Minister a couple of questions. The Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs Committee wrote a report on the July 2007 floods and
its most worrying aspect, as the hon. Member for Vale of York knows,
was that we identified that 70 per cent. of our critical infrastructure
was in the flood plain. That figure is of deep
concern.</div><a name="10011984000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
subsequently went to look at the E.ON substation at Over and was quite
impressed by the work that it had done. It has put the station on
stilts, which involved huge capital expenditure. There seems to be some
differential between the contingency planning of the electricity
industry and that of the water industry. It was made clear to me that
there was clear back-up from other parts of the country and other
electricity stations. Is that for legal reasons, or is the industry far
more aware of the need to keep the power on if possible?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div><a name="10011984000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have said before that the simple fact in relation to the water industry
was that Severn Trent did not take up the offers made by both Wessex
Water and Bristol Water to insert pipelines that would have allowed it
to keep the water on. It chose not to do that in what was a straight
commercial decision. It was not done because of the inability to action
the mechanism; it did not want to spend the money and be beholden to
other companies. That was a shocking and wrong decision, and I think
that, with the benefit of hindsight, Severn Trent has come to recognise
that.</div><a name="10011984000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another,
more general question is: when a station, whether it be a water pumping
station or a substation, is coming up for renewal or refurbishment, who
has some traction to decide that its flooding risk is such that a
contingency must be put in place&#151;as happened in Over when E.ON
put its substation on stilts&#151;to deal with virtually every
eventuality?</div><a name="10011984000358"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="10011984000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be intrigued to know whether that is covered by the Bill, or
whether there are powers under other legislation&#151;certainly in
terms of electricity&#151;that allow somebody to say that a facility
which, because of its location, could flood, either needs to be moved,
which is a huge capital expenditure, with all the planning process
involved, or needs to be made fit for purpose, notwithstanding the fact
that it has not flooded.</div>
<a name="10011984000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have seen
what can be done; parts of the electricity industry are already
addressing the matter. We have some protections around the Mythe, as
the hon. Member for Cheltenham knows better than I do. I do not know
how robust those protections are, what risk analysis has been done or
what contingency planning has been put in place. In the nuclear
industry, every nuclear establishment has to have a full-scale
emergency planned reaction to all sorts of contingencies such as
terrorist attack or plane crash. Such establishments have to do that as
a matter of course. I do not know whether that is the case with our
critical infrastructure. If it is not, it ought to be because people
ought to know what they are facing. We all know that it was only the
brave but incredibly lucky reactions of the engineer at Mythe, who
decided to turn off all the gear before it went down a big plughole,
that saved the site from being out of use for a lot longer. I ask the
Minister these questions because they are important
issues.</div><a name="10011984000221"></a>

Friend the Member for Vale of York. I also support a lot of what the
hon. Members for Cheltenham and for Stroud have said.</div>
<a name="10011984000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned
earlier that I had a meeting with the chairman of the Environment
Agency last night and he brought up the issue of the maintenance of the
SUDS. The agency is concerned about whether the SUDS&#151;whatever
they turn out to be and we had a debate on that last week&#151;will
be maintained. Poor maintenance will be a problem and they will become
ineffective. The argument for being able to build houses in a certain
place will not be strong if the defences are not maintained properly.
It is important that we put something in the Bill that makes that
clear. I am aware that house builders, including in my constituency,
are putting forward the argument, &#147;We can deal with the water.
We can deal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div>with the run-off. We can deal with all these
things.&#148; We have to make sure that they can, because that will
be quite a persuasive argument when they put in their planning
applications. If there is not a safety net attached, houses are going

want to talk about the position of Walham and the Mythe. As I have
mentioned, I live close to the Mythe in Tewkesbury and it is subject to
flood. The fields there flood very regularly; the roads flooded this
weekend. They continue to flood, not to the extent of 2007, but
sufficiently to give a warning that something like that might happen
again. The hon. Member for Stroud mentioned that there are some
defences at the Mythe. I think that I am right in saying that they are
semi-permanent; they are not perfect. I do not think that they will
necessarily stand the test of time but there is something up there.
However, we have to be absolutely sure that what happened in 2007 does
not happen again. I will come back to that in a moment.</div>
<a name="10011984000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The position
of the Walham substation is worrying because it flooded badly. It was
only the heroic work of many people that stopped it going down and the
entire county losing its electricity, with all the consequences
mentioned by the hon. Member for Cheltenham. The reason I mention that
is that an application has been accepted, on appeal, to build more than
500 houses not far from the Walham site, on green fields that, at
present, soak up water. There was a lot of flooding in a town called
Longford, which is very close to the Walham site. People were flooded
very badly in that area. My concern is that building on that site
increases the risk to those houses, and also to Walham. Our old friend
the regional spatial strategy proposes building an awful lot more
housing not far from there. Therefore, we are making the situation a
lot worse and a lot more dangerous than it needs to be.</div>
<a name="10011984000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cheltenham raised the point about whether we should build
houses in a flood resistant or resilient way. I would rather that they
were not built in the wrong place in the first place, but if we are to
build them he is absolutely right: we should consider how we build
them. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)
raised that point on Second Reading. The image everybody has of
Tewkesbury across the world&#151;I have even spoken to people in
Australia and other parts of the world about it&#151;is the iconic
picture of the abbey surrounded by water. Everybody will recall that
image. The abbey itself did not flood. There was water around the
abbey, but the abbey itself did not flood. Building work on the abbey
began at the end of the 11th century. That is a long time ago and we
seem to have forgotten the principles that people in those days
obviously understood.</div>
<a name="10011984000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cheltenham made a very good point about that. He also gave a
good account of the problems caused by the loss of the water supply.
Some people, I think I am right in saying, lost their water supply for
up to three weeks. Most people lost supply for between one and two
weeks, but I think some lost it for a little longer than that. To see
the heroic effort to get bottles of water to people was unbelievable.
Wagonloads of bottled water were brought in and distributed. The final
distribution to houses was carried out by very young
people&#151;children&#151;older people and volunteers. It was an
absolutely extraordinary sight. We also had 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div>the bowser system, but this was a monumental effort
that we cannot really expect people to go through again. I spent quite
a while, on one particular day, with the Prime
Minister.</div><a name="10011984000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000449"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> One of the reasons that we cannot go through that
again is that so few of the bowsers were collected back. We will not
have enough bowsers to run the operation
again.</div><a name="10011984000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000450"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. Getting
water out to people was hugely difficult. That operation could not be
carried out for very long. It is very difficult to get bowsers filled.
I spent the Wednesday with the Prime Minister, who came to Walham and
to the Mythe. He was on the phone trying to get people to fill the
bowsers more quickly. I mention that because if the Prime Minister
himself cannot move things on more quickly, then it is a very serious
situation. If the Prime Minister cannot move things on, then who on
earth do we go to? It was an extremely serious situation. I remember
watching the late night news when the Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who had also been down to see what
was going on and was very helpful, had to give an assessment to the
Prime Minister on how things were going to go&#151;whether the
situation would become better or worse. I will never forget the news
report saying that it did not look good in Gloucestershire; and that
the Secretary of State would have to say to the Prime Minister that
there was a great danger of losing the entire electricity supply. It
was very frightening. As I mentioned in an intervention, if we had lost
the power of communication&#151;television, radio or mobile phones
that could not be charged up&#151;it would have been a very
frightening situation. Looking back, it is perhaps easy to move on and
forget, but it was a desperate situation and we cannot have anything
such as that happen again.</div>
<a name="10011984000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">In order to
prevent such an event, we must start putting measures in the Bill. With
great respect to the Minister, I keep hearing explanations about why
certain things cannot go in the Bill, but that reinforces my concern.
Although there is nothing in the Bill that I object to, there is not
enough in it to ensure that we will not go through those problems
again. Even if some new clauses or amendments are not absolutely
perfectly worded&#151;and I do not suggest that that is the
case&#151;they would be worth putting in the Bill as that would move
us towards the situation in which we need to be. As it stands, the Bill
does not do that. I support amendment 26 and new clause 17,
and say to the Minister that we must put such measures in the Bill or
it will not much improve matters. Amendments and new clauses have
indentified in detail what needs to be done to improve the situation,
and I hope that the Minister will accept some of the measures that have
been put forward.</div>
<a name="10011984000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011984000451"></a><b class="B">Nia
Griffith</b> (Llanelli) (Lab): I would like to push the
Minister for an additional explanation on subsection (2). We
all understand the need for a proper register of structures or features
that could have a significant effect on flood risk. However, the
question is: what is significant risk? We welcome the fact that the
register will be made available for inspection by the public, but
people will be looking out for the detail of the regulations, which
will be crucial. People want to know not only that we are looking at
things that have caused problems in the past, but that we are looking
to the future and looking out 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div>for those things that will be a risk. People become angry when they feel
that things could have been identified but were not, or if they find
that building has been carried out and later somebody says, &#147;Oh
yes. It was always rather marshy down there.&#148; That is the type
of comment that we do not want to hear.</div>
<a name="10011984000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yesterday I
visited a place where a housing association has provided some
high-quality homes in a suitable setting. There are a small number of
homes that blend in well with the local environment and fit into a
small town. The name of the street is significant&#151;Willows close.
One might wonder why, shortly after people had moved in, they
experienced severe flooding. However, if we look at the records, we
find that planning permission was initially turned down because of
flood risk but that somehow, suitable plans were then found to
alleviate the problem in some way, and that was supposed to be okay. Of
course, it was not okay. That is the tragedy that can happen. The risk
is not only to people in those particular homes. Many of us have seen
what happens with what I call the sponge effect&#151;if one place is
squeezed, it squirts out somewhere else. Therefore, if people build in
one place, that will have a knock-on effect on other properties or
playing fields, which become more waterlogged.</div>
<a name="10011984000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
an assurance from the Minister about the nature of the provisions, the
details, the time scale and the type of updating that will be required.
Things clearly do not remain constant for ever; there are changes to
our environment in everything from the course of rivers to the
coastline to the effect of human activity. There will need to be
constant updating. It is no good having something that we can access on
the internet by pressing a button if it does not reflect the reality of
something new that has been
built.</div><a name="10011984000359"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="10011984000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remember reading an Ordnance Survey map that did not show Llyn Brianne,
a vast reservoir in Wales. Having recently moved to that area, I was
unaware of it, so when I went walking I
found&#151;extraordinarily&#151;a very large reservoir. People
should not find themselves in that situation. People want to know that
when they are making decisions, they have the necessary
information.</div><a name="10011984000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have one further point about the planning procedure. We in Wales have
unitary authorities, which means that the local lead flood authority is
likely to be the planning authority as well. That situation has
advantages and disadvantages. Of course, there is a lot of streamlining
with unitary authorities and they can be very effective. The
considerable worry in this case is that only one authority is looking
into the risk and controlling it. Therefore, the role of the Welsh
Assembly Government Minister, and of the Secretary of State in England,
is crucial in ensuring that the proper information is made available
and that we take notice of it when we are making provision for the
future.</div><a name="10011984000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must have the most up-to-date modelling and information about flood
risk so that people can make informed decisions when passing planning
applications. People need to err on the side of caution and to be much
more robust in asking questions about planning applications,
particularly in low-lying areas in more rural parts of Britain.
Obviously there is a crisis in places such as London, where it is very
difficult to find additional places to build, but those of us who live
in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div>areas where there is a little more space should be
ensuring that our provision for future generations is based on a much
more common-sense approach and be prepared to say, &#147;No,
that&#146;s not a good place. Let&#146;s put this somewhere
better&#151;somewhere safer.&#148; I therefore urge the Minister,
when he gets down to looking at the regulations following this
Committee&#146;s work, to make them very
prescriptive.</div><a name="10011984000236"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011984000452"></a><b class="B">Chloe
Smith</b> (Norwich, North) (Con): I want to speak particularly
in support of new clauses 17 to 19, but also about amendment 26. I
start by noting that I believe that I am the only member of the
Committee from the east of England, which is one of those rather large
areas that are referred to as a flood risk in their entirety. Anyone
who has visited any part of it will recognise that that is a very
broad-brush definition. Coming somewhat closer to home, and talking
about Norfolk, I shall refer briefly to the Norfolk broads, with which
hon. Members might be familiar, but I shall first address Norwich,
North&#151;my
constituency.</div><a name="10011984000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wholeheartedly support what my hon. Friends have proposed in new
clauses 17 to 19, in that that is a way to give power to the people,
through information, in a very specific, micro, super-local manner. Our
debate has already passed over responsibilities that might reside at
national and local levels. As I just tried to say, in a somewhat
garbled manner, this is a super-local point about the way in which
people might be able to protect their homes, down to the level of a
rubber seal around the front door. It is incredibly important that
people can know and decide about&#151;perhaps in descending
order&#151;first, structures in their area, which is referred to in
one of the proposals; secondly, utilities in their area, following on
from new clause 17; and, thirdly, the insurance available and the
factors that affect insurance in relation to their homes. Of course,
our discussion on these new clauses is not the only area in the debate
where we have referred to that. This is merely one aspect of the entire
insurance debate, but it is a valuable one none the
less.</div><a name="10011984000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
new clause 19, we come down to the most micro level possible of
modifications that home owners and tenants can make with confidence in
their properties. The example of modifications raised by the hon.
Member for Cheltenham&#151;the pillar and plank scenario&#151;put
me in mind of a case in my constituency. In comparison with the very
large and tragic floods that this country has seen, I am talking about
&#147;only&#148; 12 homes&#151;a small row of homes that have
what is as yet an unidentified or uninvestigated flooding problem. My
constituents are using the old-fashioned version of the plank system.
There is an elderly gentleman who runs out of his door when he thinks
that the rain might be coming and holds a plank in front of his
driveway. The fact is that home owners have to do such things. Hon.
Members have referred to the time that people have to act when they
think that the waters might be on their
way.</div><a name="10011984000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wholeheartedly support the measures, which could give home owners and
tenants confidence in products that they can buy so that they can
exercise consumer power to do what they can in the face of what might,
despite our best efforts in Committee, continue to be the frightening
and confusing situation of flooding.</div>
<a name="10011984000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 26
refers to mapping. As other hon. Members have said, a mapping provision
would be important, and mapping forms part of the theme of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div>information provision that we have already covered. I want to draw on an
example that is local to my constituency, in which there might be an
implicit question for clarification by the Minister: the role of the
Broads Authority. Perhaps the Minister will clarify how national parks,
and the authority in particular, fit in to the categories of risk
management authorities, local authorities, planning authorities and so
on in the context that we are considering. I hope I shall be forgiven
for looking back at definitions&#151;and perhaps forward at clauses
22 and 24 on regional flood and coastal committees&#151;but I should
like the Minister to clarify where the Broads Authority sits among
those elements of our work.</div>
<a name="10011984000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to
mapping, hon. Members might have visited the Norfolk broads on
wonderful holidays. Of course they have a large surface area, but I do
not think that they are unmapped&#151;like reservoirs in Wales,
perhaps. However, the broads come into a small area of the city of
Norwich, which often leaves local people foxed about what is the
planning authority for a particular mooring in a part of the wider
urban area known as Thorpe St. Andrew, which is in my
constituency.</div>
<a name="10011984000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">My key point
is that the broads are not simply a rural place. They are also urban;
they cross boundaries. As hon. Members have already noted, waterways do
not respect such boundaries. The mapping element is a key part of
allowing people to see, at the level of feet and inches, who is
responsible for what. I wholeheartedly recommend that amendment 26 be
accepted because it would afford extra benefit in such small-scale
examples as I have
mentioned.</div><a name="10011984000243"></a>

want to say that given the length and breadth of the debate, I do not

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000455"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Thank you for that clarification,
Mr.
Chope.</div><a name="10011984000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had a good, useful and thorough debate that has exhausted many
avenues of clause 21. I want to respond first to some of the comments
made by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury and my hon. Friend the Member
for Llanelli about what is on the face of the Bill and the question of
future-proofing. I know that I sometimes seem like the reluctant
legislator, but I come from the point of principle that we put in a
Bill what is needed, but get the right flexibility to avoid the need to
revisit primary legislation. We can build in future-proofing for future
Ministers, through regulations or guidance. Although I might seem
reluctant, there are sometimes good reasons, and I never seek
perfection, although to paraphrase Nye Bevan very badly, I would say
that any journey that does not seek utopia is not even worth setting
out on.</div>
<a name="10011984000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I go
through the points, I shall have to take some time, at the risk of
incurring the wrath of the Committee&#146;s business managers,
because there is quite a lot of detail to cover. First, however, I am
always willing to put my hand up when I make an error; I have indeed
made a technical error in something I said in a previous sitting on a
matter related to the one we are considering, for which I
apologise.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div><a name="10011984000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Thursday, I referred to the Environment Agency&#146;s power to issue
guidance to lead local flood authorities and others on requests for
information under clause 14 and the register provided for under clause
21. The Secretary of State approves the agency&#146;s national
strategy and guidance under clause 7(7), but there are other more
general arrangements to which I referred incorrectly&#151;I referred
to the wrong clause&#151;including a power to direct the Environment
Agency, which is to be found in section 40 of the Environment Act 1995,
not section 19A, as I inadvertently said. That is a clarification, but
the mistake does not affect the substance of what I
said.</div><a name="10011984000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I suggested, and as I think one of Scott&#146;s lieutenants said as
he walked out of the tent in the Antarctic, this may take some time.
First, the hon. Member for Vale of York raised the issue of lead local
authorities when she asked me to confirm that they should work with
others to ensure that they have the relevant information that they
need. I can confirm that the duty to co-operate in clause 13 already
provides that they should do that. Similarly, clause 14 provides for
information to be requested&#151;I wanted to deal with that issue
right up front and give that reassurance.</div>
<a name="10011984000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
and the hon. Member for Upminster tabled amendment 26 expressly to
include &#147;Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems&#148; within the
requirement for a register and record of structures. I agree that it is
important to ensure that there is a record for both adopted and
unadopted sustainable drainage systems. That is why, under paragraphs
22 and 23 of schedule 3 to the Bill, a SUDS-approving body is already
under that duty to include all sustainable drainage systems that it
approves on the register, while a record of assets is established under
clause 21. To come back to the point with which I began my speech, it
is right that the specific details to be recorded are set out in
regulations that underpin the Bill.</div>
<a name="10011984000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Members for Cheltenham and for Brecon and Radnorshire tabled amendments
106 and 107, which would expand the scope of the register to include
infrastructure that could have, as amendment 106 puts
it:</div><a name="10011984000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
significant effect on public health and welfare if
flooded&#148;.</div><a name="10011984000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we deal with those amendments, may I refer again to the issue of SUDS
being included on the authority&#146;s register, which I have just
mentioned? Just to clarify matters, SUDS approved under the Bill will
automatically be put on the authority&#146;s register. Other existing
SUDS can be put on the register if they are relevant to local flood
risk, which of course is the focus of the Bill, and indeed many of them
will be. The ability to request information set out in the Bill will be
quite important to
that.</div><a name="10011984000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Tewkesbury raised the issue of SUDS maintenance. The
Bill provides for all SUDS serving more than one property in new
developments covered by the Bill to be maintained by county and unitary
local authorities in the future. Those authorities can also choose, if
they wish to do so and if it is relevant to the flood risk management,
to adopt existing SUDS. I refer the hon. Gentleman to paragraphs 16 to
21 of schedule 3 to the Bill.</div>
<a name="10011984000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
amendments 106 and 107, there are existing requirements under the Civil
Contingencies Act 2004 for local authorities to co-operate with
transport and utility companies in local resilience forums, including
in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div>periods when there is an incident. Such arrangements
relate to a wide range of risks and it would not be appropriate to
require a register of infrastructure at risk of flooding and coastal
erosion in isolation. Maintaining such a statutory register would not
add any value to the existing arrangements and, in fact, would place an
additional burden on local authorities.</div>
<a name="10011984000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s Centre for the Protection of National
Infrastructure works with the operators of essential services and with
lead Government Departments to help to identify and protect critical
national infrastructure against security threats. I would like to go
into further detail on this issue, because it has been raised by a few
hon. Members. I have stated before that the natural hazards team was
created within the Cabinet Office in May 2009 to co-ordinate work
across Government and to ensure that the appropriate standards of
resilience were in place across all sectors. My hon. Friend the Member
for Stroud asked what was being done in the water sector and I will
address that point in a moment.</div>
<a name="10011984000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Cabinet
Office&#146;s critical infrastructure resilience programme is working
right across Government to identify the risks to other critical
infrastructure from flooding and other natural hazards. Action will
then be taken to ensure that measures to improve the resilience of
critical infrastructure are put in place before a hazardous incident
occurs. That includes examining the balance between improving
resilience and contingency planning to maintain the security and
continuity of services.</div>
<a name="10011984000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">To give the
Committee an idea of how much has been done, the Cabinet Office has
screened nearly 1,000 critical infrastructure sites for
flood risk. It has identified 171 sites across the nine
sectors of national infrastructure that could be flooded by rivers or
the sea. By the way, the number of such sites in the water sector is
the highest for any of those nine sectors, with the number in the
energy sector the second highest.</div>
<a name="10011984000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
mentioned before, the lead Government Departments are preparing a
sector resilience plan for each of those nine sectors to examine the
vulnerability to flooding of those 171 sites and to identify what
actions are needed to improve resilience to disruption from natural
hazards. That work is being co-ordinated by the natural hazards
team.</div><a name="10011984000360"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000456"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister provides some reassurance in saying
that national attention is being paid, finally, to critical
infrastructure. However, when he mentions statistics such as 1,000
nationwide and 171 sites vulnerable to flooding, he reinforces
my impression that there will be not nearly enough detail. I do not
imagine that things such as the bridges in Cumbria that turned out to
be so vital; district general hospitals; and critical communications,
which the hon. Member for Tewkesbury emphasised as being important,
will be addressed. The local knowledge required to look comprehensively
at the resilience of critical infrastructure is surely a vital
addition. That would translate immediately into the emergency response
because when an emergency happens, gold command is based among local
authorities and
agencies.</div><a name="10011984000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000457"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his
intervention. He has anticipated a point that I was coming to. He made
an important point about bridges 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>and locally important infrastructure. As we saw in Cumbria, there is a
significant impact when such things go down. I will come to that
point.</div><a name="10011984000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the comment by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud, I will
give an overview of the 1,000 critical infrastructure sites
and the 171 sites across the nine sectors. In the energy sector, 14
sites have been identified; there are 17 for the emergency services, 14
in communications and 63 for water. As I said, we will shortly bring
forward the sector resilience plans and give more details of those
sites. We will say what work has been done with the water companies and
Ofwat to identify the actions that emanate from the identification of
the sites. We are not in a position to reveal that today, but we will
bring it forward in short order as a result of the work we have been
doing.</div><a name="10011984000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000458"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> On that point, is there always agreement? As part of
an agreement that a piece of infrastructure is at risk, is there a
contingency to ensure that there is always some way for the provision
of services in the area to be defended, even if there is no change in
the logistical
location?</div><a name="10011984000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000459"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Absolutely. That is a very good point. The
work I have been involved in and that will be revealed shortly, for
example in Mythe, deals not only with the increase in temporary
barriers and what further work can be done, but with where sites have
interlinkages and where there is transferability of services from one
place to another. For example, we are considering how we can ensure
that there is sourcing of energy from other areas if one area is
affected by an energy shutdown. The same applies to water supply. I
assure my hon. Friend that that is part and parcel of our approach to
resilience. It is not simply to do with putting barriers around things
that are identified as critically vulnerable, but with where water
companies and energy suppliers have said that they can relay
transmission.</div><a name="10011984000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was asked what is being done at the moment. We have not been waiting. I
reiterate that these are just some examples from different sectors. In
east Hull and west Hull, there are sewage pumping stations where flood
defences have been provided in response to the 2007 floods. At the Hull
waste water treatment works, there are defences against a
one-in-200-year flood event. In Exeter, the electricity distributor has
replaced the switchgear in the substation and elevated the new
installation above the level of potential flood waters. Fire and rescue
services in Humberside have raised the IT and communications equipment
1.5 metres above ground level to ensure the continuity of service. The
National Grid has invested over &#163;1 million in flood defences,
including on a 1.2 km temporary flood defence barrier that can be
deployed when there are threats of flooding, similar to that used at
the Walham substation in
2007.</div><a name="10011984000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to the point raised, rightly, by the hon. Member for Cheltenham
on the assets identified locally on the ground, I can confirm, if we
take the example of bridges and other infrastructure of such vital
importance, that they are covered by the work of the natural hazards
team at the Cabinet Office, as I have just mentioned. They are also
included in some of the work on critical infrastructure. For example,
Network Rail has assessed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div>its bridges that are over water for scour damage. They are part and
parcel of those considerations, so we do not ignore those
assets.</div>
<a name="10011984000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000460"></a>Jessica
Morden:</b> I appreciate the Minister&#146;s giving way, as
he has done so many times today. I would like reassurance on that point
before he moves on. In constituencies such as mine, which has seven
bridges, the Swansea to Paddington railway line and cross-border issues
relating to electricity and sewerage works, will he reassure me that
there will be full discussions with the Welsh Assembly Government about
some of those cross-border issues, particularly with regard to
transport
links?</div><a name="10011984000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000461"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Absolutely. I can give my hon. Friend a
categorical assurance that that already takes place within the Cabinet
Office discussions, which include the input from the Welsh Assembly
Government.</div><a name="10011984000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000462"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> The Minister does not seem to have responded to
my remarks that they are woefully behind their schedule on critical
infrastructure and on the hazards team. I commend their work, but they
should have reported by spring
2009.</div><a name="10011984000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000463"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I understand the hon. Lady&#146;s point.
The review of Pitt progress provided in December, which I am sure all
Members have read, did show significant progress across a range of
areas, but that area required further work, and I acknowledge that. It
is pointless to say that we have delivered everything on it. The work
undertaken shows that we are clearly progressing extremely well, and
the sector resilience plans are well progressed. I hope to make a
further statement on everything that has been done. I take the hon.
Lady&#146;s point, but it is not as if we have done no work in that
regard.</div>
<a name="10011984000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000464"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Is not the Minister underlining the limits of
centralisation? He is trying to list a load of things in Exeter and so
on, but the scale of what has to be done and the number of
responsibilities, many of which do not relate to Government, such as
the responsibilities of water companies, the National Grid and other
private owners, show that that would be much more effectively done if
there was a focus on carrying it out at the local level, because that
would result in much more comprehensive attention to detail, based on
local knowledge. It cannot all be done by
Government.</div><a name="10011984000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000465"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman.
In fact, just to clarify, the local resilience forums, which play such
a pivotal role, have a key role in considering the risk to local
infrastructure and contingency planning. They include all the key local
bodies, including local authorities, NHS trusts, which he mentioned,
and emergency services. For example, the Workington bridge will not
have been categorised as national critical infrastructure, but the
local resilience forum has identified it, and that is how it will work,
so the local resilience forums can bring forward parts of the
infrastructure because, as he is right to say, the local input is
absolutely imperative.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div><a name="10011984000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s commission for the protection of national
infrastructure will work, as I have mentioned, with the operators of
essential services and lead Departments to identify and help protect
critical national infrastructure against security threats.</div>
<a name="10011984000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
question put by the hon. Member for Vale of York on what would help
households know the best way to spend money to build in flood
resilience, we are currently doing research on flood resilience and
guidance. Following that, we will consult this spring on new guidance
on flood resilience. I have discussed with her, the hon. Member for
Cheltenham and others the need to do more on that and on
flood-resilient building standards. That is in advance of, and in
addition to, longer-term consultation on possible regulatory changes
that will help deliver greater awareness, as will the Environment
Agency schemes we fund to install flood products. I will return to that
point
shortly.</div><a name="10011984000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 6, tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham, would impose a
requirement on the Secretary of State to amend the code for sustainable
homes to ensure that new homes are built with regard to flood
resilience&#151;the point that I just touched on. I recognise that
the objective of the new clause is to get new homes built with
appropriate flood resilience. I will expand on this in some detail.
However, we believe that as a result of PPS25, which we discussed
previously&#151;I do not want to go over that issue in its broad
context&#151;we already have a clear policy framework in place to
deliver it. PPS25 is clear that for developments where there is a
residual risk of flooding, local authorities should consider how the
design should incorporate flood resilience. It then points to guidance
issued jointly by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs, by the Department for Communities and Local Government and by
the Environment Agency on building in flood
resilience.</div><a name="10011984000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
of the Committee will be interested to know that in respect of Cumbria,
the Association of British Insurers has revised and refreshed the
guidance that it is issuing to all householders. It has strengthened
the guidance on resilience repair and made clear to individual
householders the potential benefits and cost savings on their insurance
if they take up the issues. I will go into further detail on that as
well.</div>
<a name="10011984000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further to
that, as I will explain shortly the Government are also considering how
flood resilience and resistance might be improved in the building
regulations for new buildings and repairs to existing homes. In
practice, the code for sustainable homes is already aligned with PPS25,
as it encourages development in low flood risk areas and promotes
measures to reduce the impact of flooding in higher-risk
areas.</div>
<a name="10011984000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000466"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> The Minister may be coming to it, but there is
the issue of the new houses themselves being flood-resistant. Also,
there is the need to avoid water run-off on to other areas&#151;the
water displacement. Will that be included in the
assessment?</div><a name="10011984000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000467"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Again, the hon. Gentleman anticipates a
point that I am coming to. It is a good point. However, let me work my
way towards it, because I am trying to string together a lot of points
with a broad rationale.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div><a name="10011984000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I was saying, the code for sustainable homes is already aligned with
PPS25 in practice. Although homes built with public money are required
to be built to code level 3, for private house builders the code is
voluntary. Given that we have no plans to make building to the code
mandatory, an amendment to the code would not necessarily deliver the
assurance that new homes would be built with flood resilience, which is
what the hon. Member seeks.</div>
<a name="10011984000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn
to the code for sustainable homes.</div>
<a name="10011984000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000468"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister is kind. It makes sense if one is in
favour&#151;as we are&#151;of making the code
mandatory.</div>
<a name="10011984000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000469"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Yes, okay. Let me expand further. As the
hon. Gentleman mentioned earlier, there is more than one way to skin
this particular
cat.</div><a name="10011984000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Flood
risk is addressed in the Sur 2 element of the code for sustainable
homes. This aims to encourage housing development in low flood risk
areas or to take measures to reduce the impact of flooding on houses
built in areas with a medium or high risk of flooding. In a code
assessment, two credits are available for developments situated in zone
1, which is a low annual probability of flooding and where the
site-specific flood risk assessment indicates that there is a low risk
of flooding from all sources. One credit is available for developments
situated in zones 2 and 3a, which are medium and high annual
probability of flooding, where the finished ground floor of all
habitable parts of dwellings and access routes to the ground level and
the site are placed at least 600 mm above the design flood level of the
flood zone. The flood risk assessment accompanying the planning
application must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the local planning
authority and statutory body that the development is appropriately
flood resilient and resistant, including safe access and escape routes
where required, and that any residual risk can be safely
managed.</div><a name="10011984000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me consider whether we should have a mandatory code. Mandatory
standards for construction of new homes are laid down in the building
regulations. The code is only effectively mandatory for publicly funded
housing&#151;I know that the hon. Gentleman would say make it
mandatory for everything. If it were decided that resilience standards
should be made mandatory, the right place to include them would be the
building regulations. I will return to that in a moment. The Government
have made a commitment to consider including resilience standards in
the building
regulations.</div><a name="10011984000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
preparation for a wider public consultation as part of the review for
the changes due in 2013, we will consult in the spring on issues that
might be reflected in future flood performance standards for new
buildings and repairs and how they might be incorporated in the
building regulations. It is a valid point. In Cumbria, Hull,
Gloucester&#151;indeed, everywhere&#151;we have seen that some of
the simple building resilience measures that can be introduced into
homes make a huge difference.</div>
<a name="10011984000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, when
those measures are coupled with flood warnings, what I saw on the
ground in Cumbria&#151;and what I am sure the hon. Member for Vale of
York saw when she visited Wales&#151;was that the work of the local
flood forum was combined with the advanced flood warnings that were
given. That work was then combined with the actions of people in
Keswick or elsewhere, who had put basic, simple flood resilience
measures in their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div>homes. Those factors made a material difference,
first, to the damage sustained in the property and people&#146;s
ability to get back into their house in a couple of days rather than
months and, secondly, to people&#146;s insurance premium in future.
When those things are pulled together, they make
sense.</div><a name="10011984000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me go on to what I think we can do, which relates to Government new
clause 28. The hon. Member for Vale of York also tabled new clause 18,
which would require the Environment Agency to report annually on flood
warnings, individual property measures and insurance. I thank her for
raising that issue. We already provide in clause 18 for the EA to
report more widely and for Ministers to set the time scales and the
contents of the report. So Ministers will be able to specify that sort
of issue, including the matters that she has identified in the
amendment. It should be noted that the EA already reports on flood
warning as part of its corporate score card, which is published on the
board as part of its website. Ministers discuss that with
the EA in detailas well.</div>
<a name="10011984000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
also referred to flood warnings and opt-out. As hon. Members know, the
EA is producing a roll-out of the strategy for improved flood warning.
We have come on a lot, but we still need to encourage the take-up and
so on. Of course, the flood warnings are targeted; they are not
general, including in parts of Cumbria. Flood warnings were not issued
everywhere in Cumbria; they were targeted at those areas identified to
be at risk of flooding. Let me give something of an update on that. The
report on Pitt that we published in December made it clear that the
work we have been doing on the opt-out approach&#151;recommendation
62 of Pitt&#151;will be completed by February 2010, when our thoughts
on that will be made tangible and real.</div>
<a name="10011984000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Vale of York also tabled new clause 19, which would provide
for a power for the Secretary of State to make an order to require
annual reports from the British Standards Institution on flood
resistance products. The measure would require such reports to be laid
before Parliament and approved by each House. Ensuring that individual
residents have complete confidence in the products they are using is an
issue&#151;I acknowledge that. To gain the BSI kitemark, products
have to undergo rigorous testing to demonstrate that they can provide
effective property-level flood protection. Information about businesses
holding the kitemark is also available on the BSI
website&#151;www.kitemark.com. However, let me expand on the
issue.</div>
<a name="10011984000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The kitemark
scheme is a British standards accreditation scheme for products. People
will be very familiar with British standards accreditation. In the case
of flood protection products, accreditation is given to those who
comply with publicly available specification&#151;PAS&#151;1188. To
gain the BSI kitemark, products must undergo rigorous testing to
demonstrate that they can provide effective property-level flood
protection.</div><a name="10011984000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
working group that includes representatives from flood resilience
product manufacturers, the Flood Protection Association, the
Association of British Insurers, insurance companies, DEFRA and HR
Wallingford has recently assessed the current BSI kitemark scheme for
flood protection products. Its conclusion was that the kitemarking
scheme is necessary to ensure product quality compliance
and as a result it was reissued last April. So the
group 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div>has confidence that the scheme is right. However, it
is also important to say that we will keep an eye on the matter to
ensure that the right products are being used in the right situations.
That is key. We have a good grip on quality assurance and on the
products, but the other aspect is to ensure that the advice given on
the ground either by the ABI or its members to individual householders
means that people are using the right product in the right
place.</div><a name="10011984000292"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000470"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I hope that the Minister agrees that it should
not be for parliamentarians to say what is the right or wrong product.
I applaud the working group.</div>
<a name="10011984000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000471"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b>
Indeed.</div><a name="10011984000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000472"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I would, however, like the Minister to address
two issues. When the guidance is followed and the kitemark is issued
but the product fails, what right of redress does the consumer have? Is
the insurance industry minded to reflect in its premiums or excesses
the fact that the investment has been
made?</div><a name="10011984000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000473"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> On the latter point, I am encouraged at
the moment because the ABI has revisited and revised its guidance on
the back of the Cumbrian floods, and its current guidance acknowledges
that if someone appropriately fits flood resilience products in their
house, it could have an effect on insurance premiums. That is
important, but there is wider work to be done, not just on resilience
but on the role of the various partners&#151;the Government, the ABI,
local flood forums, and others&#151;in jointly stepping up to the
mark, and on how we properly promote the level of expertise regarding
the right product in the right place. We are considering some sort of
pilot project based on Cumbria, which would look at what is happening
on the ground&#151;with information going out, resilience products
being fitted and, interestingly&#151;the behavioural response of
individual householders. When people are offered resilience products,
do they go for those products or is their desire to have an appropriate
local builder in? The response of individual householders is an
important
factor.</div><a name="10011984000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Powers
in the Building Act 1984 allow regulations to be made to cover
resilience or resistance in respect of new buildings or major
alterations. They do not allow for similar provisions in respect of
most types of minor repair work, for example, requiring simple things
such as the replacement of flood-damaged plaster with more resilient
plaster, or electrical sockets to be moved up the wall in the
likelihood of future floods. Amending schedule 1 of the 1984
Act in that way would ensure that building regulations could be made in
relation to any type of flood resilience and resistance work to a
building. We remain committed to considering the potential for
regulating for flood resilience and resistance, and we will consult in
the spring. At the same time, we plan to consult on additional guidance
to boost what is already published to help those seeking to build in
flood resilience. That guidance can then be consulted when dealing with
planning permissions to ensure that development incorporates flood
resilience when
necessary.</div><a name="10011984000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should make it clear on new clause 28 that any subsequent regulation
under the power created by that Government amendment will have to be
based on a thorough understanding of the costs and benefits of
different flood resilience and resistance measures.
To be justified, regulation is likely to have to be targeted on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 267</div>the basis of a cost-benefit analysis. One would not
necessarily simply want to say to every householder, &#147;You have
to do x, y and z regardless&#148;. I would not, therefore, like to
predict exactly how any subsequent regulation might be framed, but our
commitment is clear. Similarly, in advance of further detailed work to
establish a better understanding of the costs and benefits of different
approaches, I would not want to commit the Government to regulation.
However, the amendment offers a useful additional power to the
Government to regulate for flood resistance and resilience, if the
further work that we are undertaking demonstrates a clear need to do
so.</div><a name="10011984000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Vale of York raised the issue of the consumer having
recourse if one of the products goes wrong. If a product fails, under
existing legislation, the consumer might have a claim against the
manufacturer, if the product has been correctly installed&#151;that
is the key issue. The additional guidance on flood resilience will also
help raise awareness of how to build in proper and appropriate flood
resilience.</div><a name="10011984000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli rightly raised the detail of the
regulations. Some local authorities are already starting to record
information, and we are working with the Environment Agency to ensure
that the appropriate tools and systems are available to them. I will
write with more detail on that. The register will allow a better
understanding of how flood risk is managed, particularly local risk,
and it will feed into the surface water management plans. Also, just to
clarify matters, the Bill requires a register and a record to be
maintained, so it will indeed, as part and parcel of that, be updated
as well. That is the future-proofing element to which my hon. Friend
referred.</div><a name="10011984000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will now consider the comments on mapping made by the hon. Member for
Norwich, North. The flood risk regulations implementing the flood
directive provide for collation of assessment, mapping and risk
management plans for all sources of flood risk, and will incorporate
outputs from surface water management plans. Any confusion over
responsibility will be resolved by the lead local authority under
clause 19, which we discussed earlier.</div>
<a name="10011984000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of
how the national parks and the Broads Authority fit into the picture,
it is a good question. They are not risk management authorities, but we
have taken the power under clause 29 to add, if we are so minded,
them&#151;or other bodies&#151;as bodies which must have regard to
strategies under clause 11, or clause 12 for the national parks in
Wales.</div><a name="10011984000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
those detailed comments I ask hon. Members to consider withdrawing the
amendment and, when the time comes, supporting new clause
28.</div><a name="10011984000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000474"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am encouraged by the Minister&#146;s remarks.
I am not sure he entirely addresses the wide-ranging nature of
amendment 106. There is quite a lot more to it than building
regulations, and the critical infrastructure issues are wide-ranging. I
hear what he was saying about the way in which local resilience forums
are looking at critical infrastructure, and the way that interacts with
national action. I suppose we must hope that that process will have the
same kind of effect that we were trying to have through
amendment 106.</div>
<a name="10011984000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased
that the Government have tabled new clause 28. That genuinely seems to
open the door to legislative action to make a real difference to the
resilience 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>of individual properties&#151;at least, new properties. That seems to
me quite a significant step and I am prepared to welcome that. On that
basis, I will not push my amendments to a
vote.</div><a name="10011984000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011984000475"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> We have had a very good debate, and I
congratulate all my colleagues and thank them for the interest that
they have shown. I think the amendments&#151;certainly amendment
107&#151;could potentially be complementary to our new
clauses.</div><a name="10011984000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mindful
of your strictures, Mr. Chope, that I must make any comments
on stand part, I would just like to make two comments on clause 21. We
are wedded to the fact that the local community should be the master in
the Peak district, and that subsection (1)(a) refers to a register
guided by</div>
<a name="10011984000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the opinion of
the
authority&#148;.</div><a name="10011984000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
this would obtain local support. However, subsection (2) undermines
this&#151;possibly unnecessarily&#151;by encouraging the Minister
to</div>
<a name="10011984000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make provision
about the content of the
register&#148;.</div><a name="10011984000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would
the Minister therefore be minded&#151;possibly at a later
stage&#151;to drop subsection
(2):</div><a name="10011984000351"></a>&#147;The
Minister may by regulations make provision about the content of the
register and
record.&#148;<a name="10011984000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely
we must trust the local authorities to do their bit. That is part of
our agenda of localism and trusting local communities, and we feel it
could be undermined. We have some sympathy with the comments made about
that by the Local Government Flood
Forum.</div><a name="10011984000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
appeals process, which was mentioned earlier, is crucial here. If we
put down a marker now, would the Government be minded to extend the
appeals process, at a later stage, against the detail of enforcement
notice, as well as allowing an appeal against the notice itself? It
would be interesting if the Minister moved in that direction. I welcome
the Minister&#146;s comments and I thank him for speaking at
length.</div><a name="10011984000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will obviously consider new clauses 17, 18 and 19 further. However, we
want to press amendment 26 to a vote.</div>
