<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000108"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> Thank you, Mr. O&#146;Hara. It is a
pleasure to discuss this part of the Bill. I am pleased that the
amendments have been grouped together. We are minded, like a lot of
stakeholders, to support quality accounts. The amendments are probing
amendments to find out from the Government exactly what the quality
accounts will look like. Sadly, a lot of the detail is likely to be
covered in secondary legislation.</div>
<a name="09061847000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stakeholders,
such as the NHS Confederation, the King&#146;s Fund, Help the Aged
and others are concerned about the lack of detail. In fact, the
King&#146;s Fund believes that the publication will be relatively
passive in its form and will not give the public the accountability of
quality that we are looking for. Looking back to the Maidstone debacle
and the shameful events that took place in Mid Staffordshire NHS
Foundation Trust, the quality of the accounts that the public can see
is important, as I am sure the Minister agrees. Amendments 87 and 156
would develop exactly who will be responsible for publishing quality
accounts. The phrase &#147;not limited to&#148; is self-explanatory
about where we are coming
from.</div><a name="09061847000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
support Liberal Democrat amendment 169. It is important that data that
could be used in other areas of public analysis are available. In
recent years, we have not seen data on injuries within hospitals. For
example, it is difficult for us, when tabling parliamentary questions,
to find out from trusts the exact type of injuries dealt with by A and
E departments. It is imperative that such 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>information is available. I have tabled the amendment to urge the
Minister to develop exactly who quality accounts will be limited
to.</div><a name="09061847000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061847000109"></a><b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): We, too, welcome the general idea of
quality accounts but, to be useful, we must ensure that the information
has a purpose and is not just another data collection exercise with no
meaningful use. The accounts will have more credibility if the public
can see that the information is put to good use. I welcome the
Conservative amendments. They would widen the scope of quality accounts
and make them more flexible in the
future.</div><a name="09061847000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to discuss amendment 169. Before being approached by the Royal
Society for the Prevention of Accidents, I had not realised that the
United Kingdom used to be a world leader in injury surveillance. It had
much useful data on how many people were hurt in accidents, what they
were doing at the time and what products might have been involved. The
data were used to analyse trends. Obviously if one is analysing trends,
one should then take steps to ensure that there are no such accidents
in the future.</div>
<a name="09061847000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until 2002
the Department of Trade and Industry collected that data, but when the
Department was reformed as the Department for Business, Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform&#151;there has obviously been another
reorganisation since then&#151;the data were no longer collected. The
amendment is a probing amendment to see whether there is any facility
to use the quality accounts, which might be collecting some of that
data anyway, to reinstate injury data collection, so that once again
the UK can be at the forefront of data collection, analysis and the
prevention of
accidents.</div><a name="09061847000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000110"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. Mike
O'Brien):</b> Essentially, what we have here is the collection
of information and its publication for a particular purpose. That
purpose is not only to inform people but to ensure a focus on quality.
That arises out of the review by my noble Friend Lord Darzi into high
quality care for all. He determined that quality relates to three
&#147;domains&#148;&#151;patient safety, effectiveness of care,
and patient experience. I wish to set out what we mean by that and say
something more generally about the quality accounts, so that hopefully
people have a clear picture of our purpose and of why we are focusing
on quality, and understand therefore why we cannot accept the
amendments. I appreciate and am grateful for the indication from the
official Opposition both that they support the concept of quality
accounts and that the amendments are probing ones, designed to elicit
more information about the nature of quality
accounts.</div><a name="09061847000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to develop quality accounts to see whether the focus in the
&#147;High Quality Care for All&#148; review is being used by
organisations in the health service. That means that they are, for
example, protecting patient safety by eradicating health care-acquired
infections and avoidable accidents. It is about the effectiveness of
care, from the clinical procedure that the patient receives to their
quality of life after treatment, and it is about the patient&#146;s
entire experience of the NHS, ensuring that they are treated with
compassion, dignity and respect in a clean, safe and well-managed
environment.</div>
<a name="09061847000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are the
three key areas that we want to focus on, and we intend quality
accounts to contain a core  of nationally determined quality
indicators, so that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div>comparisons can be made between providers. It is important that like can
be compared with like, in respect of that core. The greater part of
each quality account, however, will be determined locally, to ensure
that providers can publish information that is relevant to the type of
health care services that they provide, to the locally identified
priorities for clinical improvement and to patients and other members
of the public in their
area.</div><a name="09061847000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000111"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> The key here is public confidence in the data
that are being published. While I am a localist politician, I am
concerned about public confidence, because if there are problems in a
trust&#151;we all know that that happens; the Mid Staffordshire trust
was a great example&#151;in the main, as the Minister has just
indicated, it is up to the trust to decide who publishes what
information about
what.</div><a name="09061847000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000112"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> One key thing we need to do is ensure that data
that are published are not just left out there, unverified. It will be
the responsibility of the Care Quality Commission to ensure that the
data are looked at and conform to the data that it has about that
hospital. If there are problems with the data in a report, correction
within 21 days can be required. The hon. Gentleman is right. If we are
to focus on quality, we need to assure the public&#151;as far as we
can ever rely on the expression of an opinion by an
organisation&#151;that it is as reliable as it reasonably can be. We
are concerned that it should not focus just on the things that we have
focused on in the past such as particular targets&#151; 18
weeks and others. This is looking at something different&#151;the
quality, not the quantity, of the care that is provided. We also want
to ensure that a quality account, which will be locally determined,
puts quality care at the forefront. By high quality care, we mean care
that is beyond the minimum set by the
regulator.</div><a name="09061847000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is not just about saying a particular target has been hit. In order to
manage the NHS and get a return on the money going into it, we have
sought to set basic standards with which everyone has to comply. We are
now, with quality accounts, looking at something quite different. This
is not about hitting minimum standards, although that will still be
relevant, because if people are not doing so it will come out in other
reports such as those by the CQC. We are now asking hospitals and other
NHS institutions to look at what they do well. That involves two
things: identifying who is performing at a very high quality level in
particular areas and then comparing the best in different areas. It is
not about minimums: it is about the best and how to keep the pressure
on to push the best to be better; it is about making the reasonably
good, good; and it is about making the good even better and excellent.
It is also about testing those who are excellent to see whether they
can push themselves further. They will have to say not only what they
are good at but also what further improvements over time they want to
see. We know that the medical teams that forge ahead and provide
quality and excellence in the NHS are those that measure their
performance, and the best are often well above minimum standards. They
measure how well they are doing for their own purposes, but until now
nobody has taken particular notice, because people think, &#147;They
are above the minimum. We need not worry.&#148; But how do we make
everyone perform to the highest level that they can? Quality accounts
are part of that process.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div><a name="09061847000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061847000113"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): I welcome the purpose
of getting the maximum possible, but I am concerned about the minimum.
I am concerned, for example, about elderly people who are in hospitals,
who have nowhere to go, who cannot go home because they cannot look
after themselves and who are not sent to less significant units. This
happens right across the country, not just in my constituency. In most
parts of the country there is something wrong every so often&#151;not
frequently, not all the time, but regularly. That fact is neglected,
and I would like to hear more about how the minimum is achieved, before
we get to the maximum.</div>
<a name="09061847000083"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="09061847000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000114"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point
and he is right that the minimum is important. As the hon. Member for
Hemel Hempstead has indicated, we saw the outcome of events at Mid
Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, where various tests on the trust
did not pick up the poor quality of treatment. Therefore, we need to
ensure that we examine the minimum standards as well. An organisation
that looks at minimum standards of care blew the whistle on what was
happening at Mid Staffordshire. We have checks in place through the
Care Quality Commission and, if the organisation in question is a
foundation trust, through Monitor, to some extent. Such bodies need to
ensure that the quality of basic standards is examined. The NHS Choices
database is available to the public, who can look in detail at how
hospitals and other NHS institutions are performing and at the quality
of different teams to ensure that they are doing what they are obliged
to do. Checks are there, and the minimum standards will be dealt by the
CQC with its new enforcement powers, which start in April 2010 for
acute trusts. A core CQC registration will  form part of the
quality accounts, so there are ways of doing
it.</div><a name="09061847000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
point is that, as important as it is to ensure that minimum standards
are hit and maintained, it is also important to go beyond that and
recognise that the NHS is not about minimum standards.
We&#151;millions of us throughout the country&#151;do not pay taxes
for the NHS to get the minimum possible standards in a hospital; we
expect those standards. We want hospitals that push to get the best and
the highest quality, and where excellence is important. Across the NHS,
there are people, medical teams and practitioners who are dedicated to
excellence and who, until now, have not been measured and
congratulated. Doing that will show that the NHS cares about
excellence. The NHS talks a lot about excellence but does not measure
it, which is what quality accounts are
about.</div><a name="09061847000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
local part of those quality accounts enables local involvement networks
to let the hospital or other institution know what they want the
quality accounts to measure, providing it is about quality. That is
what we want to focus on, and it is the agenda that we are pursuing.
Providers will have the freedom and the responsibility to decide what
goes into the local part of quality accounts. However, we need to
stipulate that quality accounts are about quality, which is why clause
8 refers specifically
to</div><a name="09061847000079"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;information
relevant to the quality of...NHS
services&#148;.</div><a name="09061847000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
that reason, amendments 87 and 156 are not the way that we want to
go.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div><a name="09061847000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, I
understand the concerns raised by the hon. Member for Romsey, who is
not in her place. I agree entirely that there needs to be a robust
collection of data on the type of injuries that cause people to be
admitted to hospital in the first place. However, such information is
not within the scope of the quality account, because that information
is, in effect, about quantity, and it measures something else. The
information in the quality account must be relevant to the quality of a
particular provider&#146;s care. Data on the causes of admission,
such as personal injuries, are available through other means.
Information on accident and emergency attendance, for example, is
collected as part of the hospital episodes statistics database, and it
is already available on the information centre&#146;s
website.</div><a name="09061847000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Statistics
show that there is a remarkable appetite for information about health
issues. Figures for the NHS Choices website show that around 5 million
people visit that site each month, with total visits occasionally
reaching around 7 million a month. Given the number of people in this
country, those figures are extraordinary, and I think that, when
quality accounts are made available, we will see the public&#146;s
appetite to see the quality of provision available in their local
hospital.</div><a name="09061847000033"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000115"></a>Mr.
Andrew Turner:</b> How many areas will be visited each year,
and how many of those will be top rank? It would be helpful if we had
some idea of what the Minister expects for this year or next. Also, how
many of those visits will involve the whole of an NHS trust, and how
many of them will involve operations, some of which may be less good,
within an NHS
trust?</div><a name="09061847000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000116"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> We have an idea of the quality of some trusts
through knowing about those that are hitting basic standards and
through reports published in relation to inspections by CQC and its
predecessor bodies, so we have some ability to assess the quality by
which a trust performs its services. Information on individual medical
teams and the extent to which components of trusts, which is what the
hon. Gentleman has asked about, are performing to the highest
standards, is less available, although there are some data in relation
to that on the NHS Choices
website.</div><a name="09061847000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have no doubt that within the medical profession, a consultant knows
whether another consultant at a hospital down the road is better and
who is the best at a particular speciality in the country. Such
information is available in the medical press, no doubt, but we want to
provide accessible information to the public, so that they can see a
relatively brief report reasonably easily. We have made it clear that
we do not want lengthy, unreadable documents, because they are intended
for members of the public, who will be able to see the quality
delivered by, and the performance of, their local NHS organisation.
More than that, we want the public to see the improvements that an
organisation wants to make to the way in which it delivers quality
during the coming year and in the
future.</div><a name="09061847000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will be a fair amount of freedom for the various organisations to say
what they want to look at or whether they have a particular specialism.
There might be a specialist team in orthopaedics, and it will be able
to say, &#147;We have got a medical team that is able to do something
like this. It is not being done anywhere 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>else in the country, we are at the forefront.&#148; Such organisations
will be able to advertise the areas in which they are the best, but
they will also have to indicate areas where they are mediocre and state
what they plan to do about it. An organisation might be above the
minimum standard and pass tests by delivering what it needs to deliver,
but it still might not match the best. It must say how it will improve
over the coming years and what it is delivering in terms of patient
quality. Patient quality is not a general concept; it has been set out
my noble Friend Lord Darzi in his report, and we want to focus on it as
something that the NHS will seek to deliver over the coming decade or
more.</div><a name="09061847000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will tell the story going back over the past 10 years. At the start of
the decade, we recognised that there was a problem of underfunding and
understaffing in the NHS&#151;we had recognised that before, but we
always had expenditure constraints. At that point, we started to put
funding in, and we used the basic tool of targets in order to see what
return we were getting. In the second tranche of change, we recognised
that we had to go beyond merely putting in more money and setting
targets for delivery and that there needed to be fundamental reforms in
the NHS
organisation.</div><a name="09061847000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
we went through a period of NHS reform. It was very painful and
involved reconfiguration, the reorganisation of some NHS structures and
trying out different ways of doing that until we felt that we had
reached a system that could enable the delivery of better quality
administration in the NHS. We think that we have broadly arrived at
that, and we do not plan significant further administrative
changes.</div>
<a name="09061847000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now need
to move to the next stage, which is where quality accounts will take
us. The review by my noble Friend Lord Darzi focused on the issue of
improved quality, so we have gone through a period of dealing with
underfunding, understaffing and the necessary administrative changes,
and we are now moving on to look at improving the quality of what the
NHS does. It is a step-by-step improvement and in due course, as we
fulfil the quality agenda, I hope that we will see an improvement in
the quality of what we, as taxpayers and patients, get from the
NHS.</div>
<a name="09061847000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
the issue of core accounts is at the centre of that vision for the
future of the NHS and the next stage in improving it. I appreciate that
the Opposition amendments are primarily probing amendments, and I hope
that we will be able to acknowledge the importance of quality accounts
and understand what they propose to do. I therefore hope that
Opposition Members will not press their
amendments.</div><a name="09061847000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061847000117"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Horam</b> (Orpington) (Con): May I probe the Minister a
little further on how he will organise this? I understand that the
thinking might not have got down to this level yet, but as I understand
it, he is trying to elevate quality accounts to the same level as
financial accounts. There would be financial accounts and equality
accounts at an equal level, just as many organisations have elevated
environmental accounts to the same level as financial accounts,
and report on them in the same way.</div>
<a name="09061847000078"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">In the
case of financial accounts, there is a clear historic structure. There
is a finance director to whom people report, and there is a clear,
understandable procedure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>that is followed every year and is understood by everybody. In this
case, we are in relatively untrodden territory, as the Minister has
admitted to some extent. We are even dealing with questions that are
not simply about target setting, check lists and waiting times, but
that concern rather more intangible things such as the nature of care
and the compassion that is shown, which are much more difficult to
measure. Who will be responsible for that in any organisation, whether
it is a primary care trust or hospital trust? Will that responsibility
be put specifically on the clinical director&#146;s shoulders, or
will it lie with the operations director or the chief executive? In my
experience, organisations and institutions do not work well unless
there are specific, clear responsibilities. Obviously, quality goes
right across the board. Everyone is concerned about quality in a
hospital or primary care trust, but, none the less, someone will be
collecting the information and pushing the agenda along. Has there been
any thinking on
that?</div><a name="09061847000084"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000118"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I agree with the key thrust of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s points. We do not aim to create a new bureaucracy or
a pile of information that needs to be collected to ensure that we can
provide quality accounts. Much of the data that will be in quality
accounts are available now. Currently, trusts provide the CQC with data
about what they are doing, so that the CQC can look at the overall
quality of what they are doing and can do its regular
reports.</div>
<a name="09061847000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, the data
are provided to the CQC, rather than the public, and the CQC will
periodically do a report based on some of those data. We want to make
sure that those data are more readily accessible and available, as far
as the core national data on quality are concerned, in a readable form
for the public. Then, local NHS organisations will have particular data
available to them, which they can measure themselves and can choose to
put out there too. We hope that will lead to a focus on what they want
to specialise in and where they can make a particular contribution to
the
NHS.</div><a name="09061847000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked who will be responsible, and that will vary
through the NHS. In a hospital, the trust board will be responsible for
the data that are out there. If they are medical data, the board will
want to, and will be obliged to, consult the clinical director to make
sure that the quality of those data are appropriate. In the end, the
buck will stop with the board and with those who are legally
responsible for the information that the trust puts out. That
information will not just be out there unchecked. The CQC, which has
much of that information anyway, will be able to say that some of it is
not accurate. With local data, the CQC may say, &#147;Let&#146;s
have a look at these data, because we want to find out the basis on
which you have claimed that you&#146;re producing at this level of
quality.&#148; If it found that the quality levels and the data
backing them up were not sound enough, the trust or other organisation
could be required to change
them.</div><a name="09061847000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000119"></a>Mr.
Horam:</b> So, it will be up to the trust in question to
decide which member of staff is responsible for collecting and
monitoring that information and presenting it to the board. I agree
that the board is ultimately responsible, but there must be someone
inside the organisation, below the board, who collates all the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>information and presents it to the board, just as a finance director
collects all the accounts and presents them to the
board.</div>
<a name="09061847000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000120"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Clinical data are currently collected in any
event, and I do not envisage that someone will get a new job on quality
accounts. There will already be people who provide that information,
and it will probably vary between the trusts who they decide should be
responsible for delivering the text of a quality account. I am less
concerned about that, and more concerned that, however they do it, we
need to have quality accounts that the public can read and understand,
and that are not too cumbersome or indigestible. They should be
reliable and verifiable by outside organisations and they should give a
clear picture of the quality of what is being
delivered.</div><a name="09061847000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the end, the people on the trust board, in the case of a hospital, for
example, will be responsible. They will have procedures for making
particular individuals responsible for particular aspects of the
quality account. That will be a decision for them&#151;we are not
trying to top-down manage this. They will appoint clinical directors,
there are good governance procedures which trusts are well aware
of&#151;some more than others. The governance procedures are out
there and they are well known. So there will be ways in which the data
will be collected and the appropriate people will be held
responsible.</div><a name="09061847000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000121"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I want to clarify a couple of points before the
Minister comes to his conclusion. The Government already have powers
under section 8 of the National Health Service Act 2006 to ask NHS
bodies for quality accounts. As they already have such powers, will
this legislation bring in other bodies, perhaps those supplying
services to the NHS? If there are already powers, I cannot understand
why we need the clause, unless we are bringing in other
bodies.</div><a name="09061847000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are asking the public, understandably, to have confidence in the
accounts, the accounts must be like for like. Two trusts next to each
other must be offering similar things, and we must have a level playing
field. We do not want a postcode
lottery.</div><a name="09061847000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
who will audit the accounts? The British Medical Association is
concerned about that, and I share its concerns. As this is prescribed
information on the quality of the services, the manner in which they
are published should, as I just said, be equal&#151;in other words,
there should be a level playing field. Who will audit the accounts, or
will there not be an audit at all? If there is no form of audit, what
is the logic of introducing the
measure?</div><a name="09061847000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000122"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> On bringing in other bodies, the hon. Gentleman
is right. Quality accounts will apply not just to hospitals. They will
apply to other NHS organisations and providers of NHS services. Even
those in the private sector who provide NHS services will be required
to look at the quality of what they do and report on it, and that
information should be available to the public so that taxpayers are
able to see the quality of what they
get.</div><a name="09061847000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that the quality accounts are verifiable. I have already
indicated that CQC will be able to examine and check them. There will
not be an outside 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>auditor such as Ernst and Young brought in. That is not the approach
that we are taking. We are saying that the trust or other organisation
board, the partners in a practice and so on will be responsible for
writing a basic quality account. There will be core national things
that they must include and other things that they may choose to
include. They will be responsible for ensuring the quality of the
quality account. There will be a failsafe&#151;a check&#151;to
ensure that what they have done is not in any way unsound. The CQC will
be there to do that, but I suspect that once these things are made
public, others who work in the NHS will start looking at them and
asking questions about them. If people are making claims that cannot be
substantiated, I suspect that they will be caught out fairly
quickly.</div><a name="09061847000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000123"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> As I said at the outset, we are broadly in
support, but there is very little detail in the Bill. I hope that the
Minister will understand why we have introduced these probing
amendments and discussions. With that in mind, I do not wish to press
amendments 87 and
156.</div><a name="09061847000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061847000124"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): I want to make a few comments
on amendment 169. I believe the Minister alluded to the fact that, in
the past, targets have been slightly distorting, and that assessing
quality from time to time can become distorting. I wonder to what
extent assessment by the public of quality accounts will differ from
internal assessment by professionals. In the case of education
assessments and establishments, people inside the education world and
the general public often have different readings of information that is
made public. However, I accept that assessing quality, albeit at a
subtle distance, may at the end of the day improve the quality of
services.</div><a name="09061847000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister mentioned that the clause draws a distinction between quantity
and quality. The amendment is about quantity, while the particular
clause is about quality, though I accept that quantity and statistics
are often a good indication of the quality of a service being
delivered. The amendment makes an important point about the necessity
of collecting injury statistics and presenting them in ways that would
lead people to consider what the causes and the preventions are of such
injuries. I want to put on the record that my hon. Friend the Member
for Romsey has gone to the Health Committee and has not abnegated her
duties here.</div>
<a name="09061847000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000125"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061847000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="09061847000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000126"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I beg to move amendment 159, in
clause 8, page 5, line 24, leave
out paragraph
(c).</div><a name="09061847000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would leave out the paragraph that stipulates that anyone
who</div><a name="09061847000080"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;makes
arrangements...for another person to provide NHS
services&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061847000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">those
who are pursuing a contract or making an
arrangement</div><a name="09061847000081"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for

<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div><a name="09061847000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">such
services&#151;will need to publish a document. Even though the noble
Lord Darzi attempted to address the situation in the other place, there
is still a lack of clarity in the Bill regarding which organisations
that supplies services to the NHS will be required to provide. A few
moments ago, the Minister listed some. It would be useful, at least in
correspondence, if the Minister could indicate exactly which bodies
that supply services to the NHS will be required. That is important, as
so much of the detail required will be left to the Minister or the
Secretary of State to decide under secondary
legislation.</div><a name="09061847000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concern is that not everyone is going to be caught up in the quality
accounts. The consultation that took place regarding which bodies
should be there was&#151;I am sorry to say&#151;slightly flawed.
Out of the whole of the NHS, only 299 people responded, of which 11
were GPs. That is not a real barometer on the field of the
wonderful service the NHS provides to the nation. Further consultation
took place between the Department, the donation trusts and other NHS
organisations. Some 15 NHS trusts responded&#151;not a huge
amount&#151;so did nine primary care trusts, one strategic health
authority and the Foundation Trust Network. That is not a definitive
list of respondents as to who will be caught up in the
legislation.</div><a name="09061847000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other thing, which I alluded to earlier, is the role of the CQC. The
Minister responded that it will be the CQC&#146;s responsibility to
look at the accounts. When and how often are the obvious questions.
What is the role of Monitor in routinely examining information for
presenting the quality accounts for the foundation trusts? That could
lead to quite a punitive effect if we are not careful. The
Government&#146;s assessments indicate that the accounts will be
quite challenging for trusts. They may have to take on new and
temporary staff. Exactly which organisations will be required to
produce quality accounts must be definitive in the Bill, and it is
disappointing that it is
not.</div><a name="09061847000085"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000127"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> There is not, as such, a definitive list,
because the NHS varies across the country and NHS services are provided
in different ways. There is obviously a list of the organisations that
we want to include, but because the operation of the NHS is so variable
and because services are delivered in so many different ways, we
essentially want to be able to say that if an NHS service is being
provided, by either the public or private sector, and if patients
receive a service, we want it to be qualitatively examined. We are not
interested in the delivery of paper to a trust; we are interested in
what the trust and medical teams are doing to deliver services to
patients. The sub-contractors who will be covered include many services
offered by independent sector treatment centres. That would mean that
patients will be able to see the quality of what is done when services
are provided to the NHS. If a private sector centre provides NHS
services and private sector services, the latter are separate, so the
centre will have to look after them. However, where facilities are used
to deliver NHS services to NHS patients, we want quality
accounts.</div><a name="09061847000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000128"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I think everybody would understand if phase 1, 2
or 3&#151;if we get that far&#151;ISTCs that were contracting had
to do that, but what about other people that are contracting directly
into the NHS such as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 95</div>dentists, the group of professionals about whom we
were talking yesterday? They are self-employed and contracted to the
PCT to deliver care from the primary sector directly to the public.
Some practices&#151;there are not so many of them now&#151;in rural
parts of the country might consist of a single dentist with two dental
nurses and a perhaps a technician, but some practices are very large.
Would dentists be required to provide quality accounts? I think they
fall into the bracket that the Minister was just
describing.</div>
<a name="09061847000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000129"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The straight answer to the question on dentists
is yes, but not immediately. In the first year of quality accounts,
acute hospital trusts will be required to provide a quality account,
including ambulance and mental health trusts. In the second year, that
will be extended to various community services, and in the third year,
it will extend to primary care services such as GPs and dentists. We
will work in detail with GPs to develop an approach that works for
them. The national criteria for quality accounts that apply to acute
hospitals will obviously not apply to a dentist, so we have to work
with each of the stakeholders to ensure that we develop quality
accounts that are suitable for that sector of the
NHS.</div><a name="09061847000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000130"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> The Government&#146;s impact assessment on
quality accounts and the Bill in general said that there would be an
impact, a cost and a burden on those who provide a quality account.
Does the Minister realise that if we bring in small organisations such
as dentists, chiropodists and physiotherapists who are contracted into
the NHS, the burden on those businesses&#151;especially dentists, who
tell me that it is driving them away from the NHS&#151;will be so
onerous that we may well lose even more of them than we lose at the
moment?</div><a name="09061847000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000131"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I thought the hon. Gentleman was supporting
quality accounts. We will be looking at how quality accounts will have
to be delivered by GPs and dentists. I assume that both of those types
of organisations will want to measure the quality of what they do. I
certainly hope that my dentist is concerned about the quality of his
work. I hope that he wants to be sure that it is of a sufficiently high
quality and that he checks the nature of the treatment delivered to
patients. The difficulty is that, yes, there will be a need to write
some of that down. Will it be an onerous or undue burden? In our view
it will not. Will it enable the public to know what they get in return
for the money that goes into NHS dentistry? It should provide them with
more data and information. Will it enable them to have a better idea
about what their GPs are doing, what their specialisms are and where
they see the need for improvements in the coming year or two? Yes, it
should; that is the sort of thing that we want GPs, dentists and others
to
do.</div><a name="09061847000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000132"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I am thinking about the public health agenda. A
number of organisations are involved in partnership with the NHS in
order to follow through on very important public health objectives.
Many of them are quite small organisations working in fields such as
alcohol awareness. Will they too be required to produce quality
accounts?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div><a name="09061847000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000133"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> It depends on the nature of the organisations.
What we have is the ability to take a view that we will not require
quality accounts from particular organisations, because of the nature
of the services they provide. Those organisations may have some NHS
funding, but quality accounts would not be something that they need to
do. We are looking in particular at some smaller
organisations&#151;or small practitioners, or providers&#151;and
considering whether they need to provide quality accounts and, if so,
the extent of the level of data they would need to provide. We have the
ability in the Bill to exclude and take a view on those organisations.
We are now in the process of consulting with various stakeholders about
exactly how we can ensure that quality accounts will apply to their
particular areas. There is the consultation, which will hopefully now
proceed with broad support as the Bill goes through the House. In due
course, because we are phasing this in over a number of years, we will
want to consult with the various organisations to get this right and
make sure the delivery of quality accounts does not produce an undue
burden, not just for small practitioners, but also for the
organisations described by the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09061847000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000134"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I have listened carefully to the Minister. He is
absolutely right in indicating that at the start of the Bill we were
broadly in support of quality accounts. That does not mean that, after
our probing amendments, we are not concerned about some of the comments
that have been made in the debate this morning, not least because the
Government&#146;s own impact assessment
said:</div><a name="09061847000072"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
may be a lack of resource within organisations to prepare Quality
Accounts - recruitment, on either a temporary or permanent basis may be
required&#148;.</div><a name="09061847000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
does that tie up with the comments made by the Minister a moment ago
that he does not think that quality accounts will be onerous for such
bodies?</div><a name="09061847000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000135"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Just to give the hon. Gentleman some estimate of
the cost that we think that quality accounts might bring to an
organisation, our impact assessment has calculated that it would cost
around &#163;3,000 per annum for the larger providers&#151;an acute
hospital trust, for example&#151;to provide the data. That is the
sort of calculation that we have put in it. As I indicated, we are open
to exempting some of the smallest providers&#151;those which may only
see, for example, a handful of NHS patients in any one
year.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061847000136"></a>Mike

not think that dentists would fall into that bracket of &#147;only a
