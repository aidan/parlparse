Question proposed [this day], That this schedule be the Third schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Questioned again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): First, may I start by saying what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Malins? This is an important Bill. We made the point forcefully and repeatedly&#151;it was not contradicted by the Government&#151;that it is a great deal more important than appears at first sight. The Bill does not make a minor administrative adjustment, but a sinister and devastating attack on the integrity of our national insurance system.
<P>
This morning I felt like an Athenian at the fence of Thermopylae. Although I was convinced that our cause was right and just, we were outnumbered enormously. We are still two on our side&#151;the Liberal Democrat, who has disappeared, was never really on our side&#151;and the number of Persians on the Labour Benches seems to have fallen. That must be good news.
<P>
I hope that the Minister of State had a good lunch and an opportunity to talk to his officials and to go through his brief. If there are arguments in support of his proposals, I hope that we shall hear them. The Minister appeared incapable or unwilling this morning to present his clauses, schedules and legislative proposals, and that made a mockery of the Committee.
<P>
Schedule 3 demonstrates, as did schedule 1, that the Bill is about the humiliating emasculation of the Department of Social Security. Many of its key functions&#151;policy functions in the case of schedule 3; operational functions in the case of schedule 1&#151;are to be transferred to the Treasury and Revenue. It is to submit any remaining functions to the Treasury. No longer are these independent Departments of state. The Department of Social Security becomes the servant&#151;a mere clerk&#151;of the Treasury. Regulations will be made either directly by the Treasury or under its instructions.
<P>
The Government owes the Committee and the country an explanation of a number of points raised by the schedule. A general concern, which relates equally to schedule 1, is that we are altering a vast range of Acts, some of which I listed this morning. They include the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the Pensions Schemes Act 1993, the Pensions Act 1995 and the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Those are being set aside and significantly modified by the schedule. Practically every part of the Bill lists one of the Acts. Major changes are being made to major Acts of Parliament, but they are buried in a schedule that the Government present as a minor administrative measure. That is not a good way for a Parliament in a democratic country to legislate. It is a formula for ill thought-through legislation. It is also a formula for complicating the corpus of our law so that no one understands it. The principle that the citizen is deemed to know the law is fundamental and should be written above the dais of any Committee Room in which legislation is scrutinised. If we do not believe in that principle, the foundation of our legal system will collapse. If we do believe in it, we must ensure that citizens can realistically be expected to know the law.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will answer my questions this afternoon. First, do the Government propose to produce new versions of each of the various social security, pensions and taxes Acts that the schedule will modify, so that the citizen, through a public library or the internet, can read a consolidated version of the Act in question, into which the changes have been incorporated? Or will the citizen find instead that he cannot rely on those Acts, because subsequent changes will have been buried in a schedule the existence of which it will be impossible for him to be aware?
<P>
The Minister may reply that the citizen can employ an adviser or lawyer and that that is how such professionals make their money, but that would not be good enough. The situation ought not to arise&#151;I was going to say that it will not arise, but we are not in power, so we cannot stop it&#151;where a citizen has to incur the expense associated with such professionals, or suffer uncertainty about the law that he is expected to know and observe. I hope that I shall receive a clear, unambiguous answer to that question.
<P>
My second question is fundamental and concerns responsibility and accountability. Given their performance this morning, I doubt whether the Government intend to raise it, but it arises directly from the schedule and it would therefore be remiss of the Committee not to raise it. I shall deal at a later point with a related quirk in the schedule that contrasts with the aspect of schedule 1 that we debated this morning.
<P>
The schedule refers&#151;in paragraphs 23 and 24, for example&#151;to a dual responsibility that, unlike that contained in schedule 1, appears to be genuine. However, the question remains: who the devil will be responsible to Parliament&#151;the Secretary of State for Social Security, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Paymaster General or someone else? I hope to heaven that, if the Government do not answer any other questions this afternoon, they at least answer that one.
<P>
I am glad to see the Minister writing something down, which suggests that I may get an answer. I do not deny that the Committee consists of able politicians. There are about eight or 10 Persians on the other side of the pass of Thermopylae, as it were, who would immediately rise to put me in my place if my questions were not politically pertinent and sensible.
<P>
My third quandary is one that, I admit, I may not have thought about entirely sufficiently, but perhaps one can never do that. This morning, during our discussion of schedule 1, I mentioned the way in which the Department of Social Security will be placed in a subservient position vis a vis the Treasury. I also mentioned the many references in schedule 1 such as that in paragraph 30, which refers to the Secretary of State's making regulations
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```in accordance with any directions given by the Treasury'''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, in schedule 3 we find a different formula. I believe that I argued successfuly this morning that the mention of the Secretary of State in schedule 1 in that context was entirely bogus&#151;the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) objected to my use of the word ``bogus'', but did not explain why it was an unreasonable inference. Clearly, regulations can be made only on the direction of the Treasury&#151;what is the point of involving the Secretary of State when the Treasury decides on the regulations and the Secretary of State is a mere post office? That is a rather humiliating position for one of Her Majesty's Secretaries of State to be in.
<P>
The formula in schedule 3 is subtly different, but different in substance. I refer to paragraphs 23 and 24, which state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for `The Secretary of State may' there is substituted `The Treasury may with the concurrence of the Secretary of State'''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I understand it, that gives the Secretary of State a real role&#151;a power of veto. We know what that means; we deal with it all the time in the European Union context, for example, as the unanimity rule. It appears, therefore, that the Secretary of State will generally be able to say no to the Treasury, which I welcome. My whole argument has rested on the fact that, as a result of the transfer of functions under schedule 1, the national insurance system and national insurance fund will not be protected by a Secretary of State who has separately defined statutory responsibilities. Either his functions will have been removed entirely, or he will be able to exercise them only on the direction of the Treasury. Will the Minister tell me whether I am right to conclude that the Secretary of State has a residual role? That is the first part of my third question.
<P>
The second part of my third question concerns the reason for the shifting of position between schedule 1, which governs the transfer of operational fuctions, and schedule 3, which govens the transfer of policy functions. What is the logic of that? It seems to be a good thing, so perhaps I have done the Minister a favour by giving him the opportunity to say something nice about the Bill. We were not able to say anything nice or nasty about the Bill this morning. If I have given the Minister the chance to tell us that there is something positive in the Bill, I shall be the first to welcome it.
<P>
The schedule is enormously complex, and we could legitimately spend not five or 10 minutes but a whole afternoon on it, as we could on other parts of the Bill. Schedule 1 changes at a stroke whole rafts of primary legislation, while schedule 2 changes whole rafts of secondary legislation. Schedule 3 takes us back to changing whole rafts of primary legislation. I have the greatest hesitation in proceeding down this road&#151;it will not be clear where changes have been made or what the current legislation stipulates, as the Government do not propose to produce a new consolidated text. That is a serious matter.
<P>
The Minister will need to be persuasive on the issue of the powers that he seeks under the schedule. I am slightly more encouraged, however, by the Secretary of State's apparent residual independent responsibility and scope for judgment. I hope that the Minister is not about to tell me that that is illusory. If he wishes to persuade Opposition Members that it is not illusory, he will need to tell us something about how the power will be exercised.
<P>
I do not want to be churlish&#151;I will not repeat my request if the Committee proceeds along the right lines this afternoon&#151;but I hope that, for the first time in the Committee, we will be given some clear explanations of what the Government are trying to do and why they are trying to do it.

<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> May I join the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) in welcoming you as Chairman, Mr. Malins. It is your first Committee as Chairman, and my first Committee as a Minister. I am delighted that you will be looking after us this afternoon.
<P>
I shall respond first to some matters raised before lunch by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. He suggested that there had been a surprise announcement at or shortly before Second Reading that policy relating to national insurance contributions would also be transferred. He was mistaken about that. The position was made absolutely clear when my right hon. Friend the Chancellor first announced it in his Budget last year. It was spelt out in the press release that accompanied his Budget speech. What was new was that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on Second Reading the date on which that transfer would take place. The fact that there would be a transfer was never in doubt.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Minister makes a fair point. If I said in haste before lunch that what was new was anything other than the date, I was wrong. Clearly it was the date that was new. We knew that the Bill provides the power&#151;that is evident from the schedule&#151;for the transfer to take place. It was the fact that it would be so rapid, and that the Secretary of State was so keen to divest himself&#151;or had received instructions to divest himself&#151;of those functions that was new.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The difference entirely undermines the argument made by the hon. Gentleman before lunch. He suggested that the transfer of policy was a new emasculation of the Department of Social Security. That is untrue. It was always the case that policy would be moved, and it would have been nonsense to do anything less.
<P>
It might be useful if I tell the Committee what functions are being transferred. They are in the schedule, but I shall summarise them. I said on Second Reading that some 20 of the 90,000 people who work for the Department of Social Security are being transferred as a result of the transfer of policy. They are the people who deal with matters such as the rate of national insurance contributions, the level of upper and lower earnings limits, the categorisation of earners between self-employed and employed, and precisely how those categories are deployed, the definition of earnings for national insurance purposes, the role of the national insurance fund, the policy on collection, enforcement and penalties, including anti-avoidance policy, the policy on national insurance contributions appeals, and liaison with Northern Ireland.
<P>
Why transfer those 20 or so people? It would make no sense to keep the functions that I have summarised separate from the other functions carried out by the Contributions Agency. It is entirely appropriate that they should move to the Treasury when the Contributions Agency moves to the Inland Revenue. Everyone who has examined the matter has acknowledged that. I referred ealier to the Chartered Institute of Taxation, which the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford advises, and the Institute of Directors. I make no apology for referring to those organisations in support of what the Government are doing.
<P>
The Conservative party used to believe itself to be the voice of business. The fact that it now ignores what business is saying and the views of employers is a measure of the dreadful position in which it now finds itself.
<P>
For balance, I must tell the hon. Member for Grantham and Stanford that the Child Poverty Action Group has long campaigned for closer alignment between the national insurance and taxation regimes. This is not a contentious move. It is a sensible, technical change. The suggestion that such decisions used to be made without the influence of the Chancellor is naive. The hon. Gentleman has been in the House long enough to know the realities of such matters. If he is in any doubt, I happen to have the 1994 Budget statement of his right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is full of announcements on national insurance contributions. The suggestion that such announcements used to be made by the Secretary of State for Social Security without reference to the Chancellor is simply without foundation. The hon. Gentleman's concerns are entirely vacuous. This is a technical Bill, which makes a sensible change of great value.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser </B>(Mid-Dorset and North Poole): I was not in Committee this morning and my comment concerns the transfer. Will the transfer from the Contributions Agency to the Inland Revenue in any way, shape or form add an enormous amount of bureaucratic overload to the system? I should like to have that explained in the context of what you are saying&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member cannot refer to the context of what ``you'' are saying, because that would be addressing the Chair. It is the Minister who is responding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I apologise. I should be most appreciative if the Minister would answer my question in the context of what he is saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that there will be no increase in bureaucracy as a result of the change. Indeed, we introduced the proposals in order to reduce bureaucracy. The hon. Gentleman was unable to join us this morning, but if he consults his right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor, who, before the election, was chair of the Deregulation Task Force, appointed by the then Deputy Prime Minister, he will discover that, in his report 1994-95, the shadow Chancellor spelled out in detail how the merger of the two organisations would reduce the bureaucratic load on business and was an important deregulatory measure. Those arguments were well set out by the shadow Chancellor, and they were right. That is why we brought forward these proposals.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked whether we would publish a compilation of the amended legislation. The Inland Revenue is planning to expand its taxes Act volume to include national insurance contributions legislation, as amended by the Bill. I think that answers the hon. Gentleman's point. In addition, commercial providers will publish their usual compilations and, indeed, may do so on CD-ROM, which would be useful to some people.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked about paragraphs 23 and 24 of schedule 3, and asked who will be accountable to Parliament. The answer is that the Minister who makes the regulation, whether or not it requires another Minister's concurrance, will be responsible to Parliament. The principle is that all policy on benefit matters will remain the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Social Security, whereas policy on national insurance contribution will be transferred to the Treasury. That is consistents throughout schedules 1 and 2, and is the basis on which the changes have been made.
<P>
Finally, the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked why powers would be exercised with the ``concurrence'' of the Secretary of State. The import of those paragraphs is that the Treasury can make regulations only with the agreement of the Secretary of State. That is to take account of the potential effects of benefit entitlements, in the case of these policy-making functions, and reflects the existing precedent, under which contributions regulations are made by the Secretary of State with the concurrence of the Inland Revenue. So the change is entirely consistent with the principle that applies throughout the schedules: responsibility for policy on benefits remains with the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful to the Minister&#151;that is the first time that I have used that phrase today&#151;because he made an attempt to give an honest explanation of the Government's policy, which we have not heard hitherto. We do not approve of the policy, but we are entitled to serious answers to serious questions. We shall certainly make better progress on that basis than we made this morning.
<P>
However, I am not entirely satisfied with the Minister's responses on the schedule, and I think that it would be helpful to the Committee, in deciding how to vote on the schedule, if I explained why. It is not entirely satisfactory to say that the Inland Revenue is preparing a new version of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which will take account of the social security provisions in the Bill. That does not deal with the point that the previous Acts of Parliament will still exist but will be incomplete and totally inadequate. New Labour has been carried away by the idea that it talks only to the business community, above the heards of the ordinary public. Of course commerical organisations will produce their own consolidations, but how much does Butterworths cost? Quite a lot of money, and a good deal more than the ordinary citizen feels like paying to know what the law is. Firms of City accountants and solicitors or large employers may be able to subscribe to Butterworths&#151;I pay tribute to its work&#151;but the private sector is doing what the Government should do. The result is that the information is available only to a tiny minority of the population. That is no way to legislate for the British public. I resent that. I am sorry that the Minister gave that answer because it will influence how we vote.
<P>
The Minister keeps returning to the shadow Chancellor and the report to which he gave his name when he was not the shadow Chancellor or even a Member of Parliament. We covered that this morning and I will not go over it again. The Minister is clutching at straws instead of addressing the substance of the Bill.
<P>
The Minister said&#151;this crucial point relates directly to the schedule&#151;that I was naive to think that changes in national insurance contributions or benefit rates had never been decided without reference to and the influence of the Chancellor. I did not suggest that. I said that up until now&#151;including today&#151;checks and balances have been in the system. Of course the Treasury has influence and is referred to, but the Secretary of State is an independent power. I am concerned that the checks and balances are being weakened.
<P>
The Minister referred two or three times to the Institute of Directors. I declare an interest because I was once a member of the Institute of Directors. I was the only board member of Morgan Grenfell who was a member. I joined it not because I wanted to use it as a trade union, but because I was in favour of some of the policy proposals that it was developing for supply side reforms. I resigned when I strongly disagreed with it. There is not a single member of the Institute of Directors&#151;I do not want to attack it&#151;who earns less than &#163;50,000 a year, and a large number earn more than &#163;500,000.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman knows that he is straying. Salaries are not relevant to the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Of course I observe your strictures, Mr. Malins. I know, however, that there is a right of appeal. The Minister prayed in aid the Institute of Directors in defence of the schedule. The Institute of Directors is composed of people whose salaries&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have no difficulty with the hon. Gentleman referring to the Institute of Directors, but he knows that he is straying a little.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I appreciate your guidance, Mr. Malins.
<P>
If I were the Minister instead of the Opposition spokesman, it would not occur to me in a million years to think of the Institute of Directors as the natural spokesman for those who benefit from the national insurance system and who have a right to believe that the integrity of their contributions and the national insurance fund will be maintained. That is a serious point. It is extraordinary that the Minister should rely on the Institute of Directors to support changes in national insurance, which I denounced this morning as extremely pernicious and destructive. The way in which the Minister prays in aid the Institute of Directors, fine organisation though it may be in its own context, only reinforces our doubts about the Government's intentions and the nature of new Labour's project in attacking the national insurance system.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Again I rely entirely on the text of the schedule to make my point. The Minister just explained, and I am grateful for his explanation, that the conceptual distinction reflected in the clause&#151;the division of responsibility that the Bill is intended to bring into effect&#151;is that national insurance should be the responsibility of the Treasury and benefit the responsibility of the Department of Social Security.
<P>
Logically, there are only two possibilities. Under schedule 3 the Secretary of State for Social Security has a subsidiary role and Treasury Ministers&#151;we heard the answer two minutes ago&#151;will be responsible. Under schedule 1, as we established beyond peradventure this morning, the Secretary of State merely has the role of a postbox, a rubber stamp, or not even that: everything is in the charge of the Treasury. That is one possibility&#151;that the division is bogus and the whole thing is being taken over by the Treasury.
<P>
The alternative is that the division is genuine and that national insurance contributions will therefore be permanently decoupled from the provision of benefits. If that is not the destruction of the national insurance system, I do not know what is. The whole point about the national insurance system is that people contribute and, on the basis of their contributions record&#151;not the amount of their contributions; that was never the principle&#151;they are entitled to benefits. The two are linked.
<P>
For 50 years the national insurance fund has had its own integrity. It has been separately audited and accounted for so as to maintain that integrity, which is the link between contributions and benefits. If the Government are saying, as they have just said, that they are now creating a faultline between contributions and the payment of benefits, they have given me the case: there is nothing more for me to say in the Committee. They have already granted the point that we have been making. Perhaps that is a good thing. Perhaps we should be grateful that the Government are being so frank and should all go home now. We shall not go home, however, because we intend to fight this pernicious Bill all the way, but we shall do so knowing that our analysis of the schedule and the Bill has been thoroughly and explicitly confirmed by the Minister's responses, for which I am therefore doubly grateful.
<P>

Schedule 3 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>General functions of Board</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> As this is my first Standing Committee as a Minister, may I join my hon. Friend the Minister and the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Malins? I am sure that I shall receive a little guidance if I inadvertently stray across the boundaries of propriety in dealing with the Bill.
<P>
It might be helpful if I explain that the clause describes how the Inland Revenue will carry out the functions being transferred to it from the Department of Social Security. In particular, the clause brings national insurance contributions under the care and management of the Inland Revenue and places the Inland Revenue under a duty to collect national insurance contributions. It thus amends legislation that governs the role and functions of the Inland Revenue and the powers and duties of its officers.
<P>
This is an appropriate point to add my assurance to that given by Baroness Hollis of Heigham that subsection (2) does not merge tax and national insurance contributions but brings their administration together in one body. It is drafted as it is precisely because contributions are not a tax.
<P>
Similarly, subsection (4) caters for and maintains the distinction between national insurance contributions and general Government receipts. I draw attention to it because it preserves the existing requirement that national insurance contributions are paid into the national insurance fund, by excepting them from the general requirement that Inland Revenue receipts go into the Consolidated Fund. Hon. Members will note that here, as elsewhere in the Bill, as my hon. Friend the Minister has stressed, we are preserving rather than eroding the national insurance fund.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I welcome the Economic Secretary to the Committee and our proceedings. I find myself in the same position as she is: it is the first time that I have sat on a Standing Committee considering a social security Bill, and an interesting Committee it is proving to be, and unexpected in many ways.
<P>
The Economic Secretary assured the Committee that the clause preserves the national insurance fund. I grant that it preserves the appearance of an independent national insurance fund, but what are the public to make of the fact that we established this morning that there is no protection against the predations of the Treasury or the Revenue on that fund? When I asked, for example, what limitations there were on the Inland Revenue drawing so-called expenses from the fund&#151;a possibility that emerges from the Bill&#151;I received no answer: the Minister sat in silence, as members of the Committee will remember. Therefore, we listened to the Economic Secretary's assurances with diminishing hope but little confidence.
<P>
The first sentence of the clause sums up the Bill:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Contributions shall be under the care and management of the Board.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the national insurance fund is now under the care and management of the agency that handles the Consolidated Fund.
<P>
All that we have seen in the Committee and in the Government's behaviour over the last few months in winding down the universal contributory principle of benefits and replacing it with means-tested benefits presses too hard on the credulity of ordinary people, and of Members of Parliament who are prepared to use their judgment independently, to believe that it is not part of a sinister project and that the national insurance fund is not in danger. There is no pretension left for it.
<P>
We do not have an independent Department of Social Security charged with maintaining the integrity of the fund. I give you the prediction now, Mr. Malins, that this is but a first step. If the party that is now in power remains in power much longer, that will be the end of the national insurance fund, and it will be a sad day for this country when that happens. I shall not go into all the perverse effects as well as the injustice to individuals and the betrayal of reasonable expectations that that will bring about, because I raised those issues on Second Reading and, needless to say, received no reassurance.
<P>
I hope that we can have answers to some of our detailed questions about the clause, which I found confusing. Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the following provisions of the 1890 Act''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Revenue Regulation Act 1890&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall not apply in relation to contributions''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One example in sub-paragraph (c) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``officers may conduct proceedings before justices''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The power in the 1890 Act allowing officers of the board to appear in cases instead of the Revenue having to brief barristers is relaxed. However, paragraph 21 of schedule 1 reinstates that power by the back door. What is the point of such administrative juggling? Have I understood the position correctly? If not, may we have a clear explanation of what is going on, and why? If I have understood the position correctly&#151;that a power is relaxed in a clause and reinstated in a schedule, so that the position remains the same&#151;what is going on? Who is being deceived? Over whose eyes are we trying to pull the wool? What is the point of this expensive and intricate bureaucratic manoeuvring when there is no real change? That is a serious question.
<P>
Other powers, which the Revenue cannot use in relation to national insurance contributions but can use in relation to taxes, are being relaxed, and cover, for example, power to reward informers, expenses of prosecutions, power to mitigate fines and stay proceedings. Some of those powers may be rather valuable to the Revenue. The Bill is amazingly intricate and I do not know how the general public, even those who take an interest in such matters in the House of Commons, are supposed to understand it. Perhaps those powers are also reinstated elsewhere in the Bill, but I have not noticed, or perhaps they are reinstated in another Bill. Now is the opportunity for the Government to come clean and to give a clear explanation that is comprehensible to ordinary people, about what the blazes is going on.
<P>
I am asking for an exegisis of clause 3(3). Why are the powers being relaxed, when some appear to be reinstated elsewhere in the Bill? The Government have given themselves a blank cheque in the Bill and if it is enacted they can do what they like in subsequent regulations? Do they intend subsequently to reinstate some of those powers? The power to mitigate fines and stay proceedings is essential in any delegated authority to administer anything involving sanctions. Of course, there will be occasions when it is not sensible to pursue proceedings because it would not be in the interests of natural justice to take people to court. The Revenue is generally sensible about such matters. It does not go after little old ladies and send them to gaol for forgetting &#163;3 of savings income three years ago. Perhaps the Revenue intends to start doing that, but it is not how the Revenue works in this country. The Revnue has a power of negative discretion&#151;but not the power of positive discretion, which can easily become tyrannical&#151;to decide that although there is a legal right to pursue someone, it may not be natural justice to do so, not in the national interest or perhaps does not make sense in terms of maximising revenue because a deal may be struck voluntarily. The Revenue works on that basis and has done so for a long time. I do not want power to be relaxed in relation to the sanctions available to pursue people who are in default, culpably or otherwise, with national insurance contributions.
<P>
I shall repeat my question. I have to do so because, as I discovered this morning, the question gets forgotten. My first question is: is there not a contradiction between paragraph 21 of schedule 1 and clause 3(3)(c) and, if so, why? Does the one not negate the other? Secondly, why are other powers being relaxed? Is it because the Government intend to reinstate them under another heading somewhere else, in the Bill or elsewhere?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My third question, which flows from the first two, is why go in for such complex administrative juggling? What is the point? Why not draft the Bill in the most simple fashion so that the public and all of us can understand, at first sight, what is going on?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tim Collins </B>(Westmorland and Lonsdale): May I add my appreciation of the fact that you are in the Chair, Mr. Malins, to that which has already been expressed?
<P>
I do not wish to add to my hon. Friend's remarks about subsection (3) of clause 3, but I wish to record some important observations on subsections (1) and (2). To begin in reverse order with subsection (2), you will note from your careful reading, Mr. Malins, that it amends the Inland Revenue Regulation Act 1890. That is a very significant year. Is it because it is the year after the construction of the Eiffel tower? No. Is it because it is the year in which Kaiser Wilhelm dismissed Bismarck and, therefore, arguably, started the destabilisation of Europe? No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that reference to Bismarck is certainly not irrelevant in this context because Bismarck invented the concept of social insurance?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Chair rules that references to Bismarck are not relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> The year 1890 is relevant because it means that the Inland Revenue Regulation Act 1890 was passed less than 20 years before the origins of the present national insurance system came into being and, therefore, within the political lifetime and memory of those people who constructed the national insurance system&#151;and, I say to the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel), the last Liberal Government to have been inflicted on the United Kingdom.
<P>
If they had thought it sensible to use the provisions of the Act when constructing the national insurance system, they would easily have been able to recall the passage of the Act in 1890. Many Members of the House at the time would have been around at the time of the passage of the Act, and the founding fathers&#151;to use an American phrase&#151;of national insurance decided not to use the provisions of the Inland Revenue Regulation Act 1890. They regarded it as an important principle of public policy to establish a clear distinction between contributions towards national insurance and Inland Revenue taxation for normal purposes. That is why we must look with some care also at subsection (1) of clause 3, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Contributions shall be under the care and management of the Board.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a sweeping declaration. Indeed, the clause is summarised beside the text as, ``General functions of Board.'' We contend that the Bill raises serious issues regarding the preservation of confidentiality, and clause 3(1) raises serious issues both about confidentiality and about the appropriate maintenance of a clear distinction between national insurance contributions and the contributory principle and general taxation. If contributions are under the general care and management of the board, and the board is bound in its supervision of contributions by no greater requirement than that which goes with any legal trust&#151;that it should act with due diligence, rationally and reasonably&#151;it might well conclude that, in its care and management of the contributions process, it would be reasonable, easier and more efficient to have an exchange of information between the Contributions Agency and the separate Inland Revenue system.
<P>
Secondly, as part of its general duties of care and management, it could lobby Ministers for a general integration of the tax and benefits system. We know that that is the policy of the Liberal Democrats, which, I am sure, is one of the reasons why they support the Bill, because they think that that it is a desirable end state.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman knows that he is straying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> I am sorry to be an errant sheep, and I am grateful to be guided back.
<P>
Clause 3 requires careful consideration of whether the Government's assurances that they do not see the proposal as an inevitable way-station towards total integration of the tax and benefits systems can be regarded as concrete. I am interested to hear from the Minister whether he&#151;[Hon. Members: ``She.''] I apologise to the hon. Lady. I forgot that she ably opened the debate. I was sorry that her hon. Friend the Minister of State was unable to respond to this general issue, but I hope that she will address it. Our observations rise straight out of clause 3. What is the general policy of Her Majesty's Government towards the integration of the tax and benefit regulations and systems? Does she regard clause 3 as a mechanism to advance that goal? Is she prepared to tell us when the Government propose to introduce further changes, which are enabled by clause 3, on this important public policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> In arriving late, I failed to refer to the able way in which you Chair the Committee, Mr. Malins. I want to put that on the record.
<P>
Clause 3 places the Inland Revenue under a duty to collect contributions. That concerns me immensely because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford said, legislation must have safeguards and protections built in, otherwise, people at the receiving end are worse off. I am not convinced that the Bill and, in particular, the clause cover the issues of protection and safeguards.
<P>
There is a question about how national insurance contributions will be seen in the future. Will they be treated like tax? Is that the intention of the Bill and the clause? I should like the Economic Secretary to satisfy my curiosity. Does she accept that the collection of contributions gives rise to an enormous bureaucratic overload? If there is to be a different collection process, we cannot avoid bureaucratic overload.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the earlier assurance that there would be no bureaucratic overload is difficult to reconcile with the Government's figures given in the other place of a cost of &#163;16 million or &#163;17 million additional spending a year in each of the first two years following the change?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his comment. There was great deliberation on that in the other place. Some of the information on extra cost that was brought to light was telling. Although extra costs are relevant, they are in addition to the current breakdown of the national insurance computer system. That is a major problem, especially when it is compounded with the extra burden that will be placed on it. I am no computer expert, but I understand that an overloaded system does not produce the best results and that it is only as good as the person who is putting in the information.
<P>
Those issues need careful consideration. They threaten the Government's claim that the transfer will produce significant improvements in customer service, and question the cost effectiveness of the transfer that is being proposed under clause 3.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, who is not in the Room to hear my answer, repeated the question that he has asked several times about the possibility of a raid on the national insurance fund to meet irrelevant expenses by the Inland Revenue or the Treasury. I repeat the assurance that my hon. Friend the Minister gave this morning: it is simply not the case that the Treasury or the Inland Revenue could draw from the national insurance fund for unrelated expenses.
<P>
The existing law, primarily the Social Security Administration Act 1992, specifies the expenses that can be charged to the national insurance fund. It lays down the requirements for the solvency of the fund and the audit of the fund by the National Audit Office. I am certain that no accounting officer would, but were he so minded to raid the national insurance fund for expenses that could not properly be charged to it, the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee would eat him for breakfast. Such action would not happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I did not suggest that, under the Bill the Inland Revenue might be able to charge expenses to the fund for unrelated matters. I said that there were no controls against the level of expenses that the Revenue might charge for related expenditure, and I wanted to know what the Government would do about that. I refer the Economic Secretary to paragraph 28 of scheule 1, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``so much of any interest recovered by the Inland Revenue by virtue of paragraph 6 . . . as remains after deduction by them of any administrative costs attributable to its recovery.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, any such levies would have to be attributable to a legitimate purpose. What is the control on the amount that could be levied on the fund as a result of such expenses being charged?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> As my hon Friend the Minister said this morning, the controls are precisely those that already exist&#151;that is to say, the controls provided by legislation, by the National Audit Office and by the Public Accounts Committee.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's second point was raised also by the hon. Members for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Collins) and for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mr. Fraser) about the possible merger of national insurance contributions and income tax and, therefore, the destruction of the national insurance fund. I repeat the assurance that was given by my hon. Friend the Minister and in another place: there will continue to be a separate national insurance fund. It will continue to be audited by the National Audit Office, as it is at present. The audit report will continue to be put before Parliament. The existence of the fund, the continuation of national insurance benefits based on the national insurance contribution records and all the proper safeguards for the existence and integrity of that fund will remain unchanged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I want to plough through some points to clarify them.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is intervening. I hope that he will make a brief intervention, rather than a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I assure you, Mr. Malins, that I will make a brief intervention. I shall paraphrase what I want to say to qualify its context.
<P>
The Minister assures us that safeguards are in place and things will not change. Does she accept that a couple of weeks ago, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport admitted&#151;after giving us absolute assurances that matters would not change in the future and that everything was safeguarded&#151;that he had raided the national lottery to prop up Government spending? Therefore, does she accept our scepticism about her argument?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> We are discussing clause 3 of the Bill; neither the clause nor the Bill as a whole merge income tax and national insurance contributions.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford talked about the complexity of the Bill and suggested that it should have been drafted in more simple language. I assure the Committee that it was drafted, as always by parliamentary counsel, in the simplest way possible. However, in order to give the Inland Revenue responsibility for collecting national insurance contributions, a large number of existing statutes have had to be amended. That is why we have published detailed explanatory notes alongside the Bill. If I may be so bold, had some members of the Committee read the notes more carefully, fewer questions would have been asked.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked about subsection (3), the inclusion of national insurance contributions in the definition of ``Inland Revenue'' and the reference to various provisions the 1890 Act. That Act, although it is still in force, is rather old. When we examine its provisions, we find either that comparable legislation exists already in relation to national insurance contributions, that the provisions no longer apply to income tax or that it is not suitable in relation to national insurance contributions. In other words, existing social security legislation already provides the equivalent necessary powers, but in a more relevant form for national insurance contributions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is a serious point. Is the Economic Secretary saying that subsection (3)(f), to which we attach some importance, which deals with the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``power to mitigate fines and stay proceedings'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is effectively maintained in the corpus of social security or tax law and will continue to apply to the collection of national insurance contributions? If so, will she please refer me to where in the corpus of legislation covering social security, national insurance or tax that provision is thus enshrined?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The powers to mitigate fines extend to equivalent penalties for national insurance contributions. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman chapter and verse off hand, but I shall do so later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Lady says that the powers exist, but we are debating an explicit text that will remove those powers and relax the provisions of the 1890 Act. The Economic Secretary says that that does not matter because the powers are being reinstated or already exist elsewhere. Our proceedings are slightly surreal. The Bill seems to get rid of something, but the Government assure us that it exists or is effectively being reinstated elsewhere. We cannot take that on trust. It is reasonable for the Committee to be given a reference, so that we can look up the matter ourselves and decide whether we consider that that protection is effectively enshrined in the corpus of law, even if the Bill is passed into law.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> If there is anything surreal about our proceedings, I hope that it does not stem from my contributions or from the Bill.
<P>
Clause 3(3) does not abolish any of the stated provisions of the 1890 Act. It merely ensures that they do not apply in relation to contributions for the simple reason that equivalent and more relevant provisions exist already and will not be affected by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Where?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall provide the hon. Gentleman with chapter and verse before the conclusion of our proceedings.
<P>
The hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale referred to subsection (1) and bringing national insurance contributions within the care and management of the board. In relation to national insurance contributions, the subsection will give the Inland Revenue precisely the same level of discretion that the Secretary of State for Social Security currently has. Under the 1890 Act and subsequent legislation, the Inland Revenue has a duty to collect every part of the revenue. Conversely, under existing legislation, the Secretary of State for Social Security has the power to collect national insurance contributions that are due, but has no duty to do so. The result is that he has a measure of discretion.
<P>
What we achieve by placing the Inland Revenue under a duty to collect national insurance contributions, while at the same time giving it the care and management of contributions, is to ensure that it has the same measure of discretion as the Secretary of State presently has.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> At least some of what the Minister says might potentially reassure Opposition Members. May I push a little further? The references that the hon. Lady makes go to the heart of her assurance that the tax and national insurance systems will not merge. Do the clear assurances that she gave us earlier extend to the whole of this Parliament and, in the unlikely event of the Labour party winning the next election, will they extend to the whole lifetime of the next Parliament?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister of State and I have both made the position crystal clear. The Bill does not merge national insurance contributions with income tax. We have no intention of doing that.
<P>
I have now dealt with all the questions that I have been asked during these proceedings. I should add, however, that section 35 of the 1890 Act is about mitigating fines. Tax fines can be mitigated under the Taxes Management Act 1970. When tax penalties extend to the equivalent national insurance contribution offence, the same mitigation is already available under that later Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful for that assurance. The manner in which the hon. Lady formulated it, saying that those powers are now available under the Taxes Management Act, reinforces the whole theme of the Bill, which is that, in the Government's eyes, there is now no distinction between national insurance and tax. That is dreadful, for the reasons that we have already given.
<P>
I am grateful at least that the Government have attempted to give us some serious answers. We are making some progress, which I appreciate. As we have been given the assurance that we sought, I believe that we should not oppose the clause. If the Government wish to put it to the vote, I shall invite my hon. Friends to abstain.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Recovery of Contributions where Income Tax Recovery Provisions not Applicable</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms. Hewitt:</B> Clause 4 introduces schedule 4, which fully aligns the methods used to recover unpaid national insurance contributions with the simple cost-effective means that are used to recover unpaid tax in magistrates and county courts.
<P>
I stress that 94 per cent. of national insurance contributions are already collected by the Inland Revenue. This clause and schedule 4 therefore apply to the 6 per cent. of contributions that are not already collected by the Inland Revenue. The clause and schedule together mean that the Inland Revenue will be able to pursue small debts of unpaid national insurance contributions in exactly the same way as it now pursues the unpaid taxes and national insurance contributions that it collects. It also provides that Revenue officers will be able to present contribution debt cases in the county courts, in the same way as they already present tax cases. That will save the time and expense of instructing lawyers to do the job. I hope that Opposition Members will support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am in slight difficulty because the Minister has gone into the substance of the schedule&#151;which is perfectly reasonable because the clause governs the schedule&#151;but I do not wish to lose the opportunity later of making comments or asking questions about the schedule because the Minister has decided that we have already debated its substance. Equally, I do not wish to be ruled out of order for debating the schedule now. I should be grateful for some guidance, Mr. Malins.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman will have a good opportunity to address the schedule when we deal with it later. It would not be right to deal with it now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful for that guidance, Mr. Malins. In that case, I shall restrict my remarks simply to saying that when the hon. Lady says that the Revenue already collects 94 per cent. of national insurance contributions, she makes a point against her own case. The Government assure us that the main justification for the Bill is administrative efficiency&#151;they claim that it will afford savings to business although, as we discovered this morning, far from being the Ministry of Savings, the Treasury is the Ministry of Costs; if that is the case, 94 per cent. of that advantage has already been achieved. By their own admission, the Government are making what can at the very least be described as serious inroads into the independence of the national insurance system, in exchange for 6 per cent. of any benefits from the merger. The fact that the Revenue already collects 94 per cent. of contributions means that they could collect the full 100 per cent. without giving away the policy functions.
<P>
I look forward to the substantive debate on the schedule which the clause will bring into effect; one aspect of it in particular concerns me. For the time being, I ask my hon. Friends to vote against the clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> It may help the Committee if I explain briefly that the schedule sets out procedures that will become available to enforce the collection of contributions that have not been paid at the right time; that does not involve and unresolved dispute between the contributor and the Department over whether national insurance contributions are due. It refers simply to unpaid debts.
<P>
The schedule gives the Inland Revnue access to the same methods for enforcing the recovery of unpaid contributions from April as it now employs for collecting tax and some 94 per cent. of national insurance contributions. It permits summary proceedings for the recovery of smaller debts in the magistrates' courts and gives authorised officials who are not lawyers the right to take county court procedures.
<P>
It is important to state that the procedures available to the Contributions Agency to deal with the other 6 per cent. of contributions are not so comprehensive as those available to the Inland Revenue for tax. Those contributions are primarily the flat-rate class 2 contributions paid by the self-employed and partly the class 1A contributions paid directly to the Contributions Agency.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The recently published report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the national insurance fund expresses concern about the high level of arrears on class 2 national insurance contributions. The Revenue's experience is that summary proceedings are an effective way to collect small debts and, indeed, likely to be the most effective way to collect unpaid class 2 contributions from the self-employed.
<P>
The proposals in the schedule directly addresses the concern of the Comptroller and Auditor General, as well as being fully justified in its own right as part of the streamlining of the administration of contributions in line with administration of income tax.
<P>
There is no Scottish equivalent of the proposal because provision has already been made under the Social Security Act 1998 for recovery action to be taken in Scotland. The proposals will extend to Northern Ireland, as a consequential amendment will be made to the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I want to make one observation on what the Minister has said. I have read the Library research paper and I am concerned that the Minister has repeated verbatim what Baroness Hollis said in another place. She has given the Committee no further justification of the schedule. That is a great pity and does the House a disservice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> The Minister has said that schedule 4 is intended to raise the provisions on the chasing of non-payment for the 6 per cent. of national insurance contributions that the Contributions Agency collects to the same level of penalty that is available to Inland Revenue officers in pursuit of the remaining 94 per cent. Therefore, she is making the Opposition's case for us; she is clearly beginning to treat contributions&#151;in this case their non-payment or late payment&#151;in exactly the same way as tax.
<P>
I am afraid that, although she went some way to reassure us in an earlier debate, she seems yet again to have given further support to our contention that behind the Bill is a thinly disguised agenda to integrate the contributions and tax systems, and the disguise is getting thinner by the minute. If the Government want that to be their policy, by all means let us discuss it. It is curious that, time and again, Ministers deny that it is their policy, yet as we proceed line by line through the Bill, it becomes increasingly clear that, to all intents and purposes, that is exactly what they are doing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I do not think that the Minister will be able to use a recycled brief from the House of Lords debate on the main point that I want to make because, as far as I know, it was not made in the other place.
<P>
First, may I say in a genuinely positive spirit that, if we have to have the Bill at all, there is much in the schedule that we would not object to. I think that procedures for summary proceedings before a magistrate can be a sensible weapon in the hands of the tax-collecting authorities or national insurance authorities&#151;sadly, the distinction between the two is being severely eroded, if not eliminated, under the Bill.
<P>
There are obvious benefits to the taxpayer or the defaulting national insurance contributor if the penalties are civil rather than criminal. Frankly, criminal penalties may not be appropriate to small businesses, which have not had an easy time since the Government came to power. Criminal law is not designed to pursue people who, in running their businesses in good faith, experience cash-flow difficulties, with many creditors clamouring at their doors. Nevertheless, the right of the national insurance system to collect its contributions must be respected. I see some advantage in extending the system currently used by the Inland Revenue to the collection of national insurance contributions.
<P>
My query about the schedule, which I should be grateful if the Minister would consider, relates to paragraph 5, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Proceedings may be brought for the recovery of . . . Class 1 or Class 1A contributions''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, employer contributions in respect of employees
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which the employer is liable to pay in respect of each employee and without specifying the employees in question''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provides scope for a fishing expedition on behalf of the Inland Revenue in collecting such contributions, and I am worried about that. It seems perfectly reasonable for the Inland Revenue to tell an employer that it has not received any class 1 national insurance contributions in respect of his employees, either from the employees, deducted from their salaries, or in respect of the employer's own liability. That seems quite reasonable. It may also be quite reasonable to demand an explanation as to why 10 employees have not been paid for although the remainder have. It is a bad principle that the Inland Revenue will now be responsible for collecting such contributions, and can approach an employer out of the blue, without knowing how many employees he has, or, indeed, knowing anything about them, wanting a fishing expedition to go through his books, thereby holding up his business and forcing him to incure gratuitous accountancy and professional charges. That is a bad principle, whether for tax or for national insurance collection. The two are being merged; we shall not reiterate the regrettability of that development.
<P>
The Conservative party is worried about providing any legislative scope for a bureaucratic or regulatory fishing expedition that involves the waste of public money and bureaucratic time and the often extremely unfair disruption of a totally honest and well managed business. No sanction is placed on the officials who launch such a fishing expedition, although they may cost thousands or tens of thousands of pounds to the business that they invade in such a fashion. I should be delighted to accept the schedule if it were followed by one that provided that the employer can claim back any expenses relating to an unjustified investigation. The Bill is being ram-raided through because of the Government's majority. We have already given the Inland Revenue the power to charge what expenses it likes to the national insurance fund for any recoveries that it makes. The Economic Secretary to the Treasury laughs, but she could not reassure us on that point. It would be nice if the employer targeted under the clause could claim back from the Inland Revenue any expenses incurrred as a result of an unjustified proceeding launched by the Inland Revenue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> My hon. Friend, characteristically, makes a powerful case. Would he care to reflect on the link between his argument and the fact that the Chancellor, when talking about the policy that the Bill implements, in his pre-Budget statement on 3 November 1998, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``So, from now on, every Government Department will have an obligation to encourage enterprise and entrepreneurs.''&#151;[Official Report, 3 November 1998; Vol. 318, c. 685.]?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is how the Chancellor justified the policy, yet it has the practical effect that my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford describes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Opposition Members are extremely worried about the new burdens constantly being placed on employers&#151;extraordinary things such as recovering student loans and the administration of the working families tax credit. Employers must now manage such matters, and will, presumably, be liable for any failings in the administration of those programmes. They will have to spend their shareholders' money setting up the systems, hiring people and getting the computers and software up and running. They will receive no mercy from the Inland Revenue if they make mistakes in such matters. There is no protection against proceedings that are unjustified and ill founded.
<P>
The schedule provides the basis for the Inland Revenue to start proceedings without specifying in respect of which employees it is claiming the money. If it has a claim, it must know in respect of which employees it is making that claim. Proceedings cannot be launched without knowing how many employees the firm has, the number of employees for which the firm has paid national insurance contributions, or whether it has not paid any national insurance contributions. It has to be known that the employees exist.
<P>
The schedule is far too widely drafted; it has no countervailing protections for employers. Unless the Economic Secretary can give us concrete reassurances, I am sure that Opposition Members will wish to vote against the schedule.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said that the schedule affects only 6 per cent. of national insurance contributions. Let me stress again that the Bill, and the schedule in particular, streamline the administration of national insurance contributions and income tax. It does not merge them.
<P>
It makes no sense to have two separate organisations with inconsistent legal powers, involved in collecting national insurance contributions. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is the least bit interested in reducing the administrative costs of the self-employed, but it does not make sense for them to have to deal with the DSS through the Contributions Agency for their class 2 contributions, but the Inland Revenue for their class 4 contributions. It is inefficient and bureaucratic, as the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer recognised in the Deregulation Task Force report.
<P>
The official Opposition need to be concerned about the administrative burden on the self-employed, as they need to be concerned about the efficient and effective collection of the remaining 6 per cent. of national insurance contributions, which should produce almost &#163;3 billion for the national insurance fund.
<P>
On the second point of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford about paragraph 5 of the schedule and his suggestion about fishing expeditions by the Inland Revenue, I wish to make it clear, as I did in my opening remarks, that paragraph 5 applies only when the liability for national insurance contributions has been established and accepted. If the employer believes that the amount that the Inland Revenue is claiming is not, in fact, due, he has appeal rights, which are set out elsewhere in social security legislation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> How, in the name of heaven, can a liability be established and accepted in relation to employees who have not been identified? That is how I read paragraph 5. One does not have to specify in respect of which employees the liability has been incurred. How can the liability be established and accepted? That is my problem.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> There are two separate parts to the procedure. The first is to establish the liability of the employer and, one hopes in most cases, that he will pay up. If he does not, the second part of the procedure relates to the recovery of the unpaid debt, for which all that is necessary is to specify the amount of the debt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): If the Bill were to follow the argument of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, would it not be a built-in way of protecting a black market?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The schedule will prevent the unscrupulous employer from using unnecessary and unjustified legal technicalities to try to avoid payment of an unpaid debt where the liability has been established in law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> No, I have already been generous.
<P>
I want to give an example of a situation where liability for unpaid contributions can be easily established without reference to the names and amounts of individual employees. Let me give the example of a large restaurant, where the inspector discovers that the employer has wrongly excluded service charges collected from diners and paid to the waiting staff in his calculation of the national insurance contributions due. It may be deliberate, or it may simply be a mistake.
<P>
It would be difficult, going back over time, to allocate the amount of service charge paid to each employee in any given week and therefore the amount of contributions due in relation to each employee for any given week. Indeed, where the employees are part time and earn less than the lower earnings limit, even the inclusion of the service charge would not bring them above the lower earnings limit. Therefore, there is not even a necessity, from the point of view of establishing their correct national insurance records, and hence their entitlement to national insurance contributory benefits, to allocate the unpaid national insurance contributions on the service charges to the individual employee. It is simply necessary to establish the total of the contributions due from the employer on the service charge and then ensure that that amount is paid to the fund.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I appreciate that the Economic Secretary is taking some trouble to answer my point, but sure she is wrong. We also noticed that she has had some help from her hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, riding to her rescue.
<P>
Surely it is necessary to establish how many of the waiters or waitresses are earning above the national insurance treshold. If they are all earning &#163;60 a week, none of them is due for employee contributions; and if it can be established that they are all earning below the employer or employee contribution threshold, no liability will arise. Therefore, it is necessary to know how many, if any, are earning above the contribution thresholds. We know that they will be brought together into one threshold from this April, but that does not change the susbtance of my point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman would keep his interventions to a reasonable length. I was beginning to wonder whether it was a speech or an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I apologise, Mr. Malins. I thought that it was a speech. I thought that the Economic Secretary had sat down.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I thought that the Economic Secretary had given way.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I had finished my speech.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I apologise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I was grateful to be able to make the point as a speech, because I realised that, in order to make it properly, it would be rather long as an intervention and I might try your patience, Mr. Malins.
<P>
I am contesting the idea that, to use the Economic Secretary's own expression, one can establish and accept that a liability exists in a vacuum, without any knowledge about the numbers or salaries of employees. No such thing can be established. One might have a suspicion, and there would be an investigation. The Revenue might send one of its plain clothes officers to have a meal in the restuarant concerned, tot up the number of waiters and waitresses and check out the number of contributions, but that is only the beginning of the investigation. It must then be clear that those employees are earning above the contribution thresholds. If they are not, no liability arises.
<P>
I shall keep an open mind on the issue, but so far I do not accept that there is a case for procedings to be launched and, to use the Economic Secretary's own expression, for a liability to be established and accepted, regardless of the identification of the employees in respect of whom the liability arises.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 4 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Powers Relating to Enforcement</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Clause 5 introduces schedule 5, which relates principally to the powers currently used by the Department of Social Security officers when visiting places of business to check or enforce matters relating to contributions, statutory sick pay and statutory maternity pay. It will allow Inland Revenue officers to exercise those powers after the transfer. Initially, they will be the former staff of the Contributions Agency, who will become officers of the Inland Revenue when functions are transferred. However, over time, as the field forces become more closely integrated and the necessary training has been delivered, former tax staff may also be allowed to use the powers when dealing with national insurance and tax matters.
<P>
Since the introduction of the national insurance scheme in 1948, authorised officers have had available to them the powers of inspection set out in section 110 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. The only significant change that we are introducing, to align with existing tax sanctions, is that failure to produce information or documents when required to do so by an authorised officer will cease to be a criminal offence, but instead will attract a civil penalty. I have no doubt that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford will welcome that in the light of his earlier remarks. It is a sensible move, as the powers will be exercised alongside existing powers of enforcement in relation to tax, which carry a monetary penalty.
<P>
In time, when officers have been trained to do both jobs, a single visit by a single officer will cover both national insurance contributions and PAYE. That will be a benefit to employers. It was the point particularly picked out by the shadow Chancellor in the Deregulation Task Force report 1994-95, where he called on Ministers to commit themselves to a merger of the field forces of the Inland Revenue and the Contributions Agency. I have no doubt that he is delighted that the Government are moving in that direction.
<P>
Clause 5 and schedule 5 transfer to the Revenue the inspection powers associated with national insurance and other functions that have long been available to police the schemes effectively, protecting employees' benefit positions. The Bill does not extend the existing powers, but merely transfers them. The threat of a criminal sanction is removed and replaced by a civil monetary penalty, which will be imposed only when employers deliberately refuse to supply lawful information. The civil penalty will be subject to full appeal rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Minister is still trying to run his particular hare&#151;perhaps I should refer to it as a fox; it is a dead fox&#151;which is the shadow Chancellor's participation in the previous Parliament's deregulation group. As I keep saying, he was not the shadow Chancellor or even a Member of Parliament. We shot that fox this morning, because we made it clear that that group believed that there would be savings to public funds from the merger of the Contributions Agency and the Inland Revenue. We established that, far from there being savings, there will be substantial net costs for as far ahead as we can see. Despite my repeated invitations, the Minister did not correct that conclusion, so clearly he accepts it. Therefore, we cannot run that one any more; it is dead. Indeed, you have heard reference already to it several times, Mr. Malins, and you may be pleased that it is dead. However, if it keeps coming back, it will increasingly embarrass the Minister, because I shall continue to remind him that this morning we established a point that he was unable to meet at all credibly, and reluctantly had to acknowledge.
<P>
I have a number of questions in relation to schedule 5, so it may be for the convenience of the Committee if we do not take issue with the clause. However, I reserve the right to recommend that my hon. Friends vote against schedule 5 stand part if the answers to our questions on the schedule are not satisfactory.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Enforcement</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Fifth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I have outlined the scope of the respective powers set out by the schedule and I shall not say more about them at this stage, but I am happy to answer any questions that Committee members may have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The passage to which I referred this morning in respect of schedule 1 again occurs in paragraph 12 of the schedule which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There shall be paid into the National Insurance Fund so much of any penalty imposed . . . as remains after deduction by the Inland Revenue of the administrative expenses attributable to its recovery.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the same point that schedule 1 makes. It is another window of opportunity for the Revenue, if it so chooses, to overcharge the national insurance fund.
<P>
The Economic Secretary responded by saying that the National Audit Office will look into the matter. Bureaucracy can get away with reallocating considerable funds within the Government machine, but I am not talking about malversation by individuals before the National Audit Office notices what is going on. The National Audit Office will find it difficult to second guess the Revenue's calculation of the amount of the recovered money that it should claim in respect of expenses.
<P>
I shall give an example that is germane to the discussion. Is the Revenue going to charge the variable costs of the investigation and proceedings, which might include overnight subsistence allowance for investigators who spend time in, say, Little Winding-on-the-Marsh in order to pursue a company that was in default of its national insurance contributions? Does it intend to recover the costs incurred through, for example, seeking external legal advice, or to recover a proportion of its fixed costs? Will its representatives say, ``Look, there's a whole investigation department here that makes calls on information technology services, so an entire section of our information technology budget needs to be covered. What is more, the Under-Secretaries, top nobs and members of the board are expensive people who run around in limousines, and part of that expenditure must be paid for from public funds.''
<P>
On what principal will those costs be charged? Will the Committee be given an answer, or must we wait until the Audit Commission conducts an investigation?

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Miller (Ellesmere Port and Neston)</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Perhaps the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston is about to give me an answer that the Government have so far declined to give.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> This morning, the hon. Gentleman sketched in the background to his merchant banking career. He will know that procedures exist in banking to determine the proper level at which customers should be charged, and that those procedures are subject to scrutiny and audit by the bank and the customer. Given his experience, he should have understood the Bill's simple premise that audit systems, checks and balances are inbuilt, including the venerable institution of the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, which has proved extremely helpful. It enables me to highlight the difference between the public sector case before us and the would-be analogy of the private sector that he has offered. In the market context of the private sector, there is a natural balance between buyer and seller. That is the very definition of the competitive market. Any business man who thinks that he can charge an unreasonable level of costs to his customers or clients is in for a nasty shock, because he will lose them. That is the one thing that one does not do.
<P>
If one is splitting costs with another firm, the other firm will try to ensure that it does not incur a disproportionate amount of the costs. Such things sometimes happen, but the two independent parties resolve the problem on the basis of equilibrium. The Bill will destroy that equilibrium&#151;there will no longer be an independent Department of Social Security and an independent Treasury or a balance between two independent Ministers of the Crown. Instead, one Minister of the Crown will be made subservient to another. A Department will be emasculated, and the Revenue will take over large parts of its operation. The rest of the Department will be made subject to Treasury decisions. I would be less worried if we still had an independent Department of Social Security that was proud of its role as a guardian of the integrity of the national insurance fund in the same way in which the Revenue is proud of its role as the guardian of income tax, corporation tax and other direct taxes&#151;which are a vital element in the revenue of the state&#151;and Customs and Excise is proud of its role. The Bill destroys such a role for the Department of Social Security.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston made an extremely valuable contribution. He highlighted the essential difference between the way in which expenses are normally allocated&#151;between independent organisations or between customer and supplier&#151;and the entirely arbitrary way, which is based on disproportionate power, in which the Inland Revenue will allocate them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Surely there is another crucial distinction between the public sector and the attempted anology with the private sector. We expect higher standards of transparency and accountability in the public sector than we do in the private sector. Procedures&#151;which may be in place&#151;therefore need to be set out clearly by Ministers, so that people may judge whether they are satisfactory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention. We will now see how much transparency there is. I have asked a simple question arising directly from paragraph 12 of the schedule. What will be the basis of allocation of costs? Will it merely be the variable costs that can be easily identified and charged, or will there be an attempt at a full cost allocation including a portion of the Inland Revenue's overheads. I do not think that the question can be much more simple. I hope that the Government understand the question fully; we will wait to see whether we get a serious answer. If they want to quarrel over that point, I shall be open-minded.
<P>
My other questions relate to the earlier part of the schedule&#151;it was right to address the end of the schedule first because it related directly to the point made by the Economic Secretary. Various curious matters arise from paragraph 3. The schedule provides the Inland Revenue with the power to enter premises at all reasonable times, but it does not say what happens if the Revenue's access is barred. Clearly that could be a problem when people are involved in ill-dealing, but even people who are running their businesses in a perfectly normal way might resent the intrusion of Inland Revenue inspectors. In either context, inspectors might be challenged to produce a warrant. According to my reading of it, the schedule does not say what action can be taken when the Revenue's access is barred. I am sure that there is a good answer to that; we should be given such an answer.
<P>
I was curious to find that, under paragraph 3(2)(c), an officer of the Inland Revenue has the power
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to examine, either alone or in the presence of any other person, as he thinks fit''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does any limitation apply? Can an officer of the Revenue take along his grandmother, or a journalist? That is a serious point&#151;there have been some instances of corruption involving law enforcement agencies in this country. We have had some nasty examples involving the police force, although not the Revenue so far as I know, bringing the press into their investigation.
<P>
Can this provide a legal basis for doing that? What is the phrase for? Why did the Government put it in? It should not be there if there is no purpose to it. We should not legislate wantonly and without thought and limitation. We should be conscious that every piece of legislation is a reduction in the liberty of the subject. We cannot therefore accept any provision in this schedule, in this Bill, or anywhere else that is otiose and restricts the liberty of the subject or provides a basis for the invasion of privacy unless there is a concrete or well-argued basis for doing that. We have not had one so far. What is the rationale for that and what limitations are going to be placed on the exercise of that power because certain conceivable versions of the exercise of that power could constitute a serious abuse?
<P>
The other question which it is important to get on the record, precisely because of these doubts and difficulties, is who will answer for this? The Revenue is using its powers and if there is a misuse of these powers who do we call to account? Is it the Chancellor of the Exchequer? Is it the Paymaster General? It is obviously not the Secretary of State for Social Security or the Minister of State, Department of Social Security or the Economic Secretary to the Treasury because they are giving away their powers in this area&#151;or at least I think they are as that is how I read th Bill. Is this some sort of legal function so we must have the Attorney-General or someone like that? Let us know exactly whose responsibility it is.
<P>
It is clear from my reading of the schedule that domestic parts of premises are somehow out of bounds for this investigation unless a business is believed to be carried on from there. That is paragraph 3(3) and that seems again to raise as many questions as it answers. I should like to know a little more about the sort of evidence the Revenue will have to bring forward to justify entering domestic premises. This protection should clearly be there. That goes to the heart of the issue of privacy.
<P>
Can the hon. Lady also tell us what sort of de facto guidance is being given to the Revenue on how it should distinguish between residential premises&#151;in non-bureaucratic language, someone's home&#151;and business premises? If we can have some clear answers to those questions we shall make some progress on the Bill. Otherwise I will have to come back because these matters are important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We may need to call on the fox to come back to life. It must be extremely galling for the shadow Chancellor to have argued persuasively in this report from 1994-95 that the field forces of the Contributions Agency and the Inland Revenue should be merged in order for people to deal with one organisation rather than two. Former Ministers, as he points out in the report, dallied over this. He said in 1995 that a decision ``should now be made '', yet in 1999 Conservative Members are still running the same old arguments and not recognising the great benefits enshrined in the proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> As he constantly refers, quite rightly, to the excellent judgment of the present Shadow Chancellor and the Institute of Directors, can we take it that he endorses their views on the social chapter, the single currency, the ``Fairness at Work'' White Paper or is he being a bit selective?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I agree with all the correct views of those organisations on all those matters. The argument in that report was particularly persuasive. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked about the allocation or cost to the national insurance fund. We have dealt with that matter exhaustively. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury spoke about that, my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) made helpful contributions and we discussed it in relation to schedule 1.
<P>
Expenses properly chargeable to the national insurance fund will be charged to it. There is a well-established procedure for doing that, and it is subject to the scrutiny of the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked about the Inland Revenue's overheads. Overheads can be charged on a reasonable basis, subject to the scrutiny of the National Audit Office. However, that is subject to a well-established procedure and must be properly accounted for, as all national fund matters have been for a very long time.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked about the regime for visits. I can provide clarification on that matter. Revenue officers will not have powers to make forcible entry into premises, but every effort will be made to continue the current practice of arranging visits that are convenient to the employer or the holder of records. It is important that officers can insist on being provided with information that is esssential to collect the contributions that Parliament has set out and that pay for people's benefits.
<P>
Baroness Hollis announced in another place that the Government will review the various powers of inspection that will be available to Inland Revenue officers visiting business premises for different purposes, with the aim of aligning those powers, except in cases in which there is good reason for them to be different.
<P>
Under existing legislation, the Secretary of State can enter into arrangements with other Government Departments whose officers are entitled to inspect premises for their own purposes. Under those arrangements, officers can deputise for the Secretary of State's own staff.
<P>
It will, however, still be possible for the Secretary of State to make arrangements with the Inland Revenue for officers to undertake inspections for benefit purposes at premises that they are inspecting for their own purposes. That will ensure that Contributions Agency inspectors' current role in carrying out visits to employers' premises to check on compliance with legislation administered by other DSS agencies may continue after the transfer of functions. Such visits may be made, for example, to check the details of earnings given by someone claiming an income-related benefit.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked about accountability and how Members of Parliament can address abuses of power. Of course, there is accountability to the Chancellor because Inland Revenue officials will be involved, and he will answer for their actions in the normal way.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> It may be convenient for the Committee if I give the Minister an opportunity to reply. His explanation of how the Inland Revenue might achieve powers to inspect premises against owners' wishes is so convoluted as to be mind-boggling. He said that the Secretary of State will have the power to allow the Contributions Agency&#151;which, under the Bill will no longer be the Contributions Agency and will become part of the Inland Revenue, for which the Secretary of State has no responsibility&#151;to carry out new responsibilities.
<P>
That does not make sense. The Contributions Agency will be handed over to the Revenue, which will be responsible for the collection of national insurance contributions. The Revenue will have to pursue investigations when employers are recalcitrant on class I and other employer contributions.
<P>
The Minister introduced a red herring into the discussion when he mentioned the misallocation of benefits. The Revenue will have to go back to the Secretary of State, who, after a few months, will have forgotten about the collection of national insurance contributions. That is absurd.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that that is the picture? If I have misunderstood the situation&#151;I cannot believe that I am the only Committee member to have done so&#151;will he provide clarification?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman may have misheard, but it remains possible for the Secretary of State to make arrangements with Inland Revnue so that officers can undertake inspections for benefit purposes. That would be the Secretary of State's interest. For contributions purposes, Inland Revenue officers would carry out the work on behalf of Inland Revenue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The situation remains confused. The Minister answered my questions by saying that the Government were reviewing all their powers in this sphere. Frankly, though, until we know what the powers are and how they will be exercised, we cannot have proper answers to questions such as what will happen if a recalcitrant employer closes the door to Inland Revenue. I no longer believe that we should proceed with the schedule, though a few minutes ago I thought it might be possible. In view of the obnoxious aspects of paragraph 12, I invite my hon. Friends to vote against the schedule.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Once again, the Government are trying rapidly to skip through an important issue of confidentiality. The Revenue in this country has a good reputation for confidentialilty&#151;unlike in some other countries where information acquired by the tax authorities can be misused for party political purposes. Even the Inland Revenue Service in America, which regards itself as an elite among taxing authorities, has been open to political manipulation and abuse. We remember what happend under President Nixon&#151;a shameful example, and it is splendid that the Revenue in this country have never adopted it.
<P>
We want to preserve this country's fine tradition and avoid any dilution of it. We also want to avoid any unnecessary extension of the number of people to whom information acquired in connection with raising taxation may be made available. A citizen making a full and honest disclosure of his affairs to the Revenue is entitled to do so in the knowledge that such information will not be misused. That is extremely important and a general concern about it is expressed in the Data Protection Act 1984, which I hope remains a matter of consensus between the parties. None of us wants a Kafkaesque, big-brother state through a computer system&#151;

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We want to ensure that the Bill, which is formally a measure of purely administrative readjustment, but which, in practice, reflects the Government's desire to run down the national insurance system, does not incorporate the additional and gratuitous evil of diluting or loosening the Inland Revenue's fine tradition of maintaining confidentiality about information that comes to its attention in the course of its duties. That principle will inform my contribution on clause 6, the schedule that it governs and clause 7, to which I tabled an amendment.
<P>
However, I shall make my detailed points on the schedule during the relevant debate and allow the clause to stand part of the Bill for the time being.

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My first question arises from genuine confusion. Why is the schedule included in the Bill? Why are the powers that clause 6 grants to the Board, and Schedule 6 gives to the Revenue, not included in clause 7? The schedule gives the Inland Revenue and the Department of Social Security powers to disclose information to each other on matters that affect some functions under clause 7.
<P>
Clause 7(2) lists those functions as:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``contributions, statutory sick pay and statutory maternity pay''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Schedule 6 provides for similar powers in the proposed change to section 121F of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. However, those functions are listed as:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``relating to social security, child support or war pensions''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill is organised in a confusing way. I do not know whether a nefarious motive lies behind that or whether it is simply a case of shambolic drafting. However, if a rationale exists, we deserve to know it. The confusion creates additional work for those who try to understand the Bill and, more importantly, it will create unnecessary work for the public when they try to comprehend the measure if it becomes and Act. Unfortunately, we cannot exclude that possibility.
<P>
Is the additional list of persons or bodies to whom information can be disclosed necessary? Paragraph 3 provides for proposed new&#151;section 122AA to the 1992 Act. It contains a list of the authorities to which information can be disclosed, including the Health and Safety Executive, the Government Actuary's Department and the Office for National Statistics. Clearly, those organisations should receive aggregated information, such as the number of people who receive a particular benefit, and the revenue of the national insurance fund. I shall be surprised if it continues to be called that if the Government have their way.
<P>
Such statistical matters should be recorded and made available. However, there is no need to make available personal information such as the fact that Mr. Bloggs pays so much in tax, or has a new wife and is claiming married man's allowance, or that Mr. Davies has manged to increase&#151;or perhaps reduce&#151;his income. Why should such information be given to various Departments? Perhaps it will not. But the Bill does not distinguish between aggregated, impersonal information and personal information. Such a distinction should be made. If the Government do not believe that, they should provide their reasons for that?
<P>
Paragraph 7 includes an ironic provision by which information will be allowed to come back to the Secretary of State for Social Security who, as we said, will be little more than a satrap of the Treasury under the proposed regime. That is information in respect of part III of the Bill which deals mainly with pensions. I take it, therefore, that it is information required to calculate people's benefits under the state earnings&#151;related pension scheme or the state retirement pension. I should be grateful to know why the provision is necessary and what it will be used for.
<P>
I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for waiting for my contribution before making her own. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I set out my questions first and the hon. Lady can respond to them in due time. I can make my other point more properly in our next debate.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for setting out his questions so clearly. I hope that I can reassure him that there is no nefarious purpose in the Bill or behind the division of functions between clause 6, schedule 6 and clause 7. The distinction between them is simply that clause 6 and schedule 6 deal with the transfer of information between Government Departments and public authorities. Clause 7, which we shall discuss later, deals with the transfer of information within the Inland Revenue and among those providing services to it. Clause 7 is internal and clause 6 and schedule 6 are external.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is not my reading of the schedule. I refer to paragraph 1 of the schedule and the proposed amendment to section 121F of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. Sub-paragraph (2), line 12 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Information to which this section applies may, and must if an officer of the Inland Revenue authorised by the Inland Revenue for the purposes of this section so requires, be supplied . . . to the Inland Revenue''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems to be a provision allowing the Inland Revenue to inform the Inland Revune. The hon. Lady said that the logical distinction between the schedule and clause 7 is that the clause deals with the provision of information within the Inland Revenue. If I am going wrong, can the hon. Lady explain why?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall do my best. Sub-paragraph (1) of section 121F states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This section applies to information which is held for the purposes of functions relating to social security, child support or war pensions . . . by the Secretary of State''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, the Secretary of State for Social Security&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``or the Northern Ireland Department, or . . . by a person providing services to the Secretary of State or the Northern Ireland Department``.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, schedule 6 deals with flows of information between Government Departments that are needed to allow the Inland Revenue, the DSS and other bodies to continue to carry out their functions following the merger of the Contributions Agency with the Inland Revenue. The boundaries between Departments will change as the Contributions Agency is merged with the Inland Revenue. Thus the powers to transfer information also need to change and schedule 6 deals with the transfer of information from the DSS in the case of section 121F or the Northern Ireland Department to the Inland Revenue after it has taken over and absorbed the Contributions Agency and from the Inland Revenue with its new Contributions Agency functions going out to the DSS or to other Departments. I hope I have made that point clear.
<P>
The central point about the schedule&#151;I make the point in relation to the other bodies, the Health and Safety Executive, the Government Actuary's Department and the others to which the hon. Gentleman refererred&#151;is that at the moment the Secretary of State for Social Security already provides the relevant information, which in many cases is aggregated, not individual, information to enable those other bodies to carry out their functions. What this schedule does is simply to ensure that after the merger with the Contributions Agency, the Inland Revenue will be able to continue to provide the same information for the same purposes. So there is no change in the purposes or the effects of the transfer of information, but a necessary change in the powers following the change in departmental boundaries.
<P>

</P>
<P>
I also want to stress that the schedule does not extend to the Inland Revenue the extensive powers of information exchange with, for example, local authorities that the previous Administration gave to the DSS in 1997. We were not convinced that such an extension was an essential part of a Bill that we intend simply to transfer present flows.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked specifically why a transfer of information would be needed from the Inland Revenue with its new powers back to the Secretary of State. That is required to enable the Secretary of State and the Benefits Agency within the DSS to establish the entitlement of a claimant to a contributions-based benefit. Normally, that would be achieved simply because both Departments will continue to have access to NIRS2, but the schedule provides the specific power to transfer that information.
<P>
I shall expand on the question concerning the Health and Safety Executive, which may require information to enable it to calculate mortality rates. That could require the transfer of information about specific individuals who suffer from industrial diseases. That information would be used by the Health and Safety Executive for the purposes of epidemiological analysis, but would not be published in a form that provides identifiable information. Personal information will be disclosed by the Inland Revenue only when it is essential for the receiving body to carry out its work. That is precisely the position now. The schedule transfers the existing powers from the Contributions Agency to the Inland Revenue.

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The Economic Secretary has satisfied my anxiety about paragraph 1. My initial reading of what was wrong. The Bill is so complicated that that is a danger into which not only I may fall. I wish it could be simplified, but I acknowledge that I was wrong.
<P>
The Economic Secretary also satisfied me on clause 7 and confirmed the explanation that I anticipated in my original question.
<P>
On the most imortant point that I raised, the Economic Secretary has not totally satisfied me. It refers to paragraph 3 and whether the Health and Safety Executive and the Government Actuary's Department will need to have personalised information. The example adduced by the hon. Lady aggravated my anxiety. She referred to the case of someone with a specific disease or disability. I understand that the details of that disease or disability and the life expectancy that flows from that might need to be transmitted to the Health and Safety Executive or to the Government Actuary's Department, which advises the Government on life expectancy, but I see no reason why such information should be personalised. If it does not need to be personalised, can we not have some protection to ensure that it is not personalised? Nothing is more intimate than someone's medical history and I see no reason why such agencies need to know the names of the people concerned. Will the Government consider that and, if they share my anxiety&#151;the Economic Secretary said that she does&#151;introduce an amendment on Report to provide such protection?
<P>
It is obvious that I am not going to get an answer to that question, so I must ask my hon. Friends to vote against the schedule.
