end add&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3) Nothing in
this Part of this Act shall affect the exercise or performance of the
general functions of the Board of Governors of the Museum assigned to
them by section 3 of the Museum of London Act
1965.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07011884000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Lady
Winterton. The Minister and all the Front-Bench spokesmen have
expressed their gratitude to Mr. O&#146;Hara for his
chairmanship of the Committee. I wish again to place on record our
thanks to you for the graceful way in which you have chaired our
proceedings and we look forward to serving under your chairmanship for
the duration of the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07011884000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the purpose of the amendment will be congenial to the Government. All
that we want to do is to provide the Museum of London and those
whouse the museum, in particular its governors,
withthe reassurance that is implicit in everything that the
Government have said so far but which, for the convenience of the
future trustees and of the Mayor, might be better written into the
Bill. The Minister said that, given that the Museum of London deals so
explicitly with London&#146;s history and culture, it makes sense in
devolutionary terms for its governance tobe in the hands of
the Greater London authority, particularly the Mayor. In broad terms,
we can see the logic of
that.</div>
					<a name="07011884000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
the Committee will be aware that other museums in London, such as the
Horniman museum, have a similar constitution to the Museum of London in
that they receive grant-in-aid funding from the Department for Culture,
Media and Sport but have a particular London focus that would not be
covered by the amendment. However, it is appropriate that the Museum of
London, because of its specific focus on London&#146;s history and
culture, which is not shared by the Horniman museum, should have the
benefit of the Mayor&#146;s closer
attention.</div>
					<a name="07011884000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the amendment is to deal with the role of the governors who might be
appointed by the Mayor in future. One of the issues on which we need
greater assurance is how the change of funding will not lead to a
diminution in the independence of the trustees and those charged with
the governance of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 290</div>Museum of London. Because grant will come fromthe Department
for Culture, Media and Sport to the Mayor and he will be responsible
for giving that grant to the Museum of London, worry has been expressed
that he might use the grant to bend the museum to his particular
ideological or cultural
preoccupations.</div>
					<a name="07011884000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all
know that culture policy can sometimes be used for ideological ends.
Whether in Vietnam, Cuba or St. Petersburg, museums that have been
erected by people or maintained by Administrations have been used not
so much to enlighten and inculcate a sense of pride in the
nation&#146;s history, but to press a particular ideological
agenda.</div>

							<b class="B">Stephen
Pound</b> (Ealing, North) (Lab): Good afternoon, Lady
Winterton. It is always a pleasure to serve at your feet. I ask the
hon. Gentleman to resist the temptation to paint a picture of the
national newt museum or the national comrade newt museum with which he
seems to be threatening us. The Horniman museum to which he referred is
different from the Museum of London in that it came from a trust on
behalf of a family who were originally tea dealers. The house dates
back about 200 years. The Museum of London goes back only to 1965,
which is why it has a different structure. Whereas there may be
charming and delightful aspects to the management of the Horniman
museum, they have grown up over hundreds of years. What we are
discussing is actually a pretty sensible structure for management, and
it is unlikely that it will become the Che Guevara friends of the newt
museum in the immediate
future.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000451"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
intervention. He underlined the difference in focus and history of the
Horniman museum from that of the Museum of London. My point was that
current funding arrangements for the Horniman museum and the Museum of
London are analogous and we accept that, because of the Museum of
London&#146;s distinctive status, it is appropriate that the Mayor
should exercise the role envisaged by the Bill for him or for
her.</div>
					<a name="07011884000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned Cuba
and Vietnam not least because those are two countries that I have
visited and whose museums I have had the opportunity to look at. What
is striking about the governance of both museums is that they tend to
portray one particular slant of the history of both countries in an
heroic light. Both museums also seek to demonise other nations in a
particular way. I admit that they are examples of museums used for
ideological purposes, which are at the further end of our
considerations, but it is not impossible for this Mayor, or a future
Mayor, to apply pressure through his control of the purse strings to
the trustees of the museum that might compromise their essential
independence. In pressing this amendment, we seek to secure a provision
in the Bill, and an assurance from the Minister, so that the trustees
will continue to enjoy the independence that they currently
enjoy.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07011884000452"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Slaughter</b> (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush)
(Lab): Having kept fairly close in previous sittings to the
brief as set out in the Bill, are we now getting on to the political
knockabout? That may dictate how I allocate my time over the rest of
this afternoon and how much attention I pay to what is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 291</div>said. If we are going to hear a lot about Hugo Chavez over the next
couple of hours, I have some correspondence to get on with. Will the
hon. Gentleman stick to the
Bill?</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000453"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and pleased to
add to his convenience in carrying on the voluminous correspondence
with his constituents, which is facilitated by the House of Commons
grant of an additional &#163;10,000 to all hon. Members enabling them
to maintain that close and intimate relationship. I shall not be
labouring points about Fidel Castro, Che Guevara or Hugo Chavez at this
point, but a new clause later on will give me an opportunity to return
specifically to that topic. That is not because the history of Latin
American revolution is close to my heart&#151;although it
is&#151;but because it is particularly close to the Mayor&#146;s
heart and he indulges that passion at the expense of London&#146;s
council tax payers. We want to safeguard them, rather than safeguarding
some 1968 image of the revolution. We will have an opportunity to
return to that matter when dealing with that new
clause.</div>

						<a name="07011884000454"></a>
							<b class="B">Martin
Linton</b> (Battersea) (Lab): Does the hon. Gentleman not
agree that the greatest danger to the Museum of London is not that the
Mayor or the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are trying to
influence it in respect of what it exhibits, but that they may suddenly
withdraw funding? Such a fate has caught up with a wonderful small
local history museum in the county courthouse in Garratt lane in
Wandsworth, which was closed quite peremptorily last week by Wandsworth
borough council as a misguided economy
measure.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000455"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I am unfamiliar with the details of
Wandsworth museum. The history of Wandsworth council&#146;s record of
a lower council tax than any other London borough&#151;lower, indeed,
than any other borough in the United Kingdom&#151;is one that all
hon. Members know and cherish. However, other aspects of the history of
Wandsworth and Battersea, not least the fact that Battersea was the
first constituency to elect a communist Member of
Parliament&#151;</div>

							<a name="07011884000457"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> Indeed. Such matters are best commemorated locally.
The Wandsworth museum may play a role in doing so, but it is not my
role to trespass on the appropriate decisions taken by the locally
elected and accountable members of Wandsworth borough
council.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000458"></a>Martin
Linton:
						</b> May I recommend that the hon. Gentleman pays that
museum a visit before it is closed? He will then be put right on two
things. Wandsworth borough council, for all the propaganda that it puts
through letterboxes, has not sought to set up a shrine to its low
council tax in the Wandsworth museum. In fact, I do not think that it
is mentioned at all. However, the hon. Gentleman will see the history
of Shapurji Saklatvala, a Labour and also a communist Member of
Parliament in the 1920s, although not the
first.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 292</div>
					<a name="07011884000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000459"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I note that
that former Member for Battersea was both Labour and communist: he was
not the first and I am sure&#151;looking at Committee members
today&#151;that he will not be
last.</div>
					<a name="07011884000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The funding
arrangement envisaged for the Museum of London would, essentially, mean
funding being split 50/50 between the Corporation of London and the
GLA. The GLA portion would, we understand, be a ring-fenced grant from
the DCMS. But how ring-fenced would that grant be? In addition to our
concern about the way in which the Mayor may use his funding for the
museum, potentially, to influence the trustees and the governance and
its contents, we are also concerned that he might say thank you to the
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport for that grant and then
say, &#147;The exigencies of governing London mean that I&#146;ve
got to raid it.&#148; That means that a larger burden potentially
falls on the Corporation of London, which may have to go to court to
ensure that the Mayor honours his commitment to spend the money that he
has been given appropriately. If it does not, it might have to pay
rather more than its fair share of the costs of the museum without
having the decisive say that the Mayor will have been given in the
appointment of governors.</div>
					<a name="07011884000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment seeks two
assurances from the Minister to the corporation, Londoners and future
trustees. First, will the money from the Department for Culture, Media
and Sport be effectively ring-fenced so that the corporation is not put
into an invidious position and the Mayor can ensure that money set
aside for the Museum of London stays there? Secondly, will the absolute
independence and integrity of the trustees and those charged with
governance of the Museum of London be protected against this Mayor or
any future Mayor who attempts to use that prestigious site to push an
agenda that is not in the interests of all
London?</div>

						<a name="07011884000460"></a>
							<b class="B">
								Michael
Fabricant</b> (Lichfield) (Con): Is it not apposite today,
given the statement of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport on the licence fee, to draw a comparison with BBC funding? The
BBC&#146;s integrity and independence are enshrined in the
Broadcasting Acts and its charter. Is not my hon. Friend asking for a
similar assurance? There is a precedent in the BBC. Funding is passed
on&#151;in the BBC&#146;s case, from the licence payer through the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Treasury, which sets
the licence fee&#151;ensuring independence and protection for the
BBC&#146;s board of governors. My hon. Friend is asking for similar
protection for the Museum of
London.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000461"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. He is well
known as a broadcasting expert in both legislative and operational
terms, and the distinction that he draws is valid. I appreciate that
throughout her time in office, the Secretary of State for Culture,
Media and Sport has had a lively appreciation of how BBC governance can
effectively ensure its operational independence.</div>
					<a name="07011884000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I emphasise that existing
legislation produced and presided over by this Government provides an
effective guarantee. The Bill has raised doubts in some
people&#146;s
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 293</div>
						minds as to whether those guarantees will be kept as
secure as they are at the moment. I am sure that the Minister will want
to reassure us that the Government will be consistent in maintaining
their integrity, and I hope that she will accept the amendment in that
spirit.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000462"></a>The
Minister for Housing and Planning (Yvette Cooper):
						</b> Hon.
Members have asked a series of questions connected with the amendment,
and I will try to respond to them. It is the Government&#146;s
intention, as the amendment says,
that:</div>
					<a name="07011884000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nothing
in this Part of this Act shall affect the exercise or performance of
the general functions of the Board of Governors of the Museum assigned
to them by section 3 of the Museum of London Act
1965&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011884000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reiterate the
amendment&#146;s wording to put it on the parliamentary record
because that is certainly the intention behind the clauses. We do not,
however, believe that the amendment is needed. It is unnecessary
because it restates the impact of our proposals.</div>
					<a name="07011884000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will not give the GLA
and the Mayor any greater power respecting the museum than the
Government have under the Museum of London Act 1965, which
clearly establishes the board of governors&#146; functions and powers
in relation to the museum&#146;s operations. They include all matters
of the care and display of collections, the employment of staff, the
loan, acquisition and disposal of objects, the provision of
archaeological services and the kinds of exhibition run. None of that
will change as a result of the Bill. It will merely amend the 1965 Act
to replace references to the Secretary of State with references to the
GLA.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000415"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07011884000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
raised specific questions about the appointments process. The nine
board members currently appointed by the Prime Minister will in future
be appointed by the Mayor, but the City of London will continue to
appoint the other nine members to maintain a balance on the board. The
museum will continue to be a charity and thus will be bound to ensure
that it complies with its duties as set out in the
Act.</div>
				
					<a name="07011884000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as the funding is concerned, clause 43(5) requires the GLA to pay a
sum equal to that given to the museum by the City of London, unless
both parties agree that they should pay a different proportion of the
expenses incurred by the museum. The City, however, is not obliged to
match extra funding provided by the GLA unless it so chooses. So in
fact there are far greater obligations on the GLA than on the City to
ensure that funding is in
place.</div>
					<a name="07011884000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think that
the appropriate measures are in place to ensure that the current
arrangements and operating procedures of the board and of the museum
will continue, but we think that it is right that the current functions
exercised by Government Departments and by the Prime Minister should be
exercised by the Mayor instead. On that basis I ask the hon. Member for
Surrey Heath to withdraw his amendment.</div>

They are broadly along the lines that we had hoped for. I must enter a
note of personal regret, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 294</div>however. The Minister said that our amendment was captured by the spirit
of her remarks, and so I believe it was. There is, therefore, no
objection in principle to our amendment. So far in my 18 months in the
House, I have had absolutely no luck in getting my name scribbled into
the statute book. Given that the Minister agrees with my amendment, I
had thought that perhaps I would have the opportunity to tell my mum
that I had changed Government legislation. My mum will be disappointed
to know that, even when the Government agree with me 100 per cent.,
they still will not give me the credit. Nevertheless, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

					<a name="07011884000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once again, Lady
Winterton. The position that the London assembly took on clause 48 was
that it was very supportive of the principle behind the provisions and,
clearly, there are many efficiencies to be secured by sharing services
within the GLA group. I take this opportunity to put on record the
credit that is due to the chief finance officer of the GLA, Anne
McMeel, for the very good work that she is undertaking in that area to
secure the best efficiencies, by the working together of the GLA family
constituent bodies.</div>
					<a name="07011884000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The assembly is concerned to
ensure that it is not denied access to resources that are currently
shared by the Mayor and the assembly. That covers a range of important
support services, such as financial, legal, procurement and human
resources advice, together with information and technology services
and, indeed, library services. If some of the services are undertaken
for the strategic GLA by a constituent body, such as Transport for
London, there is a risk that sufficient safeguards would not exist to
ensure that the assembly continues to be provided with adequate support
services.</div>
					<a name="07011884000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed putting a cap on the assembly&#146;s budget, but amendments
have also considered a floor. I know that the Government did not accept
them, but it seems a reasonable idea. The amendment would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 295</div>
						mitigate the risk to resources expected to be
applied to the assembly and ensure that they are safeguarded and
guaranteed.</div>

							<a name="07011884000465"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> The Government recognise the intentions behind the
amendment, but we believe that the changes are unnecessary. The
amendment would place additional duties on the GLA and any other
constituent functional body in delegating back-office functions to each
other and would require those constituent bodies to have regard to the
others&#146; needs and requirements. Proposed subsection (9) would
require the Mayor to ensure that the GLA secures adequate resources
from a functional body before entering into an arrangement with
it.</div>
					<a name="07011884000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (10)
defines the Mayor and assembly, rather than the GLA as a whole, as
constituent bodies. We do not think that its overall impact is
necessary to the Bill. For a start, any arrangement between the
constituent bodies concerning back-office functions would be made only
with the agreement of those bodies, so they will be able to take into
account each others&#146; needs and ensure that their own
requirements are properly
safeguarded.</div>
					<a name="07011884000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally,
we find it hard to envisage that the Mayor would agree to take on a
functional body&#146;s back-office functions without securing
adequate resources to do so from the body concerned. In any event, it
is the Mayor and assembly who set those bodies&#146; functional
budgets, and they will be able to take into account any transfer of
back-office functions in doing
so.</div>

							<a name="07011884000466"></a>Mr.
Pelling:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for accepting many
of the points made, although she does not consider it necessary to make
the change. The circumstances are particular because of how the
budgetary process is agreed in the assembly, as we have discussed
during debate on other clauses. Because the assembly must decide by a
two-thirds majority, it is possible for the assembly&#146;s budget to
be decided by the blocking third minority. It is therefore likely that
any Mayor supported by that blocking minority could direct that
significant resources should be withdrawn from the assembly while
securing efficiencies by working with GLA family
bodies.</div>

assembly&#146;s role and the Mayor&#146;s role in determining the
budget. The Government think that there are adequate safeguards to
ensure that the assembly has the resources it needs and can exercise
its scrutiny function
properly.</div>
					<a name="07011884000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
reference to the proposals, we should recognise that back-office
functions at city hall are already usually shared between the Mayor and
the assembly. The clause will require the Mayor to consult the assembly
before entering into any arrangement for the GLA to delegate or take on
functional bodies&#146; back-office functions. The assembly will also
be free to agree protocols or service level agreements with any
functional body that provides a back-office function for the
GLA.</div>
					<a name="07011884000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think that
the amendment&#146;s intentions are already captured in the Bill. A
series of appropriate mechanisms&#151;protocols, existing
arrangements, the budget and the Mayor&#146;s requirement to
consult&#151;will provide the kind of safeguard that hon. Members
require.</div>

								Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): I shall be brief.
We have already discussed the assembly&#146;s situation in relation
to consultation. Provided that the Mayor meets the requirements of the
other clauses that we have agreed will stand part of the Bill, the
Mayor can ignore the assembly. So the safeguard is not much of a
safeguard. Does the Minister accept that when one is dealing with, for
example, the assembly&#146;s ability to access human resources advice
and support, or legal advice&#151;which is particularly
important&#151;or financial advice, it is important that the assembly
have some guarantee of access? There is already discussion&#151;in
broad terms I support it&#151;on consolidating the legal arrangements
under Transport for London rather than under the core GLA. It would
make sense if the assembly had more than the right to be consulted, if
it is to guarantee itself access to legal advice on the functions of
the organisation of which it is
part.</div>

							<a name="07011884000469"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> We think that the existing arrangements will be
sufficient, although there are additional proposals on protocols and on
the budget. What we are discussing is merely the ability to combine
back-office functions to deliver services, rather than proposals to
reduce, change or amend the services that are provided. The measure is
simply a practical one and we do not believe that the additional
amendments are required. On that basis I ask the hon. Member for

							<a name="07011884000487"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I wish to express my pleasure at seeing you back in
the Chair for the remainder of the Bill&#146;s progress, Lady
Winterton. I hope that the proceedings 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 298</div>will not take too long, but the topic under discussion is particularly
important. This package of amendments and new clauses, on which we
shall want to vote at the appropriate time, is central to
policing.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
many ways, policing is one of the key areas of the GLA group&#146;s
responsibility and the way in which it is handled at the moment is
needlessly diffuse. Policing is regularly in the top one or two worries
of Londoners. Polls regard it as very important. Successful policing in
London is vital to the future of the city and our amendments would
strengthen the role of the Mayor in it. I hope that our approach gives
the lie to earlier suggestions that we are opposed to a strategic
authority. We are not. We want to make sure that it and the Mayor as
its elected strategic head concentrate on matters that are genuinely
strategic and can clearly only be delivered sensibly on a pan-London
basis. Policing manifestly fits that bill. That is why we are worried
that the present arrangements are something of a
hotch-potch.</div>
					<a name="07011884000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Everyone
expects the Mayor of London to have a keen interest and involvement in
policing. The Government have said before during our proceedings that
they are wedded to the strong mayor model. Looking at the experience
particularly of north America, a strong mayor model suggests to most
ordinary Londoners and observers a direct involvement in policing
matters. Everyone thinks of Rudolph Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg in
New York. What do they know about them? There was a problem with
policing in New York. Mayor Giuliani was elected; Mayor Giuliani was
the man who was credited with fixing it. Had he got it wrong, he would
have paid the penalty by losing
office.</div>
					<a name="07011884000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems that
city-dwellers strongly link the idea of a strong, executive Mayor with
the idea that that person should be answerable for policing and
community safety issues. We should not think in terms of narrow
policing, but as a broader point, people expect that direct
linkage.</div>
					<a name="07011884000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we ask the
average Londoner what the Mayor should do, the answer would be that he
should certainly sort out transport and policing, and make sure that
the streets are safe. Worry about safety throughout the city is
regularly at the top of Londoners&#146; concerns; although we might
disagree about some of the detail, it is something on which there is a
consensus. Safety is vital to any civilised city and for London to
maintain its pre-eminence as a world city&#151;some would say,
&#147;the&#148; world city&#151;getting it safe is crucial.
People would expect that the Mayor should have direction of that key
policy, but in fact the system does not give him that clear and
transparent direction or a clear sense of accountability. That position
might have arisen, as is often the way, deep in the mists of the
discussions in the Government when the original scheme for the
legislation was pulled
together.</div>
					<a name="07011884000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
observed earlier in Committee, there is no particular magic to the
composition of any of the functional bodies. They evolved perhaps for
historic purposes and for functional reasons. Nor is there particular
magic in the composition of the policy authority. The fact that we have
a police authority for London is, I concede, an improvement on the
position when the Home Secretary was the police authority. That is a
step in the right direction, which is why I was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 299</div>willing to argue the case for a London-wide city governance when it was
not always fashionable to do so in my party. I do not criticise the
work of members of the Metropolitan Police Authority. I could hardly do
that, since I am one of its members. However, that does not alter the
fact that accountability is not straightforward, and not as good as it
could be. We are seeking to improve the means by which policing is
welded into the mainstream of mayoral functions and city
government.</div>
					<a name="07011884000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tony
Travers, the academic to whom we referred earlier, said that the
structure that came out of the discussions between various Government
Departments on how the new Greater London authority should be set up
leaves something of a mangle. It is clear to anyone who has read the
literature, or who has looked at the history of the matter, that the
Home Office fought like a cat in a sack to avoid the handover of
significant policing powers to London.</div>
					<a name="07011884000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I give credit to the right hon.
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) for his
work on the Greater London Authority Act 1999, because he managed to
fight off some of the rearguard action of the Home Office. Now, six
years after the event, weare seeking to go further toward the
logic that that right hon. Gentleman may have had in mind, namely that
people expect the Mayor to have executive responsibility for policing.
By executive responsibility, I do not mean operational control. In our
system, politicians do not have operational control of the police at
any level, and neither should they. Executive responsibility should be
executive in the sense that the Mayor should be intimately involved in
the appointment of the commissioner and other key staff, give the
strategic overview and thrust to policing in London, and be the person
who is politically accountable, who carries the can for policing in
London. That is what we are seeking to do here. The system, despite its
good intentions and its halfway move forward, is difficult.</div>
					<a name="07011884000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr. Travers, in his
useful book, &#147;The Politics of London&#148;, refers to a
four-way split of accountability for policing, something that I think
no one would dispute. We have the Mayor, who has responsibility for
setting the budget, and for appointing some members of the Metropolitan
Police Authority. He is also consulted on the appointment of the
commissioner. The assembly has an involvement. Assembly members are
accountable, in a sense, because they set the budget. Of course,
without rehashing our earlier discussions, the assembly can only set
the budget on high-level terms, and cannot get into the detail. Some
members of the assembly serve on the authority and others do not,
meaning that the accountability of assembly members to their
constituents on policing matters varies. Because I happen to be a
member of the authority, it is much easier for me to take up issues of
policing in Bexley and Bromley than it is for, say, my hon. Friend the
Member for Croydon, Central, who does not have the same ease of access.
Is that situation logical?</div>
					<a name="07011884000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Metropolitan Police
Authority itself has responsibility. It carries out certain limited,
non-operational executive functions, and has a scrutinyrole.
In practice, however, the scrutiny role of the authority&#151;its
members would concede&#151;is much less developed than the scrutiny
role of the assembly. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 300</div>current chair of the authority, an old and respected friend of myself
and the Minister, is conscious of that situation, and has sought to
improve it since he took over. The fact is that the scrutiny role of
the MPA is much less than one might expect.</div>
					<a name="07011884000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final strand of
accountability is the commissioner himself. He is responsible for
day-to-day operations and has a line of accountability not only to the
Mayor, the authority and the assembly, but to the Home Secretary, who
sits somewhere in all of this as well. That is inevitable because of
London&#146;s position as the capital city, but we could make things
a lot easier with a little rationalisation, which is what we are
suggesting.</div>
					<a name="07011884000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Against
the background of at least four and arguably five lines of
accountability for London, it is not easy for Mr.,
Mrs. or Ms Londoner to know who carries the can if anything
goes wrong with policing in London, or who should have the praise when
things go well. Who is ultimately accountable? It could, in theory, be
any one or any mixture of those. That does not sit well with the
Government&#146;s apparent commitment to improving accountability and
transparency in service delivery, something that we agree with in
principle.</div>
					<a name="07011884000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that
reason, it is not surprising that the previous Metropolitan Police
Commissioner, Sir John Stevens, now Lord Stevens, has said himself on a
numberof occasions that he found the accountability
arrangements difficult to deal with. Once he said to the
assembly&#146;s budget committee in some exasperation, &#147;I
don&#146;t know who I&#146;m supposed to be accountable
for.&#148; I do not think that it was entirely in jest. The situation
is needlessly confused. If Lord Stevens felt that, I suspect that the
average London resident does as
well.</div>
					<a name="07011884000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite the best
of intentions in trying to find a compromise that would satisfy the
Home Office and the other conflicting Departments and could be
reconciled with the Government&#146;s desire for city-wide
governance, perhaps part of the error lay in saying that the
Metropolitan Police Authority should try to replicate as far as it
could in London the Government system for police authorities
elsewhere&#151;a certain number of &#147;local authority&#148; or
equivalent assembly members, some magistrates and some independents.
That is why it differs from the London Fire and Emergency Planning
Authority, which had an established model involving borough councillors
instead. One might think that LFEPA would have been a better model for
a separate functional body system in London.</div>
					<a name="07011884000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The error was to assume that
what works and is appropriate elsewhere in the country should be
appropriate in London. We argue that it is not. London is unique in
size and complexity. It is not necessary to have the same governance
structure here as in the rest of the country for governing the city or
delivering services such as policing. The GLA was intended to be a
unique solution to a unique situation. London is by far the largest
city in western Europe and one of the largest in the western world, and
it needs its own tailor-made
structures.</div>
					<a name="07011884000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
structures should have democratic accountability. That accountability
is provided by the Mayor and the assembly, both of which have mandates.
That is why we propose effectively to place the Mayor and the assembly
as the police authority for London, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 301</div>and that is how the new clauses are structured. Executive power would go
to the Mayor, as most people would expect, as well as the MPA&#146;s
executive functions. The Mayor would not gain any greater operational
control, but accountability would clearly focus on him. When he stands
for election saying, &#147;I am going to do something about policing
in London,&#148; it will be a pledge that he cannot get away from,
because it will be his legal
responsibility.</div>
					<a name="07011884000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Scrutiny,
which is vital and could be improved, falls to the assembly, which the
Government concede is a scrutiny body meant to deal with such issues.
Our proposed system fits very well with the Government&#146;s own
rhetoric earlier in the Committee&#146;s proceedings. It would mean
that all London assembly members could scrutinise the work of the
police. Every constituency member will have the same degree of access,
and members elected on a London-wide, non-constituency basis&#151;the
argument being that they will be able to represent more broadly with a
non-geographic constituency&#151;would have the same access and
ability. I submit that that would give much better and more logical
scrutiny, as the entire assembly would be
involved.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07011884000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We accept that
the particular role of magistrates should be preserved, so we have
provided for an entrenched committee, which I shall come to in a
moment. Under the current arrangement, the Mayor negotiates with the
MPA, which then makes a budget bid to the Mayor. We say that the Mayor
has the executive power&#151;that is explicit in the new
clause&#151;and he would set the policing component of the budget.
That would be scrutinised by the assembly and the budget process would
then take place. Nothing would change in that respect. There would
still be a separate policing component within which the Mayor would
doubtless negotiate with the commissioner and the assembly&#146;s
police committee.</div>
					<a name="07011884000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 23 would set up a specific police committee. There are two
reasons for doing that: the particular importance of policing, which is
the No. 1 or No. 2 concern of Londoners, and the fact that policing is
the service that consumes two thirds of the council tax precept, so it
is particularly appropriate that there should be a specific safeguard
on police
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07011884000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The assembly
has, voluntarily, a transport committee to scrutinise the work of
Transport for London, but under the proposal it would be obliged to
have a police committee, whose members would of course all have
democratic mandates. To preserve the particular, valuable insight that
can be given by magistrate members, we propose that that
committee&#151;uniquely of those in the GLA&#151;should have four
co-opted magistrate members who could be involved in the deliberations.
That would preserve an analogy with other UK practice, but tailor the
situation to the circumstances in
London.</div>
					<a name="07011884000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
propose independent members, because we think that the wide range of
experience of all25 assembly members adequately covers the
experience that might be required through independent members if there
was a narrower so-called political membership. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 302</div>I respect the work of my independent colleagues on the police authority,
but the key point is that they have no mandate from anyone, other than
through a process of selection and appointment. Under our system,
everybody with executive control&#151;the Mayor&#151;or who was
involved in scrutiny in the assembly would have a democratic mandate,
which would make policing for London more transparent and accountable,
and reduce some of the bureaucracy that has resulted from the
compromise that we suspect represents the gestation of the current
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07011884000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
the thinking, and we submit that it accords well with the
Government&#146;s logic. We therefore invite them to accept the
amendment, which would enhance delivery of policing and allow Londoners
to feel that there was a clear chain of responsibility that they could
call upon when
necessary.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000488"></a>Mr.
Pelling:
						</b> I am happy to support my hon. Friend. It is
interesting to note the comments made by Tony Travers in the book to
which my hon. Friend referred; he is very critical of the assembly in
not scrutinising the work of the Metropolitan
police.</div>
					<a name="07011884000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to pass on some recollections of how the assembly kicked off
on the issue of policing scrutiny, so that Committee colleagues
understand how the establishment of a separate Metropolitan Police
Authority made it difficult for assembly members to hold the police
service to account in the way that they would have expected a London
authority to do. The Metropolitan Police Service was very willing to
give an initial briefing to assembly members, but one of the key
messages from that briefing in the first week of the London
assembly&#146;s existence in 2000 was that the police service did not
believe that the Greater London Authority Act 1999 provided the
assembly with any role in the scrutiny of police service performance.
As far as it was concerned, that was specifically the role of the
Metropolitan Police Authority and its board, not assembly
members.</div>
					<a name="07011884000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">That culture
was further enforced by the approach that the current Mayor took on
police service accountability, which may well have developed because it
was important to be able to create the political capital required for
his credibility. Bearing in mind his&#151;and perhaps Lee
Jasper&#146;s&#151;alleged baggage in their approaches to the
police service, his style was that he had nothing to do with the
operation of the police service and was not accountable to the assembly
forit, because virtually everything that it did was an
operational matter on which he was not accountable. If London assembly
members want to ask questions about the performance of particular
borough commands or specific parts of the police service, the
Mayor&#146;s response is that it is not his responsibility, but that
of the
commissioner.</div>
					<a name="07011884000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst also referred to the
first experience of the assembly&#146;s budget committee in dealing
with the then commissioner, Lord Stevens. He turned up with as much
regalia as possible dripping from his uniform so as to intimidate
members of the assembly&#146;s budget committee. More importantly, he
gave us a strong message that he was sick and tired of being
accountable to the Home Secretary, the Mayor, the London assembly, its
budget committee and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 303</div>
						Metropolitan Police Authority. Such a diffusion of
accountability means that there is no worthwhile accountability at
all.</div>

							<a name="07011884000489"></a>Stephen
Pound:
						</b> Far be it from me to correct the hon. Gentleman,
but only those in the monarchy wear regalia. He may have been referring
to insignia. On the substance of his amendment, does he accept that
there was a time, when I was first elected to the House, when the only
opportunity to discuss these matters was in the annual debate on
policing in London, on a motion tabled by the Home Secretary? That was
outrageous. Therefore, there may be problems for people such as Lord
Stevens, but does the hon. Gentleman not at least accept that it is
vastly better to have a little too much democracy, rather than the
previous system, under which there was a massive democratic
deficit?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000494"></a>Mr.
Pelling:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has been watching too many
films. I would accept that there was a significant democratic deficit.
Indeed, it led to a great deal of additional inefficiency in the
Metropolitan police, which was turning up to the Home Secretary every
year and saying, &#147;Terribly sorry, we have overspent, so would
you mind making up that financial deficit?&#148; However, it is not a
sufficient argument to say that there was a democratic deficit before
and that we should not close it entirely by having a more democratic,
direct fulfilment of that
deficit.</div>
					<a name="07011884000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The response
given by Lord Stevens on that occasion showed just how ridiculous those
demands were in terms of the diffusion of accountability. It meant that
none of those groups was in a strong position to call for proper
accountability. Those issues are important when there are problems with
police service performance and, in particular, crime clear-up rates in
London, which unfortunately are spectacularly low. We cannot fulfil the
electorate&#146;s desire to put direct pressure on those they elect
to increase the police service&#146;s
performance.</div>
					<a name="07011884000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">So much
diffusion of accountability results in a feeling among Londoners that
they cannot hold their police service to account. An example that is
causing a great deal of controversy is the safer neighbourhood panels
being established in the context of the much-welcomed safer
neighbourhood teams. The police service itself is appointing
representatives to the panels that will hold it to account. I have been
so uncharitable as to describe the panels as unelected
soviets.</div>
					<a name="07011884000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						What
is particularly galling to elected representatives, whether they be
London assembly members or Members of Parliament, is that when they ask
about particular priorities in their neighbourhoods, the response is
often 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 304</div>that those self-appointed panels will set the priorities for
neighbourhood policing in their wards. The elected representatives will
have no role or input. Indeed, the commissioner&#146;s guidelines
state that politicians, whether councillors or MPs, should be
specifically excluded from the process. The accountability issues are
very real.</div>
					<a name="07011884000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">One might
have expected the Metropolitan Police Authority to be effective in its
scrutiny role, but my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst has referred to how the MPA has fallen short in that
regard. I am not surprised that that has happened. I have a great deal
of sympathy for my colleagues who have served on the MPA. Like
Ministers&#151;who, weighed down by red boxes, might be distracted
from key issues&#151;their agenda has often been set well in terms of
its weight and no end of visits to be made. In many ways, the MPA has
been happy to act as a loyal supporters&#146; club for the
commissioner rather than as an effective scrutiny
body.</div>
					<a name="07011884000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have taken a
radical approach to the Bill, and our amendments are part of that
process. Our proposals are democratic and fit in with the Conservative
party&#146;s approach in other parts of the UK&#151;we seek direct
election of chief commissioners accountable for policing. It is only
logical that the Mayor should provide that role in
London.</div>
					<a name="07011884000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make a
brief detour by saying how muchwe value your chairmanship,
Lady Winterton, and contrast it with that of the chairman of the
assembly, who has recently joined us and who has a direct approach with
witnesses before the assembly, as was shown yesterday. Conservatives
support that strongly. It shows the robustness of the democratic
process in the London
assembly.</div>
					<a name="07011884000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
sought to maintain responsibilities for planning and housing at the
local government level, the lowest level of government, and to devolve
powers from the Government office for London and from the Government in
areas such as learning and skills and the national health service. The
amendments offer the Committee the opportunity to secure a radical
reform of London&#146;s governance that would provide for direct
accountability for performance in the police
service.</div>

							<b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): It isa
pleasure to see you here this afternoon, Lady Winterton. Given
Mr. O&#146;Hara&#146;s departure, I was worried that the
Committee might be left rudderless, but clearly that is not the
case.</div>
					<a name="07011884000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some amendments
and new clauses in the group are interesting. The worry about the
amendments tabled by the hon. Gentlemen who have just spoken is that
they are perhaps a step too far in the direction of giving the Mayor
executive power. Their argument suggested that the Mayor would simply
become the person who was accountable for, rather than having
operational responsibility for, the Metropolitan Police Service. There
is anxiety that, by their very nature, Mayors might be interested in
more power, not less. I can foresee circumstances in which a Mayor who
feels the pressure of an underperforming police service might consider
that he or she wants to grasp more operational control over the service
than people deem to be acceptable.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 305</div>
					<a name="07011884000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause tabled by the
hon. Member for Surrey Heath about the appointment of seven borough
representatives has been withdrawn. The only point that I would make
therefore is that, had it been discussed, we would have supported it.
The move towards borough-based policing with safer neighbourhood teams
with active involvement of the boroughs on the ground suggests that it
would be entirely appropriate for borough representatives to be part of
the Metropolitan Police Authority, although I recognise the important
role that independents have played. There is an issue about the
democratic deficit that applies with the role of independents on the
police authority.</div>
					<a name="07011884000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
the withdrawal of new clause 9, I shall touch briefly on new clause 45.
I have not withdrawn it, unless someone else has done so without my
knowledge. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath talked earlier about how
his mother was watching his progress carefully in this place and said
that he wanted to give her a concrete example of his achievements since
his election, such as an amendment that was his own. Well, my mother
also follows carefully my progress in Parliament. She has done so
during the past 10 years and I think that she probably has a more
realistic view than the hon. Gentleman&#146;s mother about the
success of Opposition Members in identifying amendments that they can
claim as their own. However, new clause 45 may give me the opportunity
to do so. It has the unanimous support of assembly members and I hope,
therefore, the support of the Government.</div>

					<a name="07011884000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 45 would make a simple change. I hope that the Government will
consider that it is reasonable. It is entirely in keeping with our
debate about giving the Mayor greater control over things for which he
is rightly responsible. Under the 1999 Act, the deputy Mayor must be a
member of the Metropolitan Police Authority. We must question why that
is the case. It would be appropriate for the deputy Mayor to be a
member of the Metropolitan Police Authority, but I do not understand
why it is a
requirement.</div>

							<a name="07011884000500"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is making an excellent speech in
pursuit of his analysis of our amendments and new clauses. In the
unfortunate absence of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough, the
traditional role of Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of
State has now passed to the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 306</div>Shepherd's Bush, who will no doubt construe that as a reward for his
loyalty in the debate about a single waste authority for
London.</div>

from the downcast looks on the faces of the hon. Members for Mitcham

support for the Government has not yet been rewarded as the hon. Member
for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush has shown it can

as an endorsement of what I am
advocating.</div>
					<a name="07011884000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
serious point is that there is no strong argument for the deputy Mayor
having to be a member of the MPA. As my colleagues on the GLA have
pointed out, in the past six years or thereabouts the deputy Mayor has
not been able to play a greater role than she might have on the MPA
because she has had other significant interests. The fact that the
Police Act 1996 requires her to be a member of the MPA has stopped the
Mayor from having a third active member representing the Labour party
on that authority. That is one simple reason why I hope that the
Government will support the amendment, which would enable the Mayor,
their supporter and fan, to have a third active member representing him
on the MPA. This straightforward proposal would create an opportunity
for someone who has time and commitment to focus on the role and is not
distracted by other important
matters.</div>
					<a name="07011884000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause is about devolving power to the Mayor, and the Government say
that they want to take power from central Government and hand it to the
Mayor. Allowing the Mayor to determine the responsibilities of his or
her deputy would be entirely straightforward. For once, I am absolutely
convinced that when the Minister responds and clarifies the
Government&#146;s position on new clause 45, it will turn out that I
have their full
support.</div>

					<a name="07011884000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Policing
in England and Wales is managed through a tripartite arrangement that

independence to chief constables&#151;or, in this case, the
commissioner&#151;and accountability for the performance and setting
of local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 307</div>
						priorities to police authorities. Police authorities
have a statutory responsibility to consult local people on their
priorities for local policing and to reflect them in the local annual
policing plans for the chief officer of police to deliver. They are
distinct from local authorities; that delineation was brought more
sharply into focus under the Police and Magistrates&#146; Courts Act
1994, through which the then Conservative Government cut

the proposed new clause should, of course, refer to

such things. By way of clarification, when I referred to a lack of
assembly blessing, I was not talking about proposed new clause 45,

assembly blessing. I was referring to the proposed new clause tabled by
myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000510"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> It must be of some disappointmentto the
official Opposition Members who are also members of the assembly that
the assembly is not prepared to back their new clauses, and is instead
prepared enthusiastically to endorse the new clauses tabled by Members
on the Liberal Democrat Front Bench.</div>
					<a name="07011884000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The composition of police
authorities currently reflects an historic balance, between local
councillors and magistrates. More recently, there has been an injection
of independent members of the community. The model for police
authorities is set out in the Police Act 1996. The Metropolitan Police
Authority has23 members, including a majority of one from the
Greater London assembly.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 308</div>
					<a name="07011884000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Independent members of police
authorities were introduced as part of the last Conservative
Government&#146;s reforms, and were first appointed in 1995.
Independent members were introduced to provide a greater skill base to
police authorities, and to increase the diversity of authorities. I
recognise the important points made by hon. Members on the diversity of
GLA members and council members throughout the country. The points were
well argued and I have some sympathy with them. Equally, hon. Members
will understand that there are other arguments in favour of having
independent members of police authorities. Looking across the country,
we see that independent members offer greater diversity and a wider
range of skills. Of the last appointment of independent members to
police authorities in 2003, 21.5 per cent. were from minority ethnic
groups, compared with 4.2 per cent. of councillor members and 4.6 per
cent. of magistrate members. Women made up 46.3 per cent. of
independent members, compared with 23 per cent. of councillor members
and 28.5 per cent. of magistrate members. That is an important
consideration.</div>

							<a name="07011884000511"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> The Minister made an important point, and we are all
committed to greater diversity when it comes to executive and
legislative bodies. However, the logic of her point is that it is not
for parties and those that compete for elected office to look to their
own diversity policies to provide redress, but for legislators&#146;
powers of executive appointment. Would the Minister say that that is an
argument for the continued exercise of appointment, rather than
election, to the House of Lords? Would she not agree that the real way
to resolve the problem is not through the continued use of patronage
but through political parties paying closer attention to the need for
diversity?</div>

						</b> As my hon. Friend reminds me, I should resist
it.</div>
					<a name="07011884000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, they
are important arguments, and I have some sympathy with what hon.
Members have said, because democratic accountability is important.
However, I point hon. Members to the fact that greater diversity is
being added by independent members. I strongly believe that the
obligation on political parties is greatly to increase diversity. That
is exactly what the Labour party has done both nationally and locally,
with particularly strong action to increase representation of women in
elected positions. I would strongly urge Opposition Members, who do not
have such a strong record in that area, to follow suit.</div>
					<a name="07011884000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are wider issues,
however, to do with skills and the need for a mix of different
experiences. Indeed, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 309</div>Police and Justice Act 2006 provides for regulations on the selection of
independents; they need to be drawn up, but assembly members will play
an important role in the appointment of additional independent members
to the MPA. That reflects the point that Opposition Members
made&#151;that additional diversity that can be gained from
co-opting. That approach is in some ways already reflected in the 2006
Act.</div>
					<a name="07011884000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2006 Act
also made a series of other changes, providing for more flexibility in
how members of the MPA and other police authorities in England and
Wales are appointed. In particular, it provides that the MPA is to
consist of the Mayor, if he chooses to be a member, and those members
of the London assembly appointed by him, and others, including at least
one lay justice. The Mayor and the members of the assembly must
constitute the majority of the members of the authority. The Mayor of
London is to chair the authority should he choose to be a member
ofthe authority; if not, he must appoint a chairman from among
the members of the authority.</div>
					<a name="07011884000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions of the 2006 Act
clearly strengthen the mayoral role; it gives the Mayor the important
role of chairman, which strengthens his position. As I said, the
non-assembly members will be appointed by the existing members of the
MPA from those on a shortlist prepared by a selection panel.</div>
					<a name="07011884000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those measures, made under the
2006 Act, were debated by both Houses and approved relatively recently.
That is why we are resisting the amendments. We believe that there has
been considerable discussion, although I recognise that there is always
the wider issue of the accountability of the police in a democracy. We
will need sophisticated arrangements to ensure proper accountability
and scrutiny, but also to allow complete operational independence for
the police.</div>
					<a name="07011884000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that hon. Members will forgive me a slightly sceptical moment. Had the
Government proposed the amendments, I suspect that Opposition Members
would be leaping up to argue against them, as they have done with parts
of the Bill, whether it be on planning, museums or any other area. They
might be saying that the interests of the boroughs were not
sufficiently protected or that the Mayor had too much scope and might
start intervening in all kinds of detail, which they would not want to
happen. I congratulate Opposition Members on their dexterity and
nimble-footedness in leaping swiftly to the other side of the argument.
It is the strength of a good Opposition&#151;what we would normally
think of as a good Liberal Democrat approach&#151;although perhaps
not on this occasion.</div>
					<a name="07011884000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The House has obviously debated
the matter before, and I am sure that it will be debated again in order
to ensure the accountability of police forces. However, we do not think
that it is right to change the arrangements for the MPA and make them
separate from those that apply to police authorities across the
country. That is why we are resisting the amendments that
woulddo that.</div>
					<a name="07011884000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 45 has been tabled
by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington in the special
interests of his mum. I am terribly sorry to have to disappoint his
mother. We agree with the intention behind the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 310</div>amendment&#151;so much so that we have already introduced and
implemented it as part of the Police and Justice Act 2006. The relevant
requirement has already been removed, so that the deputy Mayor does not
have to be a member of the MPA&#151;although the Mayor will still be
able to include the deputy Mayor in the appointments to the MPA should
he so choose. We could certainly put it on record that that aspect of
the 2006 Act should be seen with due respect and recognition to the
interests of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, but I
apologise that I cannot support the addition of his name to the statute
book on this
occasion.</div>

might be possible to help the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington

though it was unnecessary, but we concluded that that would probably
not be the most sensible thing to do. On that basis, I ask that the

Gove:
						</b> He is almost certainly going to be the new manager
of Chelsea. He certainly stands comparison with Jose Mourinho when it
comes to off-the-field athletics. In the same area, I am disappointed
also that the hon. Lady, again with a twinkle in her eye, suggested
that our position was too flexible. She seemed to suggest that we were
playing in two different positions at once; that we were, in
ideological terms, adherents to the Dutch theory of total
football&#151;simultaneously taking a forward line on granting powers
to the Mayor when it suited us and a defensive position when it did
not. For the benefit of the House, I shall repeat the philosophical
point that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 311</div>has guided both us and, in almost every case, the Liberal Democrats
throughout the debate. Wherever possible, we want to see powers being
devolved to the Mayor. We have not wanted the powers of the Mayor to be
at the expense of the boroughs. And we have wanted to ensure that the
Mayor&#146;s extra powers are balanced by an enhanced role for the
scrutiny of the assembly. The amendments conform to every one of those
tests. There are three tests, rather than the Treasury&#146;s
favoured five, but they apply nevertheless. Are powers to be devolved
to the Mayor? Absolutely. Is there to be an enhanced scrutiny role for
the assembly? Absolutely, because the GLA acquires extra powers that
the MPA currently exercises. Will there be any costs to the boroughs?
Not at all. In fact, overall Londoners gain through greater
accountability.</div>
					<a name="07011884000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, to be fair, I noted
that the Minister betrayed more sympathy with the spirit of the
amendment than with many of our others. I hope that that suggests that
any change in Government policy on the part of Ministers as a result of
any change at the top will be more in tune with the principle of
greater police accountability. A consistent theme of my party, both
when my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr.
Letwin) was shadow Home Secretary and subsequently, has been that the
police in this country suffer from a confused and tangled system of
accountability. We need a clear and more transparent link between
public wishes, the priorities that they set, the elected
representatives of the public and how the police discharge their
functions. The hon. Member for Ealing, North pointed out in his
intervention that we already have a more democratic system, but I felt
that he uncharacteristically misunderstood my hon. Friend the Member
for Croydon, Central. The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis at
the moment being accountable to a plethora of bodies does not make him
more accountable. The confusion of accountability means that the public
do not know which levers need to be pulled or which buttons pressed in
order to get the commissioner to take account of public
opinion.</div>
					<a name="07011884000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst pointed out the important
example of New York. Mayor Giuliani was conspicuously successful
through his appointment of commissioners such as Bill Bratton in
bringing down the crime rate. Indeed,the New York experience
probably shames the performance of the Metropolitan police by
comparison. Clearly, a city that has been Democrat throughout much of
its history has now got into the habit of electing Republican mayors,
if not Republican Senators or congressional figures, precisely because
Republican mayors have been able to deliver policing changes. They have
not interfered in the nooks and crannies of policing operations, but
they have used their mandate to choose an appropriate commissioner to
set an appropriate strategy. Our amendment is the closest that the
Government could come effectively to enthusing the policing of London
with the Giuliani
spirit.</div>
					<a name="07011884000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry
that the Minister has not seen fit to accept our amendment today. I
hope that there will be an opportunity, perhaps if the Minister rises
to become the first female Home Secretary in a future Administration,
to ensure that police accountability
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 312</div>
						and the link between public priorities and the
effective discharge of police commissioners&#146; and chief
constables&#146; roles become closer and more
transparent.</div>

							<a name="07011884000524"></a>Yvette

						</b> I must clarify my earlier remarks. I have just
remembered that we have not yet implemented the measures removing the
requirement for the Deputy Mayor to be on the MPA. The legislation to
do so has been passed, but has not yet commenced. We expect
commencement to occur alongside the rest of the provisions in 2008. The
current deputy Mayor will not be removed inthe meantime. That
would probably account for the different understandings of the
Government andthe
GLA.</div>

prostitutes in Amsterdam.&#148; Against that background, she was
pleased to see me take my seat in the House. Next time she comes, I
shall point her in the direction of the hon. Member for Ealing, North

Minister&#146;s response, grateful though my hon. Friend the Member
for Surrey Heath was for the tone of her comments. My hon. Friend the
Member for Croydon, Central and I endeavour to be nimble. I accept that
we are not yet at a Carlos Tevez and Yossi Benayoun level of
nimbleness, but we are working on it. I see that the hon. Member for
Ealing, North blanches at the thought of our rising through diligent
training to those two players&#146; degree of skill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 313</div>
					<a name="07011884000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate the
Minister&#146;s point on diversity. It was well met by the comments
of my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath, but I am concerned. She
went into some detail, for which I am grateful, about the attempt to
mirror the situation elsewhere in the country, but we pressed the
matter to a Division because we argue that the whole point of
devolution is that it is not necessary to mirror national templates in
a devolved situation. Undue weight has perhaps been given to that
desire in the Government&#146;s decision to oppose the amendments. We
have sought to tailor make a different situation for London because
London&#146;s needs are
different.</div>
					<a name="07011884000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central for
referring to the democratic deficit in policing, not just at the
strategic level but in how safer neighbourhood panels operate. I hope
that the Minister will take those comments on board and speak to her
friends in the Home Office. It seems strange that local ward
councillors should be prohibited from involvement in safer
neighbourhood teams in their areas. All of us in London want
neighbourhood policing to work, but it will work better with a closer
collaboration between the safer neighbourhood teams and panels and
local ward councillors. I hope that that message can be taken back
constructively from this
discussion.</div>
					<a name="07011884000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note the
comments about the boroughs&#146; involvement, and I hope that that
can be developed. One reason why we thought it useful for the assembly
to be the scrutiny body is that, although it would not go as far as new
clause 9 and put borough representatives on the police authority as in
the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority model, every borough
would have a directly elected constituency representative in the London
assembly, so there would be a direct borough-constituency link. We
think that that is a virtue of our
system.</div>
					<a name="07011884000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I visited
New York with cross-party assembly colleagues and looked at the working
of the New York city council police committee, it was interesting that
it had the ability to scrutinise in considerable detail without going
into operational matters, drilling down to performance at precinct
level, which I suppose is the equivalent of our borough operational
command unit. The committee did so intensely and effectively. Perhaps
that is a lesson for us to take on board. With those comments of
disappointment, we will press our
amendment.</div>

						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="07011884000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
brings us back to transport and, more specifically, congestion
charging. The purpose of the new clause, which I am pleased to say is
supported by both Opposition parties, is to ensure that, if an
extension to the congestion charging zone takes place without an
inquiry, the authority must publish consultation responses, the
analysis of those responses and any reasons why representations that
have been received have been disregarded.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 315</div>
					<a name="07011884000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause is
straightforward. It is about openness, transparency and providing
additional checks and balances. Although it would not stop the Mayor
proceeding with such an extension, it would make clear the reasons why
he had rejected certain representations. It would also make clearer the
opposition to his proposals, as in the case of the most recent
extension, and provide much more public awareness of it. The Mayor has
been frank in revealing some of the facts behind the extension and the
support that was received&#151;or, indeed, not received. He is on
record as saying that only a quarter of the public responses to the
consultation supported the proposal. He also referred to what he
described to as</div>
					<a name="07011884000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
representative London wide
survey&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07011884000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">but even that
found that opposition outweighed support, with 41 per cent. supporting
his proposals and 43 per cent. objecting to
them.</div>
					<a name="07011884000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Requiring the
Mayor to make publicly available the analysis, the responses and the
reasons why such a high level of opposition was set aside would act as
another significant check and balance, which really is required when we
are talking about giving the Mayor additional powers. It is therefore
entirely appropriate to introduce additional checks and balances to
ensure that his powers are exercised sensibly.</div>
					<a name="07011884000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also worth pointing out
that the proposed extension is unlikely to address one particular
concern, which flies in the face of an earlier debate on the climate
change strategy. Our view is that the extension, the 90 per cent.
discount for residents in the area of the extension and saying that
they must pay for a week and nothing less will encourage people to
drive into central London more than they would otherwise do. One
consequence of the proposal would be to work against what the Mayor is
trying to do on the climate change strategy.</div>
					<a name="07011884000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the new clause
is simple, straightforward and clear. It would make publicly available
much more information about consultation and the Mayor&#146;s reasons
for rejecting an overwhelming response against his
proposals.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): I shall be
brief, because the number of speeches that I have made against the
congestion charge extension in recent years probably runs into double,
if not triple figures. I shall speak briefly about the experience of
some of us in west London on consultation, on both the original zone
and the extension. The consultation strategy is at the heart of the
amendment, and no one doubts the power of the Mayor, of whatever party,
to introduce a congestion charging scheme. It was specifically referred
to in the 1999
Act.</div>
					<a name="07011884000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a clear
need to reform the way in which consultation is undertaken. At the
moment, there is a statutory duty to consult, but there is absolutely
no duty to listen, to have regard to, or even to read the submissions
to the Mayor. There is not even an obligation to open or count the
letters or e-mails that come flooding in. It gives politics a bad name
when people are asked for their views and no regard is paid, or seen to
be paid, to those views. If we are to have a system of directly elected
mayors&#151;there is a lot of merit in that&#151;we must have a
system whereby the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 316</div>
						mayor is accountable, and if he or she undertakes a
consultation strategy, there should be an obligation on him or her to
note the
results.</div>
					<a name="07011884000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">People say
that the directly-elected-mayor model leads to better and quicker
decisions, but a corollary is the long consultation process.
Ironically, even those who believe in extending the congestion charge,
or are in the original congestion charging zone, would take issue with
the length of time that it has taken between the first proposal and its
implementation. The current system gives rise to poor and slow
government. The proposal for a congestion charge extension was first
made in 2003 and will be implemented next month. The consultation was
overwhelmingly opposed to the proposal, but the Mayor decided, none the
less, to go ahead. There was always a suspicion that he would go ahead
with the scheme regardless of the
consultation.</div>

							<a name="07011884000550"></a>Martin
Linton:
						</b> Between 2003, when it was mooted, and 2007, when
it will be introduced, there was a GLA and mayoral election, and the
Mayor gained a majority. People voted in the knowledge that he had
proposed an extension. Does that not take precedence over the results
of
consultation?</div>

consultation.</div>

						</b> The Minister for London is right, amendments were
made. For example, Chelsea Harbour is now included in the
residents&#146; discount area after representations that I made.
There were other small changes to the boundaries and, I believe, to the
hours of operation. There have not been any significant changes to the
original scheme or to the
extension.</div>

						<a name="07011884000554"></a>
							<b class="B">Ms
Karen Buck</b> (Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North)
(Lab): I also made a number of representations, and the
westward extension is not the design that I put to the Mayor or would
have preferred, but during the consultation we won a series of
significant concessions on the northern boundary. It would be unfair of
the hon. Gentleman to claim that there were no such
concessions.</div>
					<a name="07011884000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
also worth mentioning that part of the dilemma that we discussed when
considering planning decisions was that the western extension and the
whole congestion zone were developed for a wider strategic purpose for
the benefit of Londoners. The local consultation therefore has to be
weighed up against the interests of London as a
whole.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000555"></a>Mr.
Hands:
						</b> Of course that is true, but if we were starting
from scratch we would not design a system whereby it took four years to
introduce such a scheme. I am trying to put myself in the position of
those who are in favour of the westward extension. I would be rather
miffed to discover that it was first mootedin 2003 and not
enacted until 2007 because of consultation that was ultimately not
listened to anyway.</div>

							<a name="07011884000556"></a>Mr.
Slaughter:
						</b> I am not quite following the argument. If the
hon. Gentleman is right and the Mayor does not listen to or read
consultations&#151;I am not sure how we could oblige him to read
them&#151;and takes no notice, surely the longer he takes the
better.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am delighted that the hon. Gentleman is representing the interests of
Michael Caine and the other residents of Chelsea Harbour. I think we
all have issues. Like the hon. Gentleman, I oppose the western
extension. There were substantial concessions&#151;for instance, in
the Eynham road area of my constituency&#151;but significantly not
for the Edward Woods estate, an important area of my constituency that
is now in the zone against the wishes of the residents. Having said
that, whether or not we agree about particular parts of the zone,
surely the main consideration is that, as my hon. Friend the Minister
said, changes have been
made.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000557"></a>Mr.
Hands:
						</b> That is a rather curious intervention. The hon.
Gentleman seems to be saying that changes have been made, but he also
described how he failed to get the changes that he wanted. However,
that brings me conveniently to the position that Hammersmith and Fulham
council took during the
consultation.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000558"></a>Ms
Buck:
						</b> Before the hon. Gentleman moves on to that point, he
is asking for the consultation process to bear a heavier burden than it
should. One of the key reasons for the length of time that elapsed
between the initial proposal of the westward extension and its
introduction was the introduction of public transport alternatives,
particularly further improvements in the bus service and road
management schemes. That means that the congestion charge will not
result in people being displaced and having no alternative way to make
their
journeys.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000559"></a>Mr.
Hands:
						</b> I thank the hon. Lady for making that point. She
mentions public transport improvements that should have been made and I
am all ears to hear what they are. A package of bus route changes was
proposed as part of the westward extension of the zone and is coming
into force about now. For my constituents, the impact has been minimal.
There is overcrowding on the Wimbledon branch of the District line
before the zone comes into effect in the morning. It is at 95 per cent.
capacity during rush hour, so it is difficult to see how things could
be improved. If there is to be a system in which the Mayor consults, he
must be obliged to pay regard to the results. Otherwise there is no
point in having the consultation in the first
place.</div>
					<a name="07011884000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to
the point about the previously Labour-controlled Hammersmith and Fulham
council, the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush
says that he is opposed to the westward extension of the zone. I find
that curious, given the content of an article that I have here, which
appeared in what was then called the <i class="I">Hammersmith and Fulham
Magazine</i> on 8 April 2004. That was 15 days before the consultation
deadline of 23 April, at the height of the fever surrounding the
consultation.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 318</div>
					<a name="07011884000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">One would have expected the
council to defend its residents, who had the almost unanimous view that
the westward extension would be a poor thing. In the article, it
said:</div>
					<a name="07011884000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
council will be guided primarily by the views of residents on the
merits of extending the zone...There have undoubtedly been some
benefits of the existing zone and there may be some in extending it.
However, they appear marginal and it may well be that the disruption
caused by the extension outweighs any
benefit.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011884000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is hardly
a robust position opposing the westward extension. That was a
dereliction of the council&#146;s duty and also, I believe, a key
factor in its defeat last
year.</div>
					<a name="07011884000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need a system
with consultation&#151;we must back there being consultation behind
congestion charging&#151;but there must also be a mechanism for the
swift appraisal of the consultation before decisions are
made.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000560"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend and the
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, both of whom made effective
and cogent cases for the new clause. I am also grateful to the hon.
Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush for telling us that
Michael Caine lives in Chelsea Harbour. As the great actor himself
might say, &#147;Not a lot of people know
that.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011884000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
mention of Michael Caine highlights a material issue of the westward
extension of the congestion charge. Some of us consider the
introduction of the congestion charge to have been a good thing on the
whole and see some merit in similar schemes being employed elsewhere in
the UK. However, we have a few questions about the extension,
particularly in relation to the Mayor, the wisdom of his policy and the
integrity of the
consultation.</div>
					<a name="07011884000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
congestion charge is extended westward, a variety of wealthy people who
live in Kensington and Chelsea, such as Michael Caine, will be able to
drive into London at a discounted rate compared with what they would
have paid hitherto. Yet some shops and businesses in the extended zone,
particularly the smaller, independent ones, might be denied the custom
from places such as Hammersmith, Fulham and Brentford that they relied
on when they were outside the zone. So, the measure simultaneously
helps rich drivers and penalises independent
shopkeepers.</div>
					<a name="07011884000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we all
know, tomorrow we debate the Sustainable Communities Bill, part of
which tends towards supporting independent shops. I know that
Government Front Benchers are under instructions not to support the
Bill, but there is a lot of support for it among Labour Back Benchers.
I therefore suspect that there is widespread unease on those Back
Benches about the westward extension of the congestion charge, as well
as a desire for communities to be more effectively represented through
the new clause. I suspect that the hon. Member for Regent&#146;s Park
and Kensington, North is about to rise to offer some words of
support.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000561"></a>Ms
Buck:
						</b> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman will be slightly
disappointed. We must be careful about asking the congestion charge to
bear a heavier burden than it should in protecting businesses, given
that Westminster city council raises half as much as the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 319</div>entire London congestion zone through its parking policy alone. In
Westminster Hall, a debate on parking is going on as we
speak.</div>
					<a name="07011884000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are
going to talk about protecting small businesses and other community
interests, which is an important debate, those issues cannot be seen
out of context. A number of issues, not least of which is the cost of
parking, are at least as responsible for the pressures on businesses as
the congestion
charge.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000562"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I take the hon. Lady&#146;s point. Both Kensington
and Chelsea council and Westminster city council have parking policies
that impose higher charges closer to the centre of town and lower
charges where there is less demand on services, so there is an element
of gradation and flexibility there. That shows that those
administrations are conscious of the need to balance revenue, traffic
flow and the commercial interests of businesses in their
areas.</div>
					<a name="07011884000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">More broadly,
all sorts of vehicles, including many of the commercial vehicles that
supply independent retailers and others, will be liable to the
congestion charge, whereas they might not be liable to parking charges,
because of how commercial and customer traffic flows
vary.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000563"></a>Stephen
Pound:
						</b> There is a borough slightly beyond Hammersmith and
Fulham, which is the borough of Ealing, where we have considered such
matters in great detail. Normally, the hon. Gentleman brings a
utilitarian analysis to such matters. I admire him for that, because it
is practical, but he says that there has been a negative impact on
commercial activity in the city. However, Oxford street has just
enjoyed its best ever year for
sales.</div>
					<a name="07011884000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I see no vast,
echoing commercial canyons of empty shop fronts, with tumbleweed
rolling through the streets. On the contrary, small shopkeepers who
have gone out of business tend to say that that happened because of
either parking restrictions or commercial rents or business rates.
<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> Does the hon. Gentleman at least
accept that the congestion charge is not the root of all evil in the
world of London
commerce?</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000564"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> We were greeted by the tintinnabulation of bells
there, although I do not think that they were tolling the death of
London commerce.</div>
					<a name="07011884000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
entirely take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. My point about the
westward extension of the congestion charge is that part of the
cherishable nature of parts of Kensington and Chelsea and of
Westminster relates to the fact that they contain urban villages and
shopping centres with a variety of independent retailers. Part of the
quality of the shopping experience that the King&#146;s road and the
Fulham road offer to residents and tourists depends on the variety of
independent outlets. There is a risk of reaching a tipping point, at
which the westward extension, added to various other factors, some of
which he mentioned, will place such shops under much greater
pressure.</div>
					<a name="07011884000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about central London flourishing.
However, there is also an area of conspicuous commercial success in
Marylebone, which is just a stone&#146;s throw from Oxford street.
One reason 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 320</div>for that success is the enlightened approach of the Howard de Walden
estate to the mix of shops in that area. That underlines the point that
there is suppressed demand for independent
retailers. When we consider legislation, and when the Mayor considers
the congestion charge, it is important to ensure that that spread of
independence is not snuffed out by heavy-handed
regulation.</div>

							<a name="07011884000565"></a>Martin
Linton:
						</b> I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman about the
diversity of independent shopkeepers, which is an issue in my
constituency, too. We only wish we had the same situation as Marylebone
high street, where a single owner owns all the shops and can make
decisions as an enlightened shop
owner.</div>
					<a name="07011884000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, surely
there is a big flaw in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument that the
congestion charge will have a detrimental effect on retail businesses
in general. There are boroughs outside Hammersmith and Fulham, and
Kensington and Chelsea, in all directions, and for every shop in the
King&#146;s road that will lose business there will be another, on my
side of the bridge, that will gain, because it is outside the
congestion charge zone. It will be up to enlightened retailers and
supermarkets to move their shops outside the congestion zone. If that
is what will get them more business, they will find it in their
interests to do
so.</div>

is that I would not want regulations to harm independent retailers who
operate in already successful shopping

						</b> I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
giving way once more. I suspect that we might be straining your
patience, Lady Winterton, in flexing this debate, but it is also worth
asking the hon. Gentleman whether he agrees with the extensive research
that shows that the average spend per shopper who arrives by public
transport is significantly higher than the average spend of people who
arrive by
car.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000568"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I am very interested by that statistic, as I was not
familiar with it. Some shoppers who arrive by car in central London
might be hassled dads with children in tow&#151;as I sometimes
am&#151;whose ability to spend freely might be somewhat constrained,
and not only by their Aberdonian backgrounds. People arriving by public
transport might be coming off the Heathrow express, fresh from having
spent the weekend in Monaco or some other spot where Labour party
funders are inclined to hang out&#151;there might be explanations for
that, but I shall not stray down that
path.</div>
					<a name="07011884000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">By placing an
obligation on the Mayor to provide his reasons for rejecting evidence
given during consultation and enjoining on him the duty to publish all
those representations, the new clause will make the decision-making
process more transparent. I know that we might have strained your
patience, Lady Winterton, by straying on to the question of independent
shops in west and central London, but it is of great importance to
Londoners and precisely the sort of issue that would have been
ventilated if all the representations had been received and the Mayor
had had to take on, as has the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 321</div>Committee, all the arguments relating to that vital factor in making
London attractive.</div>
					<a name="07011884000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a way, the debate that we have had in the last10 minutes
underlines the importance of openness to different points of view when
constructing a mechanism, such as the westward extension of the
congestion charge, that might have an effect on
business.</div>

							<a name="07011884000569"></a>Michael
Fabricant:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes his point well, but the
matter concerns not just independent shops. The John Lewis Partnership,
which of course has a major department store on Oxford street, felt
that its representations to the Mayor against the congestion charge
were not dealt with adequately. So my hon. Friend is absolutely right
to talk about the importance of
transparency.</div>

							<a name="07011884000570"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that point. I
was talking mainly about smaller shops, but the John Lewis
Partnership&#146;s admirable co-operative venture has a voice in the
retail and business sectors that we would do well to pay attention to.
The new clause would ensure that the Mayor pays appropriate heed to its
voice, that the public are aware of the arguments put and that we have
an opportunity to find out why he rejects certain evidence. That
process would be made transparent and taken into the public sphere, and
as a result we would have better decision making.</div>
					<a name="07011884000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout the Committee we
have made the point that greater scrutiny of, and openness in, the
exercise of the Mayor&#146;s powers could only be welcomed by an
enlightened Mayor confident in his or her policies. They would of
course have the freedom to push ahead with a westward, northward or
southward extension of the congestion charge, as they felt appropriate.
However, they would have to engage with the arguments of those most
intimately affected.</div>
					<a name="07011884000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have one final point to make, which is almost a declaration of interest
that I should have made at the beginning. The hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington pointed out that as a consequence of the
westward extension some people might make a journey that they otherwise
would not have. The extension is not yet in force, but a person living
in the area covered can apply for a discount that is now in operation.
I mentioned my mother earlier, but my wife made an early application
for an exemption from the congestion charge&#151;she is a much more
prudent guardian of the Gove household finances than I
am&#151;because we live in the area covered. In fact, when we are in
London, during the weeks, and not in the balmy acres

<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 322</div>ordinarily have undertaken. That underlines the importance of the point
made by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington: the westward
extension might not achieve all the Mayor&#146;s environmental
objectives and his arguments would be more rigorously tested were this
new clause

I do so now.</div>
					<a name="07011884000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government agree that it is right to consult before introducing or
amending a road-user charging scheme. Under the Greater London
Authority Act 1999, it is for the Mayor to decide on the
consultation for the making or amending of the road-user charging
scheme. The 1999 Act gives the Mayor the power, but not the duty to
consult on a road-user charging scheme. It is also for the Mayor to
consider whether to proceed with proposals for road-user charging
schemes following such a consultation. That decision must be taken in
the best interests of London. Such an assessment requires consideration
of the complex nature of transport issues across London and the impact
on other areas such as tourism, and business, as well as transport
users. The Mayor is uniquely placed to do that. Clearly, the Mayor must
be allowed to respond to those consultations as necessary. The Mayor
received nearly 50,000 responses to the consultation on the westward
extension. It would surely have been impractical to respond to all the
points raised and not taken forward as suggested by this new clause. On
that point of practicality and with that in mind, I hope that the hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

theory, I am sure that on these Benches we would not want to be
prescriptive in setting out how the Mayor should conduct his
consultation, what publicity he should give to it, how he should make
publicly available the information about representations he received,
and why he rejected them. Indeed, we had a debate earlier today about
how we wanted to be flexible in giving the Mayor scope to develop his
own strategy in relation to climate change. The difference here is that
the Mayor has a track record of disregarding the responses to
consultation. Therefore, in spite of the Minister&#146;s warm

						</b> In the interests of enabling the Minister to catch
a plane later this afternoon, I will make only a brief contribution
given that the debate on this new clause would sound similar to the
debate that we have just had on new clause 1. New clause 2 is also
about ensuring that the Mayor carries out the maximum consultation. It
would require him to notify the assembly of every consultation, publish
the responses and identify those he had accepted and those he had not
accepted, before proceeding with implementation of whatever proposal he
was putting to the electorate or the local population.</div>
					<a name="07011884000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 2 requires no
further elaboration other than to say that it is again about
strengthening consultation, making the process more open and
transparent and making sure that the Mayor&#146;s views and the views
of those he is consulting are on the record so that a more informed and
more consensual decision is taken at the end of the

						</b> I may be at risk of testing both your patience, Lady
Winterton, which I know is almost infinite, and that of the Committee
by pointing out that I am about to echo the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
echo of his previous comments. Essentially the debate on consultation
has been at its most acute when it comes to the Mayor&#146;s exercise
of powers over the congestion charge and, in particular, its westward
extension. New clause 34 would provide an alternative, not competing
but complementary method of defining the Mayor&#146;s consultation
powers alongside new clause 2. We have sought to lay out a way in which
the Mayor can choose and it is at the Mayor&#146;s discretion how he
defines the manner in which he will consult Londoners and appropriate
bodies.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 325</div>
					<a name="07011884000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the reason for tabling
the new clause and hoping that the Minister might accept it today is
that rather than the Mayor having to develop an ad hoc series of
consultations at different points, we have provided him with a means of
laying down the method by which he will conduct all the consultations
that will govern his policy. It is an important principle that those
who exercise executive power in the United Kingdom prefer, wherever
possible, to be bound by the rule of law. I mentioned earlier that one
of the things that we seek to do is to ensure that when the Mayor does
exercise his powers, he does so in such a way that all those who are
affected by them have as much confidence as possible that he is
exercising them
appropriately.</div>

an agreed process? He could demonstrate that he had followed it and had
been very open in the way that he addressed the
consultation.</div>

						</b> I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making
that point. It is the second point that I was about to make, and an
important one too. There will be times when the Mayor will be of a
different party or come from a different tradition from the Government
in power in Westminster. It will inevitably strengthen the
Mayor&#146;s hand if, as well as a democratic mandate, he has the
capacity to show that he has followed a rigorous consultation
procedurethat has been laid down to cover all consultations,
not just the particular policy that he is putting forward, and that
that consultation procedure has yielded support for what he seeks to
do.</div>
					<a name="07011884000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are giving the
Mayor another weapon to defend or advance the interests of Londoners
against a Government who might be determined to thwart them. Far from
constraining the Mayor&#146;s hand, what we are doing&#151;as all
enlightened legislators should&#151;is fashioning an appropriate way
in which to provide him with an opportunity to meet Londoner&#146;s
needs and to challenge the Government to accept his role as
London&#146;s
champion.</div>

Fitzpatrick:
						</b> I am sorry, but I have to disappoint the hon.
Gentleman once again. Let me begin by repeating the fact that the
Government strongly believe in the importance of all public bodies
engaging in consultation with the stakeholders on the development and
implementation of strategies and policies. Consultation is an
invaluable part of policy development, often leading in the end to
better strategies and policies. That is why the GLA Act already
requires the Mayor to consult the assembly, London boroughs and others
on, among other things, the preparation of his statutory strategies
under section 42 and on the use of the GLA&#146;s general
powers under section
32.</div>
					<a name="07011884000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
we discussed, clause 2 requires the Mayor to have explicit regard to
any comments from the assembly
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 326</div>and the functional bodies at an early stage in the preparation of his
strategies, but we do not support the new clauses. New clause 2 would
require the Mayor to notify the assembly of consultation under section
32
						of the 1999 Act on the use of the
authority&#146;s general power before that consultation begins. It
also requires him to publish a written statement before implementing
any proposal identifying which responses to consultation he accepts and
giving reasons when he does
not.</div>
					<a name="07011884000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
the Mayor carefully considers all responses to consultation before
deciding whether to implement a proposal, so I cannot see any
compelling reason to accept the new clause. The Mayor is not required
to produce a written statement discussing all the responses to other
key statutory consultations, such as those on draft strategies and the
annual draft consolidated budgets. Indeed, if he were, it would add
significantly to the GLA&#146;s bureaucratic
burden.</div>
					<a name="07011884000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 34
would require the Mayor to prepare a strategy setting out his
procedures for consultation. Again, however, I am unconvinced of the
need to prescribe such an approach in primary legislation. Such a
requirement would be bureaucratically burdensome and potentially costly
to prepare. It is not clear that the resultant strategy would be of
significant
value.</div>
					<a name="07011884000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
given that everyone wants less statutory prescription on how local
authorities should conduct their affairs, I see no compelling reason
why we should require the Mayor to prepare a further formal strategy on
how he will consult. It should be for him to decide whether or not it
would be sensible to prepare such a strategy, not for Parliament to
impose it. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the new
clause.</div>

Brake:
						</b> The purpose of new clause 3 is to ensure that a
Mayor can serve only two terms in office. I accept that there are
arguments both for and against fixed two-term periods. I understand the
argument that applies to the US President that, in the second term, he
becomes a lame duck. However, I believe to a great extent that that is
down to the individual and the extent to which that person wants to
pursue with vigour the full two
terms.</div>

							<a name="07011884000609"></a>Mr.
Hands:
						</b> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman gave the example
of the United States President. I have an interesting parallel. One of
the reasons why I am opposed to the new clause is that, when the
constitution of the United States was amended to introduce term limits
for the post of President, it was after the person in question,
Franklin Roosevelt, had departed from office. One of the problems with
the argument about term limits is that if an incumbent had already done
more than two terms, the debate would inevitably be about that
incumbent rather than the merits of the constitutional change. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s new clause would actually disfranchise the
electorate; they would not be able to vote out of office the current
incumbent, which I am very much looking forward to happening in
2008.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column327" />Column number: 328</div>and Fulham; I agreed with it up to the final part. The problem with the
new clause is that it is partisan: it is based on the Mayor proving
rather too popular for the likes of Opposition parties, and it is aimed
at him. Were I to table an amendment that disqualified anyone, say,
convicted of a dishonesty offence, it might prejudice certain
prospective Conservative candidates. Similarly, were I to table an
amendment disqualifying anybody who had simultaneously held opposing
positions on important issues, it might disadvantage a Liberal Democrat
candidate. The weakness of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment is not
constitutional but personal.</div>

appears partisan. The Mayor is midway through his second term, but the
principle is strong and valid and it should be introduced. The US took
that decision. President Thomas Jefferson said that if there were no
termination in the constitution to the services of the chief
magistrate, as he described the post, the office would be for life. I
hope that we all agree that no one, whether Mayor of London or Prime
Minister, should be in post for life.</div>

between now and Tuesday for him to table an amendment to the new

incumbent in London from that provision, in the same way that Franklin
Delano Roosevelt was exempted. The current Mayor could stand in 2008,
and in 2012 just before the Olympics, and after his four terms the next

fixed terms, and against creating the perception that someone who is
midway through their second term is ineffective and no longer able to
make strong proposals. Equally, there are similar
concerns about having no fixed terms and no defined point at which
office is relinquished. There are both pros and cons. However, on
balance, I should like to put forward in a non-partisan way the idea of
two fixed terms for the Mayor of London, given the executive power and
strength of that office. Once the Government have accepted the
proposal, I shall entertain the option of pushing the time frame back

non-partisan.</div>

as an argument; that is why I have been keen to restrict the proposal
simply to London, which has a unique structure and where the Mayor has
unique power that is not replicated in any other city in the country.
It will probably be sensible for me not to pursue this matter with much
more vigour or for much longer. I shall give the Minister and the

					<a name="07011884000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">The arguments of those who
intervened underlined that. Given the big personality who occupies the
mayoral office, any attempt to call for term limits will inevitably be
seen as an attempt to clip Ken&#146;s wings rather than ensure that
the principle applies impartially to the mayoral office. More than
that, we have to accept that the whole principle of term limits is
alien to the British constitution. We all know why it emerged in
America and that the original principle of citizen legislator, which
existed in the Roman Republic&#151;where there were strict term
limits of one year or six months, after which the same office could not
be held by the same individual&#151;was a safeguard against the
arrogant exercise of executive
power.</div>
					<a name="07011884000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, for
all its glories, the Roman Republic was not a fully participatory,

the only figure comparable to our present Mayor of London was Fiorello

To be fair, the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington was
absolutely clear that the intention behind the new clause, certainly as
he presented it, was not to make a point against Mayor Livingstone. It
may well be that some of his Liberal Democrat allies who pressed the
new clause on him were handing him a poisoned chalice. It may be that
some of those who wanted him to press the new clause were actuated by
lower motives and wanted to put Mayor Livingstone in the frame. All I
can say is that the hon. Gentleman showed in his speech even as he
pressed his case that he was free of malice. We on our side of the
Committee wish no ill will towards the current incumbent of the office.
We want to see him taken out of office at the ballot box by a fair

the more we have risen in the polls relative to the Government and the
greater the number of individuals who have expressed an interest has

important things is that we will have a truly open primary. One of the
key elements that is attractive about how we will select our mayoral

striking feature, Lady Winterton, of open primaries
that the two Conservative candidates who were selected atthe
last general election by open primaries&#151;our candidates in
Warrington, South in the fair county of Cheshire and in Reading,
East&#151;both received swings above the national average. The open
primary method of selection, which Labour has mocked, saw the
membership of both constituency parties rise along with the votes. It
might be the case that the scorn directed towards the open primary

exercises an executive function analogous to that of the governor of an
American state, might dishonour the mandate on which he was elected, go
on an ideological or personal journey utterly at odds with the basis on
which he was elected or be temporarily incapable of effectively
discharging the duties of the office to which he was elected, yet be
determined, rather like the captain of the ship in &#147;The Caine
Mutiny&#148;, to hang on to the levers of power, even though he is no
longer fit to do so. Such a situation might arise in a number of
circumstances.</div>

							<a name="07011884000634"></a>Mr.
Slaughter:
						</b> I am tempted to put the same style of question
as was put to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington. If the
hon. Member for Surrey Heath favours this departure of the recall,
which is even more alien to British constitutional practice, for the
mayoral position, does he favour it for any other elected position, for
example, his own? The residents of Surrey Heath, conscious of the fact
that the hon. Gentleman cannot remember what his constituency is, might
like someone who can.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000635"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. There
is a clear distinction between the gubernatorial office, which is
analogous to that of the Mayor of London, and the legislative office,
which is analogous to a position in Congress or the Senate. I would not
say that being the Member for Surrey Heath is a bit like being a
Senator, although it is a little like being a Congressman.</div>
					<a name="07011884000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman teases me
about the precise location of Surrey Heath. I can tell him, because I
will be driving there almost as soon as this Committee finishes, that
the most effective way to get to it is to drive down the A316 and then
the M3. If one then turns off at junction 3, for Lightwater or Bagshot,
one will find oneself in Surrey Heath. If he would like me to take him
through every village in Surrey Heath, either in conversation at a
later date or possibly on a tour, I shall give him a lane-by-lane and
street-by-street guide to the constituency that is every bit as
detailed as that of any satellite navigation system. As we all know,
satellite navigation is a form of global positioning system. I have my
own form of GPS&#151;the Gove positioning system&#151;which means
that whenever I am in Surrey Heath, I am a happier bunny.</div>
					<a name="07011884000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point that I was about was
that, as the hon. Member for Ealing, North pointed out from a sedentary
position, Gray Davis, the former governor of California, was subject to
a recall amendment. A former mayor of Washington DC, Marion Barry, has
also been mentioned. He sets a precedent for being precisely the sort
of figure who might have been suitably chastened by being subject to a
recall amendment following the sort of petition that we are proposing.
We set quite a high threshold, insisting that 10 per cent. of those who
had voted in the mayoral election sign a suitably validated petition
before there can be any recall vote. This would not be a capricious
process.</div>

							<a name="07011884000636"></a>Stephen
Pound:
						</b> I believe that Marion Barry, the former mayor of
DC, was found freebasing cocaine with two hookers in a hotel. One would
not in any way make a comparison to the exemplary standards of probity
expressed by the current Mayor of London, but surely Marion Barry was
in prison and was thus disqualified. So, we already have a failsafe
mechanism in London in the highly unlikely event that anything of a
similar nature should occur.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000637"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I am grateful for that colourful intervention. The
hon. Gentleman points out that if the Mayor were to break the law and
to engage in any criminal enterprise, the law of the land would apply.
There are a variety of circumstances in which a person exercising an
executive function, such as a mayor, or a gubernatorial one, such as
Gray Davis, would be appropriately held in check by the power. We all
know that the lurid anecdote that the hon. Gentleman brought to the
Committee&#146;s attention is not the only example of a mayor, Marion
Barry, straying from the high standards that one might expect of an
elected mayor. One might argue that some of the policies that he
pursued were rather more worthy of chastening than were his colourful
recreational activities in some of DC&#146;s hotels.</div>
					<a name="07011884000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">The threshold that we have set
is relatively high, so anybody who sought to press a recall petition on
the citizens of London would have to be well organised and well
mobilised. Most important, he would have to be in tune with the
sentiments of Londoners. Because the threshold is so high, the device
could not be used simply to inconvenience the Mayor and to bring
London&#146;s governance to a halt. It could be used only if there
were a clear public demand and if the Mayor&#151;a future Mayor, I am
sure&#151;had palpably failed to live up to the hopes that had been
invested in him by those who elected him to the extent that he had
radically and dramatically departed from his mandate. For that reason,
I hope that, while understandably passing over the opportunity to
accept the new clause in the name of the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington, the Minister might look favourably on our imaginative
transatlantic import.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000638"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> Before I respond to this debate, may I
express my appreciation to the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington for his comments on the previous new clause, when he
indicated that he was trying to assist me in catching my flight to
Berlin for tomorrow&#146;s Employment Ministers&#146; conference. I
believed that I was on the last flight today, but that flight has been
cancelled due to weather conditions in Germany. Fortunately, the
resourcefulness of the civil service has found me a later flight, so I
apologise for anything misleading that I might have said in that
respect.</div>
					<a name="07011884000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government cannot accept either new clause. Both run counter to the
fundamental constitutional principles at the heart of the 1999 Act and
are ultimately, we would argue, undemocratic. New clause 3 would bar a
Mayor or an assembly member who had served two terms of office from
being elected for a third term. There is little justification for
limiting by statute the number of terms that a mayor can serve in
office. It should be for the London electorate to decide who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 334</div>should be Mayor. If the electorate wish to re-elect an incumbent Mayor
for three or more terms on the basis of his or her track record, that
should be allowed. This is democracy in action; it is what gives the
post of Mayor political legitimacy. A statutory limitation on the
number of terms that a Mayor can serve would run counter to the
fundamental democratic principle that covers all other national and
local electoral arrangements in the United Kingdom. Furthermore,
because a second-term Mayor would not be allowed the opportunity to
stand and face the electorate on his track record, it is possible that
he would be less responsive to the needs and concerns of Londoners and
less motivated to address the challenges that London faces. That would
not be good for the post of Mayor or for London.</div>
					<a name="07011884000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 14 would enable a
Secretary of State to make regulations to allow the Mayor to be removed
from office by a successful petition from a proportion of the London
electorate. The Government remain convinced that the use of such a
petition to remove the Mayor from office would be completely
inappropriate. I was intrigued to read that, in Committee during the
scrutiny of the 1999 Act, discussing petitioning, the late, great Eric
Forth, who sat for Bromley and Chislehurst, asked the hon. Member for
North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) whether he would rely on
an informal mechanism of people collecting signatures&#151;which
would no doubt include the usual Mickey Mouse and Napoleon
Bonaparte&#151;and if so, how he would verify the procedure and its
cost. Bonapartism is a feature of this debate that has been mentioned
several times by both the hon. Member for Surrey Heath and the sitting
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. Clearly, it runs
throughthe
Bill.</div>

							<a name="07011884000639"></a>Mr.

					<a name="07011884000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">That suggests
to me that electors who participated in the election would be deemed to

							<a name="07011884000640"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting
point. The validation of petitions has proven difficult in the past,
but subsection (4) of the new clause
says:</div>
					<a name="07011884000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nothing
in subsection (2) or (3) affects the generality of the power under
subsection
(1)&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011884000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (1)
would give the Secretary of State complete power to determine what
percentage of signature petitions ought to be
allowed.</div>
					<a name="07011884000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the heart
of the 1999 Act is the constitutional principle that the Mayor&#146;s
democratic legitimacy is ultimately derived from the direct elections
held every four years. It is the Mayor&#146;s success at those
elections, which involve the whole London electorate, that gives him
the democratic mandate to provide strong leadership and strategic
direction for
London.</div>
					<a name="07011884000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">To allow the
Mayor to be removed from office through a petition would undermine that
fundamental 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 335</div>principle. It would allow a small proportion of Londoners who were
unhappy with the Mayor to override the wishes of the wider London
electorate expressed at the ballot box. It could also encourage special
interest groups, of whatever persuasion, continually to campaign for
the removal of the Mayor by petition whenever they disagreed with a
specific mayoral policy or decision. That would almost certainly happen
if the default minimum threshold for a valid petition was set at 10 per
cent. of the number of people who participated in the last mayoral
election, as the new clause proposes.</div>
					<a name="07011884000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">Based on the last election
results, a successful petition would need the support of 186,000 voters
to remove the Mayor. That may sound a lot, but it is small compared to
the size of the overall London electorate of 5.1 million. It would mean
that less than 4 per cent. of the London electorate could decide to get
rid of the
Mayor.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000641"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> Does not membership of the Labour party nationally
stand at about 186,000? Therefore, the number of people suitable to
elect the next Prime Minister is surely also suitable to decide whether
we should have a referendum on the continuation of the mayoral
office?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000642"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> The number of people mentioned in the new
clause represents 3.8 per cent. of Londoners. There is another
significant factor. The new clause would allow the Mayor to be removed
from office but to stand again for re-election at a subsequent
by-election. Returning to the comment from my hon. Friend the Member
for Ealing, North about Mayor Barry in Washington, who was re-elected
on several occasions despite accusations against him, we could have an
endless cycle of petition, removal of the Mayor, re-election of the
Mayor, petition and so on. I have not even mentioned the cost, but this
could become an expensive and time-consuming process and would prevent
the Mayor from focusing on tackling London&#146;s problems.</div>
					<a name="07011884000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, as I mentioned
earlier to the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham, the new clause
would give the Secretary of State power to determine the arrangements,
including the minimum threshold, for achieving a successful
petition.</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000643"></a>Mr.
Hands:
						</b> Does the Minister not agree that there is an irony
in discussing this matter as, if I am not mistaken, he and most Labour
Members were instrumental in trying to prevent the current incumbent
from being on the ballot paper in the first place in
2000?</div>
					
					<a name="07011884000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011884000644"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> Clearly we were singularly successful in that
regard.</div>
					<a name="07011884000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such control
of the petition process by the Government would cut against one of the
key underlying principles of the 1999 Act, which is that the
constitutional arrangements for the GLA should be set out, as far as
possible, in primary legislation so that the Government of the day
cannot easily amend them on the basis of who the Mayor is or is not.
Accordingly, the new clause would render the post of Mayor 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 336</div>virtually powerless and the incumbent threatened with dismissal by
continual submissions from special interest
groups.</div>
					<a name="07011884000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Perhaps
that is what Opposition Members ultimately want. However, the
Government believe in a strong Mayor, whoever he is, with a clear
democratic mandate. That person should be able to take forward his
vision for London and address the considerable challenges that the
capital faces. On that basis, I urge hon. Members not to press the new
clauses.</div>

clause, but there were some semi-supportive comments from a couple of
Labour Back Benchers, so it is only appropriate that we have a Division

						</b> I hope that, with new clauses 6 and 7, I will be on
firmer ground, albeit we will be discussing water. We had a debate
earlier today on the importance of climate change, of the Mayor having
a strategy that addresses it and of providing him with the flexibility
he needs to take on that very important and serious agenda. The new
clauses, which relate to water and the utilities, are very much in the
vein of providing the Mayor with greater control and say over water
and, in relation to new clause 7, sewerage. The provision and use of
water will be central to the Mayor&#146;s strategy on climate change,
and the new clauses would provide him with an opportunity to gain
greater control over the provision of water in
London.</div>
					<a name="07011884000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
most hon. Members would agree that in many respects Londoners have not
been particularly well served by some companies that one could mention.
I would not necessarily include in that list my own local supplier,
Sutton and East Surrey Water, which does a reasonable job, but clearly
others get regular headlines for their inability to tackle very
significant leakage rates when&#151;apart from the weather that we
have had in the last few days&#151;water is in relatively short
supply. Certainly, discussions with the local water supplier indicate
that in Surrey in particular, where a lot of water is stored in bore

makes about the problems of leakage in the water system. They lead to
tremendous disruption on London&#146;s roads in terms of Thames
Water&#146;s undertakings. I am not sure whether that has yet
affected Carshalton and Wallington directly, but I know that a
significant number of unco-ordinated roadworks are to take place in
Croydon, which I am sure will adversely affect the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s constituents. Does he feel that it might have been a
good consideration in this or perhaps related legislation to give the
Mayor powers for rather more substantial lane rental charges for
utilities, which can be very disruptive and uncaring about the needs of
road
users?</div>

rental charges, but the hon. Gentleman makes the valid point that
despite the availability of such charges, in practice we experience
significant delays all over London as a result of various utility
works. He represents the borough of Sutton, and Croydon, so he will no
doubt be almost as familiar as I am with Beddington lane, which is in
his constituency as it is in mine. Traffic on that road is regularly
disrupted by utilities, which come in one after the other, rather than
in a co-ordinated
fashion.</div>
