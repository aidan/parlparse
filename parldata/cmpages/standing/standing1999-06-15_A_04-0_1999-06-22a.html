<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions </B>(Mr. Alan Meale): I beg to move Government amendment No. 18, in page 5, line 36, leave out ``otherwise than'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``, or otherwise carrying on any activities of any specified description, except''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 19 and 20.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> We bump into each other, Mr. O'Brien, on a fairly regular basis. Not many people mention that, or that you&#151;and other Committee members&#151;become bored with me when I try to get necessary amendments out of the way.
<P>
We have spoken in previous sittings about reports by the House of Lords Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation, and about amendments to the Bill made in another place to meet its recommendations. One of those amendments limited the scope of the Bill to matters set out in schedule 1. It was acknowledged during debate in another place that that might require consequential amendments to the schedule to ensure that it included an exhaustive rather than indicative list of matters which needed regulating.
<P>
We have had the opportunity to consider the effect of the Bill in its amended form; our legal advice is that the present drafting of paragraph 4, which refers only to a requirement of permits to operate an ``installation or plant'', might not cover certain activities, such as the storing of coal or iron ore, currently regulated under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. We must continue to regulate those activities; the amendments roll forward the provisions of that legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green (Ashford):</B> I want to ask just one question; I do not wish to detain the Committee unduly on this relatively technical group of amendments. The Minister mentioned the storage of coal and iron as examples of activities that would not be covered by the Bill were the Government amendments not accepted. How widespread would that consequence of the present drafting be?
<P>
Government amendment No. 18 will insert the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``otherwise carrying on any activities of any specified description''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is any class of activity affected by the amendment that would not normally fall under the regulations? I am trying to establish how widespread a change in practice there will be and which activities might be affected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> We are trying to create a catch-all situation. Technically, under the amended Bill, one could regulate talking, although no Government in their right mind would do such a thing. [Hon. Members: ``The Whip might.''] The Whips could use such a measure. The amendment provides no wider a power than that in the 1990 Act. Section 1(5) of that Act states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ```Process' means any activities carried on in Great Britain, whether on premises or by means of mobile plant, which are capable of causing pollution''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Section 1(6) reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ```Activities' means industrial or commercial activities or activities of any other nature whatsoever''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Following the legal advice given, we needed a catch-all situation covering polluting activities such as those concerning iron ore and coal storage. I come from a once great coal mining area. I know a little of what pollution such activities can cause. Anybody who has ever spoken to people who live next to a place that stores things such as coal will know that they find the situation especially arduous. The Bill seeks to control the activities that take place in such cases.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Walley:</B> What a great pleasure it always is to serve on a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Brien. Like other Labour Members, I am aware of your sterling work on environmental issues during the many years that you have served in the House.
<P>
We are discussing a fine Bill, which has already been significantly amended in the other place. I have every reason to believe that it will be even finer when the Committee has finished considering the amendments. I hope that, in replying, my right hon. Friend the Minister will take account of the huge leap forward that we will be able to take if the pollution inventory under the Environment Agency provisions is extended to the matters in the amendment.
<P>
I draw the attention of the Committee, and particularly the Minister, to the new Select Committee on Environmental Audit, which is a major Government initiative. It examines environmental audit issues across Departments to ensure that sustainable development is at the heart of all our policies. If we want the Select Committee to deal successfully with environmental audit, it makes sense for us to ensure that we have a full inventory of pollution. The inventory should not only relate to matters that the Environment Agency currently authorises, but be extended to include other installations and processes. It should also cover processes that local authorities regulate.
<P>
I want the Minister to view my comments in the light of the work of the Environmental Audit Committee. I want him to understand and share my belief that it is important to establish audits at every level and that an inventory is exactly the right way forward.
<P>
The pollution inventory that the Environment Agency published earlier this year was based on the annual returns that companies provide. It sets out the total amounts of substances that are released into air, water and late. The emissions are from about 2,000 of the largest industrial processes in England and Wales, which are subject to integrated pollution control. By simply typing in a postcode or clicking on a map on the EA website&#151;I should refer also to the sterling work that has been done by Friends of the Earth&#151;anyone can find out about emissions from big industrial processes in his or her local area.
<P>
Since the Environment Agency introduced the pollution inventory in May, about 800 visits a day have been made to its website. That emphasises the importance that people throughout the country attach to the right to know about pollution and contamination and emissions and releases that affect air, sea and land.
<P>
However, local authorities regulate 13,000 processes under local authority pollution control that fall outside the scope of the inventory. Although individual emissions from small installations may not be significant, collectively they make a major contribution to environmental emissions and to the environmental health impact of chemicals. It is important for the Committee to note that although individual emissions from specific sites or premises might not be significant, added together they cause significant pollution. The amendment attemps to deal with that; it is just as important for the carefully collected inventory to provide information on such emissions as it is on those produced by the major installations covered by other provisions.
<P>
Some 1,500 processes will be subject to integrated pollution prevention and control. Some agricultural and food and drink installations covered by the directive are currently subject neither to the IPC regime of the Environment Agency nor to the local authority controls. About 1,500 of those installations will fall within the scope of the Bill, because of the information provided under the directive. In considering the amendment, we have a wonderful opportunity to extend the scope to a wider number of processes, and to put appropriate provision into the Bill.
<P>
Article 15(3) of the directive states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``An inventory of the principal emissions and sources responsible shall be published every three years''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill should make it clear that, in the United Kingdom, the pollution inventory compiled by the Environment Agency will include information from the IPPC installations regulated by local authorities. The inventory should also include installations that will remain subject to local authority authorisation. Processes in respect of the latter will remain regulated by the Environment Agency for discharges to water and in respect of waste matter under part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
<P>
Although a great deal of information is already available, our knowledge about releases into the environment is incomplete and inconsistent. In practice, it is extremely difficult for the public to obtain information about releases affecting them. The Bill should be amended to help in rectifying that problem. The public registers alone do not facilitate public access to information about emissions on a geographical basis. Although access to information is important to this debate, I am mindful that a much greater issue concerns many hon. Members.
<P>
Neither paragraph 11 of schedule 1 nor regulation 26 of the draft regulations makes it explicit that local authorities should produce pollution inventories for all installations subject to their control&#151;I refer to the consultation of December 1998. Reference is made only to the Environment Agency. Local authorities should be required not only to collect and publish such information, but to provide it to the Environment Agency, which may collate the data nationally to produce a more comprehensive pollution inventory. I cannot over-emphasise how much that would assist the work of the Environmental Audit Committee, of which my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment is a member. I am pleased to see him in his place.
<P>
The Environment Agency has said that it would like to expand the pollution inventory. I have read carefully the press releases that were issued at the time of the most recent announcements. It is clear that there is an understanding that it is only a matter of time before what is currently undertaken in respect of the pollution inventory should be extended to other processes, including those regulated by local authorities. The Bill provides exactly the right opportunity, at the right time, to enable us to do so.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am also quite clear from talks that I have had with members of the European Environment Agency, based in Denmark, which I have had the privilege of visiting, that the question of information about releases to air, sea and water concerns us nationwide and Europe-wide. We have a real opportunity to show that we in the United Kingdom are at the cutting edge in introducing such environmental regulation. The expansion should include information on emissions from other regulated processes, such as landfill sites and sewage treatment works, and an amendment to the Bill is the most effective way in which to achieve that.
<P>
Some years ago, the royal commission on environmental pollution said that secrecy fuels fear. The Bill, and the amendment, present an opportunity to ensure that the public have the fullest information about pollution of their locality and its health effects. I am pleased to say that my right hon. Friend was present at the third World Health Organisation environment and health conference, which we were fortunate to host in London last week. I was present at some conference sessions, and it is clear that when we are trying in this country, in Europe or internationally to improve health care and health provision, it is essential that we make the link between health and the environment. Contamination and pollution are vital parts of that.
<P>
In order to know the nature of the problems with which we are dealing, in turn in order to improve health, we need an audit of information and a right to know&#151;we need access to information. That is the way in which to secure greater and better reduction of pollution, given that we know that there are links between ill health and the release of chemicals into the environment. We have an opportunity to achieve that now. Better public information will also help to allay fears that may not be justified.
<P>
I shall be interested to hear my right hon. Friend's response, because I sense that I am pushing at an open door. I hope that he will consider the present anomaly, under which the Environment Agency is enabled under the 1990 IPC to require pollution inventories, but local authorities can require information only on a case-by-case basis. It would be far better to extend the power to local authorities in its entirety. Certain operations are also currently excluded&#151;in particular, energy.
<P>
I should be interested to know whether the Government's view is that no new powers are needed&#151;that we already have legislation that would enable us to produce a full inventory. If so, I want absolute assurances and undertakings that we can already provide for such an inventory in respect of energy efficiency. How will we achieve our Kyoto commitments and our commitment to combat global warming if we cannot track what energy is being used? Again, the Bill provides an opportunity to achieve that.
<P>
Another example is that of materials such as limestone, which is used in gas desulpurisation installations. We need to know exactly how raw energy, materials and resources are being used and what is being released. It is important that we proceed on a risk-based approach. That is consistent with our commitment to public information&#151;to the right to know.
<P>
I understand that industry may have some reservations about extra work that may affect small businesses in taking this matter forward. However, if we take this opportunity to include the proposed provision in the Bill, we will have time to consult further with people who have misgivings about the amendment.
<P>
I have been in the House of Commons for 12 years. During that time, on the many occasions on which I have wanted new legislation to be placed on the statute book, I have lobbied colleagues who have been successful in the luck of the draw for a private Member's Bill. All too often, we have to rely on private Members' Bills to put legislation right.
<P>
The Government may take the view that we do not need to do this now. I do not want to have to wait another 10 years, by which time there will be a greater clamour all around the United Kingdom for the right to know about environmental pollution, when we have the chance to put the matter right now. If we are going to do a job, let us do it properly. The Government are to be congratulated on all that they have done in making the pollution inventory possible. Let us ensure that it is as embracing as it can be, and that it is included in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall speak to amendment No. 15 and then comment on the important matters raised by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley). Many of the points that I shall make will also apply to new clause 1 and new schedule 1, but I shall reserve detailed comment on those until the appropriate part of the debate.
<P>
On amendment No. 15, Conservative Members are grateful that, when the Bill passed through another place, the Government sensibly agreed with those of their lordships who were trying to improve the Bill that the amount of information that is made available to the public under the Bill should be restricted on grounds of commercial confidentiality. I agree with the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North to the extent that the more information that is available, the greater the public trust in the system, and therefore the higher the probable level of debate. Some of the more hysterical debates that arise on environmental issues are often based on a degree of ignorance, which promotes distorted arguments. I agree with her about that, if about little else.
<P>
A balance must be struck among the various pressures that bear on this type of legislation. The Government have already admitted that commercial confidentiality is one such pressure that may legitimately be cited to restrict the free public availability of information. Amendment No. 15 would add public order to the list. I am sure that all members of the Committee will accept that that is at least as important as the commercial confidentiality clause, and extremely relevant to the Bill.
<P>
Environmental issues arouse great passions&#151;and rightly so&#151;but, inevitably, some people who feel strongly may be tempted to go over the line of legality. It is important for the House of Commons, in its law-making capacity, to draw the line between what is, and what is not, legitimate protest. A recent example is an event that took place in the City of London last week, which was described as a carnival against capitalism. Although I am sure that the Minister would be happy to take part in such an event, I am equally sure that he would condemn as strongly as I do those who use them as an excuse for violent conduct. That is a good illustration of where we should draw the line.
<P>
Some people, because of their principles or prejudices, believe that illegal direct action can be desirable in the sphere of environmental activism. The amendment seeks to make it more difficult for people who wish to act illegally to gain information that would help them in doing so. Often, companies or individuals hold information that would be controversial if publicly available and which might encourage people to act illegally. The purpose of the amendment is to allow such companies or individuals not to make that information public.
<P>
The Minister may be aware that the matter has struck at the heart of middle England, which, as we are learning today, is still a main priority of the Government. I say that because it is a topic of great current interest in ``The Archers''. It always strikes me that when an issue of political controversy has reached the script of ``The Archers'', it has clearly reached the heart of political debate in Britain.
<P>
<B>Ms Walley:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to invite Tommy Archer to listen to our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I think that there is a group called The Archers Anarchists, which insists that ``The Archers'' is real life, and that everything that everyone else does is fiction. I would not be at all surprised if members of the cast of ``The Archers'' turned up in the Committee Room.
<P>
I should return to the main issue, which has been well aired on ``The Archers''. The threat of direct action does not always involve just damage to property. It can also consist of threats to individuals. Hon. Members will know that so-called animal rights protesters have sent letter-bombs to scientists. I am sure that even people who regard damage to property for a greater cause as not all that serious would admit that damaging and possibly even killing people is serious, and that we must take a cool look at the issue. That is why the amendment is desirable. It would allow such matters to be dealt with a little more safely. I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment and the incorporation into the Bill of extra protection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Ainger </B>(West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire): The hon. Gentleman seems to be moving away from his subject. Will he give some examples of the information currently held on the public register that would not be so held if the amendment were agreed to?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> There may not be specific examples, because the type of action in question has generally not so far occurred. However, the potential for it to happen exists. The amendment is a useful precaution, and is necessary as changes occur in science, information, the attitudes of the general public and, especially, the attitudes of people on the edges of the political spectrum. The hon. Gentleman is right to point out that relevant examples have not so far arisen, although that is not to say that we must accept the Minister's rubric, which suggests that while the Bill theoretically covers genetically modified foods they should not be included in it. We have seen examples of direct action pertaining to GM foods that is based on information. The information on where trials were occurring was publicly available, and people used it to go and destroy crops. That is one example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ainger:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that that is one example. Would the amendment ensure that neighbours of farmers carrying out commercial GM experiments would not be informed of such experiments? Is that what he is suggesting?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Not necessarily, no; I am sure that the hon. Gentleman recognises that. The information could be prejudicial to public order, and a decision would have to be made on whether destruction is likely to occur. If the hon. Gentleman is arguing that all information should be available at all times, he should recall the scientists who have received letter-bombs at home. If he thinks that it is legitimate for information enabling such action to be in the public domain, and he thinks that that is worth while, he may express that view, but I disagree with him. How much information should be available is a genuine issue. There are times when disclosure can affect not just property but the safety of those working in particular scientific fields.
<P>
The amendment would allow the issue of safety to be brought into the equation. I assume that the hon. Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire (Mr. Ainger) is arguing against the amendment; he is suggesting that the House should take no account of it.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ainger:</B> The names and addresses of scientists who have been targeted outrageously by animal rights activists and others would not be included on the public register&#151;that is my point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My point is that, if, as the hon. Gentleman is seeking, no consideration is given to the nature of the information on the public register, it is more likely that information that could be used by people with full intent will be on the register. The purpose of the amendment is to introduce into the equation aspects of personal safety and of safety of property. That would seem to be an entirely legitimate consideration to include in the Bill. The Government have admitted that regard for commercial confidentiality is worth including; given what is involved, the issue of personal safety is at least as important as that of commercial confidentiality. If one accepts that point&#151;as I am sure that both the hon. Gentleman and the Minister do&#151;introducing that factor into the equation would seem to be a sensible improvement to the Bill.
<P>
I have reservations about the proposals in amendment No. 16, tabled by the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North, which partly concern the degree of detail that would be introduced into the Bill. As she admitted in her speech, that measure would produce an extremely onerous burden. The concept of accepting that something might damage business, but seeking to include it in the Bill and then to start negotiating about how onerous it would be, was interesting. A simpler procedure might be not to introduce the burdens in the first place.
<P>
<B>Ms Walley:</B> We have an opportunity to include a provision now, the detail of which could be further worked out later. It would be an easy operation to have standards covering companies producing little pollution. They would be general standards and would not lead to the situation that the hon. Gentleman describes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That might be possible, but it would be extremely risky. Once a measure such as the hon. Lady's was in the Bill in such broad and detailed terms, my fear would be justified. The Environment Agency already has powers to require companies to report on a wide range of emissions. The agency produces a pollution inventory index that makes much information available to the public. The index is available in electronic form, which is, as the hon. Lady rightly identified, the best way of publishing it.
<P>
Any extension of that requirement to report could be onerous, not only on small companies, but on large companies, not least because the proposals go well beyond current data collection requirements under the IPPC directive. The hon. Lady phrased her proposal as putting Britain at the leading edge of European regulation in the field; she will be aware that many in the business world would say that it would put British business at a competitive disadvantage in Europe.
<P>
Paradoxically, the hon. Lady and I may agree that Europe-wide regulation is legitimate in this area. It is, however, perverse for her to say that Europe-wide regulation is legitimate and that we should seek to go beyond it. Of course, the collation of data and their provision to regulators carry a cost to business, but it is important to be able to justify that cost in terms of the environmental benefits that will result.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): Does my hon. Friend agree that if the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North is trying, even with the best will in the world, to over-regulate British business in an attempt to get the rest of European business to suffer under the same onerous burden, the whole of Europe would be put at a disadvantage compared with the rest of the world, including American and Asian producers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. Many of the businesses that will be affected operate in a global market. Equally important, much of the pollution will have a global effect. If we are to establish a level playing field in environmental regulation, it will ideally be worldwide, not merely Europe-wide.
<P>
The fact that the proposals are so broad and include almost any source of environmental pollution means that the dangers are all the greater. The Committee has had many debates about the appropriate level and type of parliamentary scrutiny. The Minister said that some of the provisions in the Bill are included precisely to provide detailed regulations that both Houses of Parliament can properly scrutinise. If flies in the face of what the Minister says he seeks to achieve in the Bill to introduce a further broad requirement.
<P>
Furthermore, the purpose of collating the data suggested in the amendment is not entirely clear from the remarks that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North made. It is clearly understood that there is a need to satisfy the reporting requirements of the directive as it stands; indeed, the relevant information is already provided to the Environment Agency. However, some of the data that the hon. Lady wants to be collected have no specific purpose. Collecting data for the sake of it will impose an unnecessarily onerous burden on business.
<P>
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North made a good point about the way in which freedom of information can raise the level of environmental debate. I should, however, gently tell her that the Bill is not the place to have the argument about the extent of freedom of information under the Government. I understand and sympathise with the hon Lady's disappointment with the freedom of information proposals that the Government introduced, given their rhetoric of two years ago. She and many of her colleagues rightly feel that the Government have conned the British people, but the Bill and the amendment are not the right means to rectify the problem. Similar reservations apply to new clause 1 and new schedule 1, but no doubt the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake), who tabled them, will deal with that.
<P>
Given that the Government have conceded that absolute freedom to publish information is not appropriate in this case, amendment No. 15 would be a useful addition to the amendments to which the Government conceded in another place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Brake </B>(Carshalton and Wallington): May I, too, begin by saying what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Brien?
<P>
Before I deal with the new clause and the new schedule, I should say that I am happy to support amendment No. 16, which is in the names of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North, myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell). I echo many of the points that the hon. Lady made and do not, therefore, intend to go over the same ground.
<P>
The phrase ``prejudicial to public order'', which appears in amendment No. 15, represents an extreme catch-all provision. For instance, it could be argued that information about emissions from any plant of any type could in theory, once it was in the public domain, be prejudicial to public order. For example, if the residents of Beddington found out that Thames Water's landfill site close to their properties was leaching something into the nearby ground, in theory, they could don their balaclavas and take action against that landfill site. In practice, that is extremely unlikely. It would be dangerous to incorporate an amendment that in theory could halt the free flow of any information relating to emissions.
<P>
I turn to new clause 1 and new schedule 1. The Minister is a reasonable man, and I want to discover how reasonable he is. He is on record as supporting pollution inventories; I hope that the new clause and new schedule will provide him with the opportunity to demonstrate how supportive he is. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North said that she believed that we are pushing at an open door. Let us find out how open the door is.
<P>
I hope that we are all agreed that the public have a right to know concerning environmental information. Back in 1992, the United Nations conference on environment and development stated the clear principle that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``each individual shall have appropriate access to information concerning the environment held by public authorities''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that it is also agreed that the United Kingdom has a duty to introduce a register. In 1996, the council of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development adopted a recommendation that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Member countries should take steps to establish . . . implement and make publicly available a pollutant release and transfer register.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is therfore no doubt that the public have a right to know, and that a register should be established.
<P>
Incidentally, the same conference also agreed that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Member countries should consider sharing . . . results''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the information that they have about pollutant releases, especially on the borders, where there may be some cross-contamination between neighbouring areas. I should welcome the Minister saying a little about the mechanisms that are currently in place or may be introduced to facilitate that exchange of information between neighbouring countries.
<P>
New clause 1 provides the Minister with a sound basis for a pollution inventory. It is much more comprehensive than the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North, and would require the Secretary of State to take action. That is an important point: there would be no scope for prevarication. It spells out clearly both the stationary and diffuse sources of emissions that will need to be monitored; it also lists in detail the information that must be made available to the public; crucially, it would require assistance to be given to members of the public, so that they could understand the information presented to them. It is one thing to make information available&#151;even if it is freely and readily available on the internet&#151;but it is entirely another matter for the public to be able to understand that information and track progress year on year concerning changes in emissions.
<P>
The new clause and the new schedule are necessities. Other Committee members have referred to the draft Freedom of Information Bill. There is genuine concern that little freedom and little information will be available under that Bill. If we can incorporate the provision into this Bill, it will provide a safeguard that the public deserve.
<P>
New schedule 1 lists the hazardous properties or characteristics that must be considered and monitored. That would help the process of identifying which pollutants should be monitored. As the Committee will see, they range from explosive substances through to teratogenic substances&#151;which for Committee members who have not recently consulted their ``Chambers'' dictionary, means monster-producing substances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for improving my understanding of the relevant terminology. Can he give some examples of monster-producing substances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Hon. Members could do no better than to look around the Room and dwell on what monster-producing substances have given rise to some of their colleagues.
<P>
I would be pleasantly surprised if the Minster agreed to accept new clause 1 and new schedule 1, because I think that he will resist them. They should therefore be seen as probing amendments to find out what the Minister intends to do about pollution inventories in the months and years to come.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that the Minister will outline his vision of what a comprehensive pollution inventory will cover. Will he also tell us what parts of new clause 1 and new schedule 1 he cannot support, whether he has in mind a timetable for developing pollution inventories, what estimates he has made of the potential costs&#151;which is a matter of genuine concern&#151;and whether he can guarantee to introduce regulations before the next general election so that some of these good ideas can be put into practice?
<P>
<B>Mr. David Drew </B>(Stroud): I am pleased to be serving under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Brien, and hope that I can assist you by being brief in my remarks.
<P>
In speaking in support of amendment No. 16, I declare an interest&#151;I am a member of Friends of the Earth. Although I do not agree with all the policies that it propagates, it has done some valuable work in this area.
<P>
In respect of amendment No. 15, I am genuinely confused as to who would determine what a public order danger would be. Perhaps an Opposition Member would care to answer that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake), referred to probing amendments. Regardless of that, they have not only improved my understanding of certain scientific terms, but appear to include everything from the kitchen sink onwards. Perhaps they are one of the waste materials that people should know about. A degree of realism and reasonableness should be involved in the principle of pollution inventories, and the hon. Gentleman may have gone too far in trying to include everything.
<P>
There are some good reasons for supporting pollution inventories. It is a basic right to know what pollution is being produced next door. I am always surprised to hear the matter spoken about as if only private individuals were affected. We are also talking about business&#151;one business may be affected by the pollution of another business. It is often the case that small business is affected by big business. The principle that the polluter pays is now almost de rigueur in our approach to environmental legislation. However, that can happen only if one knows what the polluter is producing. That links in to the necessity for access to information, which will encourage, help and give greater security of knowledge to business, as well as to householders or any other private individuals who are affected by pollution.
<P>
I should like to touch on another issue, which was not raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North and about which I feel strongly. In genuinely seeking to use brown-field sites, we must accept that more and more of those sites will be contaminated. Knowing exactly what contaminant was used should make the building up of databases, and subsequent development processes, easier.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Why does the hon. Gentleman believe that he needs the amendment? I do not know why I should do the Government's job for them, but paragraph (12)(a) of schedule 1 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``publicity is given to specified matters''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does not that cover the hon. Gentleman's position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Drew:</B> I thank the hon. Lady. I am open-minded. If my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment or my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary gives us a clear explanation of the Government's position&#151;I am sure that they are in favour in principle of pollution inventories&#151;we will know how it can be put into practice. However, it is still important that we have this debate. We should make it clear that pollution inventories are not a theoretical exercise and that they affect not just some of our constituents, but everyone, including business.
<P>
We have debated the right of access to information, and I have talked about brown-field sites. However, the obverse of the issue is that if we do not improve the amount of information in the public domain, all sorts of adverse consequences will arise because certain businesses&#151;I am sure that we all have constituency examples&#151;will misbehave and fail to play fair with their neighbours. We should consider the other side of the issue: we do not have the guarantees and secure knowledge that provisions have worked well in the past. That is why the Bill has been introduced and why Labour Members support it. With some qualifications, Opposition parties, too, will want it to go through.
<P>
The Bill is a clear statement. I have read various materials, including ``In Trust for Tomorrow'', which Labour Members still think is a good document and which was produced before the previous election. The Labour party made its environmental credentials clear and said that it would stand on a strong environmental programme. We have yet to tackle the issues that some of us want to, but the Bill is an important first step, as was mentioned on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is so confident that the Government are living up to their pre-election promises, will he explain why, as we move into the Administration's third year, the only legislation before the House is a measure that the Government had to implement on a tight time scale because of a European directive that the previous Conservative Government agreed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Drew:</B> I am sure that we discussed that on Second Reading. Much is yet to come. Thankfully, Governments are elected for a four or five-year term. If the Queen's speech is as one would want it to be, plenty of good things are yet to come. However, we are debating the Bill, which we want in place. Obviously, the Opposition's role is to oppose. If they do that, however, they slow down some of the good things, even though they signed up to the directive. That can never be forgotten.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): It took 18 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Drew:</B> It took 18 years to introduce, as my hon. Friend says.
<P>
I am open-minded and willing to listen to what my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment or my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary says.
<P>
The amendment is important because it goes to the heart of the way in whch we consider issues such as the polluter paying, access to information, and playing fair with business so that it knows exactly what is going on next door. I hope that the Government will look favourably on the amendment and on taking pollution inventories forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth R. Thomas </B>(Harrow, West): I, too, welcome the opportunity to serve on a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North for the way in which she introduced the amendment. I sympathise with the general thrust of her remarks. I commend my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment on the pollution inventory. Galling as it clearly is for the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, the inventory is further proof that the Government are delivering on their manifesto. It was in the manifesto, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) said. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North, I should declare an interest in that I serve on the Environmental Audit Committee. Yet another manifesto commitment was fulfilled when that Committee was established.
<P>
One of the points in the amendment that I endorse is the call for further data on energy consumption to be published. That is entirely sensible; it may aid the development of an emissions trading scheme, which the Government are currently discussing with business representatives. The sooner such a pilot scheme is established, the sooner we can establish a competitive advantage in that area for British business. The point has been made that we need to take business with us, but I suspect that to do so may require further work.
<P>
I hope that when my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment replies to the debate, he will indicate his sympathy for the general thrust of the direction in which my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North proposes to take us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Harry Barnes </B>(North-East Derbyshire): I support the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North and congratulate her on the amendment. I realise that it may be argued that many of the items proposed in the amendment are catered for in the Bill. This is a good Bill, which does not simply implement European Union directives. It refers to ``preventing and controlling pollution''. It is already a considerable piece of legislation, and the amendment would develop it further in terms of public access to information on matters such as emission details.
<P>
I want to describe a number of incidents in the constituency that I represent. In the Staveley area, Stanton plc and Staveley Chemicals have had a case brought against them by a farmer, Mr. Wareing, who used to live in the area at The Breck. Some of his calves were born blind or had serious eye defects. I once visited the farm and he showed me a photosensitive cow. It had great problems when it was moved into the light because the white bits of its skin would decay.
<P>
Mr. Wareing developed, over a considerable number of years, a whole host of information and sought to bring a court case. In fact, the case has only recently been pulled out by his barristers. Some &#163;1.5 million had been spent in legal aid.
<P>
I supported the action taken by Mr. Wareing on the ground that he held all sorts of information. He might have been reluctant to put some of it in the public domain at that stage because it would have affected his interests. However, a court case would have put all the information about what was taking place in the public domain. That would have been of great advantage in understanding the situation.
<P>
Stanton plc was once discovered to have a problem with dioxin. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was doing a grid analysis of dioxin levels in different parts of the country. When it was the turn of north-east Derbyshire, MAFF thought that it would be fruitful to test developments in the Staveley area, given the problems that had occurred at Coalite in the 1950s when there was a massive escape of dioxin.
<P>
When that survey was carried out in the Staveley area, dioxin was discovered, but of a different strain from that which had come from Coalite. It was still serious&#151;some types of dioxin do not present problems; others do. Further investigations therefore had to take place, and the dioxin was discovered in the sludge at Stanton plc. That information meant that action could be taken to clear up the matter.
<P>
Considerable improvements were made, because we were lucky enough to have discovered the problem almost by accident. That led to an investigation at Stanton itself, which is in fact in the Amber Valley constituency. Exactly the same problem was discovered there, and could be dealt with because the information had been provided.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The type of information that Mr. Wareing possesses is of tremendous importance. I am likely to have to use it in the House, perhaps in an Adjournment debate, in order to elaborate on the problems. I am in contact with a whole range of authorities to try to build on the information that he discovered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> If I have followed the honourable Gentleman's line of argument correctly, he is saying that the polluting enterprise was not aware of the extent of the pollutants that it was emitting. In that case, that would not be covered by the amendment, because the enterprise could not register them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barnes:</B> The amendment would direct people to try to provide information about what was taking place in their areas. They would therefore have to pay much closer attention to what they were doing. When problems at the farm were brought to the attention of local firms, there would be pressure to ensure that the information supplied was substantial.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give us an idea of the dates of the occurrences that he describes? From the way that he tells it, it sounds as though the information has emerged as a result of prevention of pollution legislation and the Environment Agency's actions as a result. It would be interesting if he could tell us when the Stanton plc episode and the farm episode occurred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barnes:</B> The incident on the farm took place over a 20-year period, and was being dealt with by my two predecesors. The discovery of dioxin must have occurred about seven years ago. Some of the legislation to which the hon. Lady refers was not in place at the stage.
<P>
The second issue to which I want to refer is that of Avenue Cokeworks in my constituency, which is a derelict coke work site. Plans were accepted to open-cast the area and move contaminated land into a waste cell. For a considerable period, I have chaired a committee on the matter, which has included local councillors, English Partnerships and environmental groups, including a representative from Friends of the Earth. Trying to discover detailed information on the matter has been like peeling the skin of an onion. The wide open-cast plan and the decision to move contaminated land into the waste cell are now in abeyance. There is to be no open-casting on half of the site, and it is likely that arguments about the use of alternative biodegradable techniques are now very much to the fore. The obligation to supply information, as proposed by the amendment, would have aided the process. It would have ensured that we would not be stuck with the problems or have to engage in rear-guard action.
<P>
Now, the circumstances are fairly hopeful. The problem is that the site is an eyesore. It is available for further industrial development, and action should be taken quickly. Problems have arisen because the wrong path has been taken, and because we did not have the correct information to allow us to take the right path.
<P>
The third issue that I shall mention is well known to my right hon. Friend the Minister, as he has visited the area in question. At Killamarsh in my constituency, there is a Sarp UK site that has had two massive escapes of acid gas, which have significantly affected the local community. The company has discovered drums of rocket fuel on its site, and has encountered a whole host of problems. Had the type of information whose availability the amendment seeks to ensure been accessible, those problems may never have arisen.
<P>
The firm was previously called Leigh Environmentals; I have referred in the House to matters concerning the site for 10 years or so. In fact, I remember introducing after a consolidated fund debate at about five o'clock in the morning a debate entitled ``The Environmental Regeneration of North-East Derbyshire''. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North was on the Front Bench, and thought that I was adopting a good tactic, as I could deal with the whole range of environmental problems about which I was concerned. I was seeking developments in legislation such as those in the Bill, and the opportunity to table an amendment such as the one before us.
<P>
It was hard to gain access to Leigh Environmentals or to obtain any response from it. Sarp UK has been much more open, but it has almost been obliged to be so by the horrendous circumstances that the local community has faced. Some of the problems in the community relate to amendment No. 15 and to concern about public audit commissions. The local residents have organised themselves into a pressure group called RASP&#151;Residents Against Sarp Pollution. Like many pressure groups, RASP has sometimes contained an element that has gone a bit over the top.
<P>
That tendency has been displayed in regular picketing and demonstration outside the Sarp plant, which has sometimes led to the work force having been held up and kept in the confines of the plant. They feel that threats have been directed towards them. RASP has done a fantastic amount of valuable investigatory work, and has usually presented and organised its case well and exerted pressure through legitimate means.
<P>
I remember an especially important meeting between local councillors and RASP representatives, which my right hon. Friend the Minister attended. I like to think that the meeting has had some impact on the Bill. Provisions in clause 2 would have dealt very well with some of the problems faced by the community, and would have enabled action to be taken. More information should have been available then, and it would have been better to have tackled the problems long ago. Instead, two disastrous incidents occurred, which led to the community having to mobilise and organise itself into a pressure group.
<P>
As a rule, I do not find that communities bound forth and become active on pollution matters around them. That does not occur in the Staveley area, of which I talked initially. There, a limited number of people present the arguments and cases because others are used to living near particular plants. Also, they realise that important jobs are associated with the plants. Often, people have almost to be prodded into understanding the local pollution difficulties&#151;information on that is invaluable. As in the case of Stanton plc and dioxin, things can be done to put areas right.
<P>
I dispute the Opposition's continuous claim that not much can be done in such areas, and that we should be careful about the information that is supplied because it has a bad economic effect, causing plants to be shut and trade lost. Biwaters, another plant in my constituency, was producing considerable pollution and requirements were placed on it by the then pollution inspector. Further trade orders came from Malaysia, and the plant wished to expand; pollution was dealt with as part of that expansion. More investment took place to expand the works, more profits were made and more workers from the local area were taken on. An extra burden need not be placed on industry by the proposed measures in every case.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meale:</B> It is true that details of the pollutants on the Sarpuk site in Killamarsh came to light only after health and safety hazards had occurred. That stands in support of my hon. Friend's argument that we need different controls nationally to deal with the problem. He rightly said that information is key. I recall reading a report produced by someone sympathetic to the RASP campaign which, because of lack of information, almost predicted the end of the world. It would have been far better if that person had had the information&#151;the report would have been more reflective and more accurate in its descriptions.
<P>
My hon. Friend's latter point concerned the need to avoid pressure on business. The reverse has occurred for the company that now owns the Sarp site. Because information on pollutants was made available, due to the efforts of agencies and local authorities, that company has invested vast sums in anti-pollutant measures. They would never have been introduced unless such information had come to light.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barnes:</B> I always believe in the great importance of having as much information and as many markers about what is taken to be pollution as possible. At one time, only dioxin levels in milk had a marker. When dioxin was discovered in the Staveley area, milk in nearby farms was taken off the market and sent to Leicester to be diluted witih other milk&#151;cheese was made from it. The level of dioxin was discovered not to be dangerous, and locally produced milk went back on sale.
<P>
Amendment No. 15 claims that the supply of information presents a danger to public order. There are dangers in a lack of information and ignorance. There is danger in people being able to mobilise and campaign about a matter that concerns them without sufficient information to present a substantial case. When people know the details, they may then know the possible alternatives and what action they should take. I hope that the Minister will respond fully to the points that amendment No. 16 raises, because they make a valuable contribution to the debate.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I should like to support my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green), who spoke to amendment No. 15. The speech of the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Mr. Barnes) highlighted the importance of existing legislation and the Bill&#151;the bulk of which, as amended in another place, we support. The hon. Gentleman is correct: people need information, and control of pollution legislation and the creation of the Environment Agency have facilitated that. I was grateful to him for providing the dates of the incidents to which he referred, many of which came to light because the requirements of reporting, regulating and information had become part of the system. Control of pollution legislation was also crucial to the issue of dioxin in milk, which, if my memory serves me correctly, arose in the early 1980s.
<P>
In terms of the levels of reporting and information given, the current system deals a hand that is acceptable to most reasonable people. As I pointed out in an intervention on the hon. Member for Stroud, schedule 1 requires publicity to be given. Amendment No. 16 is unnecessary and would be burdensome on business. It would apply to big and small businesses, and involves the argument about the need to avoid the gold-plating of regulations. Given the extra burdens that the Government are constantly placing on business, the last thing that we need to do is add yet more costly regulation to the large and small businesses that are crucial to the creation of wealth in this country and operate in a global environment.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 15. My experience of working in the chemical industry demonstrated to me the need for some form of control over potential public disorder when providing information. Many scientists trying to develop new pharmaceuticals have been physically attacked, had phone calls in the middle of the night and received threats to their families, such as their children when at school. Those actions are taken by people who oppose the work that such scientists do. They lead not only to physical damage, but to marriage breakdown and the creation of understandable emotional and pyschological problems in families. It is always possible for those who are prepared to take such action to inflict physical, mental and emotional damage on people in order to deduce names and addresses, however careful people are about trying to ensure that they are ex-directory and that their addresses appear in as few public documents as possible. If they want to vote, however, their names must appear on the electoral register. That concerns me particularly because science is developing in ways that we had not even thought of 20 or even 10 years ago. The sciences of biotechnology or genetic engineering might develop in ways that result in wastes and pollutants of which we had not even thought. It is, therefore, important to have some form of control in the Bill over the potential for violence and other action against those involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I was hoping that the hon. Lady would spell out in a little more detail what would fall within the catch-all phrase ``prejudicial to public order''?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> If I may return to Friday's events, it was clear that not only the City police, but the people from the Common Council down knew&#151;from information that was published on the internet&#151;that there would be disorder. In such circumstances, the producers and regulators and people who have concerns must consult to reach a modus operandi. That is a well-known and well-established practice in determining what is prejudicial to public order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree with that explanation&#151;I will not go so far as to call it a definition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allen:</B> She used to work for the CIA.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am very proud to say that I used to work for the Chemical Industries Association. I have kept the information that I learned in those days up to date because the issues involved reflect strongly on our country.
<P>
One issue is crucial. I accept that people need to know the relevant information, but they also need to know the science that is involved. Scares are often whipped up by people who prey on those who, with a small understanding of science, do not have the basic knowledge that is required to make a balanced judgment about whether something is a threat to their future.
<P>
I hope that the Government will accept that there is a strong argument for amendment No. 15 and will include it in the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> I, too, am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
We have had an excellent debate by and large, although there were one or two exceptions, to which I shall come. The discussion has been fair-minded, balanced and generally thoughtful and represents parliamentary Committee work at its best.
<P>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North on the way in which she introduced the amendment; she made an excellent speech. She made a strong and persuasive case for providing the public with thorough and easily accessible information about pollution in their area. I have strongly championed that goal and continue to do so.
<P>
I also pay tribute to my other hon. Friends on the Committee's they achieved some success in the debate. The hon. Member for Ashford opened the case for the Opposition. He was rather curmudgeonly about what will be a popular proposal. The air was thick with references to public disorder, commercial confidentiality and burdens on business. The initial remarks, at least of the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait), were a more open and understanding recognition of the purpose of the amendment. She is increasingly becoming known as a former member of the CIA; at the end of her comments she slightly reverted to type.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford is a civilised man, but this morning he was obviously a little out of sorts. I shall not make much of that&#151;he has not been on the Opposition Front Bench for very long and I do not want to prejudice his future, but he had missed the fact that the Water Industry Bill is going through the House. He also missed the climate change levy and a cascade of transport taxation, which has a huge environmental impact on fuel efficiency and vehicle emissions.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman does not seem to realise the important point that legislation proposed by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is not the prime deliverer of better environmental standards. That is the role of regulations and legislation introduced by other Departments, all of which has a massive effect on the environment, energy efficiency, transport, the countryside, as overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, a range of industrial matters such as chemicals. The hon. Gentleman has a long period in which to learn about those matters and I am sure that he will increasingly pick up on them.
<P>
As we are trying to establish, access to such information is part of an open society. Such access allows people to take informed decisions based on the knowledge of emissions in their midst. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire strongly pointed out, it helps industry and other emitters to know what is being released. It helps regulators and policy makers know of trends in emsisions.
<P>
I am not familiar with the case of Stanton plc, to which my hon. Friend referred, but I am familiar with that of Sarp in Killamarsh. When I visited the area for a whole day a year ago, I was acutely aware of the concern of people in the area to know exactly which chemicals had been released on the emergence of a huge, dark and threatening orange cloud. Although they might still have been concerned, their possibly excessive fears would have been calmed&#151;if not their peace of mind restored&#151;had systematic data been issued.
<P>
Between two and four weeks ago, I had at my surgery a constituent who, as a result of the issue being raised in the media, said that she had learned for the first time that her daughter was at a school close to what she now believed to be one of the most polluting factories in Britain. Irrespective of whether that was so, she was uptight about the matter. She demanded to know why she had not been told that information before, and why such information was not regularly available. I tried to calm her down, and explained that we were to provide much more systematic data.
<P>
We are not acting because the measure might be populist, but because it will be highly popular. A basic requirement of a civilised society is that people know that the contents of the air, water and land around them are safe, that they are not being poisoned and that they are not subject to risk.
<P>
For all those reasons, I support the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North. As she knows, I launched the Environment Agency's new pollution inventory about a month ago. I expect that inventory to become a powerful instrument in promoting emission reduction. Not only by letting people know about the problem, but by harnessing public opinion, will we bear down on the polluters to see what efforts they can make to reduce pollution. Again, I think that that is perfectly proper.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am the first to admit that the new inventory is not perfect, but it is the first of many improvements that I hope will be made. It is certainly a massive improvement on the agency's old chemical releases inventory. Under the former system, reporting applied only to 2,000 or so IPC processes. There were no standard lists of pollutants, and data did not appear for years after collection. All that is changing. The new inventory includes 1998 data&#151;I hope that we can make it even more up to date in future&#151;reported against a standard list of pollutants, live on the internet. That is quite a big step forward.
<P>
I emphasise that our ambitions for the pollution inventory do not stop there. I, for one, am not satisfied with that. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North pointed out, there is scope for broadening the inventory still further&#151;for example, to cover sewerage works and landfill sites, which the Environment Agency also regulates. The agency is already considering this, and intends to consult on the options.We have also been studying the feasibility of extending the inventory to the 13,000 or so installations regulated by local authorities under local air pollution control.
<P>
Much of the extension of the inventory, about which the Government are proposing to consult, could take place under existing powers. I am not against taking on further powers where necessary, but we already have considerable powers. We can, for example, require reporting of the air emissions of processes regulated under local air pollution control under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. If, after consulting on the options, we decide to proceed in that way, that may well be the route that we follow, especially if we want to make rapid progress, because the powers already exist. I repeat that there is much that can be done under existing powers to extend the range of information collected from sewerage works and landfill site operators to improve the inventory.
<P>
However, if we are ever to have a fully comprehensive inventory, in which all these installation&#151;and perhaps others as well&#151;provide information about emissions of pollutants to air, water and land, we shall need to use the powers in paragraph 11 of schedule 1. We shall be using those powers in any event when the European Commission decides on its requirements for an inventory of emissions from all integrated pollution prevention and control installations, as it is entitled to do under article 15(3) of the IPPC directive. Under the directive, the commission is required to publish, every three years, an inventory of the principal responsible emissions and sources on the basis of data supplied by member states. Paragraph 11 gives us the powers that we shall need to obtain that data&#151;in particular the power, if the commission so decides, to obtain data from installations which have not yet received a permit under existing legislation or regulations to be made under this Bill. Paragraph 11 is a comprehensive enabling power under which we can develop as comprehensive an inventory as we like.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Walley:</B> In view of my right hon. Friend's comments on the comprehensive nature of paragraph 11, could he tell the Committee whether any emissions from sewerage works, landfill sites or energy used could not be included in an inventory under the powers to which he has referred?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> My hon. Friend has anticipated what I am about to say. On energy efficiency and resource use, there is an extension of the powers that we already have. However, with regard to landfill sites, sewerage works and local air pollution control, we already have such powers.
<P>
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington described his aspirations for a comprehensive inventory. I have tried to set out the Government's position, and I hope that he appreciates that I am sympathetic to what he is trying to do. We also have aspirations&#151;in fact, they are more than aspirations, because I certainly intend to achieve the things that I have been talking about. However, there is a difference between having aspirations and making legally binding commitments, which is what the amendment would entail. We cannot sign up to a legal commitment to extend the inventory to the hundreds of thousands of installations that are listed in the amendment when we have no idea of the costs involved.
<P>
In that respect, I have some sympathy with Opposition Members. Of course costs must be taken into account, as well as the feasibility of rolling out the inventory on such a vast scale. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud also drew attention to that. I certainly cherish ambitions in that direction, but it would be wrong to make a legally binding commitment in Committee, as the amendment would require, when we currently have no idea of the cost and feasibility of doing so.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham referred to the measure's impact on business. She suggested that further reporting requirements on pollutants at a local level could have an uncompetitive impact. Would she favour a level playing field with the United States, which has probably the most comprehensive&#151;some might say, the most burdensome&#151;pollution inventory in the world? The toxic releases inventory in the US is in many ways an admirable model. It suggests that her argument that providing information causes competitive disadvantages does not necessarily hold true&#151;otherwise, I am sure that the Americans would not have gone down that route. The US is a very open society and there is a considerable demand for information, but I am not aware of any disadvantages in this context.
<P>
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington asked whether there was a mechanism for sharing information between different member states. Such information is available to anyone from public registers or the internet, and a mechanism is therefore unnecessary. The IPPC directive merely provides for a formal procedure for large plants. We encourage the sharing of information, and would like to see the creation of an international league table of EU countries. The information for which we are providing will allow that to be compiled by anyone who wishes to do so.
<P>
Amendment No. 16, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North, and to which Liberal Democrat Members put their names, differs from the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington's proposals. Like the Bill, the amendment contains enabling powers to set up an inventory. Incidentally, I have noticed that I am in a minority in my pronunciation of that word&#151;I say ``invent'ry'', while others say ``in-vent-ory''. I am not sure which is correct, but I am sure that we all understand what we are referring to.
<P>
The powers in amendment No. 16 would go wider than those in the Bill by making it possible to require the reporting of energy efficiency, and/or energy consumption, as well as details of the final destination of individual waste streams. Those are the only two points of substance on which the amendment differs from the Bill. That was recently confirmed to me in a letter that my officials received from the Environment Agency, which cleared up earlier confusion about whether an amendment was necessary. I shall quote two paragraphs from it. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an amendment to the Bill is not necessary to secure reporting from Agency regulated installations.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``However, the Bill's powers could not be used to secure reporting of energy efficiency and resource use.The Agency is attracted in principle to broadening the Pollution Inventory in this way at some future point in its development, and the Government may therefore wish to reflect on whether powers to do so should be taken while the opportunity is available.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The Agency's immediate priority, however, is to secure reporting from sewage works and landfill sites. We recognise the most realistic prospect for the early progress we both wish to see here may well be to use existing powers''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The agency clearly points out that an amendment to the Bill would be necesary for it to gather information about energy consumption and resource use. As the agency and my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North have said, it is tempting to take that opportunity, and I, too, am tempted. At the same time, we must recognise that the agency has a lot further to go in developing the inventory, both under existing powers and under the Bill as it stands. A great deal of information about energy efficiency and energy consumption will be forthcoming from the plants regulated under the IPPC anyway, as energy efficiency is a requirement of the directive.
<P>
Indeed, there may be a risk of a policy glut in the energy efficiency field, because of the combined impact of the climate change levy, IPPC, negotiated agreements and possible permit-trading regimes. We must think carefully before gratuitously adding to that glut. With that in mind, I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North and other hon. Friend's who support her amendment that I should like to do exactly as the Environment Agency suggests, and reflect carefully on the need for the proposed powers or similar ones.
<P>
I undertake to consider tabling a Government amendment on Report if my hon. Friend asks leave to withdraw her amendment. I hasten to say that I cannot promise to do so. At the very least, I would have to persuade the Lords Chief Whip that we should open up yet another issue for their lordships' consideration when the Bill returns to another place. The Lords Chief Whip is not the easiest person to persuade. I assure the Committee, however, that I shall consider the need for an amendment very carefully. I hope, therefore, that neither my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North or other hon. Members will press it to a vote.
<P>
The new schedule, which stands in the name of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, takes a different approach to the expansion of the pollution inventory. I think that the hon. Gentleman said that he did not propose it as alternative legislation, but rather as a peg on which to hang what has been a very good discussion. The hon. Gentleman and I are in a great deal of agreement, and I have tried to explain how the Government intend to proceed. I hope that he will support our approach. If the new schedule and the new clause were an attempt to legislate&#151;and I do not think that he intends them to be&#151;I would have to oppose them, for a number of reasons.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 15, and the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman. The hon. Member for Ashford will not be surprised that I cannot concur with his argument about the need for information to be denied to the public on the ground that it might lead to public disorder. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire put his finger on the matter when he referred to the risk of public disorder from the lack of information. I gave some examples of that lack. The example given by the hon. Member for Ashford was the carnival against capitalism. He had a lot of fund with that example, but, as far as I know, the event was not generated by a lack of information about the processes of capitalism. Indeed, the persons who held the demonstration did so because they thought that they knew all too well about the nature of capitalism.
<P>
I cannot believe&#151;after the Conservative party was in power for 18 years&#151;that the hon. Member for Ashford does not accept that there is perfectly adequate legislation to deal with public disorder, trespass, damage to property and other such criminal activity in relation to installations that are regulated under the Bill and any other premises.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire asked the hon. Member for Ashford what information he thought should be removed from, or not put on, a public register on the ground that it might cause damage or disorder. The hon. Member for Ashford gave the example of letter-bombs sent to scientists, but nobody in his right senses thinks that the Bill has anything to do with that. Of course nobody supports such practices, but the Bill will not generate them. Nobody is going to put scientists' names and addresses or details of where their children go to school and what they had for lunch on the public register&#151;they have nothing to do with the register.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I will make one more point and then, of course, I will give way.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford is perhaps on firmer ground&#151;he touched on this later&#151;as regards the grid references for genetically modified crop sites, which we have to put on the internet and in the public register. We are required to do so under the Genetically Modfied Organisms (Deliberate Releases) Regulations 1992. There is an argument about whether we should do that. I still believe that it is right to do so, and I will give the hon. Gentleman one reason why. It is not simply a matter of openness. We should not have no-go areas; that is a bad principle, which the Government do not support.
<P>
There is, however, a further problem. If one does not provide the relevant information, but tries to conceal it, groups that are bent on such activities will, by one means or another, compile what they think is a database of that information. I am sure&#151;there are already good examples of this&#151;that they get things wrong. They then destroy farms, and innocent farmers' livelihoods are also put at risk. This is not an easy issue, but it is quite wrong to suggest that the fullest information&#151;not personal details, but information about installations and premises&#151;should not be made available. Nobody in the Committee remotely supports the activity that I described; it should be dealt with very strongly, using existing powers on the statute book.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I certainly agree with the right hon. Gentleman in deploring such actions, particularly where people have got addresses wrong. Does he agree, however, that, on many occasions, they have got names and addresses right, and have deduced them from available information? I would not for a moment give names and addresses in Committee, but people have got them right and have inflicted immense destruction and distress on individuals and their families.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Of course information might be secured and then used for illegal, anti-social or criminal activity. That could, however, happen in a totalitarian society in which every conceivable effort was made to restrict information to just the authorities and limited numbers of people. One cannot prevent people from finding some things out and acting on them.
<P>
We must decide whether to endorse the entirely proper principle that there should be an entitlement to know about emission levels and pollutants in people's neighbourhoods, or whether such things should be concealed. I cannot believe that anyone would seriously propose that we should not provide that information on the ground that it might lead to public disorder. There could be a riot to demand that information if we tried to conceal it.
<P>
If Opposition Members are still concerned about the issue, they should read paragraph 12(b) of schedule 1, as it does what they want. The list of purposes includes securing
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that regulators maintain registers of specified matters (but excepting information which under the regulations is, or is determined to be, commercially confidential''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and these are the key words&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and subject to any other exceptions specified in the regulations)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If we wanted to go down that route, we could. But I repeat that I will not see local people's rights to information diminished, except on the most compelling grounds.
<P>
I cannot see that the need for the proposed provision is anywhere near compelling enough to outweigh the risk that it might be exploited as a dubious excuse for concealing information about pollution about which the public are entitled to know. It is much more likely that the use of commercial confidentiality or other reasons might be a vehicle for trying to deny information, but since it has not been raised in the debate, I shall not dwell on it.
<P>
I conclude by saying that the public's right to know, which the new pollution inventory will fulfil, extends to the precise location of the sources of emission so that local people can make fully informed decisions about how they respond to conditions in their environment. I have no intention of accepting an amendment that might diminish that right. Having said that, I have a great deal of sympathy for the views put forward on both sides of the Committee, including those from the Liberal Democrat Bench. I hope that I have persuaded my hon. Friends and other members of the Committee that I strongly support what they want to do. The Government already have ambitions in that direction and will be coming forward with further measures to achieve them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Before I turn to the substance of amendment No. 15 and the Minister's extraordinary argument about it, let me say that I obviously struck a raw nerve in what was simply an intervention on the hon. Member for Stroud on the record of the Department of the Environment. I was fascinated by his apologia pro vita sua for the past two years. As he says, I have been doing this job for less than a week, but first impressions are very strong, and the right hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to learn that the first impression of anyone moving into this field is that expectations among those who care most about the environment in this country were extremely high two years ago, and they have been badly dissappointed. If he thinks that the Water Industry Bill was a major measure that reversed that disappointment, I am afraid that he deludes himself.
<P>
Only this week, the right hon. Gentleman talked about the climate change levy and emission levels generally. His Department's dithering over the London underground, which has led to the collapse of the Circle line, is hardly designed to keep traffic off the roads in London. There will be more traffic on the road. The Government have done nothing but hum and ha for two years; they still have not come to a sensible decision and are presiding over the worst tube network in our history. That should give the people who want to use public transport&#151;of which the Government always say they are in favour&#151;pause for thought.
<P>
On amendment No. 15, the Minister was at least coherent, if wrong, until he came to the end of his speech. He then spent five minutes saying that the amendment was ludicrous and that there was no need for it. He said that it was a silly amendment and could not be serious, ``Oh, and by the way, the powers are in the Bill anyway,'' he said. The Minister can hold one view or the other but he cannot, with any intellectual coherence, hold both at once.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister is sincere in his concern that public order would be more affected by unnecessary secrecy, and I think that there is some truth in that. So why did the Government accept an amendment in the House of Lords that allowed commercial confidentiality to be a reason for secrecy? He will be as aware as I am that if a company were behaving nefariously and trying to keep secret information that should be in the public domain, it would not be beyond the ingenuity of such a company to try to define that information as commercially confidential. He is not promoting a regime of absolute openness. Having opened that gate, it seems perverse to argue that any other gates which might lead one to the feeling that there may be reasonable restrictions on the information should not be opened too.
<P>
The hon. Member for Stroud asked who would decide such questions: I am sure that he has read the schedule fully and seen our amendment that would amend paragraph 12(b), which specifies that the regulators will maintain registers of specified matters with certain exceptions. All that the amendment seeks to add is the public order exception to the commercial confidentiality exception already planned for under paragraph 12(b). From the sudden outburst on the matter from the Government Benches, it struck me that a seam of worry over too much emphasis on public order had been struck, setting the juices flowing. I had clearly hit an old Labour seam. Old Labour may be coming back into fashion this week, and I am glad to see the first signs that it is.
<P>
Until the Minister got to the last bit of his speech, which contradicted everything else he had said, he had been arguing that no public order considerations could be allowed, even though commercial confidentiality considerations could. I do not wish to get him into trouble about this, but that seemed to me to be a rather elegant combination of old and new Labour stances&#151;he is prepared to accept businesses' commercial confidentiality considerations but not public order considerations. I was also fascinated that the Minister said,&#151;I think that these are his exact words&#151;that we have perfectly adequate legislation on trespass. In that context, I look forward to seeing the right to roam legislation.
<P>
Our proposal would be enforced by the regulators, whom we can clearly trust&#151;if we cannot trust them, we are in trouble. They report to the Secretary of State, and one assumes that we can trust him not to allow companies to try to avoid giving information that should rightly be in the public domain. A balance must be struck, as the Government admit.
<P>
We are trying to point out the ever present danger of people using information for the wrong purposes. The Minister and other Government Members have asked under what circumstances information might be revealed. Let us consider a company that did something of which people with views that might lead them to violent action disapproved. The identities of the main directors of that company would be in the public domain; means of obtaining their home addresses would probably be available. Information of the sort that no member of the Committee would want revealed could be obtained through only a few practical steps.
<P>
My main point is that the Minister shot himself in the foot by revealing that, if the regulators decided that withholding information for reasons of public order would be legitimate, they would have the power to do so. There is a symbolic value in adopting the amendment because it shows that we should care not only about commercial considerations but about the considerations of public order shared by all members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Ms Walley:</B> I shall briefly address some of the points that have been made during the debate. First, the hon. Member for Ashford said that expectations were high when the new Labour Government entered office. Of course they were high&#151;we had had 18 years of so little concern about the environment, during which huge liabilities accumulated. It is absolutely right that the Government should start to put things right. I wish to place on record my thanks to organisations such as Friends of the Earth, which has done so much to assist the provision of greater public information and the promotion of the right to know about issues that are now on a list waiting to be dealt with. Of course expectations are high, and of course we must do something about them. That was why I wanted the amendment that I tabled to be part of a constructive debate, ensuring that any forthcoming legislation is right.
<P>
I am grateful for my hon. Friends' support in this debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas), who serves on the Select Committee on Environmental Audit, along with me spoke about the importance of energy efficiency and about energy emissions. It is clear, given the huge international debate, and the huge progress that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has made on the Kyoto commitments, that not only must we set our own targets as high as possible, we must meet them. The point made by my hon. Friend backs up the need for a proper trading scheme. That will be made so much easier if we have the wherewithal and the expertise to monitor energy in that way.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud talked about principles and referred to issues about contaminated land. It is precisely because we have had to deal with so much contaminated land that it is all the more important to draw a line so that future operations may start afresh. The pollution inventory will give us the means to achieve that.
<P>
I am particularly grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire for reminding me that some of us have served in this place for a good part of those 18 years under the Tories. It could be 5 o'clock in the morning, or some other time of the day or night, and we would be trying to do something about the huge problems faced by people the length and breadth of the United Kingdom as a result of them not knowing which pollutants and emissions were contaminating our land, air and water.
<P>
For all those reasons. I hope that the Bill will be able to deliver on the principles that we hold dear. It should be able to address what Friends of the Earth has referred to as a democratic deficit in the current powers, which will enable the Environment Agency to address issues which have not been as completely covered as they would have been.
<P>
I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Minister. He has broken new ground, and not simply in enabling the introduction of the inventory on 12th May, which is carried out by the Environment Agency. It is to his credit that he has done so much work to enable greater access to information&#151;the first stage in dealing with the problems of pollution and contamination. Without that, we cannot introduce changes in policies, whether through regulation or the Department of Trade and Industry, whether on health policy or simply in taking our responsibilities in Europe and internationally as seriously as we should.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Minister is right in saying that this is not simply a case of what the DETR does. We are talking about information that enables the issue of sustainable development to be placed at the heart of Government policies.
<P>
My main concern is that the restrictive powers on the statute book should go wider. I have listened carefully to my right hon. Friend's point that sewerage works and landfill sites appear to be excluded, or at least not properly covered. I think that it is in his interests that they should be. I am mindful of his responsibilities in overseeing the issuing of licences. Under water resources legislation, he can obtain information only when permits come up for renewal every three or four years. Showing in an inventory, what sewerage works or landfill sites are pumping into the water would be an added incentive for my right hon. Friend to provide much better protection of the public interest by keeping tighter control over the operations of the relevant companies and industries. It is in my right hon. Friend's interests&#151;given his responsibilities to the nation&#151;to obtain such information to enable him to operate most effectively, with all the powers that he has, on the public's behalf.
<P>
Whether we are talking about schools and people's homes that are near to landfill sites, sewerage works and industry, or pollution that transport causes, we need to know, cradle to grave, what is being produced and where the waste ends up. Contamination of ground water causes huge problems, and we must tighten up much more on industrial pollutants. I am pleased that my right hon. Friend has recognised the three loopholes in legislation as it is currently interpreted. One loophole is that the Environment Agency cannot, even now, cover all the processes that we would like it to. I listened carefully to my right hon. Friend's remarks about the extension of the inventory to cover sewerage works and landfill sites, and about other sites that could be included. I am conscious that it is not acceptable for local authorities to take action on a case-by-case basis. The provisions must be enforced in their entirety, insofar as they cover the whole of the United Kingdom. I am pleased to see my right hon. Friend nodding. Further such issues relate to the Environment Agency, and to energy and resources.
<P>
I have not been in the House all this time to be impatient now or to say that I cannot wait any longer, if waiting means that proper changes may be put on the statute book. I have listened carefully to my right hon. Friend's remarks. He mentioned the possibility of problems in the other place, and said that it might not be easy to secure co-operation on the broad issues that I am raising given its difficult passage there. If he would like me to go with him to help convince Government managers or to encourage them to consider the matter, I am prepared to do so&#151;[Interruption.] I did not hear what was just said from a sedentary position, but perhaps that is just as well.

<B>Mr. Green:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Walley:</B> It is probably best if the Committee retains some order. My right hon. Friend the Minister pointed out at the start of the debate that it is to the Government's credit that we set up the Environmental Audit Select Committee, which considers various environmental issues. As my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West knows, the Committee is seeking to develop more constructive partnerships with the Government. As well as being the terrier that bites the Government's heels on better environmental practices, the Committee is considering how it can work in constructive partnership with them. I remind my right hon. Friend the Minister that there might be some scope for that Committee to exert extra pressure in the course of its inquiries in order to achieve tighter legislation in respect of my aims for changing this Bill, if such pressure is needed.
<P>
I shall watch with great diligence and conscientiousness the progress that my right hon. Friend the Minister makes. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I have also listened carefully to the Minister's remarks. He has clearly considered the new clause and the new schedule, as well as amendment No. 16. I welcome his clarification of Government thinking on the matter.

<P>
</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 7, line 37, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Matters pending appeal Providing that where an appeal has been brought in accordance with rights conferred under paragraph 19, the operator may continue to operate an installation until the appeal has been heard and determined.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a matter of basic justice. People who have been accused of an illegal action and who have appealed should be regarded as innocent until proved guilty. Difficult cases could arise. Clearly, if there is a polluting incident, Ministers and regulators will want to put an end to it as fast as possible. That might encourage Ministers to reverse the normal order of things. As a result, a company might be prevented from operating a process until its appeal is heard. The Minister will be aware that such legal proceedings might take a long time, particularly if there is a dispute about scientific evidence. One problem that might arise is that a company which in the end wins an appeal might be put out of business in the intervening period. 
<P>
This issue is especially important because we are introducing a legal framework for the making of appeals in secondary legislation. Normally, that would be done through primary legislation.
<P>
The public's image of those involved in such cases is of hard-faced, large multinationals that seek to extract the last ounce of profit from a situation. However, cases might involve small farmers or small firms&#151;they do not quite fit the image of those whom the Bill is designed to hit.
<P>
Will the Minister explain whether, under the schedule, a company would always be regarded as innocent until proved guilty during an appeal, and whether it would be allowed to carry on its business as normal? If not, a safeguard along those lines would be useful in ensuring that the normal principles of justice were maintained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am rather surprised that the Opposition have tabled the amendment. As hon. Members will have seen from the draft regulations on which the Government consulted before Christmas, we intend to continue with the appeals procedure that it set out in the current legislation, for which the Opposition were responsible when they were in government. I should explain why I think that the current situation is right, as I have been requested to do so.
<P>
If an operator appeals against a decision to revoke a permit, the revocation will not take effect until the appeal is finally determined. Where an alternative method is used, and a variation, enforcement or prohibition notice is served against an operator, bringing an appeal will not prevent the notice from taking effect, and nor should it. That should not change. Let me explain why.
<P>
A prohibition notice is served where there is an imminent risk of serious damage to the environment. The amendment would render that emergency safeguard ineffective, which is clearly unacceptable. A variation notice may be served when a better technique or a cleaner technology becomes available. If a provision were in place whereby an operator could stall its introduction by appealing, that would invite wholesale abuse of the appeals system.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
How does the hon. Member for Ashford suggest safeguarding against an unscrupulous operator who lodges an appeal simply to delay the introduction of beneficial new technology? I cannot seriously imagine that he wishes to facilitate that. The Conservative party is always concerned about over-regulating administrative systems. Has the hon. Gentleman thought about the burden on the appeals system that floods of new appeals would create, and the effect on operators who had genuine grounds for an appeal but found that it could not be heard for a long time?
<P>
The current system has worked well; I am not aware of any problems with it. It deters the unscupulous and, for those who have genuine grounds on which to appeal, has not caused any of the problems about which the hon. Member for Ashford talked. I therefore see no reason to change the arrangements, and hope that on further reflection the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's clarification, especially his confirmation that he intends to carry on with the satisfactory procedures that are laid down in the 1990 Act. That puts into context the suggestion of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North&#151;who is sadly no longer in her place&#151;that the previous Government did not pass any good environmental legislation. I am happy to have the Minister's confirmation that that is not so, and that the 1990 Act was a significant step in this and other respects. With that spurt of charity, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 21, in page 7, line 42, leave out `to' and insert `, 158 and'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 22.

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I can be brief, Mr. O'Brien. These technical amendments are needed to ensure that the new regulations can apply to Her Majesty the Queen and the Prince of Wales in their private capacities.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> As hon. Members will know, the Government intend to use the Bill to make improvements to the offshore environmental regime. That includes implemeting one of the recommendations in Lord Donaldson's ``Review of Salvage and Intervention and their Command and Control''&#151;Cmnd 4193. It was published on 15 March and was instigated following events surrounding the Sea Empress oil tanker incident in 1996. Lord Donaldson's work related to the control and salvage of shipping and offshore installations in situations where there is a significant threat of pollution.
<P>
Lord Donaldson reached four basic conclusions. The first was that incidents that threaten to or actually cause marine pollution are so many and varied that involving Ministers in operational decisions is not a practical option. Ministers are entitled to be kept informed of more serious incidents and may subsequently be held to account in Parliament. While operations are in progress, however, they must stand aside and be seen to do so, leaving operational control in the hands of a Secretary of State's specially trained and appointed representatives. I am sure that all members of the Committee agree with that.
<P>
The second conclusion was that the trigger point&#151;at which the Government, in terms of their statutory powers and responsibilities, become entitled to give directions&#151;comes when there is a threat of significant pollution to the UK's pollution control zone, territorial waters or coastline. Once an incident has developed to the trigger point, the Government have an inescapable and continuing responsiblity to monitor and control the whole operation.
<P>
The third conclusion was that officers from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency should play a much larger part than in the past in operations in response to a threat of significant pollution.
<P>
The fourth conclusion, which is relevant to our debate, was that the Government response to the threat of significant pollution from or involving an offshore installation must be compatible with their response to such a threat from a shipping casualty. Furthermore, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should be given powers and responsibilities in relation to offshore installations which are similar to those of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995.
<P>
The provisions are designed to implement that fourth conclusion, and I shall briefly spell out the intention. Subsection (1) provides the Secretary of State with powers over offshore installations which are equivalent to those for ships under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. Subsection (2) defines an offshore installation by type and geographical location.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Minister will doubtless be more familiar than I am with the terms of section 1 of the Petroleum Act 1998. Why does subsection (2) of the Bill limit the scope of the new clause to facilities that are used in connection with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the exploration, development or production of petroleum''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why does it not include gas? Is gas considered to be petroleum under the terms of the Act?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am happy to quote from the Petroleum Act 1998. The meaning of petroleum is defined as follows in section 1, part I:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> 1. In this Part of this Act ``petroleum''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) includes any mineral oil or relative hydrocarbon and natural gas existing in its natural condition in strata.
<P>
</UL></FONT>I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman. He has an eagle eye, on which I congratulate him. Fortunately, my officials are just as eagle-eyed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Will the Minister clarify whether the definition of offshore installations also includes the possibility of using the wells of an offshore platform as a nuclear storage site once they are exhausted? Does it include the possibility of mineral extraction? I do not know whether that happens currently, but it is possible that offshore installations might be used for that purpose in future. Finally&#151;this is not an entirely serious point&#151;could the definition cover an initiative about which I read in the papers a few days ago, under which someone is considering using one of the platforms as a duty-free shop?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am rapidly looking through my papers to find a definition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I am happy to wait.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not have to wait long; things have speeded up. I cannot altogether read the definition in front of me, but I am pleased to tell the hon. Gentleman what common sense would suggest. The term ``petroleum'' does not include the items to which he referred.
<P>
I had reached subsection (3) of the new clause, which seeks to ensure that regulations made under it may be tailored to particular circumstances and types of offshore installations, and that they sit well with existing provisions. Subsections (4), (5) and (6) provide for consultation with statutory bodies, industry and others prior to the introduction of regulations, and for such regulations to be made by affirmative resolution of both Houses.
<P>
Government amendment No. 25 provides that powers to make and enforce regulations extend to Northern Ireland. Government amendment No. 26 reflects the fact that the Petroleum Act consolidated a good deal of oil and gas legislation, including the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982. The amendments are important, and make an important point. They use the Bill to make significant changes to the regulation of offshore installations. I hope that they are acceptable to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I have one question. I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that the new clause is a self-conscious attempt to improve the Bill by incorporating some of the important Donaldson recommendations. He will be aware that there was much discussion of the Bill's relevance and application to offshore installations during its passage through another place. It is a happy coincidence of timing that we can consider the matter now.
<P>
I did not want to add to pressure on the Minister and his officials on questions of detail while he was speaking, but I should like some clarification. The heading of the new clause refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Prevention etc. of pollution after accidents involving offshore installations''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One assumes from the Minister's remarks&#151;and common sense would dictate it&#151;that the powers are not intended to be exercised only in the immediate aftermath of accidents. I am not clear on why the phrase ``after accidents'' appears in the new clause. Will the Minister clarify that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ainger:</B> I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Minister on bringing the new clause before us. It reflects the urgency with which we must treat the anomaly whereby shipping in general was covered by existing legislation but the potential pollution from offshore installations was not. That anomaly was clear, and was identified by Lord Donaldson. I congratulate my right hon. Friend on the speed with which he has brought the matter forward. It shows up the previous Administration, and their considerable delay in dealing with the Donaldson report. That report considered the incident of the Braer, which ran aground in January 1993; it was published in early 1994. A significant number of Lord Donaldson's recommendations were not implemented. I refer in particular to the recommendation on the availability of powerful salvage tugs around the United Kingdom coast. The failure to implement that recommendation played a significant part in the scale of the disaster of the Sea Empress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> On a point of information, I used to follow such matters before entering the House, but I have not been so well informed about them since. Is the hon. Gentleman, with his particular constituency interest, now content with the provision of powerful salvage tugs around the coast? Is it adequate yet?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ainger:</B> As my right hon. Friend the Minister knows&#151;
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
