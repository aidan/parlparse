							<b class="B">Mr.
David Burrowes</b> (Enfield, Southgate) (Con): Welcome to the
Chair, Mr. Cook. I welcome everyone back to the Committee. I
have been away from its rigours having an operation on my hand, facing
my own particular torture in trying to straighten my finger, so it is
nice to be back facing a different sort of torture now. We shall see
how we
progress.</div>
					<a name="0711211000037"><div class="hs_Para">While
I have been on the operating table at my fine local North Middlesex
hospital, the Ministers have been drafting several amendments to keep
us all busy, but has the Minister of State had the opportunity to look
at the Prison Reform Trust leaflet, as I encouraged him to do as part
of his recess reading? It goes through the sentencing process in detail
and makes particular reference to policy developments. As I said at a
previous sitting, we are especially concerned about the interference in
sentencing jurisdiction and the discretion that has been circumvented
by legislation, which has caused the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div>judges&#146; concern that their hands were being
tied. I drew attention to the florid, pejorative and perhaps
unparliamentary comment by one judge, when he said how judges look
so&#151;expletive&#151;</div>
					<a name="0711211000328"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;silly
in court, when we can&#146;t sentence properly because some civil
servant has second-guessed us.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official
Report, Criminal Justice and Immigration Public Bill Committee, </i>25
October 2007; c.
257.]</div>
					<a name="0711211000038"><div class="hs_Para">Clause 10 is very
much in the realm of s. It restricts the use of suspended sentence
orders to indictable and either way offences, and to remove suspended
sentence jurisdiction when dealing with summary only offences. When
giving evidence, concern was expressed by the Magistrates Association
and the Police Federation, which opposed the clause. The Magistrates
Association said that
it</div>
					<a name="0711211000329"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;can see no logical or
good reason for this
proposal&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0711211000039"><div class="hs_Para">The Police
Federation does not support the abolition of suspended sentences, and
says that it supports the</div>
					<a name="0711211000330"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;greater use of community
sentences&#148;,</div>
					<a name="0711211000040"><div class="hs_Para">and believes
that</div>
					<a name="0711211000331"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;suspended sentences
provide magistrates with an additional sentencing incentive which can
effectively act as a
deterrent.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711211000041"><div class="hs_Para">It therefore
recommends that the proposal to remove the option be reconsidered. I
endorse the Police Federation&#146;s
view.</div>
					<a name="0711211000042"><div class="hs_Para">The Magistrates
Association opposes the clause for two particular reasons. The obvious
reason is that when dealing with a suspended sentence, one is dealing
with an offence that has passed the custody threshold. As the Committee
will be aware from the evidence sessions, the Government&#146;s case
is that research has shown that suspended sentence orders have been
overused and have led to an increase in the prison population. However,
in clause 10 and others, the Government are dealing in the wrong way
with the problem of prisons being full to capacity. The Magistrates
Association says that the jury is very much still out on the research,
and questions whether it is sufficiently robust to show that suspended
sentence orders have or will have a significant impact on the prison
population. It makes the point that a suspended sentence order is
imposed when the custody threshold has been
reached.</div>
					<a name="0711211000043"><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, the
Sentencing Guidelines Council makes it clear on page 24 of its guidance
that a suspended sentence is a sentence of imprisonment, imposed when
that threshold has been passed&#151;when an offence is so serious
that it merits a custodial sentence. The guidelines go on to give
helpful recommendations on what magistrates and judges should do when
they are dealing with such offences. They make the point that, in those
cases,</div>
					<a name="0711211000044"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;requirements can
be imposed during the supervision period and the court can respond to
breach by sending the offender to custody. The crucial difference is
that the suspended sentence is a prison sentence and is appropriate
only for an offence that passes the custody threshold and for which
imprisonment is the only
option.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711211000045"><div class="hs_Para">The
relevant questions to ask, the guidance states,
are</div>
					<a name="0711211000332"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) has the custody
threshold been passed?</div>
					<a name="0711211000333"><div class="hs_brev">(b) if so,
is it unavoidable that a custodial sentence be
imposed?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column327" />Column number: 327</div>
					<a name="0711211000334"><div class="hs_brev">(c) if so, can that sentence be suspended?
(sentencers should be clear that they would have imposed a custodial
sentence if the power to suspend had not been
available)&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0711211000046"><div class="hs_Para">That is the
position we are in. The clause is designed not to allow the power to
suspend to be available. That will lead any sentencer to deal with the
three questions within the guidance. Has the custody threshold been
passed? Yes. Is it unavoidable that a custodial sentence be imposed?
Yes. If so, can that sentence be suspended? They would have to answer,
because of this clause: no, the sentence cannot be suspended. So,
inevitably, to be true to the guidance from the Sentencing Guidelines
Council and the statutory provisions, they would have to send the
defendant to prison. Therefore, the argument that the clause would lead
to a reduction in the prison population is not properly made
out.</div>
					<a name="0711211000047"><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0711211000409">
							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Hollobone</b> (Kettering) (Con): I do not have the
privilege of being a practising lawyer, as my hon. Friend does, so my
thoughts may be a lot more simple on these things, but surely it is
screamingly obvious that the Government&#146;s efforts will not
achieve what they intend to achieve? The evidence given to the
Committee on 16 October by the chief executive of the Magistrates
Association could not be clearer. Cindy Barnett and Sally Dickinson
themselves made it very clear that the measure will have no effect at
all on custodial sentences and will actually ensure that more people go
to prison who otherwise would have been kept out of it. At a time when
the national prison population has never been higher, is this not
simply the most unfortunate and almost crazy way for the Government to
proceed?</div>
					<a name="0711211000048"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000410">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I could not put it better than my hon. Friend
has. It is crazy. The Government may well think that we would say that,
but surely, if the Magistrates Association and the Police Federation
are saying that it does not make sense, the Government should listen
and reconsider?</div>
					<a name="0711211000049"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000411">The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. I sympathise with the time spent
correcting one&#146;s digits, but I think that in that time the hon.
Gentleman may have forgotten that I am partially deaf and that I like
arguments to be expressed clearly and through the
Chair.</div>
					<a name="0711211000050"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000412">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I am grateful to you, Mr. Cook. As a
solicitor, I should know that I should address the chairman of the
magistrates. I would not want to get on the wrong side of the person
judging.</div>
					<a name="0711211000051"><div class="hs_Para">Let us try to
be charitable to the Government. Perhaps they will argue that the
problem is that too many suspended sentence orders have been made with
too rigorous requirements, which have been breached and have led to
custodial sentences inevitably being imposed. But I again refer to the
Sentencing Guidelines Council publication &#147;New Sentences:
Criminal Justice Act 2003&#148;, which says on page 25
that</div>
					<a name="0711211000335"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Because of
the very clear deterrent threat involved in a suspended sentence, the
requirements imposed should generally be less onerous than those
imposed as part of a community sentence. A court wishing to impose
onerous or intensive requirements on an offender should reconsider its
decision to suspend sentence and consider whether a community sentence
might be more
appropriate.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711211000052"><div class="hs_Para">We,
therefore, have guidance already; we do not need additional legislation
to try to circumvent magistrates 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 328</div>or judges. They have the discretion to decide when more rigorous
requirements of supervision are needed than could be dealt with by way
of a community
penalty.</div>
					<a name="0711211000053"><div class="hs_Para">The first
problem with the clause is that when the custody threshold has been
reached, a custodial sentence will follow without suspension. The other
point made quite properly by the Magistrates Association is that the
proposal seems to be one of the first to
differentiate</div>
					<a name="0711211000336"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;so
radically in sentencing disposals between summary and either-way
matters.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711211000054"><div class="hs_Para">That would lead
to an anomaly, one that Cindy Barnett, the chairman of the Magistrates
Association, referred to in an evidence-taking session. It occurs when
one is dealing with a summary only case and an either way case. I will
take the example of a defendant charged with joyriding or aggravated
vehicle taking, which could be an either way case. However, this
particular defendant ended up smashing his vehicle into another
vehicle, resulting in damage worth less than
&#163;5,000&#151;&#163;4,999 to be exact. The case therefore had
to be determined as a summary only, magistrates only case. The
defendant also drove while disqualified and was driving under the
influence of excess alcohol, at three times the limit. All of those
factors together place him above the custody threshold; the offence is
so serious as to merit custody.</div>
					<a name="0711211000055"><div class="hs_Para">At the same court on the same
day, another joyrider appears, again charged with aggravated vehicle
taking, driving while disqualified and driving under the influence of
excess alcohol. That defendant was involved in smashing up his own
vehicle and another vehicle, causing damage worth
&#163;5,000&#151;&#163;1 more than the other defendant at the
same court caused. Under the proposed legislation, the latter case
would be dealt with as an either way offence. The two cases would come
before the same magistrates court and the magistrate would deal with
those two defendants differently, but both cases exceed the custody
threshold and a custodial sentence would be inevitable. However, let us
suppose that the magistrate was also told that both defendants, for
example, suffered from a terminal illness&#151;that there were
mitigating circumstances to merit the magistrate deciding to suspend
the sentence.</div>
					<a name="0711211000056"><div class="hs_Para">In the
case of the defendant who caused damage worth less than &#163;5,000,
the court would have its hands tied; it would be unable to suspend the
sentence for that defendant. As the defendant was suffering from a
terminal illness, a community penalty would not be suitable, so the
court would be left with two options: a conditional discharge or a
custodial sentence. Given the severity of the case, the court would be
hard pushed not to impose a custodial sentence. In the case of the
defendant who caused damage that amounted to &#163;1 more in costs,
under the proposals the court would have discretion to impose a
suspended sentence. What an anomaly. The chairman of the Magistrates
Association said of such
cases:</div>
					<a name="0711211000337"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I think
that the bench involved would follow the law absolutely in both cases
in relation to sentencing, but would be very aware of the anomaly
caused by the legislation. As a general rule, as has been said, we
would prefer more rather than less
discretion.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Criminal
Justice and Immigration Public Bill Committee, </i>16 October 2007; c.
37, Q78.]</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 329</div>
					<a name="0711211000057"><div class="hs_Para">The Minister must tell the Committee what
evidence there is just justify for creating such an anomaly and
disparity.</div>
					<a name="0711211000058"><div class="hs_Para">Continuing
to deal with those two examples, the disparity is made worse if the
joyriders had gone into a shop and stolen a Mars bar. The defendants
would be charged with theft and their cases would be treated as either
way offences. The magistrates would then have powers to suspend the
sentence because an either way offence is included in the summary only
offences. Nevertheless, that would be a convoluted way to sentence. The
magistrates would have to rely upon the relatively less serious offence
of theft of a Mars bar to put the defendant into the category of cases
that can receive suspended sentences. That does not make sense, and the
Government have not laid out evidence that they need to reduce the
discretion of magistrates courts.</div>
					<a name="0711211000059"><div class="hs_Para">It is worth us spending some
time on the clause because it is an example of many clauses that have
not been properly thought through. Such clauses are a response to the
Government&#146;s concerns about prison overpopulation, but they seek
to deal with the problem in the wrong way and in a way that has not
properly taken account of or listened to the people in the
field&#151;practitioners, magistrates and police&#151;who wish to
persuade the Government not to follow a course of action for the sake
of over-legislating. I therefore want the Committee to vote against the
clause standing part.

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): I welcome you to
this little Committee of ours, Mr. Cook. The Criminal
Justice and Immigration Bill is a delight to return to after our short
break.</div>
					<a name="0711211000061"><div class="hs_Para">I hope that we
will be able to make quick progress at times today,
but we cannot allow clause 10 to pass without serious comment. I will
echo some of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Enfield,
Southgate. Initially, I welcomed the clause. At first sight, it seemed
eminently sensible that the Government should wish to encourage the use
of community sentencing and discourage the use of suspended custodial
sentences in preference to community sentences. I understood where the
Government were coming from. However, I do not accept the argument that
we should restrict the discretion of the courts in order to meet the
shortcomings of the prison estate. That seems to be entirely wrong, and
I am concerned by the comments that the Lord Chief Justice expressed
only last week on that front. It seems that we are increasingly
limiting the discretion of the courts simply because of the
Government&#146;s inability to provide the necessary prison places. I
have frequently expressed my own views on how we could get around that
problem: rather than build more prisons, we should build other secure
institutions to remove from prison those people who should not be
there. However, that is a debate for another
day.</div>
					<a name="0711211000062"><div class="hs_Para">Closer
examination of the Government&#146;s argument for the clause reveals
that they cannot possibly achieve those objectives. That is why we are
asking the Ministers to think again. I do not think that they have
looked at their proposals&#146; consequences for what actually
happens 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 330</div>in a courtroom setting. I will return to the argument made by the hon.
Member for Enfield, Southgate and refer to the advice that is given to
magistrates. I would have hoped that the Ministers looked at that
advice before embarking on this proposal.</div>
					<a name="0711211000063"><div class="hs_Para">As we know, responsibility for
the training of magistrates and full and part-time judges in this
country lies with the Judicial Studies Board. The Judicial Studies
Board helpfully provides advice to magistrates in the form of the
&#147;Adult Court Bench Book&#148;, which sets out in explicit
terms how magistrates are to approach the difficult area of sentencing.
The &#147;Adult Court Bench Book&#148;, which magistrates are
required to have regard for in their decision making, first states how
they are to assess the sentencing threshold, a point to which the hon.
Gentleman referred. I refer the Minister to page 49&#151;he
may  not have a copy about his person, so I shall read
out  the relevant part for his benefit. The heading is:
&#147;WHAT LEVEL OF SENTENCING ARE YOU CONSIDERING?&#148; The

the fourth tier that we get to the point of a custodial sentence,
if</div>

serious that neither a fine alone nor a community sentence can be

sentence&#148;,</div>
					<a name="0711211000068"><div class="hs_Para">if the offence
warrants a sentence that a magistrate would not have the power to
impose.</div>
					<a name="0711211000069"><div class="hs_Para">At no point
during that initial consideration does the magistrates bench consider
whether a suspension of the sentence is or is not appropriate. It
merely decides whether the severity of the offence merits a custodial
sentence. It is only once that decision has been reached that the
magistrate can make a second decision, on whether that custodial
sentence could be suspended, served intermittently or shortened
commensurate with the gravity of the offence.</div>
					<a name="0711211000070"><div class="hs_Para">It is possible that the Minister
intends that alternative advice be given to magistrates on the
hierarchy of offences, I do not know. However, in the absence of other
clear advice, the consequence of clause 10 as it stands is that a
magistrate can take a decision only on whether the gravity of the
offence requires a custodial sentence; he or she does not then have the
capacity or the discretion to say that that sentence should be
suspended. Therefore, the automaticity of a custodial sentence becomes
absolute. Far from reducing the number of offenders who are sent to
prison, the clause would increase it. That is exactly the point made by
the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate, which I seek to
amplify.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>
					<a name="0711211000071"><div class="hs_Para">I think that the Minister has got
the measure wrong&#151;not intentionally; no one intends that to be
the consequence, but the consequence will not be what is expected.
Given the clear advice from the Magistrates Association, from
practitioners and from everybody else who knows about the subject, it
would be sensible of the Minister to think again. If the clause will
not achieve what we want, perhaps it should be taken away and more work
be done on it. In its current state, the clause will not achieve its
objectives.</div>

problem with the interpretation of the present rules, and the Minister
has a genuine concern&#151;and I am sure that he does&#151;about
that, it is a matter of returning to the Judicial Studies Board and
recognising that the problem needs to be addressed with the magistrates
benches. They need to understand that our intention is to use community
sentencing more and suspended sentences less. Perhaps we need a
rewriting of the entire hierarchy of consideration of
sentencing.</div>
					<a name="0711211000074"><div class="hs_Para">That would
be a radical step, but it is not impossible. What is impossible is to
reconcile clause 10 with the current advice given to magistrates on

evidence that are worthy of reflection.</div>
					<a name="0711211000081"><div class="hs_Para">The clause, as hon. Members
know, will remove the criminal courts&#146; power to impose a
suspended sentence order for a summary only offence. It will not affect
the power to impose immediate custody for those offences and the courts
will still be able to impose suspended sentence orders for either way
or indictable only offences, and, as was mentioned by the hon. Member
for Enfield, Southgate, for a summary offence where it is sentenced
together with an either way or indictable only
offence.</div>
					<a name="0711211000082"><div class="hs_Para">We have given
serious consideration to these matters. It is part of the
Government&#146;s drive to examine how we can achieve greater use of
community sentences and I accept that that will have some impact upon
the prison population. Both the hon. Members who have spoken so far
have mentioned the prison population. They will know that, at the
moment, there are just over 81,000 people in
prison.</div>

						</b> Eighty-one thousand five hundred; that was a
helpful intervention by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough. The
maximum capacity for the prison population is approximately 82,000. I
believe that we must examine how we can avoid custody for individuals,
particularly where&#151;I will argue this case&#151;whether they go
to prison is a marginal decision.
</div>
					<a name="0711211000085"><div class="hs_Para">The use of suspended
sentence orders has increased dramatically since their introduction in
April 2005. Recently, more than 3,500 such orders per month have been
given by the courts, of which about 40 per cent. are for summary only
offences, which the clause deals with. Although sentencing trends show
a small drop in sentencing of immediate custody, that is greatly
exceeded by the increase in suspended sentences, which suggests that
many of those sentenced to a suspended sentence order would previously
have been sentenced to a non-custodial sentence. That is the point that
I wish to make. I accept the points that were made earlier about the
guidance that is given, but I contend that many of those who are now
receiving suspended sentence orders would have received a community
sentence before.</div>
					<a name="0711211000086"><div class="hs_Para">May I pray in
aid Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, the Lord Chief Justice? Only last
week, on 15 November 2007, in a speech to the Howard League for Penal
Reform, he
said:</div>
					<a name="0711211000343"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
seriousness of the offence determines whether it crosses what is known
as &#145;the custody threshold&#146;, but factors personal to the
offender can justify the court in passing a non-custodial sentence even
where the custodial threshold is crossed. In practice there is quite a
wide border-line area where it is open to the court to choose between
sending the offender to prison or dealing with him in some other way.
This is particularly true in the case of
Magistrates&#148;.</div>

						</b> I was there, listening to the Lord Chief Justice
as he gave the Cripps lecture, sponsored by the Howard League for Penal

across quite a lot of issues relating to criminal justice policy and
sentencing.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 333</div>
					<a name="0711211000088"><div class="hs_Para">However, the point that the
Minister of State must get to grips with is the one that was revealed
during our evidence session, when Ellie Roy was giving evidence and she
quoted the 40 per cent. figure. The Minister of State may remember that
I asked Ellie Roy about that figure and specifically whether she had
done any unpicking of that figure, to analyse why, in 40 per cent. of
cases, magistrates were sentencing in the way that she described in our
evidence session and the way that the Minister of State now describes.
Repetition of the figure does not help us; we need analysis of the
basis upon which that 40 per cent. figure is arrived at. I am not yet
sure that the right hon. Gentleman has done that
analysis.</div>
					<a name="0711211000089"><div class="hs_Para">May I finish
by making another point? I appreciate that, as a recorder, I do not try
summary offences unless they are sent up on an either way basis from
the magistrates court, but I can assure the Minister of State that the
power to give a suspended custodial sentence is one of the most
valuable weapons at the disposal of a criminal justice system. If he
removes it from the magistrates court he would do great damage to the
ability of the courts to sentence appropriately. I urge him to think
carefully about this aspect of the sentencing regime before he resists
the Opposition&#146;s
arguments.</div>

and people avoiding custody. My judgment, and that of the Lord

this will result not in up-tariffing to custody but in down-tariffing
to more community sentences. That is the heart of the disagreement

will result in stronger use of community sentences rather than going to
automatic custody for the reasons Lord Phillips laid out in his lecture
last week. There is an element of discretion for those sentences which
allows a judgment to be made which, based on the exercise of the cases
we have looked at to date, will result in down-tariffing to community
sentences rather than custody.</div>

magistrates in any way? So if there is a concern by all to down-tariff,
it can be dealt with properly through the guidance to which we have
already referred today rather than by removing another power or string
from the bow. Finally, is there not a concern that the National
Association of Probation Officers estimates that the abolition of the
suspended sentence for summary offences may increase the prison
population by 1,000?</div>

					<a name="0711211000110"><div class="hs_Para">In
respect of the offences that are considered under the current

two years who could have been more strongly prevented from reoffending
by receiving a community sentence. In such cases, individuals will go
to prison for a short period, potentially with all the difficulties
that that short sentence brings, despite all the evidence showing that
short sentences cause great difficulties in respect of re-employment,
housing and a range of other issues. The measure under discussion, as

preventing
reoffending.</div>

welcome a number of the Bill&#146;s provisions including the
extension of conditional cautions to younger offenders, the reduction
of periods served by recalled prisoners and the restriction of
suspended sentences. Suspended sentences can have a
&#145;boomerang&#146; effect which has the perverse result of
increasing the prison population. Courts often misuse suspended
sentences by giving them to offenders who would otherwise have received
community penalties.&#148;</div>

by the courts, 40 per cent. of which were for summary only offences. In
respect of certain offences, which I can mention if the Committee
wishes, the increased number of suspended sentence orders directly
correlates with the reduction in community sentence orders given. That
means that there is a greater opportunity for people to go to prison,
which is not good for the prevention of reoffending in such

current regime, people may end up in prison because magistrates are
giving the wrong sort of person a suspended sentence that they breach
and, therefore, have to serve a custodial sentence, possibly with a new
sentence for a second offence to run concurrently. However, that issue
relates to training and pre-sentence reports and working out whether a
defendant will appropriately be dealt with by a suspended sentence
order; it does not undermine the good arguments and experience of those

						</b> Again, I am grateful for the way
in which the hon. and learned Member for Harborough has approached this
matter. I am always happy to consider issues and to monitor progress
during the passage of legislation through both Houses of Parliament.
However, I return to the key point that the Sentencing Guidelines
Council made in its May newsletter, before these proposals were
advanced. It
states:</div>
				
					<a name="0711211000348"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
number of suspended sentences rose steadily between 2004 and 2005;
provisional figures for 2006 show a much more rapid increase. The
information available to the Council and the Panel appears to indicate
that this increase has been accompanied more by a reduction in the
number of community orders and fines than in the number of custodial
sentences&#148;.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000441">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> The assertion that the Minister of State makes is
no doubt correct. The use of suspended sentences has gone up, and he
must ask himself why that is. The fashion in sentencing has changed.
The guidelines from the Court of Appeal Criminal Division and the
position of the Sentencing Guidelines Council have changed, although I
cannot remember whether that happened by
2000.</div>
					<a name="0711211000120"><div class="hs_Para">In the 1990s, it
was much more difficult to give a suspended sentence, as the criteria
were much stricter. However, they were made more liberal and so the
sentences were used more. Now the Government say that that is wrong,
particularly on the summary jurisdictions. We are yo-yoing around. I
repeat that my experience sitting as a judge for over 10 years is that
the suspended sentence is a very useful
weapon.</div>

be a valuable addition in supporting community sentences, reducing
levels of custody and preventing reoffending. I am always happy to
examine these matters and to look at training issues, but I commend the
clause to the
Committee.</div>

difficult person to agree with because the more one tries to agree with
him, the more he tries to introduce entirely spurious arguments. We
experienced that on the last day of the Committee before Prorogation
and we are experiencing it again now. He is trying to play silly
political games rather than concentrate on the issues. He adduced the
comments of my noble Friend Lord Dholakia. Why on earth did he do that
when he could have quoted
me?</div>

quite wrong that suspended sentences are used in the magistrates courts

the Government, but they will not accept it. That is an extraordinary
position to take, but&#151;and it is a big but&#151;on examining
clause 10 in more detail in conjunction with the rules that magistrates
are required to follow, it appears that it will have a perverse effect.
Instead of addressing that problem, the Minister chose to ignore it. He
repeats time and time again what his intention is, rather than what the
consequence of the clause will be. That is my problem with
him.</div>
					<a name="0711211000125"><div class="hs_Para">I
say to the Minister squarely that he needs to address, through the
Judicial Studies Board or the Sentencing Guidelines Council, what will
happen as a consequence of the clause. If he gets that right he can
achieve his intentions and my intentions. If he gets it wrong, it will
have the opposite effect. Surely that is not what he wants to happen as

and look forward to it in the vote. I will happily look at some of the
issues to do with delivery. I have already indicated that we will
discuss advice that could be given by the Sentencing Guidelines Council

Everything that he has said up until this moment has suggested that
there is no problem to address, but there is. We have Committees to ask
Ministers to look at measures again when their intentions will not be
translated into adequate legislation. That is my purpose in this
Committee. That does not mean that I have changed my mind or that I
have a great disagreement with my noble Friend in the Lords. It does
not mean any of those things. It simply means that I am trying to
achieve good legislation for our courts. The Minister has something
different thing in mind, which is simply getting his Bill through
unamended. That is not a sensible way of doing

					<a name="0711211000153"><div class="hs_Para">Government amendment No. 20
corrects a minor drafting error in clause 11, which makes reference to
the old-style youth community orders rather than the new youth

so.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000466">Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I do not take issue with the technical
amendment, but perhaps I could take the opportunity to make a comment
in more of a stand part mode. The Magistrates Association&#146;s is
concerned that clause 11 is repetitious and unnecessary. That theme
developed in our debate on clause 10. Clause 11 makes the point that
sentencers do not need to impose a community sentence when the
community threshold has been reached, but magistrates and the judiciary
are already aware of that, day in, day out, in the courts. If they
wanted a reminder, they could look at the &#147;Adult Court Bench
Book&#148;, or they could refer to the Sentencing Guidelines Council,
which
states:</div>
					<a name="0711211000350"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Sentencers
must consider all of the disposals available at the time of
sentence...before reaching the provisional decision to make a
community sentence, so that, even where the threshold for a community
sentence has been passed, a financial penalty or discharge may still be
an appropriate penalty. Where an offender has a low risk of
re-offending, particular care needs to be taken in the light of
evidence that indicates that there are circumstances where
inappropriate intervention will increase the risk of re-offending
rather than decrease it.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711211000155"><div class="hs_Para">In addition, the point is made that
enforcement of financial penalties make them a more viable sentence in
a wider range of cases. Guidance and discretion are already available
for the magistrates not to impose a community sentence, even if the
threshold is reached, when there are particular mitigating
circumstances, so why is it necessary for the Government to seek to
spell matters out in additional
legislation?</div>

simple matters.</div>
					<a name="0711211000159"><div class="hs_Para">Once
again, this is a matter of judgment. I accept that there is an element
of common practice, as the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate
mentioned. We are keen to examine how we can put new energy into the
issuing of fines, which we want to use as an alternative to some forms
of community sentence. The purpose of clause 11 is to revitalise the
fine, making it central to the process of redirecting probation
resources where they are most needed, in particular using those
resources to deal with more serious offenders. Many offenders can be
adequately punished by a fine; in fact, for some offenders a fine is
more of a punishment than a community sentence or another
sentence.</div>
					<a name="0711211000160"><div class="hs_Para">The payment
of fines now is significantly higher than it was before. Performance in
the collection of fines has improved&#151;it is more than 90 per
cent&#151;so sentencers can be confident that a fine is an effective
punishment. It will be collected, and, in certain circumstances, it
will be more effective than other types of punishment. We must face the
reality that resources are scarce. I want probation resources to be
used effectively, and if we can encourage the greater use of fines,
that will help us to achieve our twin objectives. It will reduce the
demands on probation resources and, at the same time, the
magistrate&#146;s ability to impose a fine will result in a more
effective punishment for many individuals.</div>
					<a name="0711211000161"><div class="hs_Para">I accept that the greater use of
fines is already evident. We are restating the principle, encouraging
it and trying to give greater drive to it in clause 11. I commend
clause 11 and Government amendments Nos. 20 and 57 to the
Committee.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div>would mean, of course, that people below that age would be subject to
the current arrangements. This issue is part of the larger question of
whether we deal with all offenders, whatever their age, in the same
way. It has been a long-standing principle in our legal system that we
treat children differently from adults, and indeed we are party to
various international obligations to treat children and young people
differently from adults.</div>
					<a name="0711211000166"><div class="hs_Para">There is, however, a particular
problem with indeterminate sentences. Children and young people are
different from adults. First, there are developmental changes&#151;
children grow up while in custody and may be very different people
within a relatively short period of time. Secondly, a young
person&#146;s perception of their future will differ from that of
somebody who has been in and out of the prison system, is of more
mature years and can take a more phlegmatic view of
things.</div>

is a requirement, too, under article 37(b) of the United Nations

					<a name="0711211000352"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No child shall be
deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily. The arrest,
detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the

shortest appropriate period of
time&#148;.</div>

term.</div>
					<a name="0711211000171"><div class="hs_Para">I shall not press
the amendment to a Division, as it is simply intended to probe the
Minister&#146;s views on the matter, but tariffs for indeterminate
sentences imposed on a child should be no longer than what would be
served under a determinate custodial penalty for the same offence.
Given what I said about children&#146;s development and the process
of maturity, there may be a strong case for reviewing the threat that
the young person poses to society at an earlier stage. There is no risk
involved, if risk assessments are done properly and the Parole Board
does its work when the young person is eligible for release, in
reducing the sentence available to a limited period, because at that
point there is an assessment of whether the young person represents a
threat to society. If they do, they will not be released. That seems
entirely right.</div>
					<a name="0711211000172"><div class="hs_Para">My
argument is very simple. We recognise that the judicial system should
treat young people differently from adults. There is an argument for a
clear and determinate length of sentence for young people that should
be commensurate with the offence, rather than an indeterminate sentence
of the sort envisaged under the clause. I should be grateful for the
Minister&#146;s
comments.</div>

Garnier:
						</b> Not so very long ago, I was going through the
front door of Oakhill secure training centre in Milton Keynes as the
Minister was coming out, accompanied by his colleague the Minister for
Children, Young People and Families. They had gone 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column342" />Column number: 342</div>to look at the provision of custodial services for 15, 16 and
17-year-olds in that establishment, which is run by a private company.
There were a number of people in the centre with indeterminate
sentences. They had committed very serious crimes&#151;some had been
found guilty of murder.</div>
					<a name="0711211000175"><div class="hs_Para">The way in which we deal with
youngsters who commit very serious crimes is not something that we can
simply brush under the carpet and put out of mind. It is extremely
important that the way in which we sentence people who are, at law,
minors should have a number of aims in view. I suspect that we need to
have those aims in view when we are sentencing adults as well.
Punishment and public reassurance are clearly vital. The possibility of
redemption as a young person matures is greater than it might be for an
old lag of my age. The amendment provides an opportunity to ask the
Government what their policy is with regard to the imprisonment of
children, including those who have committed very serious
crimes.</div>
					<a name="0711211000176"><div class="hs_Para">On my short
visit to Oakhill STC, I found that its regime was humane and much
improved from what it was perhaps two years ago, when it went through a
period of difficulty. I do not know what the experience of the Minister
and his colleagues was. I should have mentioned that the hon. Member
for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) was also there, as that
establishment is in her constituency. I had a brief conversation with
her before she left to attend to her other tasks.</div>
					<a name="0711211000177"><div class="hs_Para">We must be careful that we do
not lump children or under-18s in with the rest of the criminal
population. When children are detained during Her Majesty&#146;s
pleasure&#151;I think that that is the frequently used
expression&#151;we should keep an eye out for education and
rehabilitation, so that when that those children have served sufficient
time for their punishment, they can be returned to society without the
threat of being attacked or set upon by vigilantes, and without the
concern that many of us have that they will reoffend if they have not
been properly educated, reformed and rehabilitated. We should be able
to stand up and say that when a young criminal is released, he or she
will be a positive addition to society, not a drag on it or a further
cause of problems. I suspect that the Minister, having been to Oakhill
and, no doubt, other STCs, will largely agree with what I am saying. I
congratulate the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome on raising the
issue, albeit a difficult one to grasp.</div>

							<a name="0711211000472">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I shall try to answer this short debate
positively. I have some sympathy with the amendment tabled by the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome, and I hope that that shows that it is
not all confrontation and disagreement among Committee members, and
that there are occasions when we can reflect in a productive way on
amendments that are tabled.</div>
					<a name="0711211000179"><div class="hs_Para">I recognise that there is
precedent for a measure of the type suggested by the hon. Gentleman.
Indeed, the murder tariff was debated in the context of the Bill that
became the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and after consideration during
the passage of that Bill, the Government reduced the starting point for
juveniles convicted of murder. I have said that I have some sympathy
with the amendment, but I ask the hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 343</div>Gentleman not to press it to a Division&#151;I think that he has
indicated that he will not. I ask him to withdraw the amendment and I
will examine the issues in detail before we return to the matter
following the end of the Committee&#146;s consideration of this
Bill.</div>
					<a name="0711211000180"><div class="hs_Para">I have little,
if any, disagreement with the comments made by the
hon. and learned Member for Harborough. Unfortunately, I did not see
him when we exited Oakhill STC very rapidly. My right hon. Friend the
Minister for Children, Young People and Families and I had to dash for
a train so that we could return to London urgently for a further
meeting. Had that not been the case, I would have happily had the hon.
and learned Gentleman accompany me at Oakhill to look at the work going
on there.</div>
					<a name="0711211000181"><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Gentleman makes a valid point. I am not proud of the fact that
when I woke up this morning, nearly 4,000 young people were in custody
in secure training centres and other establishments. That is a failure
of the system. We need to do several things, not least ensuring that
when those individuals leave our care they are better individuals than
when they came in. That means that we need to look at
education&#151;literacy and numeracy&#151;at the difficulties in
dealing with drug and alcohol problems, and at interventions outside
establishments, with families and others. We must look at training and
at skill levels and development, and we must consider housing and
employment when individuals leave custody.</div>
					<a name="0711211000182"><div class="hs_Para">I know that the four Opposition
Front Benchers and I have a common cause. The hon. and learned Member
for Harborough and the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate take a
positive view on this. I know that the hon. Member for
Ruislip-Northwood is interested in the Blue Sky project in his
constituency, which promotes positive investment in individuals, and I
know that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome shares that
aspiration. There is work to be done, and I hope that we can reach some
form of cross-party consensus on what should be done to make secure
training centres efficient and effective. It is not just a matter of
detention and punishment, although it does involve that. It is also
about rehabilitation, preventing reoffending, and ensuring that people
leave those centres in a more positive way.</div>
					<a name="0711211000183"><div class="hs_Para">I say to the
hon. and learned Member for Harborough that there is work to be done at
Oakhill to raise standards still further, and the reason for our visit
was to look at how we can do that. We all have that objective. In
giving sympathy and consideration to the amendment, I hope that both in
Committee and elsewhere we can look at how to make the operation of
STCs more effective.</div>
					<a name="0711211000184"><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the reason why the
Minister for Children, Young People and Families and myself were there
was because since the new Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend the
Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr. Brown), took
office, he ensured that the Youth Justice Board was not the sole
responsibility of the Ministry of Justice, but that of the Department
for Children, Schools and Families, too. The purpose of that is to
better integrate work in education and training, and
outside-establishment interventions, and to ensure that we do exactly
what the hon. and learned Member for Harborough says: make the
experience more positive for those going through the system. Hopefully,
in doing so, we can reduce the awful 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 344</div>reoffending rate for those coming out of an STC, which is at about 75
per cent. That is not satisfactory to anybody. I hope that the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome will withdraw his amendment and that my
comments have helped to restore balance to the debate and to the
Committee&#146;s
temper.</div>
					<a name="0711211000185"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000473">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> That is more like it. That is the way a Committee
is supposed to work. I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for
Harborough for his support, and to the Minister for his
response.</div>
					<a name="0711211000186"><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
says that he is not proud of the number of young people who are
incarcerated in this country. I would go further: we should all be
heartily ashamed of the fact that we imprison more of our young people
than any other comparable country. That is a scar on the
nation&#146;s conscience. If we can address that&#151;I take what
the Minister said about the matter entirely at face value&#151;we
will be doing something hugely worth while for society.</div>
					<a name="0711211000187"><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to the Minister
for agreeing to look again at the amendment. As I said, it was not my
intention to divide the Committee irrespective of what he
said&#151;unless he really provoked me. The key point is that
children and young people are different. There should not be an
automaticity by which the approach to adults applies to younger people
in the same way. Whenever we do anything within the judicial and penal
system, we must look carefully at whether that is appropriate to the
needs of young offenders, and whether it will encourage them not to
reoffend, but to grow, mature and become responsible members of
society. That should be our clear intention. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

							<a name="0711211000475">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> The previous debate touches upon the one that we
are about to have, albeit that we are now dealing with the mechanics by
which a court will consider the minimum tariff that a person sentenced
to an indeterminate life sentence should be given.</div>
					<a name="0711211000192"><div class="hs_Para">I ask the Committee first to
open up the amendment paper at new clause 4 on page 397 and compare it
with the wording of clause 12, which is gobbledegook. It is possible to
understand what clause 12 intends to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 345</div>achieve, but it takes some little while to do so and not all of us have
that some little while, particularly when we are busy dealing with
someone in court. I push forward a plea for simplicity in English
before we make such
decisions.</div>
					<a name="0711211000193"><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) made a
similar point during the Queen&#146;s Speech debate, and I agreed
with him. Clause 12 is not quite impenetrable, but it is getting close.
We therefore thought that it would be better to invite the Government
to adopt new clause 4. It is instructive to compare the two measures.
The new clause states
that</div>
					<a name="0711211000353"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Section
82A of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000...is
amended as follows.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711211000194"><div class="hs_Para">So

The court shall have a complete discretion to set the minimum period to
be served in custody by an offender subject to a discretionary life
sentence for public
protection.&#146;&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711211000196"><div class="hs_Para">As a
matter of philosophy and sentencing practice, it is preferable for a
court to have discretion. The adjective &#147;complete&#148; is
perhaps unnecessary, but I submit that, giving the court discretion in
relation to the appropriate sentence for the case, the defendant and
the circumstances bit, is
vital.</div>
					<a name="0711211000197"><div class="hs_Para">Several offences
nowadays carry with them a life sentence. Some are discretionary life
sentences, in that it is possible to give a determinate sentence with a
limit. The same crime can be the subject of an indeterminate or life
sentence. Clearly, an offence such as murder has a sentence prescribed
by law, and that is life. However, the amount of time to be served by
the defendant is not always the natural life of the defendant. The
court has therefore to go through the exercise of working out the
minimum that the defendant should serve before he is considered for
release on licence by the Parole
Board.</div>
					<a name="0711211000198"><div class="hs_Para">Clause 12(2)
states:</div>
					<a name="0711211000356"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
subsection (3) (determination of the appropriate part of the sentence)

					<a name="0711211000200"><div class="hs_Para">I

					<a name="0711211000201"><div class="hs_Para">So we go back
upstairs and look at subsection (2). Having done that, let us now move
on to new subsection (3B), which
states:</div>
					<a name="0711211000362"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Case B
is where the court is of the opinion that the period which it would

circumstances of the particular offender.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 346</div>
					<a name="0711211000202"><div class="hs_Para">I hope that you are still with
me, Mr. Cook. I will now whizz on to new subsection (3C),
which
states:</div>
					<a name="0711211000363"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In Case
A or Case B above, in deciding the effect which the comparison required
by subsection (3)(c) above is to have on reducing the period which the
court determines for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) (and before
giving effect to subsection (3)(b) above), the court may, instead of
reducing that period by
one-half,&#151;</div>
					<a name="0711211000364"><div class="hs_brev">(a)
in Case A above, reduce it by such lesser amount (including nil) as the
court may consider appropriate according to the seriousness of the

reduce it by such lesser amount (but not by less than one-third) as the

					<a name="0711211000203"><div class="hs_Para">Then subsection
(4) states:</div>
					<a name="0711211000204"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
subsection (4A) (no order to be made under subsection (4) in the case
of certain sentences) after &#147;No order under subsection (4) above
may be made&#148; insert &#147;, and Case A above does not
apply,&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0711211000205"><div class="hs_Para">There
we are. What a fuss I am making about nothing. That is clear as mud,
and any sentencer who is faced with this sort of serious crime
requiring the application of an indeterminate sentence, has only to
look at that and go through the rubric and it is easy for him to decide
what to do.</div>
					<a name="0711211000206"><div class="hs_Para">With some
diffidence, I will address new clause 4 and see if it meets the problem
that the Government think exists. It
states:</div>

The court shall have a complete discretion to set the minimum period to
be served as custody by an offender subject to a discretionary life
sentence for public
protection.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0711211000208"><div class="hs_Para">Let me start
by saying that if you want to change the wording, Mr. Cook,
go ahead. All that I ask for is clarity. The following refers to the
minimum period to be served in
custody:</div>
					<a name="0711211000368"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(1B)
In setting that period the court must take into
account&#151;</div>

					<a name="0711211000209"><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
that is a bit of a sweep up. I agree that I wrote that and, therefore,
I think that it is marvellous in every particular, but I also suggest
that you, Mr. Cook, probably found it a little easier to
understand than clause 12. On that basis, I suggest that we substitute
new clause 4 for clause 12 as appropriate, and I invite the Government
to persuade me
otherwise.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000476">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I recall that the Leader of the House had an idea a
year or so ago, whereby legislation would be translated into simple
English. I do not know what happened to that idea; it was done for one
Bill and has now disappeared. My concern in that case was that we ended
up with two different versions of the same Bill, which simply gave work
for lawyers to determine which wording they felt that they could hang a
case on more effectively; so I was not particularly enamoured of that
approach. But clarity in legislation is desirable and
the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 347</div>hon. and learned Member for Harborough is absolutely
right to draw attention to clause 12 as being the antithesis of clarity
in drafting. It does not suggest that it is fit for purpose. I am
rather impressed by the new clause; it is rather good. I understand it
and it seems to cover all the requirements. I will be interested to see
where the Minister feels that it is deficient, but my view essentially
is clause 12, bad; new clause 4,
good.</div>
					<a name="0711211000211"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000477">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I do not know how this is recorded in
<i class="I">Hansard</i>, but I put my hands up and say that the clause is
difficult to comprehend. I accept that it is not in a form of English
that is in common parlance in my constituency or, indeed, in the
constituencies of other members of the Committee. However, it serves a
purpose and with the help of parliamentary counsel it is how we have
expressed the intention of the clause.</div>
					<a name="0711211000212"><div class="hs_Para">In simple terms, the provision
is as follows: it will ensure that courts have the discretion to set
appropriately high tariffs for particularly serious crimes, which will
not include the crime of murder, but will include crimes for which an
offender could receive a life sentence. It will not include sentences
currently given under imprisonment for public protection known as
indeterminate sentences but there will be certain types of crime that
are allocated a life sentence which are not murder and not
IPP.</div>
					<a name="0711211000213"><div class="hs_Para">The effect of
clause 12 will mean that in particularly serious cases the judges will
not have to take into account the parole arrangements that apply to
ordinary sentences when they calculate tariffs. As the hon. and learned
Gentleman will know, the law at present obliges them to do so with the
result that the final figure is half what a notional equivalent
determinate sentence would be. If necessary, the court should be able
to disregard the requirements completely or apply some reduction that
is less than 50 per cent. as appropriate.</div>
					<a name="0711211000214"><div class="hs_Para">The current law requires working
out a notional equivalent sentence and then reducing it, as would be
the case with a determinate sentence which in some serious cases can
result in what will appear to be, and are, disproportionately short
sentences. They will continue to give rise to public discontent about
particular sentences by the judiciary unless we examine and support the
clause.</div>
					<a name="0711211000215"><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
may recall the recently highlighted case of Sweeney, to which we
referred in our consultation paper, &#147;Making Sentencing
Clearer&#148;. Sweeney was sentenced to life imprisonment for the
horrendous offences of kidnap and sexual assault of a child under the
age of 13. There were serious aggravating factors in that case.
Following the calculation on Sweeney&#146;s conviction the tariff
amounted to a mere six years for aggravated kidnap and sexual assault
of a child under the age of 13. The case had an element of notoriety,
certainly in my part of the world in Wales, when it was tried at
Cardiff Crown court.</div>
					<a name="0711211000216"><div class="hs_Para">Clause 12 leaves intact the
current arrangements for setting tariffs but gives the courts more
flexibility to deal with the exceptional serious cases when needed,
which I think is the objective of the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s new clause. Had the clause been in place when the
Sweeney case was heard, the judge would have had discretion to examine
it and to raise the tariff 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div>accordingly above what would apply in a normal case based on his
determination of the aggravating factors in the
case.</div>
					<a name="0711211000217"><div class="hs_Para">I accept that the
examination of clause 12 is a minefield and I greatly enjoyed the hon.
and learned Gentleman&#146;s gentle poking of parliamentary draftsmen
and the Government in relation to it. The purpose of the clause is to
give effect to the underlying principle, which I have outlined, and it
should be supported for that reason.</div>
					<a name="0711211000218"><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and learned Gentleman
has put much time and effort into his new clause but
it would leave a number of gaps which, on reflection, he would not wish
to occur and which would be opposed by members on both sides of the
Committee. The new clause has the distinct disadvantage that it is not
clear what its results would be. It asks the courts to consider
seriousness but it does not specifically ask them to consider early
release arrangements nor specifically permit them to disregard that
part of the calculation. More importantly, the proposal might be read
by courts as meaning that they were entitled to double all current
tariffs. I would not wish to see the vast majority of tariffs doubled.
We are looking at particular serious and difficult cases. If the new
clause were accepted it would have tremendous resource implications as
well as raising issues of the appropriateness of the new sentences. It
seems to apply to sentences for public protection as well, which are
not currently included in clause
12.</div>

the new clause, as drafted by the hon. and learned Gentleman, may
appear to be simpler and clearer for sentencers, but there are severe
gaps in it. For example, it removes the role of the Parole Board

advice, is that it does. I believe that the hon. and learned Gentleman
shares our objective in clause 12, which is to give judicial discretion
and to raise the tariff in cases where the seriousness of the case is
examined by the judge and an increased tariff is deemed necessary, as
in the case of Sweeney. It allows the judiciary to exercise that
discretion accordingly and, whatever the minefield of clause 12, I
assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that it achieves that
objective.</div>

criticise the judiciary&#146;s operations. I do not do so, but I
understand people&#146;s frustration. The rules that pertained
blatantly led to a lower tariff and sentence from the judge on that day
at Cardiff Crown court than any civilised person would expect for the
horrendous crimes that were committed. My right hon. Friend expressed
his frustrations in his inimitable way. I am trying now, with the

Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op):
Frustration was expressed not just about the judicial aspects of the
sentence. Intense anger and frustration was felt by people in my
constituency who were directly affected by the events that led to the
arrest and subsequent imprisonment of the individual concerned. We
should remember that it is not just a question of protecting the
proprieties of what goes on in court, but of making sure that common
sense is applied by the courts when making decisions, and that that
common sense is seen to apply. That was not the case on that
occasion.</div>

							<a name="0711211000483">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. He will
know better than other Committee members the impact of the Sweeney case
on the community in Cardiff and the reverberations generally. I accept
the gentle chiding of the hon. and learned Member for Harborough. The
interpretation of clause 12 does take some effort, but its objective is
clear. I have checked with parliamentary counsel that it legislates for
its objective, which is to allow judicial discretion on serious cases,
such as those that I described to the Committee. I commend clause 12 to
the Committee, and urge the hon. and learned Gentleman not to press new
clause
4.</div>
					<a name="0711211000227"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000484">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> When I argued in favour of new clause 4 and made
criticisms of clause 12, I did so to the Minister, not parliamentary
counsel. The Minister is elected to the House, and is appointed by the
Prime Minister to speak for the Government. There is a great big
Chinese wall between me and parliamentary counsel. I do not see him or
her and, therefore, nothing that I have said is intended in any way as
a rebuke or criticism of that
person.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000485">Mr.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000486">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I am glad that the Minster is taking it on the
chin, because he is the person who speaks for the Government.</div>
					<a name="0711211000230"><div class="hs_Para">We all remember the events that
followed the Sweeney case, which perhaps as a greater resonance for the
right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth than for others,
because the crime, even though it did 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 350</div>not take place in his constituency, affected his constituents and
because the trial took place in the Cardiff Crown court.</div>
					<a name="0711211000231"><div class="hs_Para">What really annoyed me about the
ministerial reaction to the sentencing remarks in the Sweeney case was
the fact that the recorder of Cardiff was criticised for doing no more
than what the Government required the judge to do. I have looked at the
sentencing remarks&#151;I deliberately downloaded them to ensure that
I understood what he did. He applied faithfully and to the letter the
rubric that the Government required him to apply as a result of their
own sentencing legislation. Therefore, it was more than
annoying&#151;it was disgraceful&#151;that the then Home Secretary
made criticisms, swiftly followed by the Solicitor-General on an
edition of &#147;Any Questions&#148; immediately after the sentence
was given. It was outrageous that those two Ministers should make
personal criticisms of the recorder of Cardiff, who, as I said, was
doing no more than what this Government said he should do.</div>
					<a name="0711211000232"><div class="hs_Para">The Minister of State talked
about discretion, but the recorder of Cardiff had no discretion and had
to do exactly what an Act of Parliament stated. I fully appreciate that
clause 12 is designed to prevent such problems from arising again, but
that problem was made by the Government, not by the courts and
certainly not by the recorder of Cardiff. It cannot be repeated too
often that the recorder of Cardiff did precisely what he was required
to do by the law, as passed by Parliament and initiated by the
Government.</div>
					<a name="0711211000233"><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that new clause 4 does not mention anything about early
release. However, it deals with the minimum tariff that the court must
set when sentencing someone to a discretionary life sentence. He said
that new clause 4 would double the tariff, but it would do nothing of
the sort. It would give the sentencing court the discretion to give an
appropriate sentence in light of the facts and circumstances of the
case. He claimed that the new clause would take the Parole Board out of
the equation, but it would do nothing of the sort because the tariff is
the minimum that a person serves, just as the six years handed down by
the recorder of Cardiff in the Sweeney case was the minimum that the
offender had to serve before he could apply to the Parole Board to be
released on license. I have a suspicion, without prejudicing in any way
the future decisions of the Parole Board in the Sweeney case, that it
will be a very long time beyond the six years before Mr.
Sweeney sees the outside of a prison wall.</div>
					<a name="0711211000234"><div class="hs_Para">The Minister kindly said that I
must have spent a long time drafting new clause 4, but I can assure him
that, having looked at clause 12, it took me about 10 minutes to do so.
Perhaps I should have spent 15, 30 or 60 minutes drafting it, but it
does not require that amount of time to work out what is wrong with the
clause and why new clause 4 would be a marginal
improvement.</div>
					<a name="0711211000235"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000487">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will
take this in the spirit in which it is meant. By removing subsection
(2) of section 82A, his new clause would have the knock-on effect of
removing the application of the early release provisions in
section 28 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 351</div>section confers an important role on the Parole Board in recommending
early release. While that is not set out in the new clause as clearly
as I have tried to describe it, the consequences would be different
from those which the hon. and learned Gentleman wishes to
achieve.</div>
					<a name="0711211000236"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000488">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I am not sure that that is the Minister&#146;s
best point. I do not want to detain the Committee for too long. New
clause 4(1) simply repeats his own clause. If my proposal affects the
earlier legislation as he suggests, perhaps his does so as well. Let us
not fuss too much about that. It is always said that Opposition new
clauses and amendments are defective in their drafting. To use the
expression that the Minister used a moment ago, I put my hands up. Of
course, my drafting is not perfect, but so what? The clause is bad
beyond description, although I understand what he is trying to
do.</div>
					<a name="0711211000237"><div class="hs_Para">I make a simple
plea for the legislation, particularly in the field of criminal
justice, that Ministers present to Parliament and to the public and
which will eventually be used by judges. Sentencing is the most
difficult thing that a judge has to do. There are arguments about the
inadmissibility of evidence and whether a particular line of
questioning is relevant, but very often they sort themselves out.
Sentencing is the most difficult thing that judges and magistrates have
to do. It cannot just be read from a template or book that the tariff
is four, 10 or six years. It is incredibly difficult. Anything that is
designed to make the job of sentencing more difficult is to be
deprecated and, I suggest,
removed.</div>
					<a name="0711211000238"><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, if the Minister would be good enough to look at new clause 4 and
compare it with the clause with his expert and eminent parliamentary
counsel, perhaps he can come up with something a little more
user-friendly&#151;to use some new Labour jargon&#151;and we would
all be happy, as we might get some sentences that do not excite the
right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts or the Solicitor-General. I am
ever hopeful that the Government will listen to something of what I
have said, and on that basis I will not seek to press new clause
4.</div>

					<a name="0711211000248"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000493">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> The Minister mentioned that the under-12-month
provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 are not yet in force.
Clause 13(4)(b) refers to intermittent custody orders. As I understand
it, such orders&#151;for &#147;weekend prison&#148; in colloquial
parlance&#151;have been introduced and used with some success in
certain parts of the country. Under pilot schemes, certain Crown court
jurisdictions&#151;and possibly magistrates courts as
well&#151;have the power to sentence appropriate defendants to a
certain number of weeks in prison, breaking up the custodial period
into separate periods of non-consecutive days or weeks.</div>
					<a name="0711211000249"><div class="hs_Para">Most obviously, for example, a
single father who has committed a sufficiently serious offence to
warrant custody could, to ensure that his family is not broken up and
that he can continue with his job, be sentenced to serve a term of
imprisonment at weekends and carry on Monday to Friday being employed,
paying his rent and mortgage and looking after his children. At
weekends, care arrangements could be made for his children&#151;they
could live with their grandparents, an uncle or aunt or some other
suitable person.</div>
					<a name="0711211000250"><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, weekend prison has been used in Manchester and Luton. It
has been used not only for single fathers but for single mothers who
have difficulties with employment and child care and whose children
might have joined the 150,000 children in this country who have a
parent in prison. We know that families break up and that mothers and
fathers lose 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div>touch with their children; we know that reoffending rates rise when that
happens. When contact between the offender and the family is broken,
the chances of reoffending increase. Only one visit a year to an
offender by a family member correlates noticeably with a reduction in
reoffending. Intermittent custody, although it might still be in the
Criminal Justice Act 2003, is no longer in use. Unless I have got it
wrong and the pilot is being continued in other, discrete areas of the
jurisdiction, we need clarification whether intermittent custody is
still available for the courts.</div>
					<a name="0711211000251"><div class="hs_Para">New clause 5 deals with the
imposition of consecutive sentences up to a maximum of 65 weeks. The
English in clause 13 is marginally better, but not much better, than
that in clause 12. Clause 13 seeks to limit the total length of
consecutive sentences to 65 weeks. New clause 5 would provide greater
certainty of discretion. I abide by the Government&#146;s maximum of
65 weeks, but within that I give the court clear discretion, and
clearly expressed discretion, to set the appropriate length of
sentence. It gives the court the power to suspend all or part of the
total period in prison, which goes back to our debate on clause
10.</div>
					<a name="0711211000252"><div class="hs_Para">Often courts give
sentences for two or three offences that have to be
served at the same time&#151;concurrent sentences. Sometimes if the
offences are different in time, for example if they took place in
January, March and July the court might think it appropriate for the
sentences to follow one after the other, which is called a consecutive
sentence. Under this provision, in the limited circumstances of clause
13, the total length of a sentence is 65 weeks, but the court should
not be hamstrung by the wording of clause 13 in such a way that it
cannot suspend or adjust the length of the total consecutive sentences
as it sees fit, having taken account, in essence but not precisely, the
factors to which I referred in new clause 4. I hope that is a
relatively simple point to grasp, that I have explained it in an
understandable way and persuaded the Committee that it is better than
the provision in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="0711211000253"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000494">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> Again, I am grateful to the hon. and learned
Gentleman for his amendment. The clause is a technical amendment to
correct some anomalies relating to the position on consecutive
sentences in the Criminal Justice Act 2003. It amends the 2003 Act in
respect of consecutive custody plus and intermittent custody sentences
and general restrictions on imposing consecutive sentences for release
prisoners.</div>
					<a name="0711211000254"><div class="hs_Para">The policy
intention is to underpin custody plus: there need to be two or more
sentences imposed consecutively, the resulting total sentence should
not be more than 65 weeks and of that 65 weeks a maximum of 26 weeks
custodial time should be imposed. The hon. and learned Gentleman is
correct in the sense that the Criminal Justice Act 2003 indicated the
direction of travel on these matters. We have had the pilots and as he
will know custody plus has been deferred. I am not yet able to examine
when we can bring the full potential of custody plus on stream but it
is still on the statute book and has not been removed; it remains an
option for us to consider. However, we must consider the current
priorities in respect of Government expenditure and proposals
generally.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div>
					<a name="0711211000255"><div class="hs_Para">The deferment of custody plus was
announced as part of the White Paper on rebalancing the criminal
justice system in July 2006. That is not to say that it will not be
introduced at a later date; we are content to consider it and I will
continue to keep it under review. However, clause 13 is about
consolidating the position based on the anomalies that have occurred as
a result of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.</div>
					<a name="0711211000256"><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and learned Gentleman
would have us delete clause 13 and replace it with new clause 5 and he
has explained the reasons and thinking behind it. I simply say to him
that the new clause removes the current restriction on the amount of
aggravated sentence that can be delegated to custody, namely, 26 weeks.
I am not entirely clear whether that is the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s intention, because in real terms it will mean that
custody could be applied up to the present 65-week threshold, which
could mean a sentence of 65 weeks in prison if sufficient offences were
being sentenced
together.</div>
					<a name="0711211000257"><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of custody plus and the 2003 legislation is to strike a balance between
custody and licence, to allow intermittent sentences and the general
restrictions that we have already discussed and to give courts the
discretion, which the hon. and learned Gentleman welcomed, and the
potential to help people to manage a sentence and life outside prison
at the same time. We are continually keeping that under review. We need
to examine it in light of our resource pressures and, as he will know,
the pressures on the Prison Service are intense at the
moment.</div>
					<a name="0711211000258"><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
clause 13 is to bring the 2003 Act into line with the changes under the
Bill. I urge the hon. and learned Gentleman to reflect on what I said
and to consider whether he intends his new clause to be such as to
extend the potential for custody up to the maximum of 65 weeks. I do
not think that, on reflection, he would be seeking that so I commend
the original clause to the Committee and ask him not to press the new
clause to a
Division.</div>
					<a name="0711211000259"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000495">Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I always reflect on what the Minister says and,
sometimes, I reflect it back at him. Today is not one of those
occasions, but I was interested in his saying that the purpose of
clause 13 is to bring the balance inherent within custody plus into
play. Well, custody plus is not in play, so there is no balance to be
struck. Intermittent custody&#151;a different concept&#151;has been
put in abeyance. We all understand the resource difficulties, but I
urge the Government not only when dealing with the Bill, but when
looking at the history of criminal justice legislation since 1997 not
to rush for headline solutions, but to think more carefully about the
implications of what flows from that
legislation.</div>
					<a name="0711211000260"><div class="hs_Para">Let
us consider schedule 23. It contains pages and pages of amendments to
legislation that is barely two or three years old and some of it
obviously deals with much older legislation. The amount of legislation
that the Government have amended before it has even come into force,
let alone after it has come into force, and the amount of legislation
that the Government have not brought into force&#151;custody plus
being one example&#151;is enormous. It is an incompetent, inefficient
and confusing way in which to run a criminal justice

Minister, when questioned on the matter, said that there were 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div>quite large numbers of Jamaicans, Nigerians and other foreign nationals
in prisons in England and Wales. The Committee is probably in agreement
that many of those people ought to be living in their own country,
either in prison or not, but not at our expense.</div>
					<a name="0711211000272"><div class="hs_Para">By removing a number of foreign
national prisoners who have served at least a part of their sentence in
this country, we would free up a number of valuable prison spaces. The
prison population is bigger than the space available inside the prisons
to house them by about 250 people. Modernisation of the prison estate
means that there is now sanitation inside the cell. An unintended
consequence of overcrowding is the ridiculous set-up whereby cells
designed for one person now have two men, sometimes three, sleeping in
a space that is also used as a lavatory. There is no privacy or
dignity. If one of the cell&#146;s occupants wishes to use the
lavatory, he must do so in front of the others.</div>
					<a name="0711211000273"><div class="hs_Para">I have been to some prisons
where prisoners rig up a string and make a curtain using a sheet or a
towel, although there are obviously difficulties in allowing prisoners
to have string in their cells, as the suicide rate in overcrowded
prisons is enormous. There were about 57 suicides by the mid-point of
this year, although the figure may be higher. However, the number of
suicides in our prisons is gross and something of which we should be
ashamed. If we want to ease overcrowding, one answer is to ensure that
an appropriate number of foreign national prisoners is removed quickly
from our prisons once they have served their sentences.</div>
					<a name="0711211000274"><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 12 was tabled to
act as a spur to the Government to do something about the matter. Our
knowledge of the European Union legal system has shown that expelling
EU citizens to their country of origin is not an apt way to prevent
these people from coming back into the country, because the free
movement directive and other regulations allow them to return. Some
European Union prisoners have been here so long, or were here so long
before they were found guilty of a crime, that under EU law or the
European convention on human rights, they can claim a long-term
connection with this place that prevents them from being deported. That
is not necessarily the case with nationals of countries
outside the European
Union.</div>
					<a name="0711211000275"><div class="hs_Para">The short
point&#151;and I apologise for getting to the church by way of the
moon&#151;is that our prisons are woefully overcrowded. The
Government could relieve some of that overcrowding if they pulled their
socks up and started to negotiate, implementing bilateral treaties with
non-EU countries to ensure that a proportion of the foreign national
prisoners in our prison estate is sent home. More urgently, foreign
national prisoners who are released but remain in this country as
illegal immigrants or are here unlawfully should not simply be released
back onto our streets. They should be taken directly from the prison
and deported. There is no excuse for having such people pushed out into
our streets, where they remain unlawfully and undetected.</div>
					<a name="0711211000276"><div class="hs_Para">Bullwood Hall in Essex and
Canterbury prison in Kent are two prisons dedicated exclusively to
housing foreign nationals who have not yet completed their sentence
and&#151;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;foreign
nationals who have completed their sentence but who have been detained
pending deportation. Either way, something is wrong with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 357</div>system if it cannot ensure the removal of a foreign national who would
be deemed to remain in Britain unlawfully but for the fact that he has
been detained. The presence of such people is not conducive to the
public good, and in the right cases and in the right numbers we should
relieve prison overcrowding by doing something along the lines
suggested by the amendment.</div>
					<a name="0711211000277"><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="0711211000499">Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I simply wish to add a few comments. We undoubtedly
have a problem with foreign prisoners who should have been deported,
but that is more of an administrative problem than a legal one. I am
not convinced that there is a gaping loophole in the present statutory
provisions, but I am utterly convinced that there is
a huge administrative loophole, which I hope will be addressed, given
the inability of the Prison Service and the immigration authorities to
work closely together to ensure that proper measures are taken to label
prisoners due for imminent release so that they know where there is a
recommendation for deportation, and can effect that removal on release.
That should not be the most difficult thing in the world.</div>
					<a name="0711211000278"><div class="hs_Para">I found myself defending the
Minister of State on the question of prisons used for
foreign prisoners, which I regard as a positive move. If one can
congregate those prisoners in one place, it is administratively easier
to effect their removal. That is an entirely proper and sensible thing
to do, and I do not have a problem with it. However, there are some
countries with which we have a substantial problem, including Jamaica,
and I think that the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon.
Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle) travelled to Kingston to
discuss it.</div>

Heath:
						</b> They are all willing to go. I have never been to
Jamaica, but I am not convinced that Kingston is one of the most
salubrious places in the world, although perhaps that is unfair. We
have a problem with Jamaica, and I ran into it when I was involved with
policing in Avon and Somerset. There was a large turnover of Jamaican
drug runners&#151;youths&#151;coming into Bristol airport. On
virtually every aeroplane from Kingston, Jamaica that touched down
there was a significant number of people who were arrested because they
were found to be carrying drugs. That significant problem resulted in
an increase of Jamaican nationals in our prison population. Other
countries are similarly involved in the drugs trade.</div>
					<a name="0711211000283"><div class="hs_Para">It makes sense for some of those
prisoners to be returned to custody or given an appropriate sentence in
their state of origin. Often, these people are not the Messrs. Big of
the drug world. They are poorly advised to carry a limited amount of
drugs on to a plane and get off at the other end, only to find
themselves arrested and put in prison in this country. Of course, they
should not do such things, and they should be deterred, but
nevertheless the real villains of the piece 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>are the people who pay them to act as carriers. If there are ways of
reducing that population, we should adopt them.</div>
					<a name="0711211000284"><div class="hs_Para">I do not, however, accept that
we should deliberately set out to remove as many foreign prisoners as
possible from our jails&#151;particularly if they end up in a
non-secure jail in another country or if we are not convinced that they
would not reoffend. In countries with which we have bilateral
agreements, we must be careful to ensure that we do not create further
work down the line for police and customs officers. I am not convinced
that the statute contains a lacuna. I am convinced, however, that, as
is often true of matters that were the provenance of the Home Office
and which partly still are, and whether or not the Department of
Justice needs to work in conjunction with the Home Office, there is a
huge problem in the management and organisation of the administrative
process. The Government have not yet put that right, and they need to
do better in future.</div>

							<a name="0711211000504">Mr.

						</b> I very much support any measures that are
intended to return foreign national prisoners to their country of
origin, either towards the end of their sentence under present
arrangements or preferably towards the beginning, provided that they
are returned to secure detention. I am sure that my hon. and learned
Friend the Member for Harborough is better informed than me, but I
tabled a parliamentary question on the subject not long ago, and my
understanding is that there are 8,000 foreign national prisoners in our
jails, which is about 10 per cent. of the British prison population.
That is an absolute scandal.</div>
					<a name="0711211000286"><div class="hs_Para">There ought to be scope for
genuine international agreement, perhaps co-ordinated by the United
Nations, on where prisoners should serve their time. A reciprocal part
of that arrangement would be a requirement that we take in British
nationals jailed abroad. From memory, I think that the number of such
people is about 1,500&#151;a lot less than the number of foreign
nationals
here.</div>

people more than British taxpayers&#146; money being spent on
accommodating foreign national prisoners in our jails. The issue of EU
nationals should not be passed over either. The Italians recently came
to some sort of arrangement on Romanian nationals convicted of offences
on Italian soil, and found a way of returning those people to their
country of
origin.</div>
					<a name="0711211000289"><div class="hs_Para">Given that one
of the principles of the European Union is freedom of movement, I do
not see why that should not apply to convicted prisoners. I support the
amendment tabled by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Harborough, and I am glad that the Committee is addressing the genuine
and growing concern in the country that we are far too generous to
foreign nationals in our jails. People get very cross when they are
told, &#147;We would deport them but we have to get their
consent.&#148; We should have appropriate international agreements so
that, whether the prisoner consents to being deported or not, we do not
spend taxpayers&#146; money on detaining prisoners here if they can
be detained in their own country.</div>

contributions. This is an important issue, given the concern about
foreign national prisoners in jails in my jurisdiction of England and
Wales. I hope that I can reassure all hon. Members that foreign
national prisoners are in jail because they have been caught, tried and
convicted of crimes and are therefore serving a sentence. There are
approximately 11,000 such prisoners in British jails, which is about 14
per cent. of the total. As has been mentioned, certain countries
represent a significant proportion of those

					<a name="0711211000293"><div class="hs_Para">As I was
indicating, there are significant areas of difficulty regarding that
figure of 11,000. I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the points
that were mentioned by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. As of 31
August 2007, there were just over 1,300 Jamaican prisoners in British
jails, just over 1,000 Nigerian prisoners, 449 prisoners from
Vietnam&#151;a significant number&#151;369 from Somalia and 371
from China.</div>
					<a name="0711211000294"><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I
can offer the hon. Gentleman and the Committee some reassurance. An
important key point is that, as of 23 October 2007, we have agreements
with 97 countries to repatriate prisoners to serve sentences in their
home country. The countries range from Albania and Australia, in the
a&#146;s, through to Venezuela and Ukraine at the other end of the
alphabet. Those countries and they have operational transfer agreements
in
place.</div>
					<a name="0711211000295"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000510">Mr.
Hollobone:
						</b> Is it the case that those repatriation
agreements require the consent of the prisoner concerned? The Minister
says that there are 1,300 Jamaican nationals in British jails. Surely
the British Government should have been making an agreement with
Jamaica for the mass deportation of those people to a suitable
detention facility in Jamaica. I would be surprised if it were not
cheaper to pay the Jamaicans to hold those people in their own jails
than to house them in this
country.</div>

						</b> Again, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will bear with
me. We have a facilitated return scheme, under which we are encouraging
individuals to return to their home countries. We are also helping with
transfer costs. We recently discussed the matter with the Jamaican
Government and decided on an agreement at official level, which awaits
ratification by the Jamaican Parliament, in respect of the transfer of
such people.</div>
					<a name="0711211000297"><div class="hs_Para">We are
negotiating prisoner transfer arrangements with the major countries,
some of which I mentioned earlier. They include Nigeria, Vietnam, Laos,
China, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div>Ghana, Libya, Botswana and Russia, which are the main areas for which we
need prisoner transfer agreements at official and ministerial levels.
This afternoon, I am meeting the South African Minister of Correctional

with South

							<b class="B">Mr.

lawyers use to prevent those transfers? It is all very well having a
deal with Libya, but I am sure that some slick lawyer will argue that
such a transfer might impinge on his client&#146;s human rights or
something. Even with these agreements, is it likely that prisoners will
be deported to their country of

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000513">Mr.

						</b> Let me put the success of the transfer agreements
and work in context. Two years ago, approximately 1,500 people were
transferred by the Government out of prisons in England and Wales to
foreign prisons. Last year, 2,784 prisoners were transferred out. In
the current year we are on target to meet my right hon. Friend the
Prime Minister&#146;s aim of removing 4,000 prisoners from prisons in
England and Wales. I accept that there is more to be done, which is why
I am investing ministerial time in trying to secure agreements with the
countries that I have mentioned, and why I will be trying to raise that
issue this afternoon with my South African counterpart. There will be
engagements across the board to ensure that that is done, because it
needs to occur. However, the speed of transfer to date has been
significant.</div>
					<a name="0711211000300"><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members mentioned the two prisons that we have allocated entirely to
foreign prisoners&#151;Bullwood and Canterbury&#151;to ensure that
we transfer out prisoners at the end of their sentences much more
efficiently and speedily. Border and Immigration Agency staff are
working in those prisons with the Prison Service to effect a speedy
transfer either to a final destination, or to a holding camp in the BIA
estate. I welcome the support of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome
for that measure.</div>

return to what the Minister was saying because it is important that the
Committee does not get the wrong impression about the agreement with
the Jamaican Government. Is not the scale of that agreement extremely
modest, simply because there are not enough prison facilities in
Kingston to deal with the sort of numbers of prisoners that we have in
the British prison estate?</div>

in August with Jamaica, must be welcomed.</div>

						</b> No, they do not. This is a complex area and it is
difficult to discuss individual cases, but those agreements do not
automatically rely on the consent of the prisoner. There are people who
have been deported and have not consented to that deportation.
Obviously, in the European Union context, that is very difficult,
because in that context a prisoner can be deported to Krakow tomorrow,
walk across the airport and fly back to the UK under their European
rights&#151;rights to which they are perfectly entitled to. So, the
situation is difficult, but the intention is to speed up the
deportations, to effect prisoner transfer agreements, especially with
countries outside the European Union, and to ensure that we put in

deportations.</div>

thinking along the right lines&#151;in answering the question put by
my hon. Friend the Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 362</div>Ruislip-Northwood? Is it not the case that consent is not required from
a prisoner for them to be deported on completion of their sentence, but

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0711211000524">Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> No. The situation, essentially, is that a number
of strands of consent are required. The bilateral agreements that I
have mentioned&#151;there are 97 in total&#151;require the consent
of the prisoner. So, with the 97 countries that I have listed, an
element of consent is required. Under the EU framework decision, which
we have already agreed at an EU level and which comes into effect in
2009 or 2010, consent will not be required. Also, under domestic
legislation, we do not require consent, and where there is no bilateral
agreement, we can deport individuals without their consent, and we have
done so.</div>
					<a name="0711211000315"><div class="hs_Para">The reason
why the figure has risen from 1,500 to 4,000 over the past two years is
because my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, the Minister for
Borders and Immigration, and other Ministers dealing with these
matters, including me, have all recognised that we need to improve the
performance of the BIA estate on deportation and to free up people from
prison into the secure BIA estate ready for deportation. The purpose of
Bullwood and Canterbury was to achieve those
things.</div>
					<a name="0711211000316"><div class="hs_Para">Clause 15 is
designed simply to give the Parole Board the power to determine parole
for all prisoners serving sentences of less than 15 years, regardless
of their immigration status. It is designed to address the decision in
the case of Hindawi, about which hon. Members might be aware, which
provided that applications for the early release of foreign national
prisoners serving between four and 15 years who are liable to
deportation or removal from the United Kingdom can be determined only
by the Secretary of State. That procedure was incompatible with article
5(4) of the European convention on human rights, and clause 15 is
designed to make us compatible with that
convention.</div>
					<a name="0711211000317"><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 19
and 20 are designed to make certain changes to the operation of the
early removal scheme. At the moment, the Secretary of State is
empowered to remove from the country, up to 135 days before the halfway
point of a sentence, fixed term prisoners serving a sentence of three
months or more, but not life, who are liable for deportation or removal
from the United Kingdom. The purpose of the three clauses is, first, to
extend the scheme to make it available to offenders not liable for
deportation; secondly, to streamline the existing scheme by removing a
number of restrictions on eligibility; and, thirdly, to remove a
potential anomaly in the treatment of prisoners released under the
Criminal Justice Acts 1991 and
2003.</div>
					<a name="0711211000318"><div class="hs_Para">I wish to draw
the Committee&#146;s attention to the fact that in pursuing the aims
that I have outlined, clause 20 inadvertently makes a change that I do
not support and that we want to rectify on Report. It would remove the
existing provision requiring prisoners who are entitled to be released
under the provisions of the 2003 Act to serve at least one quarter of
their sentence before they can be removed early under the scheme. We
have reflected on the unintended consequence that that creates a
disparity. I will table an amendment on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 363</div>Report to reinstate the requirement, and I hope that right hon. and hon.
Members will bear with me on that
point.</div>
					<a name="0711211000319"><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, I
commend the clauses to the Committee and I urge it to reject the
amendments tabled by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough. We are
already doing a considerable amount, and are trying to do even more to
effect the changes that I think are sought by all Committee members to
ensure that the 11,000 prisoners either serve their sentences abroad
under repatriation terms, or are at least deported at the end of their
sentence.</div>

						</b> We have had an interesting discussion about the
impact of foreign national prisoners on the English and Welsh prison
estate. It is important that the Government make their position clear.
Obviously, we must consider the situation involving some foreign
nationals. For example, a person could be deported back to China after
serving a relatively short length of time in custody for a relatively
minor offence. Such people could get into considerable difficulty on

am right that since the Government came to office, the foreign national
prison population has gone up by 155 per cent.&#151;three times that
of the British prisoner population&#151;which gives rise to all sorts
of questions about language facilities and the need for interpreters in
prisons and courts. The bill for interpreters in London courts now runs
into millions a year. I have no idea what that bill is in the Prison
Service, but it must be quite
significant.</div>

know the Government&#146;s thinking about this at the moment, but
they were proposing to give EU nationals &#163;1,500 to go away. Of
course, those EU nationals would take the money, go back to France,
Italy or Greece, and return under the free-right-to-travel
arrangements.</div>
