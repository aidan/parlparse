<B>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 328, in page 38, line 5, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in connection with the discharge of their duties under this Act'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take new clause 21—Further Education Funding Council: transfer of property—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—No action in connection with the distribution of the property, rights and liabilities of the Further Education Funding Council for England or any related scheme for the transfer of property shall be taken to affect the interests of further education corporations.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am conscious that we concluded our proceedings this morning in some haste. Although that is often commendable, especially when education questions are pressing, it can lead to consideration being ragged. We found ourselves having to register our dissent before receiving assurances from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks), in relation to further considerations that he wants to bring to the Committee about how the new regime might be more economical and efficient than its predecessor.
<P>
I seek not to reopen those matters, but perhaps I wound up the debate without doing justice to the remarks made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke). At one point, I thought that there was to be a low-level outbreak—a skirmish—into the class war, as the Under-Secretary seemed to take exception about the idea that we were obsessed with the affairs of Oxbridge. I assure him, although my right hon. Friend can speak tellingly for himself, that we did not intend to appear so. Many of us attach the greatest possible importance to further education, and the relevance of my right hon. Friend's comments was that, even with the best will in the world, it is possible to acquire and hold assets almost by accident. That is why we made the case for an asset appraisal before transfer.
<P>
The clause qualifies the simple transfer of undertakings from one body to its successor body. There are three bodies, and not all are successors. One of them—the long-established chief inspector of schools—is not set up by the Bill but has important new responsibilities, and the Bill establishes the adult learning inspectorate and the Learning and Skills Council. They all do slightly different jobs; we do not argue about that. It appears to make sense in terms of the amendment that the appropriate assets should be attached to those jobs. I do not object to the principle of the clause.
<P>
The thought behind this probing amendment is that there should not be an automatic transfer if assets come to light, whether as a result of a formal study or in some other mechanism that the Under-Secretary has canvassed the Committee about introducing, which have no relevance to the subsequent activities of any of the three bodies.
<P>
I do not want to put the matter contentiously. Suppose that one of them inherited an ice cream van, a spare domestic television or something like that because it was the property of the Further Education Funding Council. Through the amendment, we suggest that transfer would not be allowed if such items were not for the purposes for which the bodies were created or given new powers under the Bill. If the asset was contingent and had nothing whatever to do with the discharge of duties, the Secretary of State would be entitled to say, ``An asset has been acquired that had nothing to do with further education. We'll have it, thank you, as it is a public asset.'' Transfer would not be a natural event. In any case, any scheme of transfer should be related to the duties of the Bill and should not simply arise through some general beneficence of the Minister.
<P>
I did not earlier raise future receivables for the FEFC or the successor bodies. We had a rather jocular discussion about compiling codicils for the local learning and skills councils but someone who had given long and dedicated service to the FEFC might have decided to leave it some money in his will. It would be quite useful to have the Minister's clarification as to how that money would be receivable and by whom.
<P>
The essential point is that the Bill reshuffles and reassigns new duties. Assets will transfer as the result of the dissolution of one body and its disposition among successor bodies. If the Minister changes those assets, he must have regard to the fact that the assets relate to the discharge of those duties. The amendment is perhaps a way of exploring and probing the nature of the relationship and how it will work in practice. We do not suggest that there is anything malign about this. We are anxious to see the smooth transfer of business to cover all reasonable eventualities and to ensure that they are handled in a businesslike way.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks):</B> The hon. Gentleman seeks an assurance that the schemes provided for in the clause could not enable the Secretary of State to transfer property or other assets from the FEFC to my Department, Ofsted or the adult learning inspectorate that were irrelevant to their functions. Let me give him that assurance immediately. It would be a misuse of the Secretary of State's power if he did so. I find it hard to think of an asset that the FEFC holds that could not be made use of by any of the bodies listed. Indeed, I understand that the FEFC has already undertaken an inventory. We are confident that there are no such assets but if, in a garage somewhere, an ice cream van is found, we will think diligently about its use. A parliamentary committee would carry out a study into why it was purchased in the first place, and I would seek the Speaker's permission to share its contents with the Committee on a suitable occasion.
<P>
In all seriousness it is difficult to imagine assets that would not be appropriately transferred. I hope that that assurance alone will persuade the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment. He obviously raises a serious issue but I hope to convince him further by explaining some of its unwelcome consequences. The amendment would limit the power so that it should be in connection with the discharge of the transferee's duties under the Bill. The Secretary of State has relatively few duties under the Bill, and Ofsted has many duties provided outside the Bill. It would severely limit the sensible use of public assets made available by the dissolution of the FEFC if the Department or Ofsted could use assets such as, for example, an empty office, only for its duties under the Bill rather than for its other functions. The objective of transfers must be the most effective and efficient use of public money and assets made available by the dissolution of the FEFC. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not want to stand in the way of that process.
<P>
Turning to new clause 21, I must point out that the provisions dealing with the property, rights and liabilities of the FEFC allow for their transfer to successor bodies.
<P>
However, the Bill will not and is not intended to affect the property of individual EE corporations. It is useful to make that clear. A power to transfer property that belongs to the FEFC will not affect FE corporations. The new clause is therefore unnecessary, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for having helped the Committee by saying, no doubt following further advice, that the FEFC has already made an asset appraisal. No ice cream vans or any other inducements were found. I realise that, to ensure the good management of assets, the Bill would allow a schools inspection requirement to transfer an office block that might be used for both Her Majesty's chief inspector's new and enhanced remit and his existing remit in relation to schools. That might be a sensible use, and have probed that point effectively.
<P>
The Under-Secretary responded to new clause 21 in anticipation of my rising again to make one or two points about it, and did so entirely satisfactorily. I thought that it was important to make it clear that he is not trying to get his hands on the assets of further education corporations or to interfere with the discharge of their duties. Clearly, the Learning and Skills Council will affect them in other ways—that is the essence of the Bill—but property transfers should not be affected. The Under-Secretary's assurance on that matter is entirely satisfactory. I beg to ask leave withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 330, in page 38. line 36, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or after a recommendation by the Learning and Skills Council to such local not-for profit interests as he may deem appropriate and suitable for the advancement of education and training'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendment No. 293.
<P>
Amendment No. 329, in page 39, line 8, leave out `3' and insert
<P>

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 294 and 295.
<P>
Government new clause 19—Contracts of employment.
<P>
New clause 22—Training and Enterprise Councils: transfer of property—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—No action in connection with property transfers under the provision of this Act shall be taken to affect the assets of training and enterprise councils, where the assets are not derived from public funds.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am conscious of the fact that my amendment leads a group that contains several Government amendments. Again, our amendments are intended not to be malicious but to probe the minds of Ministers and to ensure good order in the important issue of transfers.
<P>
I shall reserve my fire on the Government amendments until the Under Secretary has spoken, although I do not anticipate having great difficulty with them unless a matter emerges that I had not previously noticed. I shall concentrate on amendments Nos. 330 and 329 and new clause 22.
<P>
As I understand it, the import of the clause goes wider than the mere transfer of what in shorthand we would call FEFC property to any successor bodies by enabling a scheme—it is not clear whether it would be the same scheme or a separate one—to allow the Secretary of State to transfer any of his property to any of the ``listed persons''. Presumably, therefore, the Secretary of State might, subject to his statutory duties, be able to transfer property that belongs to him for whatever reason—even the mythical ice cream van—to the successor bodies for their use. In doing so, he would provide a scheme for a transfer to ``listed persons'', who are, according to my reading of the provision, exactly the same as those specified in clause 85.
<P>
Amendment No. 330 would widen the Secretary of State's powers in making such a scheme so as to enable him to transfer property to another person who might have an educational interest. However, it is limited in several respects. We do not suggest that it should apply to any organisation that claims to be educationalist or person who wants pay personally for the education of his child. We have in mind local charitable organisations and educational trusts, for example.

<P>

<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): Would the hon. Gentleman include within the not-for-profit definition such companies as Nord Anglia, Cambridge Education Associates or CFBT, which provide significant education services under contract to authorities or schools? In addition, are the 66 career services, which are independent, not-for-profit, contracting organisations, included in the definition?
<P>
<H5>1.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I could not comment, even as a layperson, on individual cases without knowing their details. Many organisations—careerpath, for example, in my county—are set up as consortium operations, under a variety of different arrangements but with a strong not-for-profit influence. However, some are private sector bodies and some are for profit. We could imagine a situation in which a private company could, at arm's length as it were, manufacture profit out of what might seem a not-for-profit relationship. If that is what the hon. Gentleman is implying, I readily accept it.
<P>
I do not claim that my amendment is legally watertight; it seeks rather to probe the Minister for details. The asset from the Further Education Funding Council may be a small one—a lease on a couple of rooms in a building, for example, which had not been disposed of in time—which it would be eminently sensible to transfer to some other local worthy activity and for which it would not make a great deal of sense to transfer it to one of the successor bodies. Although it is not formally the same, the argument is similar to our earlier one about the transfer of property to local learning and skills councils and whether they would be run by trustees. We are saying—it is not intended as a matter of ideology—that some public assets, which are perfectly reasonable and which were held by the Further Education Funding Council or, as I understand the clause, by the Secretary of State, may no longer be required specifically for the purposes set out in the Bill. In such cases it might be sensible to borrow a bit of charity law by applying the cy-pres doctrine and transferring such assets to some related worthy educational cause, provided that it were a not-„for-profit organisation and provided that the LSC approved. I suspect that the acute members of the Government Back Benches, as well as Ministers, will have spotted that it would be within the powers of the LSC to make such transfers if it wishes, outwith the scheme. It could simply say that it does not want to sell assets for profit to the private sector but would rather transfer them to the local organisation. Conditions might be attached to that transfer, and the Minister might like to ponder on that point.
<P>
Amendment No. 329 is rather different, arising out of representations that I received from another source. If I explain the background to it, the Minister can respond. It is not so much to do with the divestment of assets as with assurances to members of the public, including parents, that there will not be—the Minister says he does not think there will be—a serious change of direction in funding, for example, of school sixth forms. However, it would be reasonable for a parent, whose 11-year-old or 12-year-old child was about to enter a school with a sixth form, to presume that there would be continuity for the period of that child's time at secondary school. That continuity would be secured by a period of six years, as it would not be by a period of three; a break of service after three years would be discontinuous and distressing. We want to probe the Government's wider intentions for sixth forms and receive assurances that Ministers have some understanding—although it may be inadequate—of the importance of continuity and of not messing children about by changes of arrangement during their schooling. The Minister will remember the case of Heather Begbie, which must be engraved on his and his colleagues' hearts. That student had an assisted place at primary level but was surprised to find, at secondary level, that she no longer had that status. That was a wrenching case, which I had in mind when I tabled the amendment.
<P>
New clause 22 concerns training and enterprise councils, which are private bodies operating under licence and under the direction of the Secretary of State. Those licences will be terminated with effect from next year. Ministers have made it clear that they do not intend to collar assets not seen to derive from public funds—that is an important assurance. We have already proposed that there might be some means of creating an independent set of trustees to hold those assets for the benefit of local learning and skills councils and the local communities. I hope that the Minister will keep that idea in mind.
<P>
New clause 22 is declaratory, like new clause 21, its twin and predecessor. It would mean that Ministers could give assurances that any genuinely private assets would not simply be collared for central Government purposes, but would be inviolate and disposed of in accordance with the trust's wishes.
<P>
There are a mix of issues to debate. I seek to win assurances from Ministers in what I hope is a balanced approach and to widen the flexibility of the transfer arrangements. I hope that the Minister will explain his proposals and respond sensitively to ours.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I shall introduce our own proposals and comment fully on the hon. Gentleman's. His suggestions raise important issues, on which I hope to reassure the Committee.
<P>
Clauses 84 to 87, along with the provisions in schedule 9, are intended to provide the necessary legal framework to support a smooth transition to the new arrangements. The three Government amendments, Nos. 293, 294 and 295, with new clause 19, are intended to strengthen those provisions further.
<P>
The three amendments are primarily designed to allow the Secretary of State to transfer any property rights and liabilities directly from TECs to the LSC with the prior permission of the TEC concerned—there must be prior permission. Under the existing provisions of clause 87, the Secretary of State can transfer to the LSC property rights and liabilities that have been returned to him under the terms of his contract with the TECs. However, there are likely to be several liabilities that we would want the LSC to honour, but which are not covered by the provisions and will not revert to the Secretary of State under the terms of the TEC contracts.
<P>
Hon. Members have often spoken about the importance of maintaining worthwhile activity in local areas. The amendments will allow us to ensure that the LSC builds on some of the TECs' longer-term commitments, which are important to local areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister prompts me to ask about the ordinary liabilities of TECs, which I have not previously considered. If, when their licence runs out, there were a commercial dispute about, for instance, the photocopier bill—which, previously, would have been dealt with by a private sector company under licence with the supplier, which is also likely to be private sector—who would take on those liabilities? I assume that it would not be the Secretary of State. Will there be liquidators for the existing TECs? Who will pick up the tab? Alternatively, will the Secretary of State offer to consider such cases?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> My understanding is that liabilities, along with assets, will be transferred to the successor body. I might be wrong, however, and I shall ensure that the Committee is provided with the correct detail. Liabilities may include existing commitments to support learning and skills activity within single regeneration budget projects and European projects. The provisions will allow us to provide such projects with early certainty, and will avoid the risk of planning blight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is being extremely helpful, so I hope that he does not think adversely of me for raising other matters. Currently, the relationship is between the European Commission, as the funding body, and the TEC. However, if the TEC no longer exists, because it has no licence, do arrangements exist which he might have brokered with Brussels, whereby the European Commission will be prepared to recognise the LSC as the successor body, and to continue the arrangement unchanged?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I shall check the detail on that. We want such projects to continue, and, clearly, what the hon. Gentleman describes would be logical.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): Given that explanation, does amendment No. 293 refer to a TEC? It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may make a scheme providing for the transfer to any listed person of any of the property, rights and liabilities of a person with whom the Secretary of State has made arrangements.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If so, can the Secretary of State provide more detail on the ``arrangements regarding employment'', to which the amendment also refers? To whose employment does it refer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> In answer to the first question, it does refer to a TEC. If further clarification is needed, I shall provide it.
<P>
In response to an earlier and important question, the arrangements are being discussed with Brussels, as anticipated by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell). We certainly do not foresee any problems in that respect.
<P>
I was discussing how the provision will allow us to provide early certainty to such projects, and avoid the risk of planning blight. We want to strike a balance between maintaining such worthwhile activity and giving the LSC as much scope as possible to develop its own initiatives.
<P>
New clause 19, which relates to contracts of employment, introduces changes that will involve a complex set of staff transfers. We have discussed that on a number of occasions. The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 offer protection to many individuals who move to a new organisation. We want to ensure that such protection may also apply to individuals, such as those in the FEFC, who transfer, under the express provisions of the Bill, to the LSC, the adult learning inspectorate or OFSTED, even where TUPE does not strictly apply. That is achieved by the new clause. It is in line with Cabinet Office guidance on transfers in the public sector, which was issued in January.
<P>
<H5>2 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Given the especially complex structure of some TECS, some TEC employees may wish to transfer to the LSC—those who have the skills and expertise that the LSC requires—but who might not transfer under TUPE, because of the way in which their job with the TEC is arranged. In such cases, and with the agreement of the individual and the LSC, the provisions in the clause will allow us to transfer such individuals to the LSC, with full protection of their existing terms of employment. The clause contains the standard provisions adopted when contracts of employment are transferred by or under legislation.
<P>
Those are important additions to the Bill to help the transfer process, and I commend them to the Committee. I hope that hon. Members think that we are being reasonable on the important matter of employment.
<P>
Amendment No. 330, moved by the hon. Member for Daventry, would give my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State the power to transfer assets, rights and liabilities of the LSC, Ofsted or ALI to a not-for-profit body involved in education and training. The hon. Gentleman may have intended the provision to apply to the assets that have returned to the Secretary of State, but the amendment would not achieve that. We have a shared aim that we should make the best use of the assets for the benefit of local communities, and I will return to that in a moment.
<P>
Last week in Committee, I promised to return to the reasons behind the few cases where TECs have set up charitable trusts, which the hon. Gentleman raised. There are three instances, and I can confirm that in all three the primary reason was the tax advantages that that brought. They all involve activities that TECs elsewhere have chosen to conduct through their main company or through other organisations, such as education business partnerships. The stimulus for setting up trusts will not be the same for the LSC, because its tax position is different.
<P>
As long as the third party consents, the Secretary of State can already do much of what the amendment may seek. As I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not want such a power to be exercised without the consent of the not-for-profit organisations referred to in the amendment, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 329 would increase the time allowed for operating transfer schemes under clause 87 from three years to six years from the date of commencement. In considering how long it might take to resolve all outstanding issues in respect of transition, we felt that a three year period was sufficient. It would be unreasonable to subject the LSC, Ofsted and ALI to a much longer period during which liabilities could be imposed on them. A period longer than three years is unnecessary. Indeed, I would expect much of the work to have been completed well within that period. I am not attracted to a provision that is longer than necessary and I invite the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment.
<P>
I hope that I understood correctly the hon. Gentleman's argument about the position of a child at school. The clause has nothing to do with such a situation; it involves assets and similar matters. I can reassure him that his fears are unfounded.
<P>
I will deal with new clause 22. In out useful discussions last week, when we considered for the first time matters involving TECs, hon. Members recognised the complexities of the issues. I spoke about the detailed work that we are doing with all TECs to establish the position in each case. I want to emphasise that our aim remains to reach agreement on a TEC by TEC basis on what happens to all assets, irrespective of how they were funded. I hope that hon. Members agree that it is the Government's responsibility to do so. After all, TECs owe their existence to the significant public funding that they receive. They would have been unable to generate other assets, without the substantial capacity and capability that public funding has provided. That is the fundamental issue. We want to ensure therefore that all assets continue to be used for the benefit of the communities that TECs were set up to serve.
<P>
I understand what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve through the amendment, but it over-simplifies a complex picture. Let me explain some of the complexities. First, the vast majority of TEC assets, including some that TECs would consider private assets, derive somehow from public funds, as I implied.
<P>
Secondly, some assets will have been funded through a mix of public and private finance. The amendment would unnecessarily constrain the flexibility that we need to agree on the best future use and ownership of such assets, and to use the Bill to transfer them to the LSC if necessary. Hon. Members wish to see locally generated assets, as well as the fruits of national funding, applied to benefit and improve the local community.
<P>
Several TECs have made it clear to us that, on winding up, they intend to put all residual assets, whatever their provenance, at the Secretary of State's disposal. The amendment might prevent him from passing such assets on to the new bodies under the Bill.
<P>
We continue to work closely with TECs on those issues, including examining the outcome of the work that we have commissioned from Robson Rhodes, which I mentioned last Thursday. I suggest that the best way forward would be to return to the issue on Report, when that work will be completed, and I will be able to give the House a more detailed exposition of how we intend to handle the transfer of TEC assets in the round. I hope that, with that assurance, the hon. Gentleman will not press his new clause or amendments, but join hon. Members in supporting the Government amendments.
<P>
I am aware that I have not yet answered some detailed questions of almost an accountancy nature. I will do that either during the afternoon or in writing, because those detailed questions deserve detailed responses.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the tone with which he moved the Government amendment and the way in which he responded to me. With no disrespect to him, it is increasingly clear that several issues have not yet been resolved. It is right to debate them, and we are grateful for his offer to return with a more substantial formulation on Report, following further research and discussions with the TEC movement. He also undertook to respond to some more specific points, which, in my case, arose as the Committee discussed the implications of the proposals.
<P>
The Government amendments appear at first sight to be inherently reasonable. Subject to the necessary caveat of careful study, we will not create difficulties over them.
<P>
I can quickly dispose of our amendment that would set a six-year period. I suspected that the Minister would respond to that as he did, so I suggest that we store that issue for a later debate about sixth forms, which my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) may conduct. That is an important matter, which to some extent bears on grammar schools.
<P>
I felt that the Minister became a bit minatory when he talked about the new clause and said rather firmly that the majority of TEC assets derived from public funds. Certainly, about 90 per cent. of spending flows through the licence, but that should not be construed as the situation in every case. It may be true that most of the assets are public or assumed to be public, and that a TEC can divest itself of its assets and hand the proceeds over to the Secretary of State. However, such conditions and behaviour should not automatically be attributed to other companies—if not to private sector companies, which the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) discussed earlier, at least to organisations with private governance and an identity separate from the Government.
<P>
Will the Minister assure the Committee that individual TECs will not be unduly pressured to divest themselves of assets when they genuinely doubt or dispute their ownership? That must be dealt with on a fair and all-fours basis. Will he confirm that he will not take powers to overturn an individual TEC's memorandum and articles of association? He should not be granted a power that would allow him to take assets and wilfully sweep them into a scheme.
<P>
On the disposition of assets, should there not be a mechanism that would allow someone to act as an umpire or arbiter so that disputes could be resolved? The Minister may need to re-examine the issue later, but experienced people in the arbitration world could be called in and would not be viewed as being under the control of the Secretary of State. There is a need for an independent person to examine the circumstances and sort them out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): I take the hon. Gentleman's point about arbitration, and welll-worn systems and methods exist to carry it out. However, does the hon. Gentleman concede that when the assets and liabilities are transferred, any outstanding disputes will still have to be dealt with by the bodies to which they have been transferred? I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman distinguishes between dealing with unresolved disputes about capital or revenue assets and bringing in an arbitration system that can be employed in the usual way to settle disputes arising from transferred assets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is greatly at odds with me on this matter. It does not necessarily arise out a scheme of transfer, though it might affect what assets could form part of a scheme of transfer if they were in dispute. I cannot imagine that the Secretary of State will want to make a scheme of transfer in which he will say, ``The assets are mine and I transfer them, subject to a later arbitration procedure''. That seems implausible.
<P>
Returning to amendment No. 330, I am seeking the Minister's assurance that he will not lean on TECs and that the Bill will not subvert their existing constitutions. I do not believe that it will, but we must be sure about that.
<P>
If there is a row—even a genuine and principled row rather than one created to raise a political stink—between a TEC board and the Secretary of State about ownership of a particular asset, there must be a mechanism for dispute resolution. That is particularly important because the Bill makes a wide definition of assets derived from public funds. There should be a mechanism for dispute resolution. The last thing that I want is a continuing set of withering and wearing litigation over undetermined assets. It must be sorted out. The simplest approach would be for the Secretary of State to collar all the assets, but that would not be right and would subvert the individual TEC. The sorting out must be done on a principled basis.
<P>
I shall not press amendment No. 330 to a vote because the exchanges and assurances have been helpful. The issue of separate trust status relates to earlier debates and I am grateful to the Minister for his researches into TECs that hold separate charitable trusts in parallel. I would not be surprised—though I have not checked the arrangements myself—if these have been made mainly for tax avoidance. Regarding future benevolence by individuals, we need to consider whether establishing a non-departmental public body—the LSC—to receive assets bequeathed by generous persons to local interests is the best vehicle. A genuine local focus may be required and that vehicle may cut off some of the areas of beneficence.
<P>
Will the Minister also clarify an earlier unresolved point about assets that may accrue to the FEFC by bequest ex post divestment, but are not yet in the bank? How will such assets be received and who will have them?
<P>
<H5>2.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brook </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I want to express my appreciation to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry for his defence, in the debate on amendment No. 328, of my remarks about amendment No. 327, on which the Minister mildly animadverted. My choice of examples to illustrate amendment No. 327 was picked up by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase) and exposed my Achilles' heel towards the Minister. He was wholly entitled to take advantage of it, as he did.
<P>
I have three sons, who have moved through foundation, under-graduate and post-graduate levels and one has acquired a craft skill. Together, they attended four universities, one of which was Oxford, two polytechnics—as they were then called—and a technical college where the craft skill was learnt. My delight was occasioned partly because when I was the Minister responsible for higher education, though I did not rival the record of my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and the Weald (Miss Widdecombe)—who visited every prison in the country when she was a Home Office Minister—I was said to have visited more higher education institutions than any previous Minister. I choose those words carefully so as not to make any comparison between my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry or the present Minister. I remember persuading one of my sons to go to an institution in Newcastle instead of in the south of England, as his school was suggesting. He was tremendously successful and he hugely enjoyed it there.
<P>
I revert to the morning's financial calculations. We do not yet have a breakdown to ascertain how much comes from public funds, how much is hybrid or how much definitively belongs to technical colleges. I hope that we shall receive the Government's best global estimate of how much the TECs' assets are worth. I was pleased to hear how many TECs, regardless of where they come from, have agreed to a voluntary transfer of their assets. My hon. Friend's criteria conditions were thoroughly sensible.
<P>
I was particularly glad to hear, in the context of new clause 21, that the possibility of using the resources of trusts was being contemplated. To be circular in my remarks—it did not occur to me when we were talking about trusts earlier but it does now—I want to mention the enormous contribution, to further more than higher education, of livery companies in the City of London over the past century. They contributed to the expansion of education at all levels out of funds that had accumulated over centuries. That shows the virtue of such trusts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his remarks. I want to deal with the specific points that were raised in the debate. I shall have to write to the hon. Member for Daventry with a reply to his question about bequests to FEFC, which we shall have to examine carefully. As to his earlier question about the discharge of liabilities, I promised to come back to the Committee on that. It is for the TEC companies to discharge their liabilities, but the clause will enable them to be transferred if the Secretary of State and the TEC agree and if a third party, such as a learning and skills council, wishes to be involved in a contract. That is the answer in principle, but much will depend in practice on individual cases.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked three specific questions. First, the Bill is not all about putting pressure on TECs. The Government are not leaning on them—or anyone else—and we do not intend to do so, even at the rag end of a Committee. It is not about pressure, but about a proper and sensible dialogue, which we are having with the TECs. The TEC national council is being extraordinary helpful; I meet its members from time to time and had an informal discussion with them this week.
<P>
In the great majority of cases we envisage no problems; the proposal is not about anyone being nice or nasty but about the sensible discussion of complex issues. The structure of the TECs and the future of the work that they undertake is not straightforward; some of it goes to local learning and skills councils and some to other institutions, depending on the nature of the local TEC. The Committee expects the Government to safeguard public money and that is what we are endeavouring to do.
<P>
I can reassure the hon. Member for Daventry that there is no power in the schemes to transfer non-attributable assets.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Briefly, for the record, my anxiety was not only about there being no power to transfer non-„attributable assets but that there was no power to set aside the memorandum and articles of a TEC company in respect of the transfer of any of the assets that were left to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We shall need to return to that matter to ensure that there is no power in the schemes to do so.
<P>
An arbitration process, which the hon. Gentleman proposed, is not necessary. I repeat: we are handling the matter with great care and we thank those in the TEC movement for helping us in that respect. I am not an arbitrator, but we have appointed accountants Robson Rhodes to look carefully at what can be regarded as public assets and what can be regarded as private assets. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Gentleman that we are seeking outside expert advice.
<P>
Our key responsibility is to ensure that money that can properly be described as the public's money is safeguarded and appropriately transferred. I have already reassured the Committee that when money is left over after negotiations, it will be used for local purposes. That does not require the establishment of charitable trusts.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry is thus reassured and that he will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response to the amendment, which extracted some interesting details and assurances from him. The TEC movement, both generally and specifically, will be pleased to have the Minister's assurance that no undue pressure will be put on them and that, if necessary, they will have recourse to outside advisers to assist in the difficult business of unbundling the assets. I do not cast aspersions on any firm of accountants, but rather than having an accountant as an agent for the Secretary of State, it might seem better if an independent person were to adjudicate in disputes.
<P>
The sensitive issues raised have been well rehearsed; I appreciate, and readily acknowledge, that the Minister has tied his interests to the proper recovery of public funds. It is extremely important that assets that are not part of public funds should not be misappropriated to them. We are pleased that the issues will be further considered; given the useful nature of the debate, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The clause deals with many complex matters involving the transfer of assets, rights or liabilities. I shall keep to my promise and explain how we calculated the £50 million savings, and respond to points made by Opposition Members.
<P>
As I said earlier, our starting point was to assess the numbers of people employed on post-16 learning and skills in TECs, the Further Education Funding Council, the Training Standards Council, the Department for Education and Employment, and Government offices. That was not an easy task because of the complex structure of TECs and the limited central information on the breakdown of TEC staff by function. However, by working with individual TECs and assessing what proportion of staff in my Department and Government offices were involved in work that would either disappear or transfer to the Learning and Skills Council, we calculated that about 6,500 people were engaged in post-16 learning and skills work in those organisations. We estimated the total cost of those staff and the associated on-costs to be in the region of £250 million to £270 million.
<P>
The next step was to make an assessment of the resources needed by the Learning and Skills Council, the adult learning inspectorate and Ofsted to take forward the remit set out in the Bill. In the case of the LSC, we put together our assessment by building up from the functions that it will need to perform. That work led us to conclude that about 4,700 staff employed by the LSC in total, with 80 to 90 on average in each local LSC, although they will vary a great deal in size and coverage. We estimated the overall costs of the LSC, ALI and Ofsted at about £200 million to £220 million.
<P>
I emphasise that the figures were used for planning purposes. The actual budgets for ALI, Ofsted and the LSC will be decided in the context of the comprehensive spending review and it will be for each organisation to determine its staff numbers according to the resources available.
<P>
I shall respond to the points made by the hon. Member for Daventry. First, we made it clear that the £50 million savings per annum were in steady state. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the costs of transition need to be offset against that; we made no secret of it, as it was in the explanatory notes to the Bill. However, I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that the return on our investment is, by any standards, impressive.
<P>
Secondly, I re-emphasise that we are talking about savings in direct administration costs. They take no account of the benefits to providers of simpler systems and less bureaucracy, such as the example I quoted earlier of having to cope with different IT systems. Some providers told us that more than 30 per cent. of what TECs pay them goes on administration. We will help to free up some of those resources for the benefit of individual trainees to improve the quality of their training. I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West (Valerie Davey) that the savings to providers above £50 million could be significant.
<P>
Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman asked whether we had validated our calculations with external consultants. In developing our calculations we worked with the people who know best what resources are needed to do the job—individuals in TECs and in the Further Education Funding Council. Real experts who do not charge for their advice are the best form of management consultants, and we must pay heed to public money in that respect, too. I shall not leave unchallenged the assertion that the system will cost more because it involves consultation with a wide range of partners. Consultation is a strong feature of the current system; TEC chairmen have in place a wide range of mechanisms to receive partners' views. My Department is building on that best practice at national level, not creating new costs. I hope that I have provided the Committee with more information, as it requested. I am not always so optimistic, but I hope that it will reassure the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thank the Minister for enabling us to smoke him out a little on costs. As he rightly said, some of them were trailed in the explanatory memorandum and the figures that he has given are at least consistent with his earlier assertions. I do not wish to subvert his figures, but it seems that when it is necessary to work out what assets are owned by which organisation—whether it is the private sector arm of TECs, the public moneys represented by the Secretary of State or the existing trusts held by TECS—the Minister is happy to bring in Robson Rhodes as an independent firm to carry out that hard job, but when it comes to awkward matters, he is happy to say that they are matters for the experts in his Department.
<P>
Scepticism remains, and it is not confined to a tightly knit group of politically motivated people on the Opposition Benches. Indeed, there is a wide feeling in the sector that some additional costs have not been fully taken into account. Let us consider the possibility of a delay in decision making if the decisions became more centralised to the extent that they are devolved rather than determined by formula. Such decisions may be taken more quickly, given that 47 organisations might be more or less responsive than 72 local organisations. However, to the extent to which they are determined by formula, they may be less appropriate in individual cases.
<P>
Consultation will depend not only on good practice, but on the structure that has been derived. The Under-Secretary will have seen the organograms and other helpful aids that will involve national training organisations, regional development authorities and others, not all of which will have identical remits. We have already discussed the overlap between the two inspectorates, and those consulting may be frustrated by the endless process of brokering the various aspects of the consultation exercise. A more objective judge than we are of such matters will come in the shape of the facts and the outcome. Having expressed our genuine concerns about the provision, we shall probably have to stand back and await the outcome, but if more money is dissipated in administration, I hope that the Under-Secretary will be gracious enough to acknowledge that we warned him about it.
<P>
The clause empowers the Secretary of State to set up schemes of transfer. At no point in my perusal of the Bill did I find a specific requirement on the right hon. Gentleman to make public the details of the schemes.
<P>
Reasons of confidentiality may make that inappropriate, but it would be helpful if the Minister explained how he intends to set about the business of public accountability. He must confirm that assets have been properly transferred and logged, and that any responsibility that he assumes for reallocating the assets can be defended in the Public Accounts Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I had a brief exchange with the Minister this morning about the letter that he wrote to me subsequent to Second Reading. I return to it briefly, not for further assurances, but so that we can be given a definitive answer in due course.
<P>
On Second Reading, I gave the House the explanation that Baroness Blackstone had already given to the other place about where the saving came from. Of the £50 million, £15 million came from savings in Government office spending, thanks to a reduction in the number of staff contracting with the TECs; the balance of £35 million would come from a reduction in local branch spending as the number of branches fell from 72 to 47. I continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the branches have shrunk by about a third, we assume that branch administrative spending was previously three times £35 million, or a little more than £100 million. That figure is another that needs to be verified in Committee.—[Official Report, 30 March 2000; Vol.347, c.582.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When the Minister wrote to me just before the Committee stage began, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>During the debate, you suggested that because the number of offices is being reduced by a third, creating a saving of £35 million, it follows that the current cost of administration is likely to be three times that figure—a little over £100 million. It is not, however, correct to estimate the costs of administration in this way.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There follows a long passage of text without figures, but I had not argued about the total cost of administration. My calculations were based on the cost of running the 72 branches, which were reducing to 47. That is the figure that I would like to know in due course. I understand that the layering of other expenditure at all levels—the inspectorate in the Department and in the Learning and Skills Council—will involve administration. I have no problem with that. I want to make sure that the figure is not drastically different from the £100 million that was my best estimate of what seemed to be to be a reasonable arithmetical extrapolation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I shall check the record on the figures that I gave this morning and my further explanation in the light of that ``supplementary'' question and I shall give any further reassurance that I can. I have said that the great bulk of savings will come from the number of public bodies that we envisage. But I am happy to give that information. Despite my jocular reference this morning to the assumption that the right hon. Gentleman was more interested in literature than arithmetic, I checked his academic achievements and I withdraw even a jocular reference. He may be a slow bowler but that is part of an all-rounder approach to academic achievement. I did not intend to cast aspersions.
<P>
We shall make public in all circumstances the schemes to which the hon. Member for Daventry referred. I gave some commitment to open government earlier, except, of course, where there are issues of commercial confidentiality, as I think the hon. Gentleman will appreciate.
<P>
We have had a good run through of the issues. We agree on much, but not on everything. We have a year to go to the transition period and, perfectly properly, much discussion is still to be had and performance to be maintained. No doubt one or two difficult issues will need to be discussed carefully with some local TECs, but we are engaged in that. I am confident that we shall complete discussion in a way that satisfies everyone, safeguards public money and ensures a smooth transition. I hope that the Committee will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Clause 87, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 88</center></H4>
<H4><center>Persons under 19</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 332 in page 39, line 22, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; or is one which is authorised by the Learning and Skills Council for exceptional or experimental use'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 146, in page 39, line 26, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) The requirement in subsection (2) above shall not apply to any programme of study leading to a certificate or other award which does not constitute a qualification.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now move away from the somewhat technical area of assets and financial issues to the subject of external qualifications. In some respects clauses 88 and 89 have to be seen together. Clause 88 relates to the younger age group—persons aged 16 to 18; clause 89 to those over 19. Both are governed by the following provisions of clauses 90, 91 and 92 relating to the approval of qualifications.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm my understanding of clause 88. The clause seems to provide that courses must not be publicly funded if they lead to non-approved external qualifications other than those appearing under subsection (5). [Interruption.] The Minister looks as if he has given that consideration, and appears to agree. It is curious that for these purposes under subsection (5) external qualifications do not include courses particularised in paragraphs (a) to (e). In my view—we are now making our personal confessions about the educational qualifications that we have gained—I would be covered in two respects. The clause would certainly cover me under a first degree course, which I took at university. It would also cover me under paragraph (b) for a post-graduate course, as I have the great advantage of having taken a post-graduate course at the polytechnic of Central London, a very fine institution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> In my constituency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It is in my right hon. Friend's constituency. We have heard comments about different institutions. That institution compressed the basics of a three-year law degree at university into a single year, and taught it to a high level, with most people passing the rigorous externally moderated examinations. So, credit to the polytechnic of Central London, which provides fine teaching.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> While my hon. Friend is right that the clause would limit the qualifications for which funding could be attracted to those within a list of external qualifications, is it not also of some interest to the Committee that if there were no qualification at all, it would still be open to the Learning and Skills Council to pay? It is the strange lacuna of non-approved qualifications which is in limbo.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend, with characteristic acuteness and conciseness, has come straight to the point of the amendment. While courses leading to non-approved external qualifications are ruled out for public funding, those which do not lead to external qualifications seem to be ruled in. So it would appear possible to provide such courses. Can the Minister confirm that, and give an example of the type of non-approved external qualification that he does not want to be publicly funded? One or two concrete examples would help the Committee.
<P>
The other strange issue is that these non-approved courses leading to non-approved external qualifications can be provided for people over 19 under clause 89. Different issues arise there, but the Government appear to be taking a different approach to them. It seems all right for someone over 19 to take such a course, but a person under 19 will not receive public funding. I should be grateful if the Minister would deal with that point as the amendment—and amendment No. 332—are relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> If I may, I will compliment my hon. Friend and briefly complement his remarks. 
<P>
A major concern is that the LSC should wherever possible look at ways of moving forward and including rather than excluding people. The Minister referred to his interest in prison education, which I share. I am thinking in particular of a Home Office secure institution in my constituency. One of the awarding bodies gives part qualifications that can build up to a useful qualification, probably the first that these young people ever receive. 
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There will be basic skills qualifications and we should encourage them. The clause does not suggest that they are all ruled out but we need to encourage people to complete, and dare I say it, to attempt these courses, even they do not complete them, rather than to produce too narrow a schedule, perhaps for reasons of academic propriety. That is a statement of my personal attitude. I am aware that some restrictions on qualifications were operated by previous Governments too, no doubt for the good reasons that the Minister will give us, but I urge him to be as inclusive as possible in this regard.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> I understand the concerns of the hon. Members for Daventry and for Hertsmere about this. I had some difficulty in understanding quite what they were driving at in amendment No. 332 and there seems to be some confusion in their minds about what is going on here. I shall therefore try to enlighten them. I hope that I have understood the hon. Member for Daventry correctly, but what lies behind his concern is that nothing should be done to stifle innovation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister has helpfully stated at least half of my concern. It is not simply a matter of not stifling innovation, but of not creating hurdles for low achievers who may be slightly disaffected with the result that they give up rather than make some partial and, in Lord Dearing's memorable phrase, bite-sized achievement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> As ever, I am grateful to the hon. Member for Daventry. We share his concern that the whole process should encourage innovation but also respond to the needs of learners. That is the key. Of course we want to see that. I hope that the remarks that I am about to make will reassure both hon. Members. Clearly the approval process must not stand in the way of those goals, but it can answer both those needs. It can be responsive. It can promote innovation while at the same time ensuring that young people, including learners of compulsory school age, have access to sound qualifications that meet their learning needs and are suitable for their age and maturity.
<P>
Approval of qualifications is likely to depend on prior accreditation by the QCA or other regulatory authorities. In accrediting qualifications, they will provide choice and scope for innovation. They can accredit new or developing qualifications for initially limited purposes, while ensuring that such provision is subject to evaluation to ensure that it is sound, fit for the purpose and suitable for young people. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we would want to consider such provision for approval for public funding. As now, I would fully expect promising provision to be approved for limited use for young people if appropriate.
<P>
Courses that do not lead to qualifications or other forms of certification can be funded. They are not precluded. The hon. Member for Hertsmere also asked me for examples of courses that might not be approved. One example would be NVQ3s for pre-16s, which might not be appropriate on maturity or health and safety grounds. I hope that that gives him further insight into our thinking on that.
<P>
The LSC will have considerable flexibility in determining what provision it should fund. Equally, we would be concerned if it were able to decide what ``exceptional and experimental'' provision should be made available to compulsory school age pupils in maintained schools to determine what an external qualification is without recourse to the regulatory authority.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It is always helpful to have examples. Is the Minister saying that an NVQ3 would not be an approved external qualification?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> No, I was not saying that at all. I gave it as an example and said that NVQ3 might not be approved for pre-16s on the grounds of health and safety or maturity. That is the point. I hope that that is helpful. We would be concerned if qualifications were funded where approval has been withheld for sound educational reasons. That is what the regulatory bodies are there for and we trust them to do their job properly. All these risks exist with the amendment. I hope in the light of the assurances on the amendment that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilary Benn </B>(Leeds, Central): I have been reflecting carefully on my hon. Friend's argument. Could he say a little more about what those sound educational reasons might be that would lead the awarding body not to agree a qualification? I have a lot of sympathy with the argument that we should maximise flexibility. My concern is simply that we should not have a clause that will provide an obstacle in years to come. Could he also give us some idea of how long it would take for these qualifications to be authorised? We are all keen on flexibility of foot, if I can put it that way. If someone has a good way of getting to people who are otherwise disaffected, he should be able to get something up and running relatively quickly, without having to wait for the due processes to grind their way slowly through the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I rise to my feet, simply to give way to the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On a point that arises directly out of that helpful intervention, could the regulatory bodies give approval and come within the rubric of the clause on an experimental or temporary basis that could then be piloted? We could see whether it worked and if it did, we could put it on a permanent basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn) and to the hon. Member for Daventry for their interventions. I share their concerns, particularly about the speed of response. We live in a world where technological change is taking place so rapidly and the regulatory body sometimes finds it difficult to keep up with the new information and communication technologies and the qualifications from private sector providers, which may be state of the art. I understand that, but we must ensure that a proper process is in place too. I am sure that hon. Members will recognise that.
<P>
The sound educational reasons that might stand in the way of approval would be those that related to age and maturity. Obviously, as I mentioned in response to the hon. Member for Hertsmere, some qualifications might not be appropriate for pre-16s because of their age. In terms of the speed of response, the process of accreditation should not take more than 26 weeks. Most learners study in academic years and qualifications will be approved ahead. There will be the capacity for approval on the basis of a rolling programme. I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central and the hon. Member for Hertsmere that we envisage flexibility and speedy responses when new situations develop.
<P>
Amendment No. 146 raises concerns that have already been voiced in Committee in another place. I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for Hertsmere that there is no foundation for them. Baroness Blackstone gave firm and clear assurances to Baroness Sharp that clause 88 will apply only to courses that lead to qualifications awarded or accredited by an external body. I am happy to repeat that assurance today.
<P>
The approval requirement in the clause, in conjunction with clauses 90 and 91, will relate only to external qualifications and courses that lead to them. It will not apply if courses are certificated in some other way, as is the case with the Duke of Edinburgh award or some youth enterprise schemes. As the clause and the approval requirement do not apply, it would simply be for the Department and the LSC, or the National Assembly for Wales and the National Council for Education and Training for Wales, to determine the funding for such provision.
<P>
We recognise the importance of non-qualification-bearing provision. We are fully committed to ensuring that the LSC funds a full range of learning opportunities for young people and adults. Learning for enrichment and development is valued, and there are a range of reasons why such provision motivates and encourages learners to engage in other forms of learning that lead to qualifications. It helps in the job market, as well as enriching individual lives.
<P>
I believe that hon. Members will find that ethos reflected in our second LSC funding and allocations consultation document, which was issued on 12 May. To give an example, it is proposed that outcomes other than qualifications should attract an achievement element of funding, and that no explicit outcomes will be required where appropriate. In the light of those assurances, I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This short but useful debate has cast some light on the meaning of the clause and has drawn further assurances from the Under-Secretary. I accept what he said about the educational reasons for not approving courses under clause 88. That underlined the point that I made earlier about how a course could be educationally sound for people aged over 19 but not for those under it. The Under-Secretary said that the reason for making such a distinction would principally be on grounds of age and maturity, suggesting that those under 19 would not be mature enough to undertake such courses. Clause 90(3) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Approval may be given generally or in relation to particular cases.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I imagine that the Government propose to use that provision to limit approval by age.
<P>
We have also had a useful plea in favour of flexibility and speed in assessing qualifications. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry made a good point about prison education, in which I too have been interested from time to time. In another place, similar sentiments were expressed in support of a different amendment moved by Baroness Sharp. The Under-Secretary has recognised the value of courses that do not necessarily lead to qualifications. In examples such as prisons, those courses can be valuable, apt to the sort of person being dealt with, and a prerequisite for their going on to other sorts of training and education.
<P>
The debate has been useful, and I hope that the Minister will reflect further on the points that have been made. As we have obtained some useful assurances from him, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<H4><center>Persons over 19</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am curious about the reasoning behind the clause, which also deals with external qualifications, this time in relation to people over 19. The notes on clauses state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Clause 89 provides for the approval of qualifications for those aged 19 or over. To ensure that the . . . providers can exercise the discretion and make the wider range or provision more appropriate to adult learning, the scope of this measure does not extend to cover the programmes of study leading to external qualifications.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under the clause, therefore, people aged under 19 would be ruled out from publicly-funded courses that lead to non-approved external qualifications. That is the distinction to which I referred earlier. The Minister said that people under 19 were not mature enough for the sort of courses envisaged, and I understand that distinction.
<P>
However, although the clause provides for the public funding of courses leading to non-approved external qualifications, payments cannot be made in respect of fees or charges for the qualifications themselves. It struck me as curious that it is considered worthwhile publicly to fund courses, but not the fees or charges in respect of the qualification at the end of them. If someone has undertaken a publicly funded course, he should be supported in getting the external qualification.
<P>
Perhaps the Minister will tell me that that is a reflection of existing arrangements. However, on the face of it, I would have thought that it was worth encouraging people who have undertaken such a course to gain the external qualification at the end of it. The clause seems to put an obstacle in the way of that. A high proportion of such courses are taken by people over 19 in FE colleges, quite a large percentage of which stand altogether outside the national qualifications framework. I look for clarification from the Minister as to why the Government are taking that course.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chaytor </B>(Bury, North): I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but it is not a matter for great concern. It has for many years been common practice to make that distinction between the funding of courses and of qualifications. To draw an analogy with the remission of fees by FE establishments, eligible groups have for many years had remitted the fees for tuition costs in that sector, but not necessarily—indeed, in most cases not—the cost of taking the examination and obtaining the qualification under the course. Therefore, the measure is not exceptional.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Before I address the specific concern that I share with my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor), I wish to reassure the hon. Member for Hertsmere that there is no need for concern.
<P>
It may be useful to remind ourselves of the purpose of the clause. It provides, in the case of those aged 19 or over, that public funds for specified courses may not be used for the payment of registration or other fees associated with assessment, moderation, verification and accreditation of external qualifications unless those qualifications are approved. By limiting the scope of approval in that way, we intend to provide the LSC and the CETW with the greatest possible flexibility to determine the course provision that they will fund for adult learners. The clause should also ensure that only qualifications that require stringent criteria are approved for funding purposes. The clause confers a responsibility for compliance on the authorised bodies—on the LEA, the LSC, the CETW or any other body designated under the clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere may, umderstandably, have had a little difficulty comprehending the matter. The rationale behind it is simple, however: we want public funding to pay for approved qualifications only, and to ensure that public money does not support inappropriate qualifications. That should reassure him that, as always, we are being prudent in the use of public funds. I hope that the feels able to join us in agreeing that the clause should stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am not entirely clear about the Minister's rationale for the clause, because if it is not worth paying the fees and charges for obtaining the external qualifications, it may not be worth funding the course at all. The clause seems to allow courses to be publicly funded. However, I listened carefully to the explanation given by the hon. Member for Bury, North, who said that that is common practice. I had allowed for that in my earlier comments, but it struck me as strange none the less. However, if the provision is common practice and tried and tested, I do not want to throw a spanner in the works by pursuing the matter further. I accept the explanation on that basis, but would like to reflect carefully on the one given me by the Minister.

<P>

<P>
might be? I am sure that the Minister has something in mind that fits the Bill apart from the LSC and LEAs, but I do not know what it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I hope that I can provide enlightenment.
<P>
Clause 92 specifies the authorised public funding bodies to whose funding the qualifications approval requirements in clauses 88 and 89 apply. They are the LSC, the CETW and LEAs—the bodies that are expected to be responsible for funding the majority of qualifications approved under the Bill and on which clause 89 places a duty of compliance. The clause will enable the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales to add other bodies to the list. It is intended to ensure that clauses 88 and 89 can apply if other sources of public funding are used for the provision of secondary and further education in future.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am conscious of the fact that I bowled the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for North Swindon, a rather fast ball on clause 92, possibly to equally as good an effect as the England attack that is disposing of Zimbabwe even as we speak. I shall bowl another in hope.
<P>
The opaque provisions of the clause relate to enforcement in England—or, in the case of clause 94, in Wales. They refer to several public bodies, including LEAs, specified bodies and governing bodies. As I understand the explanatory notes, which are not at their most pellucid at this point either, clause 400 of the Education Act 1996, but not clause 401, has been in force for some time. Has enforcement action ever been taken against an LEA or other specified or governing body, and if so, in what circumstances? Why are the powers necessary? I am not saying that they are not needed, but they seem slightly awesome, and we should not let them pass without remark.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am disappointed that the hon. Member for Daventry does not think that I dispatched his earlier delivery to the boundary. I hope that I shall do rather better with this question. The short answer is no, but I shall add a few words to illuminate a clause that the hon. Gentleman finds opaque.
<P>
The clause is intended to ensure that LEAs, any other specified bodies and, in the case of maintained schools, governing bodies that have failed in their duties of compliance under clauses 88 and 89 can be directed to comply by the Secretary of State. Under clause 25, the Secretary of State has direction-making powers in respect of the LSC, which has duties of compliance under clauses 88(2)(a) and 89(2).
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> If I may, I shall pursue that chain of thought for a moment. People who are directed by the Secretary of State may occasionally react in the vulgar and arguably even healthy manner of telling him to push off. A school governing body or an LEA, for example, might say ``shan't''. I construed the Under-Secretary's earlier remarks as suggesting that that has never happened. However, a body might, for example, say that it will fund courses that are not approved under the Bill and that it must receive the funding to do so. In other words, it could collapse out of the system. Will such organisations have a duty to provide qualifying courses as well as not to solicit funding for courses that result in a qualification that is not approved?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his assistance in pursuing the matter. I cannot envisage circumstances in which anyone would react in that way, and certainly not to the current Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman is piling hypothesis on hypothesis, but I hope to shed more light on the matter.
<P>
In the unlikely circumstances described by the hon. Gentleman, the LEA could be taken to court and ordered to carry out its statutory duty. I am sure that we all agree that such circumstances are extremely unlikely, but they could arise.

<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 221, in page 43, line 2, leave out `setting or administration'.
<P>
The amendment concerns the arrangements that apply in England and Wales in connection with the division of powers between qualification bodies or regulators and awarding bodies. Our colleagues in Scotland do things differently because, under Scottish legislation the two functions are integrated. In England and Wales, however, we have maintained a separation of powers. In England, about which I cast most of my remarks, the well-led Qualifications and Curriculum Authority exercises the function of a regulator; alongside it are various awarding bodies. I shall leave aside for the moment vocational qualifications and concentrate on the more educational end of the spectrum of qualifications: the Oxford, Cambridge and RSA examinations whose representations occasioned the amendment, the AQA and EDEXCEL. The national open college network also functions as an awarding body.
<P>
The bodies all operate under the QCA. There are codes of practice, for example, for A-levels and the system is regulated on that basis. Given the size of England, it is a sensible way in which to conduct our affairs. Since the days when I was involved in the Department, and with my having, in the early days, given a glimmer of encouragement to such a move, I am glad that there has been some coalescence among awarding bodies, including a bringing together of academic and general education with more vocational activities. We now have a reasonable arrangement with a single regulatory body and a small, but significant, number of awarding bodies. I mention in passing the vocational sphere in relation to NVQs, where the pattern is more fragmented, although that is not the main thrust of the clause.
<P>
It is interesting that the amendment commands bipartisan support. I am grateful to the hon. Members for Harrogate and Knaresborough and for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) for supporting it. Our proposal probes methods of delivery. In representations to us, the OCR has expressed concern that the QCA will take over its function. In a letter to me, its head of policy, Dr. McLone stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is clearly unacceptable that a regulator can also be an operator in the very sector it is regulating and I ask that you give serious consideration to ensuring that Clause 95 is suitably amended.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that Ministers will give that matter serious consideration. I do not anticipate that creating some sort of fusion between those two rather separate activities is on their agenda—certainly not by means of this clause.
<P>
I sought clarification in the explanatory notes. It is clear that the clause is to some extent designed to clarify the existing procedure, with particular reference to tests aimed at those over compulsory school age. The explanatory notes set the clause in the context of the valuable Moser report on improving literacy and numeracy skills, which suggests that the QCA might develop and administer the new national literacy and numeracy tests. As I am enthusiastic about adult basic skills issues, I would not for a moment suggest that it is inappropriate to develop those national tests.
<P>
However, the Committee must pause to consider whether tests should be of a uniform structure throughout the country and set by the same authority. If so, should that authority be the regulatory authority, rather than the awarding bodies? The amendment would confine the role of the regulatory authority—the QCA—to the development of such tests. By inference, the setting and administration of the tests would then be in the hands of any awarding body that decided to apply to carry out the tests.
<P>
I could even imagine an arrangement between the parties to suggest that there should be a single national test, such as one paper or series of papers, to achieve the qualification, but that the various awarding bodies could administer it. Persons who use the services of awarding bodies—which are of course private organisations or consortia— would choose according to where they thought that they would receive the best service or where they had had a good experience or follow up in the past. It is unnecessary to centralise or nationalise the procedure to have a national test or even an identical test administered by various awarding bodies, assuming that the marking schemes and other factors are consistent.
<P>
If Ministers believe that that sort of monolithic structure is necessary to deliver, for example, a national test in adult literacy, they should say so and explain why. Awarding bodies have made representations to us stating their concern that, if that is the Ministers' objective—if it is, I am assuming that it is confined to adult literacy or national tests of that type—they should not, by a side wind, create conditions in which the regulatory body takes over or subverts the functions of the awarding bodies in relation to everything else, such as GCSE, A-level, GNVQ and so on. I do not imagine that that is what Ministers intend, but if so, we are against it. The purpose of the amendment is to probe Ministers' thoughts on the matter and to obtain some pretty firm assurances, because the awarding bodies are clearly exercised by it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I rise briefly to support the amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Hallam and I were also pleased to support the representations from the operators. I hope that the Government will accept the amendment, because it seems an eminently sensible way of clarifying the situation. One of the great strengths of the British education system is the confidence that people have in the qualifications. We sometimes underestimate how positive that is, not only in the United Kingdom, but throughout the world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his support and his courtesy in giving way so early. I want to reinforce his point about confidence by pointing out that EDEXCEL recently engaged the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, to consider judiciously the way in which it conducted its tests. He gave it a high mark, if not 100 per cent., for the fairness with which the process was conducted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that issue. He will know that little of our media covered that report. Every year, whenever GCSE, A-„level or GNVQ results improve, some members of the press say that exams are becoming easier and that operators or the Government are fiddling the system. I would not accuse the Government of doing that—on this occasion. [Laughter.]
<P>
I make a serious point about confidence in qualifications. Once we start to undermine confidence in the awarding bodies, the system starts to unravel. My party and I would be unhappy if the Government regarded a closer relationship between the regulatory and operating systems as a way forward. The previous Government began to privatise many of our state functions, but saw fit to place regulatory bodies such as the Office of the Rail Regulator, the Office of Telecommunications and the Office of Water Services alongside to ensure confidence in them. I was going to mention the Office for Standards in Education, but Ofsted is a classic example of a regulatory system that has become close to the operating system and in which confidence started to unravel. The previous Government and the current one have recognised the need for good regulation alongside operation.
<P>
I do not want to repeat the comments made by the hon. Member for Daventry. He said that we do not want a fusion of the two systems, but we are starting to see a little of that. The SATs system in our schools is entirely operated by one organisation—in effect, the Government—which sets, marks and regulates the tests. We now have tests at key stages 1, 2 and 3, so it would not be a quantum leap to suggest them at key stage 4. That would take out a raft of external qualifications at GCSE level. Some people have argued for that, based on the seamless progression of SATs throughout most of the maintained and statutory sector.
<P>
I am sad that the Bill does not tackle: the problem of the qualifications structure, although I am sure that the Government will have to deal with it. Under the previous Government, Lord Dearing carried out a major review. The hon. Member for Daventry was a Minister at the time, so he may know why the Government chickened out at the last moment. Despite having greater clarification, especially on GNVQs and NVQs, there is still a division between the academic gold standard of A-level and the vocational gold standard of advanced GNVQ.
<P>
There is concern that we are moving slowly but inextricably towards a system whereby operation and regulation come together. That would be regarded by the Government cost-effective, because the cost of separate examination boards et al is expensive to the public purse, which funds most of those requirements. We support the amendment. We hope that the Under-Secretary will support its sense, and that he will reassure us that that the Government do not have it in mind to merge the operating and regulatory systems. The operating companies, which have served our examination and qualification system brilliantly over many years, are concerned that their businesses are threatened by the clause. For their sake, the Minister should make absolutely clear what is in the Government's mind, not just for the immediate future but for the long term.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I start by thanking the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough for his tribute to the Government's success in driving up standards. He may not have intended to make that the centrepoint of his contribution, but I was certainly grateful for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> If it makes the Minister happy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Indeed, it does make me happy. Our success also makes parents in this country happy.
<P>
We are aware of, and recognise, the concerns that have been outlined this afternoon by the hon. Members for Daventry and for Harrogate and Knaresborough. However, the amendment will remove an important safeguard, which is why we must resist it. I hope that I can offer some reassurance in relation to the concerns expressed.
<P>
The tests for pupils of compulsory school age, which are conducted by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority in England and Awdurdod Cymwysterau Cwricwlwm ac Asesu Cymru in Wales, are central to our efforts to improve school standards and raise pupil achievement. As hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have recognised, there are similar challenges in relation to older people, whether in full-time post-compulsory education or in a wider community setting. Sir Claus Moser's report, ``A Fresh Start'', published in February last year, graphically drew attention to poor literacy and numeracy among broad sections of the adult population. It was found that one in five adults is functionally illiterate, which is terrible. We must act decisively to put that right. A proposal for national literacy and numeracy tests for adults was central to Sir Claus Moser's recommendations, and has received wide-ranging support.
<P>
In implementing that recommendation, we would prefer such tests—and those in other vital skills such as information and communication technologies—to be conducted on the basis of collaboration between the QCA and the awarding bodies. I am pleased to report that that is in prospect. However, clause 95 must also provide for the possibility, albeit unlikely, that we would need to ask the QCA alone to set papers for the tests and to make arrangements for adult learners to sit them. Amendment No. 221 would remove that safeguard, which it would be prudent to retain. That is why we must resist the amendment.
<P>
Other important concerns have been expressed. I can offer assurances in relation to hon. Members' anxieties about the powers of the QCA and the ACCAC under the clause. Those powers are positive. Clause 95 does not give free licence to the regulatory bodies: section 24 of the Education Act 1997, to which clause 95 proposes a new subsection, states that the QCA may only make arrangements for tests or tasks that fall within a ``prescribed'' description. Section 56 of the Act clarifies that ``prescribed'' means prescribed in regulations made by the Secretary of State. I recognise the concern that the QCA will act as its own awarding body, but I can state categorically that it will not.
<P>
Concern was also expressed about potential conflict if the QCA administers and assures the quality of new tests. However, I do not believe that there are grounds for concern about such a conflict of interest in the QCA or the ACCA. The national curriculum tests administered by those bodies happily co-exist with qualifications offered by awarding bodies for pupils of compulsory school age. If it proved necessary, we would ask another statutory body to review the administration of tests for adults, just as we asked Ofsted to review the administration of the national curriculum assessment tests in 1999.
<P>
In the light of that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister sought to be conciliatory and he satisfied the Committee at least that there was no hidden agenda of destroying the concordat between the regulatory body and the awarding bodies. He made it as clear as he could that the regulatory body's powers were last resort powers to be used in the absence of agreement on carrying out the tests.
<P>
It would be wise for interested parties to study the record of our deliberations, rather than press the issue now. I hope that the Minister mollified those people to some extent, but we reserve the right to return to the matter, if they remain dissatisfied. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 333, in page 43, line 29, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(e) conditions for the liquidation of accounts in the event of the death of a holder or his anticipated inability to complete any future course of study'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As we approach the anticipated conclusion of this afternoon's proceedings, I realise that one piece of homework that I have so far failed to do is a detailed study of the draft regulations, available in the Library, on qualifying accounts for individual learning accounts. The amendment's purpose is to sound out the Government's views on the status of such accounts by prescribing for circumstances in which they might naturally end and be divestible. For example, if somebody became severely incapacitated and could not complete a future course of study, an account might no longer be appropriate.
<P>
In earlier exchanges, the Minister helpfully explained and gave us news about the arrangements for appointing a national contractor to run the system and take over from the TECs. That is welcome, and perhaps he can again update the Committee on developments.
<P>
The amendment probes for more information on the accounts, but let us start by logically examining the different education levels. Individuals under school-leaving age are obliged to attend school, and payment is out of the question. People aged between 16 and 19 are entitled to free full-time education or study. The individual learning accounts arrive further down the line and will typically be used by people over 19, who may draw sums to pay fees required for learning. Those people are not entitled to free fees, but under the national regulations they will have a right to obtain funds with which to pay the fees. Is the Minister saying that entitlements will be offset or that the Learning and Skills Council, on behalf of the council, will pay a student's fees up to a certain level each year?
<P>
An alternative would be a benefit, rather like a social security benefit, whereby the student receives an amount in cash, albeit in a tied account, or by means of a bank transfer, with which the fee can be paid. In other words, the student could draw the cash and spend it as if it were his own, but that would be conditional on the course of study and recoverable if it was not completed. That is where the amendment kicks in; the inference is that when the entitlement has been decided, and granted in the form of cash, it will be necessary to decide how to dispose of the asset if an individual cannot make use of it because of death, incapacity or another reason. No doubt the Secretary of State could sue for the return of the asset, but if it were merely a less intense entitlement, he might say, using my terminology, ``We are not going to give you the benefit because you can't avail yourself of it,'' or, ``You no longer have the entitlement to claim it.'' That might be all that happens.
<P>
I am seeking, by the slightly oblique route of the amendment, to get the Minister to explain the matter. It would help us a lot if we had a clearer picture of what is happening now, of the legal status of the bank accounts and of what arrangements will be made to ensure that they are properly accounted for and wound up if the students can no longer make use of them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I want to ask the Minister what is the Government's long-term thinking on individual learning accounts, because to judge from the note in the Library, it seems that the Government have only a limited view of their use. I am therefore grateful to the hon. Member for Daventry for tabling the amendment. Liberal Democrats support the principle of individual learning accounts, which give students responsibility for spending the money.
<P>
With your indulgence, Mr. Benton, I shall digress: the Government should have learned their lesson when the idea took hold that the 75p per week increase in pensions was all that the elderly would get. I should not be saying this, but the Government actually gave pensioners £2 extra because of the fuel allowance, but that was not how it was perceived, because the money did not go into their pockets. Certain groups of the population are treated as being incapable of spending their own money; there is a feeling that students cannot be trusted to take decision, and that is particularly insulting to mature students.
<P>
Individual learning accounts should have three major elements: what could be called a virtual account because the money that goes into it can be spent only if it is drawn for a purpose stated by the Government. That is an important point of principle, and in that case—
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I shall finish my argument and then give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The virtual account could be used for funding—my party would fund up to level 4 tuition fees as part of an entitlement. The Government have different views but there is a difference of political opinion on how to spend money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) first. I want to tease out from the Minister where we go from here; if I explain what I am doing the hon. Gentleman can intervene and shoot me down.
<P>
<B>Dr. Phyllis Starkey </B>(Milton Keynes, South-West): Send in an exocet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Exocets are great.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
What will happen to the virtual account element of the individual learning account? The derisory sums available at present will not be attractive to most students. The evidence is that only about £70 million to £75 million in real terms has been taken out.
<P>
In respect of the savings account, the Government want employers to put money into individual learning accounts and then receive tax relief, or some other benefit, for doing so. There is no reason why individuals and their families should not save money in individual learning accounts, which could start from birth.
<P>
Has the Minister considered a third element: the individual learning account as a borrowing account? Student loan companies and other organisations lend students money; the Government extended the facility to part-time students in the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998, although it is not universally available at present. Have the Government considered expanding the borrowing element of the individual learning account to give young people and adults a major entitlement to education and training?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman cited the similarity between the Government's handling of pensions and their handling of the individual learning account. The 75p per week increase in pension can be spent on whatever the pensioner wants, but the winter fuel allowance, although that is what it is called, is a tax-free allowance, which can be spent on whatever the recipient wants; it does not have to be spent on winter fuels. It is not tied to expenditure on a specific item, unlike the individual learning account, which is earmarked for learning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I do not want to rerun the pensions debate; if the hon. Gentleman cannot imagine the answer if pensioners are told that they do not need to spend £150 on fuel, his constituents must be very different from mine. I will not be drawn into such a discussion now. We must trust people to spend their own money. Liberal Democrats would like students to be given a greater overall entitlement—
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> Marketing, and clarifying the use of individual learning accounts is very important. One way forward would be to get them endorsed by Lord Mackay of Clashfern, which might increase the take-up.
<P>
Will the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough clarify his party's policy on entitlement? At the start of the Committee proceedings, his hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) distinctly said that Liberal Democrat policy was to establish an entitlement for over 19-year-old students to courses at level 3. By the end of the debate, that entitlement had been reduced to courses at level 2 and now, several weeks later, the entitlement has been increased to courses at level 4. If the hon. Gentleman is going to make a critique of our development of individual learning accounts, his party's policy should be consistent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to spend the next hour or so on Liberal Democrat education policy. We accept entirely the Government's view that there ought to be—and we would support—a lifetime guarantee of people's entitlement to tuition for level 2 qualifications There is not an iota of difference between us about that. We should like to see during the next Session emphasis on level 3 and an entitlement for 18 to 24-year-olds. We have made that clear, and have tabled amendments to that effect. We also made it clear during the previous Parliament—and when the Government disgracefully introduced tuition fees for students on 25 July 1997 in response to the Dearing report, before it had even been considered—that we oppose root and branch the idea of students having to pay tuition fees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> That does not explain the point at all. The hon. Gentleman has merely reinforced our suspicion that he does not have a clue about his party's policy on entitlement because he has enunciated three different policies in the space of one Standing Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee that we are not here to discuss the Liberal Democrat party's policy. We are dealing with an important amendment to the Bill. Perhaps we can return to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To assist the Committee, and without in any sense trespassing on the private grief between the hon. Members for Bury and for Harrogate and Knaresborough, whose exchanges I greatly enjoyed, I thought that it might help if I said that I am not insensitive to the wider issues. Perhaps I am a cautious individual, so I will register no definitive policy rather than three definitive policies at this stage. Instead I will share with the Committee the experience that I had on the birth of my oldest child in 1971 when one of the local banks offered not only a free money pig but a 50p inducement to open an account. As Granny thoughtfully provided a substantial, although not, I hasten to say, inordinately large, cheque, for the infant, it was banked, so she had a bank account, a pig and 50p extra within two hours of her being declared part of this world. That is a lesson to be borne in mind. There are lots of attractions in levering in. So that the Minister can respond, I simply give notice that these are precisely the issues that we should look at in future. In that spirit, I will not move my amendment to the following clause. That will allow us to make progress, and facilitate the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> It is nice to have an opportunity to join in on an interesting discussion on a range of issues, including, occasionally, individual learning accounts. You would rule me out of order, Mr. Benton, if I sought to pursue the discussion about social security and pensions, so I will not. If I did, I would have to remind colleagues that the first Liberal pension was worth only five shillings—and what can one buy with five bob? Obviously, I do not mean that too seriously, but we could discuss it if we wanted to.
<P>
I am in some difficulty because some later Government amendments will allow us to discuss some of the more general issues, and there is always the clause stand part debates. Although I am always tempted to enter into discussion with the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough on wider issues, I will not do so now —save to say that I thought he was uncharacteristically unfair about the learning account. We are offering an account holder a contribution of £150. The hon. Gentleman may consider that that is a small sum but, given the costs of many courses, it is not an insubstantial amount. I am advised, for example that an A-level or equivalent course could cost a student £80 per annum. Obviously, costs will vary. An IT-related qualification may cost between £80 and £150, depending on the qualification level. Such amounts are already heavily subsidised through overall funding. For many people, an inducement of £150 is not an insubstantial sum. I understand why the hon. Member for Daventry tabled the amendment. We do not believe that it is necessary, but it has enabled me to explain our intentions.
<P>
We do not intend to adopt a special savings account for learning accounts. We have talked extensively to financial institutions and consumers and have decided that there is no need for a dedicated bank account facility at this stage. Learning accounts will be like a membership scheme and will entitle people to claim a range of incentives to help to pay for their learning. I share the ambition of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and hope that we shall see many more such developments in the future. Learning accounts will give entitlements.
<P>
Although we are keeping clause 96 to ensure flexibility for the future development of such a key policy, a person's registration as an account holder under the new qualifying arrangements clause will enable him to claim the incentives. Individual learning accounts will be ``virtual'' accounts and the incentives will be paid as discounts on the cost of learning when the scheme is in operation. They will be made available through the learning provider. Individuals will decide how to pay the balance of the cost and will pay it directly to the course provider.
<P>
There will not, therefore, be any money sitting in an individual learning account. The contributions of individuals to learning will stay in their hands, in whatever account or other money management scheme they decide to use for their personal affairs. That will also be the case if we set in place a dedicated financial account. Individual savings for learning will be ring-fenced and the Government will not have access to them. If the holder died, the money in the account would form part of his or her estate.
<P>
Under our proposals, if an individual learning account is closed for any reason, there will remain only unclaimed potential Government incentives. We can explore such policy under subsequent amendments and, given that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In the light of the Under-Secretary's assurances and in anticipation of further discussions, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 43, line 39, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) The power to make regulations under this section is to be exercised by the Scottish Ministers so far as those regulations are to have effect in or as regards Scotland.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 36 and 37.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The savings account model for individual learning accounts or qualifying accounts to which clause 96 refers relates to financial services, which is a reserved matter under the Scotland Act 1998. The amendments will be of constitutional interest to those who follow such matters carefully. Consequently, responsibility for introducing such regulation-making powers throughout the United Kingdom rests with us in Westminster. Unlike the other provisions in the Bill on individual learning accounts, all of which deal with devolved matters and for which Scottish Ministers have already introduced their own separate Bill, clause 96 extends to Scotland.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Executive will make their own regulations, not least because they will relate closely to other provisions that are automatically devolved and because the Scottish Executive are best placed to ensure that the overall individual learning account package suits the needs of the people of Scotland. The normal procedure for devolving powers in those circumstances would be through the mechanism of an executive devolution order, made under section 63 of the Scotland Act 1998, after the Bill is, as we hope, enacted. To speed up the legislative and therefore the implementation process in Scotland such that it can keep pace with implementation of the national framework for learning accounts across the United Kingdom, we propose through amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 37 to devolve powers to Scottish Ministers directly through the Bill.
<P>
As I said, this is a slightly unusual situation. We believe that this is the first time that such provision has been sought in a Westminster Bill. We are convinced that the approach will allow for simplicity and transparency in policy decisions relating to individual learning accounts. It will allow Scottish Ministers to operate learning accounts as they think necessary to benefit the people of Scotland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Extremely briefly, we do not object to the constitutional innovation in itself but, given the disparity between the student support arrangements in Scotland and England, will the Minister assure me that he will in broad terms, and allowing for the different legal systems and concepts applicable to such arrangements in Scotland, seek to align the systems wherever broadly possible—although I respect the authority of Scottish Ministers to make specific decisions about their situation?
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>

<H4><center>Clause 97</center></H4>
<H4><center>Holders of accounts: grants</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 291, in page 43, line 43, leave out from `regulations' to first `may' in line 1 on page 44 and insert:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`must provide that grants may be paid only to or in respect of individuals—
<P>
(a) who hold accounts which qualify under section 96,
<P>

<P>
(c) who hold such accounts and are parties to such arrangements.
<P>
(2A) The regulations'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following:
<P>
Government amendment No. 292— 
<P>
Government new clause 16—Qualifying arrangements.
<P>
Government new clause 17—Qualifying arrangements further provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The main purpose of amendments Nos. 291 and 292 and of new clauses 16 and 17 is to insert provisions that refer to qualifying arrangements in respect of individual learning accounts. New clause 16 makes provision for what the Bill refers to as qualifying arrangements and new clause 17 deals with the Secretary of State's powers. Without the first clause on qualifying arrangements, an individual would have to hold a special savings account to qualify as a learning account holder and claim support for learning through the discounts conferred in clause 97.
<P>
New clause 16 allows us to set the purely administrative conditions for people to qualify. In practice, that means that by registering with a central customer services provider as an account holder, individuals will be able to claim learning account incentives. How they choose to pay for their element of the learning cost is left to them. That alternative model was developed following the extensive market research that we carried out last year. The model will work as a membership scheme, offering account holders access to discounts on learning and information on the various courses available. That approach will form the basis for the initial national implementation of individual learning accounts, while keeping open the option of developing a dedicated financial account model for the future.
<P>
The new clause will also ensure that people cannot simultaneously hold an individual learning account in more than one UK country. That will enable us to control the distribution of the incentives linked to learning accounts.
<P>
New clause 17 gives the Secretary of State the power to enter into arrangements with a body that provides individual learning accounts, taking the form of qualifying arrangements, which I will refer to as the customer service provider. The CSP will provide administrative support for the national framework—operating caller information service, registering new account holders and handling the payment of the incentives with learning providers. The new clause will also enable the Secretary of State to make payments to the CSP to pay for its service. With the evolving nature of the policy, we also now envisage a more strategic role for the Learning and Skills Council in relation to individual learning accounts. The Clause will enable other bodies to be designated by the Secretary of State to manage the contract with the CSP, and we envisage that the LSC will be designated to take on that role in addition to its marketing and promotional activities. However, we do not envisage the LSC taking it on before April 2002.
<P>
The other amendments, Nos. 291 and 292, are consequential on the introduction of the new ``qualifying arrangements'' clause. They are minor amendments, which will allow grants to be paid to people who register as account holders with the CSP. They will also allow for the future possibility of people holding savings accounts for learning, as well as being registered under the qualifying arrangements. The amendments will ensure that learning accounts are offered in as simple and direct a way as possible, through a central customer services provider with which the Secretary of State or, in time, the LSC on his behalf, can contract. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Boswell:</B> As the Minister has helpfully explained, individual savings accounts will not be involved at this stage, so the relationship will not be governed by banking law. That may well be sensible in the initial stages of the scheme. 
<P>
Can the Minister tell the Committee more about the arrangements for dispute resolution—with a CSP, for example? There could be two difficulties. First, there could be an argument relating to entitlement, about whether someone had registered or produced the right criteria; the CSP might refuse to register someone because it felt that the criteria were inadequate. Secondly, there could be a dispute over whether the CSP should have paid an entitlement to an education provider if the money should have been drawn down on behalf of an individual but was not. Another difficulty could arise if an institution holds back a qualification because of unpaid fees. I hope that those situations will not arise frequently, but it is important to know whether the CSP alone, the civil law or the Secretary of State will be required to adjudicate disputes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> On the important question of dispute resolution, we envisage setting up the accounts in such a way as to make disputes unusual occurrences. We cannot, of course, foresee exactly how the accounts will develop in future, so I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. We envisage an independent complaints service operated by my Department; I assure the hon. Gentleman that independence will be a strong feature of it.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 299, in page 44, line 38, leave out subsection (7).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government new clause 20—Part V: Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> In the Bill, we have generally tried to make a distinction between English and Welsh provisions. Parts I and III are wholly devoted to England, as they are about the LSC and the inspectorate. Parts II and IV are wholly devoted to Wales, as they are about the Welsh inspections and council. Even within the miscellaneous part V, which we are now discussing, we have tried to make it clear which functions are exercised in respect of England and which in respect of Wales. It has been much more difhcult to determine in part V when provisions apply equally to England and Wales, because we generally want to amend existing legislation. The new clause tries to solve that problem. When the joint English and Welsh provisions in part V confer a function on the Secretary of State, whether it be a new function or a change to an existing function, the new clause will provide that such references can also be understood as conferring a function on the National Assembly for Wales if the provisions can be exercised in Wales.
<P>
The new clause also solves the problem of the interpretation of the Bill's effects on legislation, which have already been the subject of a transfer of functions order under section 22 of the Government of Wales Act 1998. It makes it clear that, when a subject is conferred by amendments to existing legislation covered by a transfer of functions order, we should regard that order as transferring the functions provided for in the Bill.
<P>
Proposed new clause 20(4) makes four exceptions. Clause 85 deals with the Secretary of State's powers to make schemes dealing with the transfer of assets from the FEFC. We do not want a similar reference to confer a function on the Assembly. Clause 96 deals with financial services in the context of individual learning accounts, which have not been devolved to the Assembly. Clause 122 deals with commencement provisions, which we shall return to with amendments on Report. The amendment to the Education (Fees and Awards) Act 1983, again, is not a devolved matter.
<P>
Amendment No. 229 tidies up the Bill in the light of the new clause, and I hope that hon. Members will accept it with the intention of ensuring that the provisions in part V apply equally to England and Wales.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We have had a useful discussion about individual learning accounts. The amendments have enabled me to give the Committee more information about our intentions. There may be some disagreement, but we all see the potential of the accounts, and we might predict that in 10 years' time they will be seen to have been a major development. We hope that we will soon have 1 million account holders, and I am proud to say that more than 117,000 people have already used individual learning accounts to change their careers and improve their lives.
<P>
I would like to end on a personal note by mentioning the example of a Salvation Army resettlement worker, who, with the help of her individual learning account, has embarked on part-time study towards a level 3 counselling diploma. That will help her realise her long-held aspiration to be a professional counsellor. Like me, she feels that the accounts provide a great incentive to learn. We mention figures such as a million here and 100,000 there, but that is one example of the policy serving the public, and I hope that there will be many more of them in years to come.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sure that the Under-Secretary and the Committee will appreciate that, if we occasionally niggle over the details and exercise our duty to ask awkward technical questions or table complex probing amendments, it in no sense subverts our interests in the success of the proposals. Many of us are sympathetic towards that useful initiative, which has been some time in the making. As the Welsh Minister said, there will be scope for lateral thinking and, perhaps, some expansion over the years. The initiative should be neither oversold nor under-recorded, but it is highly desirable that we should give people more say in their learning. There is an analogy between our debate and the discussion about care that is taking place in the Chamber: people should be able to produce their own learning packages, just as they can produce their own care packages.
