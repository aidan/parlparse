<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call the Minister to move Amendment No. 33-I am sorry, amendment No. 589.

<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 589, in page 31, line 3, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6A) The Authority shall give the Secretary of State not less than 28 days' notice of any proposal to impose a modification condition.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(6B) If, before the expiry of the time specified in a notice under subsection (6A), the Secretary of State directs the Authority not to impose the condition, the Authority shall comply with the direction.'.

<P>
Given that the House adjourned at 10 minutes to 3 this morning, I could well read this as amendment No. 33.

<P>
The amendment provides a mechanism whereby the Secretary of State may veto a proposal by the authority to impose a modification condition on a licence that is to be transferred. The reason is that, as he or she will have created the standard licence conditions in the first place, he or she will have a responsibility, as with other condition modifications, to ensure that amendments made by the authority do not undermine the basis on which the conditions were approved by Parliament.

<P>
There is a similar provision in the equivalent gas clause-clause 65-but it was overlooked in drafting clause 33.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Clause 33 introduces a procedure enabling a licence to be transferred, in whole or in part, to another person, subject to the authority's approval. The amendment gives the Secretary of State a power to prevent such a modification. As the Minister said, that brings the provision into line with the Gas Act 1986.

<P>
The Opposition do not oppose the amendment. The transfer of licences from one company to another is essential in a dynamic market. In the years ahead, there will be consolidation and changes of ownership, as well as new entrants into the market. As long as there is no abuse of the dominant market position, the Government should do all that they can to ease such movements and transfers. The Competition Act 1998 will deal with any problems of abuse of a dominant position. Competition keeps management on its toes and is the lever that introduces new techniques and practices, which provide greater consumer choice and more opportunities as well as more efficient processes and lower prices.

<P>
I note that this is another of the many amendments that the Government have tabled in order to deal with bad drafting. There have already been up to 216 Government amendments, but there will be more to come.

<P>
Amendment Agreed to.

<P>
Clause 33, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 65</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer of gas licences</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 590, in page 64, line 18, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, except in the case of a generation license,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment removes an erroneous reference to the generation licence that crept into the clause. Generation licences are not applicable to the gas sector. The amendment makes the electricity and gas clauses on licence transfer identical.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Clause 65, as amended, ordered to stand part of the clause.

<H4><center>Reasons for decisions under the 1989 Act</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 601 in page 31, line 37, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) the granting of a licence;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may consider the following amendments: No. 507, in page 32, line 6, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, or any other decision which materially affects the interests of consumers.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 600, in clause 67, page 67, line 12, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) the granting of a licence;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 553, in page 67, line 27, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``( ) any other decision which materially affects the interests of consumers''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Clause 34 ensures that the regulatory authority and the Secretary of State give reasons for, and publish, their decisions. The decisions to which the clause refers are the granting of an exemption, the revocation of a licence, the modification of the conditions of a licence, the giving of directions and the determination of questions and disputes in the making of a final order. However, there is no reference to the granting of licences in that respect.

<P>
Section 38A of the Gas Act 1995, which amends the Gas Act 1986, requires reasons to be given. It is to be replaced, under clause 67, with new section 38A. The original section implies that as well as enabling the licence holder to make representations-which clauses 34 and 67 do not-it applies to the granting of licences. Section 38A(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This subsection confers power to provide that, where the Director makes a specified decision in relation to a licence holder, the Director shall as soon as practicable give to the licence holder a written notice explaining why it appeared to him to be appropriate to make the decision.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (7) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In this section-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``decision'' means any decsion under this Part.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That includes the granting of licence. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>references to a licence holder include references to an applicant for a licence fee.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The 1986 Act thus requires the reasons to be given not only for modifications to licences, but for the granting of, or failure to grant, the licence. Will the Minister tell the Committee whether that is a correct reading of the legislation? If so, why have decisions on the granting of licences been removed? Why does the 1986 Act refer to representations by licence holders, but the Bill does not?

<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): I should like to speak to amendment No. 507.

<P>
The list of categories of decisions that are to be published is doubtless intended to be comprehensive. We have just heard about one possible omission, and have yet to hear the Minister's reponse to that. There may be other unforeseen omissions, which necessarily will not become evident until the Bill has been enacted and is in operation. The clause should therefore include a catch-all provision that enables the publication of decisions that could not have been anticipated at the drafting stage, as suggested in the amendment that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) tabled.

<P>
Given that the Government have consistently said that consumers take priority, they should welcome the amendment. It would grant the Secretary of State and the authority the duty to publish information relating to the interests of consumers where they are affected and those interests are not covered by the specific categories in the clause.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Amendments Nos. 600 and 601 would require the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority to give reasons for each of its decisions to grant a licence. To some extent, I can understand why the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) should want those decisions to be included in the list of key decisions in clauses 34 and 67, because the granting of licences will be one of GEMA's most important functions. I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no sinister motive for omitting them from the list. In competitive activities such as the supply of gas and electricity, there is, in effect, a presumption in favour of granting licences without discrimination to all applicants who satisfy the relevant conditions. Consequently, the only reason that can be given for granting a licence is that the applicant fulfils all such conditions. However, much is obvious from the fact of granting a licence, so there is nothing to be gained from a statutory requirement for GEMA to give reasons for such a decision.

<P>
The only licences to which the presumption might not apply relate to activities such as electricity transmission, where there are issues of geographical exclusivity. In such cases, the granting of a new licence encroaches on the authorised area of an existing licence holder. That is why, in such cases, provisions dealing with the granting of new licences enable an extensive consultation procedure, including the requirement that GEMA gives reasons why it proposes to grant such licences. It seems unnecessary to duplicate that requirement here. In the light of that explanation, I hope that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
I turn to amendments Nos. 507 and 553. Clauses 34 and 67 will require the authority to give reasons for regulatory decisions that involve the exercise of any decision-making powers included in a specific list. As the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) said, the amendments would broaden that provision by requiring the authority to explain any other decision that materially affects the interests of consumers.

<P>
The amendment raises difficulties that may not be obvious at first sight, and it may assist the Committee if I briefly explain how we reached our position. We wanted to address the regulators' key decisions, and the response to consultation document did exactly that. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government confirms that it intends to introduce a duty on the regulators to publish reasons for key decisions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The difficulty was in pinning down what was meant by a ``key'' decision. The most logical approach was to focus the test on the substantive effect of a regulatory decision.

<P>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Lewes would, in effect, define a key decision as one that materially affects consumers. However, an approach that relies on the effects of a decision would leave the authority uncertain as to what decisions are subject to the publication duty. As the hon. Gentleman will agree, too broad an interpretation of what is ``key'' or ``material'' could result in an unreasonable burden. It would generate a vast amount of information, much of which would be of little benefit to those affected by the decision.

<P>
Valuable information would lay bare the regulator's approach to substantive issues, but the danger is that it would be lost in the chaff of irrelevant information.

<P>

<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am following the Minister carefully and I understand why he is taking that line. If the amendment had included the word ``key'' between ``other'' and ``decision'', would he have been more sympathetic to it?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I think that the Bill already accommodates that, but I shall take my explanation a little further.

<P>
We have taken a form-based approach that ties to the exercise of specific decision-making powers the duty to publish reasons. Clearly, the hon. Member for Lewes is less enthusiastic than me about that approach, but it's great advantage is certainty and simplicity of application. Moreover, in practice, it will capture most key decisions decisions taken by the authority. In answer to a question raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, I have already explained why it is inappropriate to add to the list decisions to grant a licence. However, it is important to note that the decisions that we have identified are those that are taken with sufficient infrequency to avoid placing on the authority an unacceptable administrative burden.

<P>
To add a little further to the questions raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, the power to require reasons in section 38A of the Gas Act 1986 has not been used. We are replacing it with a clear duty to give reasons in respect of decisions specified in the Bill. The clauses set out the circumstances in which the authority will be required to publish reasons for decisions. It would always be open to the authority to provide reasons for decisions in circumstances that fall outside the list that we have drawn up.

<P>
I very much hope that, having heard the explanation of how we ended up with the proposals, Opposition Members will see the advantage of our approach, which has much to commend it. I urge the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that clear explanation, which confirms that my reading of the clause and of section 38A was correct. It still surprises me that this fresh approach contains no provision relating to a decision not to grant a licence, especially as the Minister has said that there will be a presumption that licences will be granted.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The applicant will of course be given reasons. However, as the hon. Gentleman has rightly said on numerous occasions in Committee, reasons for refusing an application could include very sensitive information. The applicant will have that information, and if he or she wished, for whatever reason, to challenge the decision, he or she could do so through a judicial challenge. The reasons would then become public.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that intervention. I am less concerned about the publication of the information-as the Committee will see from one of my later amendments-than about ensuring that people who go to the trouble of making a licence application will be given reasons if that application is turned down.

<P>
The Minister has assured the Committee that applicants will be given reasons in those circumstances. I am grateful for that, although it would have been better to incorporate the requirement into the Bill. However, his assurance is helpful and will be a useful record of the commitment by the Government and the regulator. In the light of that, I shall ask leave to withdraw the amendment after other hon. Members have had a chance to debate the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his lengthy and reasonable explanation of why the Government reject the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove and me.

<P>
I understand why the Minister has adopted that position, and it is a reasonable one. I hope that he will continue to stress that there are permissive powers to publish further information that falls outside the specified categories. I see that he is nodding. If that is so, much will depend on the ethos of the Secretary of State at the time and of the authority. It will be important that such an ethos favours the consumer, and that there will be a willingness to publish information that is regarded as being in consumers' interests. Provided that such an ethos will prevail, I am happy with the Minister's explanation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 608, in page 32, line 8, leave out from ``shall'' to ``considers'' in line 12 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`publish a notice stating the reasons for the decision in such manner as it or he'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 337, in page 32, line 9, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and, in the case of a decision under paragraph (c) or (d) of subsection (1), the notice shall include an analysis of the costs and benefits to the licence holder of the modification, direction or consent concerned.'.<P>

<P>
Government amendment No. 609.

<P>
Amendment No. 598, in page 32, line 24, leave out ``seriously and''.

<P>
Government amendment No. 610.

<P>
Amendment No. 338, in clause 67, page 67, line 30, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and, in the case of a decision under paragraph (c) or (d) of subsection (1), the notice shall include an analysis of the costs and benefits to the licence holder of the modification, direction or consent concerned.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Government amendment No. 611.

<P>
Amendment No. 599, in page 67, line 45, leave out ``seriously and''.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Clauses 34 and 67 oblige GEMA and the Secretary of State to publish notices setting out the reasons for key decisions. In addition to a requirement to publish such notices, the clauses require a copy of the notice to be sent to the licence holder at the centre of the decision-at least in cases that involve a licence holder.

<P>
Taken together, amendments Nos. 608 and 611 are intended to clarify two matters in relation to that process. First, they clarify which types of decision trigger the duty to send a copy of the notice to the relevant licence holder. That includes all the decisions in clauses 34 and 67, except those to grant exemptions which clearly do not relate to licence holders and the determination of disputes referred to GEMA under section 23 of the Electricity Act 1989 or section 27A of the Gas Act 1986. The requirement to send a copy of the notice to the licence holder need not apply because the procedures for determination of such disputes already ensure that, as a party to the dispute, the relevant licence holder will be notified of the reasons for the determination.

<P>
Secondly, the amendments have been designed to reduce the risk that the requirement to give reasons under clauses 34 and 67 might unintentionally affect any independent right that those who are directly affected by a decision might have to be notified of the decision and the reasons for it.

<P>
The primary purpose of clauses 34 and 67 is to improve the transparency of decision-making for all those with an interest in regulation. To the extent that those directly affected by a regulatory decision have an independent right to receive reasons for decisions-perhaps under the developing principles of administrative law-nothing in clauses 34 and 67 should be taken as detracting from that right. That might be important, for example, in relation to a decision for which the reasons contain a good deal of confidential information. Much of that confidential information might properly be excluded from the reasons given under clauses 34 and 67 because of the application of the ``serious and prejudicial'' test in clause 34(4). However, there would be no reason to exclude that confidential information from the reasons given to a party directly affected by a decision if that information was only confidential because it related to that party. It would be wrong, therefore, if clauses 34 and 67 were interpreted so as to prevent reasons containing such information from being given to such persons if they would otherwise have a right to receive it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Here we have four more Government drafting amendments. The Government have now drafted 2
<P>
<H5>16 amendments and I suspect that there will be between 350 and 400 by the time that the Bill leaves Committee, which is staggering.</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendments No. 337 and 338, tabled by the Opposition, would add to clause 34, which refers to electricity, and clause 67, which refers to gas, a requirement that the reasons to be given should include an analysis of the costs and benefits arising from multiplication of a licence condition or a direction given by the authority or the Secretary of State. That is vital discipline to impose on the regulatory authority. Both the Electricity Association and the Gas Forum are worried about regulatory instability that could arise from increased costs following revision to the regulatory framework.

<P>
The most significant cost to industry will not be confined to the new, larger buildings and increased staff of the regulatory authorities or consumer councils. It will not even be the extra bureaucracy with which the information-requesting powers will force the utilities to deal. The real cost will be the new burdens on the utilities that modifications to the licence conditions will impose.

<P>
The Government like to make a distinction between an extra cost that is bureaucratic and administrative in nature-filling in forms, and so on-and the extra costs that arise from delivering a social benefit under their programme. They see the latter as improvement to the lot of mankind which should not be included in any assessment of the regulatory cost that they are imposing on business. To make such a distinction misses the point and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of business and economics. We all want more; we all feel underfunded, overworked and under-vacationed-even Members of Parliament. The aim of all political parties is to create better living standards for all of us.

<P>
As Conservatives, we believe that the best approach is to set business free, impose the minimum necessary regulations, levy the minimum taxes on business and individuals, and thereby watch an economy thrive with innovation and expansion. In that way, everyone's living standards are raised. That model worked for Britian in the 1980s and 1990s, and it is working in the USA. It is even espoused in the rhetoric of the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State, but it does not translate into action by the Government, who have imposed £5 billion a year in extra regulatory costs. Even if that includes the so-called benefits of regulation, it is a cost that must be borne by business and is not market-driven. That cost would not have been borne but for the regulations-the business may not be able to afford it, which may result in lost orders or a smaller expansion in orders. Alternatively, it may halt an investment programme or a new marginal project.

<P>
Conservatives want business to pass on its largesse to the population when it can and when it feels that the economy can absorb it, but Labout wants to pass laws requiring that largesse now, regardless of whether it is appropriate. That is the fundamental difference between the two approaches. Labour's approach might result in a business having to sell its capital to pay out that largesse, thereby damaging the business in the longer run.

<P>
The new conditions that the regulators wish to impose on utilities all sound beneficial and marvellous. We would all like to benefti from them. However, we need to assess whether the cost of those new modifications outweighs the benefits. Amendments Nos. 337 and 338 would require such a cost-benefit analysis, to ensure discipline in the burdens imposed on industry, which is a vital determinant of the nation's economic success.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 598 and 599 would bring information publishing duties in line with the Freedom of Information Bill. We have already debated that matter, but I wanted to table the amendments under this clause for reasons of consistency.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Amendments Nos. 337 and 338 would move GEMA's focus away from the protection of the interests of consumers-where we believe that it belongs-and towards the interests of licence holders. We want the authority to balance the benefit to consumers against the cost to licence holders.

<P>
There is a more fundamental difficulty, however, with a rigid obligation to produce a formal cost-benefit analysis on each occasion. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, we have debated the matter previously, and our discussions have been interesting. There may be occasions on which the production of a cost-benefit analysis would not be to the advantage of any interested party. That would be the case if the licence holder and other interested parties were in broad agreement about the need for modification, direction or consent-for example, if the industry were willing to accept certain restrictions in the interests of improving its public image. In such cases, it would be folly to divert GEMA's resources into preparing a cost-benefit analysis. I will not rehearse those arguments again, as they have been explored thoroughly. As the hon. Gentleman said, they lie at the heart of our different analyses of the Bill. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> There we have it. The Minister thinks that a cost-benefit analysis would not be in the interests of the parties concerned.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Not always.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is always in the interests of all parties to prepare and provide a cost-benefit analysis of any project undertaken. That harks back to our debate about the consumer councils and their forward work programmes. The Government felt that it was unnecessary for the councils and the regulatory authority to provide detailed costings and estimates for the programmes, project by project. There is no expenditure in the private sector-whether it be purchasing stationery or taking on a new employee-without a cost-benefit analysis. That is the difference, not just between Labour and Conservative members of the Committee, but between the state and private sectors. The approach is wholly different, and the private sector can deliver efficiencies that the state sector cannot. The private sector must take care of shareholders' pennies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): Is the hon. Gentleman seriously saying that large companies count very paper clip? If that were the case, there would be no need for systems analysts to sort out the messes into which some of those companies get themselves.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am saying precisely that. In large firms, every paper clip is counted. It may not be the case that someone goes round counting the paper clips on everyone's desk, but the cost-controllers of large companies-and small companies-know precisely what their stationery budget is, and how much stationery is purchased out of that budget. There are all kinds of analyses-[Hon. Members: ``I wish it were true.''] I am afraid that it is true. Companies that do not do it soon find themselves in difficulties, as we see in the newspapers from time to time.

<P>
The Minister's response was disappointing, and indicated that, once again, there will be increasing regulatory costs. The Bill will be very damaging to British industry. The utilities are not an evil grouping that seeks to wreak havoc and exploit society: they are a fundamental and important part of the British economy. The utilities are highly efficient world-beaters, since privatisation, but the Bill will impose regulatory and interventionist costs on those businesses, hampering their efforts to fulfil their roles in the most efficient way.

<P>
It is a gross dereliction of duty for the Department of Trade and Industry to reject so dismissively amendments that simply require the regulator to provide a cost-benefit analysis of the modifications to the licence conditions, to see whether the benefits to Britain plc are outweighted by the cost. We are getting used to that from the Government, however. They do not really want to pay much attention to the consequences of their policies. In so many areas, the policies of the DTI are beginning to crumble and to cause enormous damage to the British economy.

<P>
As there is no further response from the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There is no need to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. It was tabled by the Government.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mrs Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): I beg to move amendment No. 606, in page 32, line 14, leave out ``affected by them'' and insert ``interested''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 607, in clause 67, page 67, line 35, leave out ``affected by them'' and insert ``interested''.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> At present clauses 34 and 67 require GEMA and the Secretary of State to give notice of the reasons for certain key regulatory decisions and to publish it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in such manner as the person publishing it considers appropriate for the purpose of bringing the matters to which the notice relates to the attention of persons likely to be affected by them.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have paid close attention to the detail of the wording, and it seems to me that it is, arguably, too narrow, and might restrict the range of persons whom GEMA and the Secretary of State are required to bear in mind when publishing notices setting out the reasons for their decisions. In particular, there is a risk that the employees of regulated companies would not be thought to be ``likely to be affected'' by regulatory decisions, because of the wide scope that regulated companies have to implement regulatory decisions, and because not all the options that such companies face would necessarily impact on the employees.

<P>
The amendments would increase the range of persons covered, so that GEMA and the Secretary of State would be required to publish a notice giving reasons in the manner that they considered appropriate for the purpose of bringing those reasons to the attention of persons ``likely to be interested''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Did the hon. Lady draft the amendments herself?

<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> Yes. I am happy to confirm that-and that the initiative was mine. Perhaps I should have said that I am co-chair of an organisation called PURG-the Public Utilities Reform Group-that brings together parties interested in the utilities. We have had some extremely interesting debates involving the employers' associations, Water UK, the Electricity Association, the trade unions and the consumer organisations. They have been among the most interesting meetings that I have had the pleasure to chair since I came to the House. I can confirm that it is an initiative that I prompted.

<P>
The broader wording of the clause will help to avoid disputes as to whether a person with a legitimate interest in a regulatory decision is also affected by that decision. It would more clearly cover employees of regulated companies and their representatives, as well as those whose principal interest is in the precedent value of decisions, such as regulatory managers of utility companies. My approach is that there are stakeholders, that we must sometimes co-operate to compete effectively and that we all benefit as different stakeholders. It is a little like being both a pedestrian and a car driver: we need rules to regulate the different circumstances in which one person can often find himself.

<P>
I look forward to hearing the Minister's observations and I hope that he will consider supporting the amendment.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Once again, my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs Gilroy) has made a helpful contribution to our scrutiny of the Bill. I welcome this clarification of the scope of the obligation to publish the reasons for key decisions.

<P>
It has always been our intention that everyone with a legitimate interest in the reasons for a regulatory decision should have access to those reasons, as I explained in relation to amendment No. 507. This amendment helps to achieve that aim, and the Committee will be delighted to hear that I am happy to lend it our support.

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 613, in page 32, leave out line 30 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`After section 56 of the 1989 Act there is inserted-<P>
</UL></FONT>
{**VB2**}Alteration of activities requiring licence'.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 614.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Clauses 35 and 68 introduce new sections following sections 5 and 6A of the existing Electricity and Gas Acts respectively. On reflection, we concluded that it would be more appropriate for the new sections to come later in the relevant Acts, and the amendments achieve that. This is a minor reorganisation that has no substantive effects.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 602, in page 33, line 8, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and which are currently within the activities for which a licence under the Act is required.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 603, in clause 68, page 68, line 37, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and which are currently within the activities for which a licence under this Act is required.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> This is a useful clause, if its drafting reflects what I understand to be its purpose, despite the fact that we have just relegated it and clause 68 to below the ``Miscellaneous'' section in the original Acts.

<P>
The purpose of the clause seems to be to enable the Secretary of State, by secondary legislation, to refine further the area to be licensed separately. In the same way as the supply and distribution of electricity have been split to enable the natural monopoly-distribution-to be separated from the highly competitive market of supply, further such refinements can now take place without the turmoil and chaos that another Utilities Bill would undoubtedly create. For example, metering may become a highly competitive activity that might benefit from being separated from distribution. However, the concern is that the clause might enable the Government to require a licence for activities that are not subject to a licence at present. The clause should be used to separate out licences in areas of activity already subject to a licence rather than bringing them within the regulatory regime's activities, which are regulation-free.

<P>
The key passage is to be found in new section 5A(4), which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An order under this section may only provide for activities to become licensable activities if they are activities connected with the generation, transmission, distribution or supply of electricity.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That appears to provide the safeguard that I am worried about. The key phrase is ``connected with''. That may be intended to imply that it must be an activity that is subject to the current regulatory regime, but it does not necessarily do so. Will the Minister confirm that? If it is intended to enable the Secretary of State to bring into the regulatory regime activities that are not currently regulated, will he say why and what activities he has in mind?

<P>
The amendments would clarify the issue by inserting the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>which are currently within the activities for which a licence  is required.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that that deals with the problem, although it is not technically the correct wording to achieve what I want to achieve. An assurance from the Minister that he will table an amendment on Report would be satisfactory, but an assurance about the purpose of the clause, explaining the ambiguity about the type of activities that might be brought into the regulatory regime, would be helpful.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I can understand why the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has tabled the amendments. He is right to say that the ability to introduce a licence requirement without recourse to primary legislation should not be unlimited and should be hedged by substantial safeguards. That is why we have stipulated that, among other safeguards, a new licence requirement may be introduced only if the activity concerned is connected with gas and electricity activities for which a licence is currently required. ``Connected with'' includes the concept of ancillary services, including metering, which are currently regulated by licence conditions on suppliers. The clause is drafted to cope with the unbundling of such activities from those of a licensed company when there remains a good public interest case for continued regulation. It is not the intention to extend regulation to activities that have never been subject to controls through licences.

<P>
This is only the first of the safeguards to ensure that the power is not used capriciously to extend the scope of regulation. We have deliberately built in a number of hoops that must be gone through when creating a new licensable activity, including wide consultation, the potential involvement of the Competition Commission and the approval of Parliament. Those safeguards will ensure that a reasonable decision is arrived at in all cases.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for that response. The Minister has clarified the Government's intention. There was ambiguity, but under Pepper v. Hart his statement could be used to clarify Parliament's intention. It is now clear that there is no intention to include in the regulatory regime activities that are not already included, and that the question will simply be one of separation or unbundling when competition emerges in new sectors in it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): I have been listening carefully at a conference across the river this morning on e-commerce, which is packed with business people. One of my worries about the clause is that it introduces uncertainty because the power is so wide. Despite being told that the Government may not use it, businesses that are thinking of starting a new activity-perhaps as part of a new e-business-may look at the three and a half pages of additional regulations and wonder what the Government are up to. Before my hon. Friend rushes to withdraw his amendment, I wonder whether he is right to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for my hon. Friend's helpful intervention. He is right in saying that the clause increases uncertainty. A Bill that should have introduced clarity and transparency does the reverse. It is full of new uncertainties and will substantially increase regulatory risk. The purpose of the amendment is to try to remove a tiny bit of uncertainty by inserting a clear statement that the new power cannot be extended and must be confined to activities that are currently within the licensing regime.

<P>
The Minister has clarified the position in Hansard, but not every new entrepreneur will be able to read the Act-and why should they when it contains 216 Government amendments? On top of that, most lawyers rarely read Hansard and when they need to use the case of Pepper v.  Hart they go to top legal advisers to obtain the necessary advice. It would be better for the position to be stated in the Bill rather than in Hansard.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I want to correct the record. There are five and a half pages on the reserve power, which seems excessive.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes an accurate point.

<P>
We have dealt with the matter as far as possible. Although it would have been better to amend the Bill, drafting the clause more crisply and tightly, the Minister has put an assurance on the record in Hansard, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 605, in page 36, line 48, at end insert ``(and not a person acting under his authority)''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 604, in clause 68, page 72, line 29, at end insert ``(and not a person acting under his authority)''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The purpose of the amendments is slightly mischievous, but it none the less reflects a serious point. It was clear from this week's and last week's debates that the Minister had not read all the consultation documents on the standard licence conditions that were published by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets. Those documents consist of eight turgid and tedious volumes, but they are not unreadable. They relate directly to the Bill and can be read fairly swiftly by a diligent Minister who pays keen attention to detail.

<P>
I do not blame the Minister-he is a nice chap and we get on very well-but I do blame the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, because this is her Bill. Where is she? We have not seen her today; nor did we see her on Tuesday. I realise that she has recently been ill, but she had recovered by last week. Yet again, she has failed to appear in Committee. Perhaps she is not dealing with the Bill because it is a catastrophe with which she does not want to be associated.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> It may be tempting to talk about the Bill in terms other than a triumph, but I should point out that my right hon. Friend is at a meeting of the Council of Ministers, where she has struck a good deal for the United Kingdom on the vexed question of droit de suite.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe would better spend her time dealing with the energy issues to which the Bill is confined. The art market is rightly important to the Government, but as far as she is concerned, energy issues should take precedence. She should be present, and if our sittings need to be rescheduled, so be it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> We have been told where the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe is this week, but we have not seen her since she had lunch with representatives of the Electricity Association a week and a half ago. We still do not know whether that lunch was so powerful that electricity provisions are no longer to be included in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. We do not know what was said at that meeting by Electricity Association representatives, but I hope that the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe took on board their very real concerns about the Bill.

<P>
The amendment would ensure that it is the Secretary of State who pays attention to the report, and not a person acting under his authority. The Government are having enormous problems with a range of issues, and the root cause is the failure of Ministers to get to grips with policy detail, which they leave to civil servants. It is true that civil servants are qualified and experienced people, and perhaps that should be enough. However, in a democracy, it is not. Ministers receive relatively high salaries. They were elected to represent the views of the people at government level, and those who do not do their jobs properly are guilty of dereliction of duty.

<P>
Had Ministers paid attention to policy detail, the problems associated with the Bill would not have arisen, although, in saying so, I may be showing an undue degree of faith in Ministers. The amendment is a shot across the bows. It is a tongue-in-cheek attempt to persuade Ministers to get a grip on their ministerial briefs and administer Government policy in the right way.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 616 to 620, Nos. 630 and 631, and Nos. 633 and 634.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg the indulgence of Committee members in discussing this substantial group of amendments. Unfortunately, the provisions are rather complex, and I hope that I will be forgiven if I explain them in some detail. Given that they cover much of the next part of the Bill, I want to be as helpful as I can. They make an important change to the arrangements for connecting customers and embedded generators to the distribution system.

<P>
Clauses 25 and 27 introduce distribution licences, replace the two existing types of supply licence with one, and require that the same person may not hold both types of licence. As a result, there will no longer be any such thing as a public electricity supplier. That apparently straightforward change has far-reaching structural implications because so much of the Electricity Act 1989 is constructed around the obligations that are laid on public electricity suppliers and the rights they are given. It has therefore been necessary carefully to consider all those powers and duties and determine what is to be done with them. In each case, we have had to consider whether the relevant right or duty should remain a statutory provision and, if so whether it is a matter for distributors or for suppliers.

<P>
Clauses 36 to 39 and new clause 7, which I shall discuss later, deal with a very important aspect of distributors' duties and powers-namely, their duty to offer terms for a connection, which I shall occasionally refer to as their duty to connect. Sections 16 to 22 of the 1989 Act, which the clauses amend, deal with the existing duty of public electricity suppliers to give a supply. We now need to separate the provisions relating to supply and the provisions relating to distribution. On the whole, we thought it best to retain in primary legislation all the statutory powers and duties of existing public electricity suppliers that relate to distribution. Distribution remains, and is likely to remain for the forseeable future, a natural monopoly activity on which we all depend for electricity supplies. In the case of supply, given that there is now full competition, we felt it appropriate to adopt a more flexible approach. Some of the powers and duties that have hitherto been statutory will become matters for licence conditions or supply contracts.

<P>
I shall say no more about supply now, other than that we will shortly table amendments in the form of new schedules to replace schedules 6 and 7 of the 1989 Act. Those will spell out in detail the necessary statutory arrangements for supply and related activities such as metering. Sections 36 to 41 deal with the duty of licensed distributors to connect, as well as several associated matters-principally the financial arrangements relating to the duty and terms of agreements made in relation to the duty.

<P>
Amendment No. 615 inserts new sections 16 and 16A into the 1989 Act in place of the existing section 16. Subsection (1) of new section 16 places all licensed distributors under a duty to provide a connection when required, in accordance with such terms as may be agreed under the procedures provided for in section 16A. Under the subsection, a licensed distributor has a duty to offer terms for making a connection to anyone who requires a connection to premises or other distribution systems operated by distributors that are authorised by licence or exemption.

<P>
In the case of premises, the owner or occupier will be able to request that a connection be made. In addition, an electricity supplier, acting with the consent of the owner or occupier, will also be able to require a connection. Extending the duty to include requests made by suppliers on behalf of their customers is consistent with our general policy that customers-especially small customers-should, if they wish, be able to use suppliers as a one-stop shop for all of their electricity requirements.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The reference to connections to other distribution systems is also a new feature of the statutory duty. In practice, most distribution systems, other than those owned by the public electricity suppliers, are connected to the regional distribution system of their local public electricity supplier. It is helpful to make it clear that distributors have a duty to connect other distributors to their system. The duty to connect is owed to embedded generators in the same way as to electricity consumers. The hon. Member for Lewes made that point strongly in previous sittings.

<P>
Clearly, the terms for embedded generation connections are likely to be different from those that apply to an electricity consumer. However, the underlying principle of putting embedded generators on the same statutory footing as any other distribution system user remains. That is important for all the reasons that I have discussed.

<P>
Subsection (2) clarifies the nature of the duty by providing that the duty to connect includes a duty to provide all the necessary electrical lines and plant to make the connection. In rural areas, new connections may involve running wires over considerable distances and installing transformers on the line. In other cases, the connection of large loads, or embedded generation, might require the distributor to reinforce the system to accommodate the connection. Such reinforcement work must be carried out, albeit subject to cost recovery from the person requiring the connection. The Committee will return to that point when we consider amendments to clause 37.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> It is extremely difficult to follow a Bill if, effectively, the Minister is introducing an enormous amendment that will operate through another series of amendments, which the Committee has not yet seen. I want to ask a simple question. When people install electricity lines, sometimes they ask the electricity company to do all the work, and are quoted a price. If that price is too expensive, they might want to run their own lines, and merely ask the electricity company to connect the two ends of those lines. Is that covered by the amendment? Otherwise, it might be sugegsted that a company has a monopoly to run the lines and charge what it wants.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As I have tried to explain-it is difficult, because this is a long amendment-the potential customer can ask the distributor or supply company to do the job. In some cases, I am sure that supply companies will offer good packages, and distributors might decide to do exactly the same. That is acceptable under those circumstances. I shall try to provide more detail later. It is an important point, and I hope that we have accommodated such requests.

<P>
Subsection (3) provides that the duty to connect applies subject to the terms of the connection agreement made by the distributor and the person requiring the connection under the provisions of section 16A. It also provides that, subject to those terms, the connection shall continue to be provided by the distributor for as long as it is required. That is an important point.

<P>
Subsection (4) is important. It sets out the meaning of some key terms in this clause and clauses 37 to 39. In so doing, it further illuminates the nature and scope of the duty to connect.

<P>
Subsections (4)(a) and (b) deal with the terms ``make a connection'' and ``maintain a connection'' as they are intended to be understood in reading sections 16 to 23 of the Electricity Act 1989. Since a proper understanding of this point will assist the Committee's understanding of some of the other Government amendments in this group, I trust that hon. Members will permit me to explain this in some detail. The term ``making a connection'' is defined to include three separate elements: making the connection in the first place, maintaining it, and keeping in good repair the equipment that constitutes the connection-or, as the Bill puts it, continuing to provide
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the necessary electric lines and electric plant.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Subsection (5), the final subsection of section 16, provides that the duty to connect is subject to all subsequent provisions of part I of the Electricity Act 1989 and any regulations made under those provisions. This will have the effect of making the duty subject to the provisions of sections 16A to 23 of the Act, most of which we shall turn to shortly.

<P>
New section 16A, which will also be inserted by the amendment, sets out the procedural aspects of requiring a connection to be made. These provisions are contained in the same section as those relating to the duty itself, both in the Bill and in the existing Act. I believe that separating them will add to the clarity of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I seek clarification, because, as the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) said, this is an exceedingly complicated matter. Is there anything in the Bill, or in the guidance that may follow it, that deals with the manner of connection? Environmental reasons are constantly urged for connections being made under ground rather than by means of overhead lines, because of the impact of the latter on the landscape. Many people would want the Government to take the opportunity to ensure that new connections had as little impact as possible on the environment. Will that opportunity be taken as part of these proposals?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> That opportunity will certainly be taken, and that is an important point. As the hon. Member for South Dorset highlighted in his intervention, the contract between the customer and the company-either the distributor or the supplier-will have to include certain other considerations. Occasionally, they will be important environmental ones. All the planning requirements presently in force, such as those relating to the despoliation of the landscape, will also apply. The existing consents in section 37 of the Electricity Act 1989 will accommodate that matter, and we can discuss them in due course.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> That is very helpful. Is the Minister saying that the presumption is that new connections will be made under ground?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> No, I am not saying that. Sometimes they will be under ground, sometimes they will be above ground. That will be decided case by case. I would love all connections to be made under ground, but I cannot give such an assurance.

<P>
Subsections (1) and (2) provide that a person requiring a connection must give the distributor a notice requiring him to offer terms for the connection to be made. The notice must state the premises or other distribution system to which the connectionis to be made, the date from which it will be required, and the maximum power to be conveyed through it. That last point is important; we do not want someone setting up a welding company at the end of a light connection, because it would blow the entire circuit. Subsection (5) and (6) are the final subsections of the new section. They make provisions relating to the notice that the distributor must give to the person requiring the connection, setting out the terms on which the connection is offered.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 616 to 620 relate to clause 36 and to section 17 of the 1989 Act. The existing section 17 of the Act provides for the circumstances in which the duty to supply does not arise. This is termed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Exceptions from duty to supply.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It contains a mixture of provisions, some of which relate to supply proper and some of which relate to distribution and, in particular, what we are now calling the duty to connect or the duty to offer terms for a connection.

<P>
New section 17 deals with distribution only. Subsection (1) would disapply the distributor's duty to connect if and to the extent that he was prevented from making a connection by circumstances beyond his control-for example, by an environmental consideration-if he could not do so without breaching the electricity supply regulations made under section 29, which are principally about electrical safety and will, when section 29 and the regulations have been amended, apply to connection as well as to aspects of supply, or if it would be reasonable to require a connection to be made. New section 17(2) provides for further circumstances when the duty to connect will not arise.

<P>
The subsection is both complicated and important, and I hope that the Committee will feel free to quiz me on it if they see fit.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> What would the Minister regard as an unreasonable requirement to make a connection? Would geographical length-as when a cottage is a long way from the nearest connection-be the criterion? What is unreasonable?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> It will depend on the circumstances. The requirement could be considered unreasonable for a number of reasons, some of which the hon. Gentleman may or may not be correct in citing. There would be a contractual relationship between the person applying for the connection and the company that supplied it. I am sure that a great deal of case law exists to show what is considered to be reasonable. No cases have yet arisen under this provision in the existing Act. Public electricity suppliers almost always connect. We might consider the matter later.

<P>
Amendment No. 630 amends section 23(1) and (2) to remove references to public electricity suppliers and related terms and replace them with drafting that limits the clause to dealing with distribution only. Amendment No. 631 inserts into schedule 5 the terms that arise principally as a result of the provisions on distribution. Those terms are used consistently in these provisions and elsewhere in the 1989 Act. For example, the terms ``authorised supplier'' and ``authorised distributor'' are both used in new subsection (1) of section 16.</H5>
</P>

<P>
Finally-to everyone's relief, I am sure-amendments Nos. 633 and 634 ensure that certain minor and consequential amendments are made to the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1985 and the Insolvency Act 1986.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's explanation, particularly of amendment No. 615, which is one an a half pages of text, and I cannot understand how it differs from the original text in the Bill. Will the Minister explain how they differ in substance?

<P>
Clause 36 introduces new sections 16 and 17 to the Electricity Act. The amendment deletes the whole of the original section 16 in the Bill and replaces it with a revised new section 16 and a new section 16A.

<P>
One of the first reasons that the Minister gave for tabling amendment No. 615 was that it provides for the distribution system to be connected to other distribution systems. The original section 16(2)(b) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>where the request is made in relation to another distribution system, between a distribution system of his and a distribution system of the other system.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is already in the Bill. He went on to talk about electrical plant. That is also in the Bill. Subsection (2) refers to a duty
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to provide such electric lines or electrical plant as may be necessary for that purpose.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He talked about different terms. Subsection (5) talks about offering terms to the person requiring the connection. He talked about maintaining the connection in good repair. Again, subsection (6) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any reference to making a connection includes a reference to maintaining in good repair the connection.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He then went on to new section 16A and talked about a notice being required. Section 16(5) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a notice requiring him to offer terms.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He then referred to counter-proposals. Again, counter-proposals are in the Bill. Was the Minister implying that this is an amendment of substance, or was he simply describing basic principles that are already in the clause and attributing them to the amendment?

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I think that the amended version is a good deal tidier than the original. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will have a little fun with that, but it does clarify the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> If this is simply a matter of drafting errors, the Minister should have said so at the beginning. Had he said that this is an amendment of substance, I would have asked what consultation he has undertaken on an amendment that extends to one and a half pages. I received a copy of it from the Whip only last Tuesday, and, given its size, I suspect that there has been no consultation on it. If it has no substance and merely tidies up drafting errors in the clause, perhaps there is no need for consultation.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I shall give another example of a drafting error. New section 17(2)(b) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The distributor's licence does provide for that provision to have effect in relation to him.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 617 will correct it by adding the word ``not'', so that it will state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The distributor's licence does not provide for that provision to have effect in relation to him.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The more one examines the Bill, the more catastrophic its drafting appears.

<P>
The Minister's explanation has been helpful. The amendment is huge and redrafts a disastrous clause. On the Government's removing the telecoms and water clauses, we told them that they should redraft the entire Bill and resubmit it. Amendments such as this, which are intended to confuse the Committee, demonstrate that we were right. The Bill should have been redrafted and given a new Second Reading, so that it might be examined properly in Committee. The Minister has pretended that this is an amendment of substance but it is not, and he should not have tried to confuse us. Had it been an amendment of substance, industry and others who will be affected by it should have been consulted.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 621, in page 40, line 25, leave out ``necessary'' and insert ``used''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendments Nos. 622 to 629.

<P>
Government new clause 7-Special agreements with respect to distribution.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 632 and 635.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Under the previous group of amendments, we considered distributors' duty to connect. These amendments and the new clause deal with other sections of the Electricity Act 1989-sections 19 to 23-that make further provisions relating to the present duty to supply. The provisions in clauses 37 to 39 and the new clause will replace existing provisions in sections 19 to 22, which refer to public electricity suppliers, with provisions appropriate to distribution in the light of the separation of activity from supply.

<P>
As amended by clause 37, section 19 of the 1989 Act will provide that distributors may recover from the person requiring connection costs relating to putting in place electric lines and equipment necessary for connection, and the capitalised cost of keeping them in good repair.

<P>
We are also proposing four amendments to clause 38, with which I should like to mention one other. Amendment No. 623 will replace the word ``requests'' with the word ``requires'' in new subsection (1) of section 20, as amended by clause 38. That will align those provisions with parallel provisions in the Gas Act 1986/1995 and will also pick up language in section
 16A(1), as amended by amendment No. 615. Amendment No. 628 will make the same change to section 21 in clause 39.

<P>
Amendment No. 624 makes another change that is related to the definitions of some key terms in section 16 by clause 36, which I spoke about in respect of amendment No. 615. Amendment. No. 625 ensures that if a person's security proves insufficient or becomes invalid, the distributor may not take action against him unless he is first given a chance to provide alternative security and fails to do so. Amendment. No. 626 rewords the sanctions that the distributor has at his disposal in the absence of adequate security being made available. The effect of the part of the subsection that is amended is the same.

<P>
I commend the amendments to the Committee.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Perhaps I will be third time lucky.

<P>
Before the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton challenges me, I confess that the matter that the amendment addresses was brought to my attention by the Combined Heat and Power Association. We shall return to it when we reach clauses 50 to 55. It is possible to improve CHP by introducing air conditioning and cooling. The 1989 Act refers to digging up roads, and the amendment would allow that to occur for the purposes of putting in cooling pipes. Given that it deals with a technical matter in a reasonable way, will the Minister accept it?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am feeling extraordinarily generous today, and shall accept my hon. Friend's amendment.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Clause 41, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
