Chairman:</b> Good afternoon. Before we begin our
consideration of the Bill, I have a preliminary announcement. Members
may remove their outer garments to ensure more comfort if they wish.
Will all Members please ensure that they are rigged for silent running,
or switch their pagers and telephones off altogether, so that we do not
have disturbances? There are no amendments to the Bill, so we will move
straight to clause stand part debates on each clause, if the Committee
wishes to debate them at
all.</div><a name="09061097000008"></a><h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
1</h4><a name="09061097000004"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Registration
of societies as co-operative or community benefit
societies</div><a name="09061097000012"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09061097000013"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061097000075"></a><b class="B">Malcolm
Wicks</b> (Croydon, North) (Lab): It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship once again, Mr. Cook. I am pleased
that we have been able to encourage such a distinguished group to be
members of the Committee. The members are known for not only their
intelligence, but, on occasion, their
brevity.</div><a name="09061097000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the Bill is to modernise and update the law for industrial
and provident societies by changing their name, by improving their
corporate governance, and by giving the Treasury the power to modify
certain aspects of the law for co-operative societies and community
benefit societies in line with company law. In addition, certain
aspects of the law for credit unions will be modified in line with
building societies law. This follows extensive consultations with the
industry.</div><a name="09061097000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
you have mentioned, Mr. Cook, no amendments have been
tabled, which reflects the fact that we had a very through and good
debate on Second Reading that was characterised, as on so many recent
occasions, by consensus on both sides of the House. Although the
Committee will determine the form of the detailed scrutiny that the
Bill is given, all things being equal there is no reason why the
Committee should require a subsequent sitting, although time will
tell.</div><a name="09061097000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
1 provides that all new societies registered under the Industrial and
Provident Societies Act 1965 shall be registered as co-operative
societies or community benefit societies. It sets out the basis on
which societies may be registered. The criteria are essentially those
already in existing legislation, so no major change is made to the
qualifying criteria. The introduction of the requirement will also
ensure that such societies can be properly supervised by the Financial
Services Authority, thus improving corporate governance over the
sector. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>By modernising the name from &#147;industrial and provident
society&#148; to terms that are in common usage, we can help the
sector adopt a modern, 21st-century
persona.</div><a name="09061097000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause deals with the treatment of those societies already registered,
or treated as registered, at present. Such societies did not have to
register as a particular type of society. A &#147;pre-2009 Act
society&#148; is not to be affected by the definitions of
co-operative society or community benefit society in the Bill. The
clause also makes consequential amendments to other legislation to
reflect the changes made to the 1965 Act. Amendments are also made to
section 16 of the 1965 Act, which deals with circumstances in which a
society&#146;s registration may be cancelled, to reflect the new
registration provisions. The FSA, as registrar, will be able to cancel
the registration of a society where it does not meet the new statutory
definitions. Again, the status of societies registered, or treated as
registered, under old section 1 of the 1965 Act is catered
for.</div><a name="09061097000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Wicks:</b> I must seek to stir up some controversy but,
unfortunately, clause 2 might not do that. It will simply change the
name of the Industrial and Provident Society Act 1965 and other Acts
concerning industrial and provident societies so that
&#147;Industrial and Provident Societies&#148; is replaced by
&#147;Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies and Credit
Unions&#148; in the titles.</div>

Chairman:</b> Does the right hon. Gentleman wish clause 4 to
be decided
formally?</div><a name="09061097000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061097000078"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:</b> Clause 4s can be controversial, but not on this
occasion, so I should like to proceed formally.</div>
<a name="09061097000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause 4
ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></div>
<a name="09061097000010"></a><h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
5</h4><a name="09061097000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Power
to make provision corresponding to provision applying to building
societies</div><a name="09061097000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061097000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061097000079"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:</b> Clause 5 is particularly important because it
enables provisions corresponding to building society law to be made for
credit unions, which I know have broad support in House, not least at
this difficult financial time.</div>
<a name="09061097000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power
will allow any provisions of building societies legislation that are
deemed appropriate to be mirrored for credit unions. There has been a
significant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>expansion in credit union membership in recent years, including&#151;I
declare an interest&#151;in my own Croydon credit union. The best way
to allow credit union law to keep pace with credit unions&#146;
expanding membership and operations is to bring it in line with
building society law, which is tailored to deal with issues specific to
institutions that accept
deposits.</div><a name="09061097000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
power is widely drawn to allow any provisions of building society
legislation that are deemed appropriate to be mirrored for credit
unions, but there are restrictions to ensure that specific provisions
of existing credit union law cannot be modified. Thus provisions
regarding registration, the use of the name &#147;credit
union&#148;, the general prohibition on deposit taking, amalgamations
or transfers of engagements, and conversion of status for a credit
union company, are safe. There is a requirement that the Treasury
consult such persons as appear appropriate before using the new
power.</div>
<a name="09061097000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061097000080"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): Will the right hon. Gentleman
indicate whether draft regulations will be published in respect of the
powers given to the Treasury under the
Bill?</div><a name="09061097000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061097000081"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:</b> I am happy to answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question, but I am sure that the Minister will be able to give some
indication of that, even if there cannot be a chronologically specific
indication. This is a matter for the Minister, the Treasury and the
Government and not, thankfully, for the
ex-Minister.</div><a name="09061097000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Depending
on which provisions of building society law are converted into credit
union law, the Treasury may need to confer powers to make orders,
regulations and other subordinate legislation to create criminal
offences, and to provide for the charging of fees, but not any charge
in the nature of
taxation.</div><a name="09061097000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061097000082"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Nick Palmer</b> (Broxtowe) (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend
have any reservations about creating criminal offences with the
Treasury consulting
only</div><a name="09061097000054"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such
persons as appear to them to be
appropriate&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061097000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">in

<a name="09061097000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061097000083"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:</b> It is very good of my former Parliamentary Private
Secretary to ask me that question. Clearly&#151;the Minister might
have a view on this&#151;one has to be careful about such criminal
offences and how we consult on them. However, not least given the
backdrop of the financial crisis that we have been going through, it is
important that law is strong in this area and, if necessary, it should
include such offences. I defer to the Government on the details of the
consultation.</div><a name="09061097000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061097000084"></a><b class="B">David
Lepper</b> (Brighton, Pavilion) (Lab/Co-op): On a point of
order, Mr. Cook. May I place on record my membership of the
Sussex credit union before we proceed to a decision on this
clause?</div><a name="09061097000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061097000085"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon,
Mr. Cook, for what I imagine will be a brief but important
sitting. I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon,
North on his Bill, which the Government fully support.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div><a name="09061097000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham asked when the draft regulations would be
published. The Treasury intends to consult fully before taking things
further. The time scale is not yet set, but it will depend on the speed
with which the Bill is enacted. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that
we intend to take a legislative reform order through the House shortly,
and we want the time scale to be
appropriate.</div><a name="09061097000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, Treasury
consultation always takes place with appropriate people. There was
extensive dialogue with the credit union movement and industrial and
provident societies before and during the Bill&#146;s gestation
period, and I have every confidence that all whom need to be consulted
will be
consulted.</div><a name="09061097000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
must admit to being something of a linguistic conservative. I do not
like the disappearance of words such as &#147;industrial and
provident societies&#148;, just as I did not like the words
&#147;trade and industry&#148; disappearing from the title of a
Government Department. However, I am aware that there is a broad
consensus that the term is outdated. The earlier clauses attracted no
comment from me because they have the Government&#146;s full
support.</div><a name="09061097000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061097000086"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I take the Minister back to my question about
the regulations that will be made under the Bill, assuming it passes,
and his comments about the LRO for credit unions? Is it fair to say
that through a combination of the Bill and the LRO, the Government will
implement all steps that they expect to take to modernise the
legislative framework for credit
unions?</div><a name="09061097000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061097000087"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We certainly think that the package of measures
in the Bill and the Government&#146;s proposed legislative reform
order will represent a comprehensive update of legislation in this
area. The Government will always want to keep matters under review, but
we certainly intend that the Bill and the subsequent legislative reform
order will represent a major piece of
work.</div><a name="09061097000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
