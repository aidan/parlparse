welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Illsley. Having just looked you up, I
find that you are now in your 20th year as a Member of Parliament. I am
grateful to you for taking on this onerous task. I am told this is the
longest Bill that has ever appeared before the House. We are hoping
that your interest in football will inform our
sittings&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;Hear,
hear.&#148;]&#151;and that we shall finish in time to watch the
Sweden match. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;It is next
week.&#148;] I am ahead of my time.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 4</div><a name="06061555000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Illsley, you once called on the royal family to attend more football
matches. I do not know what success you had with that. You are one of
the few MPs who opposed televising the Commons, but I am sure that you
do not oppose the facility of television in the Commons for those who
want to watch things going on outside.</div>
<a name="06061555000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had a good debate on Second
Reading. The Bill is enormous and will grow during the course of our
considerations as we try to consolidate more into it to put all the
legislation has an impact on companies in one place. It will make an
enormous difference to UK business and I hope that it ensures that
people who wish to incorporate companies see the UK as the best place
in which to do business. If we are to succeed in that, it is vital that
we get the provisions right.</div>
<a name="06061555000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members who have read
proceedings in the upper House will see that the Government are very
open-minded in our approach to the Bill. The provisions are in good
shape, but we are always anxious to improve them. Certainly, during the
discussions that I had in the past month with my officials, we found
that there is always room for improvement in a Bill of such an enormous
size. If we are persuaded that amendments will improve it, we will be
happy to support
them.</div><a name="06061555000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">We tried to
approach the development of the Bill in a truly collaborative and
inclusive way, which is why it has attracted such broad consensus and
support in the business community. Indeed, I am meeting various hon.
Members to determine whether we can reach a consensus on one of the
issues of contention, which is the clause on indirect shareholder
interest. Those who read the debate in the other place will know that
the Bill attracted a good deal of cross-party support. I hope that in
this Committee all Opposition Members act in that collaborative and
constructive way.</div><a name="06061555000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that hon. Members will bear with us on the substance of the
programme motion. We are proposing not to deal with the provisions in
the precise order that they are laid out in the Bill. There are several
reasons why that approach is sensible. I will be kindly supported by
two ministerial colleagues who have better legal qualifications than I
do. One of them is the Solicitor-General, who is unable to be with us
today because of his involvement with the Fraud Bill. We want to defer
parts 10, 11, 15, 16 and 24. He will lead on those in the most part
lead, although I shall work through some of the clauses with him. As
the Attorney-General took those through the House of Lords, it seemed
sensible for the Solicitor-General to lead on them in the Commons
Committee.</div><a name="06061555000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parts 17 to
21, 26 to 33, and schedules 9 and 16 have been moved because they are
where we want to introduce new consolidating clauses from previous
legislation. Those will restate many of the provisions of the Companies
Act 1985. As we speak, parliamentary counsel are drafting those parts.
We want to defer them and discuss them later in our
proceedings.</div><a name="06061555000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I alluded to consideration of part 9, which is the clause on indirect
shareholders. We want to leave it to the end because I am trying to
build consensus with all parties concerned on the proper way forward.
After the first consultation meeting yesterday, I am optimistic that we
will bring the parties together. That would be a much more satisfactory
way of resolving the problem.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 5</div><a name="06061555000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061555000203"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): I join the Minister in
welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Illsley. She was correct when she said
that we might finish in time for the Sweden match, as it kicks off at 7
o&#146;clock. I suspect that if we are still here shortly before 5
o&#146;clock, even I would command a majority if I were to move that
the Committee be
adjourned.</div><a name="06061555000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is one
of those occasions when our primary duty as legislators is to work
together to produce the best framework for our companies. There is
broad agreement that company law needs to be recast. There is no
disagreement on that in principle&#151;indeed, there is significant
agreement. The subject may be politically dull, but it is important. We
are all charged with a precious responsibility to get the legislation
right, because the prospects and living standards of all our citizens
will be hampered if we do not get right the legal environment that
affects our wealth creation. The Bill is immensely
important.</div><a name="06061555000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
had a lengthy gestation period. There has obviously been substantial
consultation since the Department first started serious preparation of
it as far back as 1998. However, it is only in Parliament that the
arguments of the people who are being consulted about the Bill, the
people whose interests are affected by it and the experts who have made
contributions to all sides of the debate will be exposed to public
discussion. It is only by examining the detail of the legislation that,
in Committee here and in another place, we can expose the arguments put
to the Department of Trade and Industry over a long period to determine
how strong they are, particularly when the Government have rejected
submissions that have been made to them. The Government are asking for
trouble by introducing legislation that will become the largest Act to
reach the statute book, as everyone anticipates it will, and by getting
into detailed Committee consideration more than one year into the
parliamentary Session&#151;it is a year since this Parliament was
formed&#151;when there has been such substantial preparation time. It
will be difficult for us to do the job that, as legislators, we are
sent here primarily to do.</div>
<a name="06061555000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a 925-clause Bill. Some
181 amendments and 22 new clauses are tabled for consideration. I
suspect that 22 new clauses will be multiplied by a factor of at least
22 to give us perhaps 400 new clauses to deal with the consolidation.
At this stage, we do not know for sure, however, because the Government
will table the consolidation measures in due course. They cannot
produce them yet because they are drafting them and consulting on them.
However, this programme motion provides for a finish date in Committee
of 13 July. That is the principal problem.</div>
<a name="06061555000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">With this Bill, programming as
a way of doing our business as legislators reaches its nadir. With a
Bill of this length, the 13 July finish date will not enable us to do
our job properly, and we will have to examine the legislation with that
handicap. We must make it clear to the people whose interests are
affected by all 925 clauses that Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition will
not be able to examine significant aspects of the Bill in the detail
that we would wish. We are being forced into a position whereby we will
have to focus our attention on those aspects of the Bill which have
attracted the most public 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 6</div>controversy. Important elements deserving of proper consideration will
not receive it because of the time constraints on us.</div>
<a name="06061555000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will have to focus our
efforts on specific aspects to meet our priorities for examination. We
have had to produce a batting order for the things that we wish to
examine. Sadly, we will reach perhaps only the top 11 in that batting
order. At the moment it runs to 925, but no doubt it will be rather
longer when we reach the end of our proceedings.</div>
<a name="06061555000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although on Second Reading we
can no longer debate programming because of a change in Standing
Orders, the Secretary of State
said:</div><a name="06061555000148"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As I
understand it&#151;I may be wrong&#151;the timetable was agreed
through the usual channels, though they are not always
foolproof.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 2 June 2006; Vol.
447, c.
123.]</div><a name="06061555000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
usual channels never agree to timetables on any legislation. Her
Majesty&#146;s Opposition have a principled opposition to
programming, and that goes for all legislation. The Government must
expect Divisions on programme motions at any stage. We are in principle
opposed to them imposing programme motions because they deny
legislation the chance for proper
consideration.</div>
<a name="06061555000170"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="06061555000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree that
the Government are entitled to get their legislation. If it becomes
clear in the course of proceedings on any legislation that obstruction
or filibustering is likely to prevent that from happening, we accept,
as we did when we were in government, that timetables might need to be
applied. The fact that the Bill has been introduced in June and is
likely to be the largest Bill ever makes our position extremely
difficult. We shall oppose the programme motion. I refute the
suggestion that it was in any sense agreed; it was not. It might be
suggested that we sit for all hours of the night between now and 13
July to consider the Bill. The Government might decide that that is an
appropriate way to proceed. I do not think that it is.</div>
<a name="06061555000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is technical and
requires a lot of work and preparation. The Government are still doing
a great deal of that and their civil servants are working away trying
to meet their deadline of 13 July. We should have a proper chance to
scrutinise the Bill in sensible time. That has been denied us by the
Government and that is why we oppose the
motion.</div><a name="06061555000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061555000204"></a><b class="B">Lorely
Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): On behalf of my Liberal Democrat
colleagues, I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Illsley, for this
marathon. I am sure that under your wise guidance we will manage the
whole event with dignity and good humour.</div>
<a name="06061555000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our group will also play our
part in ensuring that we co-operate as fully as possible, so that we
meet the strict deadline imposed by the Government. I echo the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s sentiments: we will work hard to ensure that we do
not take unnecessary time over things that are not controversial and
have received a high degree of consensus in consultations elsewhere.
However, we are disturbed at the order of proceedings. Although we take
the Minister&#146;s point about the Solicitor-General&#146;s other
responsibilities, it is unfortunate that legislation of this importance
has to be ordered in a way that reflects his convenience, not the
convenience of the Committee. It does not reflect well that no one on
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 7</div>Government side is available to give the level of expertise that taking
the Bill through Committee in a coherent manner demands.</div>
<a name="06061555000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are particularly concerned
that clause 399, which relates to what was the operating and financial
review and is now the business review, should receive proper time for
debate. It would be appalling if we did not reach that point. We, too,
will vote against the programme motion.</div>

Ennis</b> (Barnsley, East and Mexborough) (Lab): It is a great
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley. As you know, we
are a rare breed in Parliament in that we are both Barnsley supporters.
There are few Barnsley supporters in this House apart from you, me and,
of course, Lord Mason in the other place. We recently had the privilege
of seeing Barnsley win against Swansea City in the league one play-offs
for a place in the championship. Later today is the World cup match,
and I am sure that we are all looking forward to England winning their
second World cup&#151;under a Labour Government, like last time. We
are tough on sport, but not soft on
crime.</div><a name="06061555000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the
comments of the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) do not really
reflect the debate on Second Reading, as far as I can see from
<i class="I">Hansard.</i> The Bill is very complicated, important and long and it
should be subject to detailed scrutiny. I draw his attention to the
remarks of the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) on
Second Reading, who
said:</div><a name="06061555000149"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
broadly support the Bill. As it has nearly 1,000 clauses, it is
pleasing that we have to disagree with only a handful of them. We are
glad that the Government have moved towards our position on some of the
issues that remain before us.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 6

the hon. Member for Reigate rightly said, it is a long Bill&#151;925
clauses&#151;but as the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton said,
there is an all-party consensus on many clauses. The Minister referred
to that, and she is willing to go as far as possible to accommodate
Opposition Members.</div>

Blunt:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Illsley. We are eight
minutes from the conclusion of the debate and it appears that the
Government are in some difficultly. Two issues arise from the programme
motion, on which they may lose a vote unless something changes before
9.30. If paragraph (3) of the programme motion were withdrawn, it would
be acceptable to us. However, I understand that we are constrained by a

whether there is any way we can escape our current
dilemma.</div><a name="06061555000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000207"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point,
but I am advised that we cannot amend the programme motion at this

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000208"></a>Jeff
Ennis:</b> I thought the hon. Gentleman was going to comment
on what I was saying.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 8</div><a name="06061555000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Labour
Members are looking for consensus, which the hon. Member for Rutland
and Melton mentioned on Second Reading. He went on to
say:</div><a name="06061555000150"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
reports, consultations and reviews on which the Bill is based argued
for putting deregulation and a &#147;think small first&#148;
approach at the heart of company law. The Bill that has come to us,
much amended in another place, is broadly to be supported. In many
areas it deregulates and simplifies existing law, for which companies
will be grateful.&#148;</div> <a name="06061555000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
again, as far as I am concerned, that underlines the consensus on
Labour and Opposition Benches. It also underlines the fact that in the
other place many points raised by the Opposition were taken on board by
Ministers. We are very much looking for consensus.</div>
<a name="06061555000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman
continued:</div><a name="06061555000151"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
shared objective with business is that it should achieve sustainable
economic growth.&#148;</div> <a name="06061555000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
have I heard that expression before? The Chancellor of the Exchequer
will probably use that phrase in Treasury questions at 10.30, because
Labour Members have used it for almost 10 years since we came to power.
We are trying to put deregulation first and to accommodate small
businesses. That is the tenor of the
Bill.</div><a name="06061555000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman went on to
say:</div><a name="06061555000152"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Against
those measures, much of the Bill stands up very well. Existing company
legislation needs revision so that it better reflects modern business
practice and technological developments such as electronic
communications.</div> <a name="06061555000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
absolutely right. We need to reflect the modern business environment
and the modern business ethos. That is exactly what the Bill is trying
to achieve by bringing company law into the 21st
century.</div><a name="06061555000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also
said:</div><a name="06061555000153"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Small
business and private companies have in the past suffered from having to
comply with requirements that were designed for larger public
companies. The Bill goes some way towards rectifying that. We support,
for example, the provision that one person alone can set up a company
and that he will not have to appoint a company secretary, although they
may choose to do so if they so wish. The requirement to hold an annual
general meeting was a burdensome formality&#151;it was a nuisance for
some small firms. It is the recognition of these issues in the Bill
that we thoroughly
support.&#148;</div><a name="06061555000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
absolutely right.</div><a name="06061555000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
future of this country will be based on small and medium-sized
enterprises, and the Government are doing everything in their power to
try to encourage and foster the growth of
SMEs.</div><a name="06061555000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061555000209"></a><b class="B">Mr.

the season, let alone a football club that had managed to avoid
relegation. Does he agree that that is precisely the sort of
organisation that we must be careful not to stifle with regulation?
Many companies are doing their best to survive, let alone prosper and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000238"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> Thank you, Mr, Illsley. Members of the public who
are attending proceedings might be slightly confused by the process,
but that is a consequence of programming. What has happened this
morning reflects a mismanagement and mishandling of legislation in that
the House of Commons is being presented in June with the biggest Bill
that it is ever going to
consider.</div><a name="06061555000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are right
up against a deadline because the parties represented here all want to
get the legislation on the statute book before the end of the
parliamentary Session. However, it is essential that we do so in good
order, with the Bill having been properly considered not only by
Members, but with the benefit of advice from all the experts in
corporate law whose fortunes depend&#151;as do those of all of us in
the United Kingdom&#151;on the legislation providing the right
framework for company law and the creation of wealth in this
country.</div> <a name="06061555000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the end
of the process in another place, the Government accepted that the
measure would be a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 11</div>consolidation measure, so that one would be able to use the Company Law
Reform Act, which is what the Bill will be upon enactment, to find the
source of company law. The Minister shakes her
head.</div><a name="06061555000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000239"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> It is not that the entirety of the Bill is a
consolidation matter. I assure Opposition Members that if we undertake
further consolidation that leads to Government new clauses being
tabled&#151;the programme motion suggests that the parts of the Bill
affected will be dealt with later in the Committee&#146;s
consideration&#151;those further clauses will be entirely
consolidation clauses and will make no change to existing statute or
case
law.</div><a name="06061555000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000240"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> As the Minister will understand, that is not quite
as straightforward an exercise as it would appear, because the
presentation of such legislation would obviously interact with other
elements of the Bill.</div>
<a name="06061555000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000241"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I entirely accept that that is not straightforward,
which is why I have given assurances to the spokesmen for both
Opposition parties that we will share with them the drafting of those
consolidation clauses as soon as we can, and we intend to involve the
Law Society in that. By the time the Committee is ready to consider
those clauses, I hope that many of the experts and stakeholders will
have had the chance to give them appropriate
consideration.</div><a name="06061555000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000242"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving an
undertaking, when her Department is ready, to share the drafting of the
new legislation with the Law Society, other experts and the Opposition
parties. That illustrates the precise point that we are making, and
shows the assistance that the Opposition are attempting to give the
Government in order that they can avoid what might be described as the
parliamentary pugilism of driving legislation through to a fixed
timetable.</div> <a name="06061555000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister is not in a position today to give us or the Law Society or
anyone else that legislation. Why? It is difficult and complicated and
technical to produce. Her draftsmen, who are hard pressed with all
sorts of other legislation and have necessarily limited resources, are
working to the deadline of 13 July. This morning&#146;s events give
us the opportunity to go back to the House and say that that date is
too soon, and to take up the suggestion made by the hon. Member for
Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) on Second Reading that the
consolidation measures should be considered when Parliament returns
after the summer
recess.</div><a name="06061555000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
suggestion, made by both Opposition parties, would give the draftsmen
and the Minister&#146;s departmental officials sufficient time to
ensure that the legislation proceeded in good order. We concede that
the Bill should be enacted by the end of the parliamentary Session. It
has the necessary support to achieve that, but it is our duty as
legislators to get it on the statute book in the best possible order,
so that it is technically correct and competent.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 12</div><a name="06061555000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal
is that the Committee should sit until 19 October&#151;that would
give us the possibility of eight more sittings&#151;to consider the
consolidation measures. That would allow an extra two and a half months
during the summer. It strikes me that that would allow us sensibly to
discharge our primary duty as legislators&#151;we have a
responsibility to the public to get it
right.</div><a name="06061555000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">For whatever
reason, the Government will not take that opportunity, and insist that
the Committee complete its scrutiny by 13 July. We have the opportunity
to change that this morning, and I am at a loss to understand why we do
not when we concede that we want this legislation on the statute book
by the end of the
Session.</div><a name="06061555000095"></a>

the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly), who appears to want
to intervene, is leading for the Conservatives on the substance of the
Bill and is being advised by a large number of experts in the City
whose profession we are dealing with. This is their opportunity to have
arguments tested in public debate in a Committee of the House of
Commons and to convince the Minister of the merits of those largely
technical arguments and of the technical changes that will come about
during our proceedings. Those proceedings are being curtailed, which
reduces our opportunity to achieve that objective as
legislators.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 13</div><a name="06061555000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000247"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister said that my hon. Friend the Member
for Rutland and Melton mentioned that we agree with all but a handful
of clauses. That is correct, but the Minister is being disingenuous in
so far as that does not mean that we do not want to amend many of the
clauses with which we agree. If she examines the selection list, which
is sitting in front of her, she will see that we have tabled more than
100 amendments to the first 100
clauses.</div><a name="06061555000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000248"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Indeed, I am yet
to mention the number of Government amendments that have been tabled.
We are doing precisely the job that the Government are doing: taking
the opportunity of consideration in Committee to make changes to the
Bill.</div><a name="06061555000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in
receipt of advice, as the Minister and her colleagues in the Department
are, and we are trying to improve the legislation. We have the
opportunity to take longer to do that and to produce a better Bill, but
the Government are not giving us the opportunity under this
motion.</div>
<a name="06061555000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000249"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Perhaps it would be helpful if I simply said that
many Government amendments arise from issues that were debated in
another place. In some cases, we gave undertakings to revisit the
wording of particular clauses, which is what we are doing now, so we
are meeting them. In others, the amendments are consequential and arise
from issues that, again, were discussed in another place. Tidying up
needs to be done throughout the Bill. That is from where most
Government amendments originate. During the sitting, I shall do a
calculation on
those.</div><a name="06061555000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">A large number
of the amendments tabled for consideration have already been fully
discussed in another place. They are technical, not of substance. A
technical response was given by us in another place and does not need
necessarily to be given again today, although I shall do so if that is
required. If the Opposition are concerned that there is insufficient
time for proper consideration of issues that are important to them in
getting the legislation right, they ought to focus their amendments on
those
matters.</div><a name="06061555000174"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="06061555000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000250"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> Sitting underneath the assumptions of that
argument, there is a rather dreadful arrogance about the role of the
House of Commons and the duty of the Committee. It is not only the duty
of the Government to come forward. Otherwise, why are we
here?</div><a name="06061555000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
no one here expected to do anything or to make any contribution to the
legislative process? I regret to say that that is the way that the
Government have treated the House of Commons. Programming is a classic
example of that, curtailing as it does the ability of the House of
Commons to produce better legislation. A careful selection has been
made of hon. Members to sit on our side of the Committee, who are able
to make a contribution because of their experience.</div>
<a name="06061555000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening), due to her accountancy
experience, will be invited to speak for Her Majesty&#146;s
Opposition from the Front Bench on those sections that relate to
accountancy. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 14</div>(Mr. Davies) is an experienced company director who can speak with
authority on those elements of the Bill. My hon. Friends the Members
for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones) and for North-West
Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara) are solicitors with considerable
experience in corporate law. We have put on the Committee people with
the ability to make a
contribution.</div><a name="06061555000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friends the Members for Huntingdon and for Hornchurch (James
Brokenshire) have been in receipt of a considerable amount of
professional advice in their preparation for leading for Her
Majesty&#146;s Opposition on the Bill. That has been technical, with
a team of more than 30 solicitors being brought in to advise them.
Similarly sized teams were advising my noble Friends in the other
place.</div><a name="06061555000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are taking
our duties seriously in trying to produce the best legislation so as to
enable the wealth creation of the UK not to be prejudiced by us getting
it wrong in the House of Commons. By tabling the programme motion and
insisting on the timetable of ending consideration on 13 July, the
Government are not enabling the House to do its job. That is why we
will oppose the motion and invite the Government to think again to give
them the time to propose consolidation measures in good order over the
summer. The process can take place in
October.</div><a name="06061555000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061555000251"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Shailesh Vara</b> (North-West Cambridgeshire) (Con): Thank you
for calling me, Mr. Illsley, and I welcome you to the Committee as
Chairman.</div><a name="06061555000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
comment briefly on the Minister&#146;s remarks. While I am sure that
my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton will be delighted that
he is being quoted so freely in Committee, the Minister mentioned that
he had said that we disagree with only a few clauses. However, she must
appreciate that the Bill&#146;s purpose is to minimise litigation and
maximise efficacy for the practising of company
law.</div><a name="06061555000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
should appreciate that even one word, if not properly considered, could
lead to litigation costing hundreds of millions of pounds. It is
disingenuous to dismiss the argument by referring to our disagreement
with only a handful of clauses when one word alone, if not properly
thought through, could make life miserable and lucrative for lawyers,
but not for business
people.</div><a name="06061555000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000252"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs (Vera
Baird):</b> First, I deplore the use of the word
&#147;disingenuous&#148;, which has been used twice about my right
hon. Friend the Minister for Industry and the Regions. It ought not to
be used. It has been used by the hon. Gentleman&#151;I am grateful to
him for giving way&#151;and by the hon. Member for Huntingdon. It is
not necessary to use language of that kind. It is not correct to use it
either.</div> <a name="06061555000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend has made it clear that in her view the Opposition are repeating,
tediously and unnecessarily, technical amendments that have already
been considered in the Lords and dealt with, and which met with huge
agreement from the Government. If that is the case, what are the
Opposition playing
at?</div><a name="06061555000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000253"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> May I clarify the purpose? Many submissions have
been made by outside bodies&#151;the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 15</div>Law Society was referred to with reverence&#151;and another place has
considered the amendments in detail, but the Committee is responsible
for the final
decision.</div><a name="06061555000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
unhealthy presumption&#151;if I may say so, Sir&#151;that
everything that has been submitted by everyone else is to be taken as
read and that this is simply to be an exercise in submitting
things.</div><a name="06061555000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000254"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I have just made a calculation that will interest
the Committee. Two thirds of the Opposition amendments tabled for part
2&#151;I shall come back with calculations on the other
parts&#151;are identical or very similar to those that were discussed
in huge detail in another place. The hon. Gentleman suggests that
somehow all the stakeholders and experts whom we have consulted since
1998 in formulating the clauses have suddenly appeared on the scene in
the past week when Opposition Members in the House of Commons started
to take an interest in the Bill. That is simply
wrong.</div><a name="06061555000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">This has been
an incredibly inclusive process, and there has been much consensus
among all the experts who have an interest in the Bill. Are Opposition
Members sincerely concerned with improving the Bill? We are sitting
here at 10.21, after almost two thirds of this morning&#146;s
sitting, discussing process, not content. That does not appear to me to
be the best
way&#151;</div><a name="06061555000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000255"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> Intervention or
speech?</div><a name="06061555000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000256"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> No. This does not appear to me to be the best way
to use parliamentary time, which is always
precious.</div><a name="06061555000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000257"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister for reminding us
that so many outside bodies have contributed to the Bill. Indeed, it is
because of that that the Government have regularly changed their mind,
clause by clause. It is ironic that the Government, who feel that they
have a right to change their mind, are not willing to give Her
Majesty&#146;s Opposition time properly to consider the outside views
and make their contribution.</div>
<a name="06061555000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I conclude simply by saying
that the Minister rightly commented that we have not been able to make
progress, but that is no fault of ours. Perhaps if there were less
arrogance on the Government side in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 16</div>assuming that there would be total co-operation from those on the
Opposition Benches&#151;that would be a dereliction of our
duty&#151;and perhaps if some Labour Members took the Bill seriously
and took the trouble to attend the Committee, we might not be in the
difficulty to which she
refers.</div><a name="06061555000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061555000258"></a><b class="B">Lorely
Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): May I register the disappointment of
my party over the lack of change to the programme motion? The irony has
not been lost on the Liberal Democrats that the nominal change to the
deadline&#151;one hour&#151;happens to be exactly the time that we
are spending on reorganising the programme motion. The Government say
that they will be conciliatory, but it does not feel that way on this
side of the
Committee.</div><a name="06061555000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000259"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Will the hon. Lady give
way?</div><a name="06061555000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000260"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> Not for
speeches.</div><a name="06061555000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000261"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Certainly not for speeches. I am somewhat surprised
by the hon. Lady&#146;s intervention, because at the conciliatory
original meeting about programming, she agreed with the Government on
the motion that we put before the
Committee.</div><a name="06061555000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000262"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her elucidation,
but the Bill has been more than seven years in the preparation. When an
opportunity manifested itself to implement the suggestion of my hon.
Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton to increase the time for
discussion by four days, given seven years of preparation and the
enormous amount of time that has already been taken up in another
place, that did not seem to be too much to ask of the Government, who
said that they would try to accommodate
us.</div><a name="06061555000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06061555000263"></a><b class="B">Kitty
Ussher</b> (Burnley) (Lab): If that is the case, why did the

motion?</div><a name="06061555000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06061555000264"></a>The

will sit next. Using my powers as Chairman and in accordance with
