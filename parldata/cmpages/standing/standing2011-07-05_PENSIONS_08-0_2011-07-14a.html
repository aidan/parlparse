Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Steve
Webb):<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000446">&#160;</a>
                     </span>
                  </strong> Good afternoon, Miss Clark. We were discussing
information about pensions for employers and employees, particularly in
the context of auto-enrolment. As I said this morning, I very much
welcome the opportunity to discuss these important questions. For
reasons that I shall come to later, I am not sure that new clause 8
delivers what one would want, but the matters are none the less
important and I am happy to address them.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For those who
seek it, there certainly needs to be a place where people can find
pensions information. The principal place for that is the
Government’s website Directgov, which gives information about
all pensions, both state and private, and includes signposting to other
sources of information if necessary. However, I repeat what I said this
morning: the problem with information is that people have to know that
they want or need it, and they need to know where to go. It is not
sufficient to make it available; we have to direct people to it, even
tailoring information for the individual, rather than merely using
websites for people to use online—if they know how to use
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Erith and Thamesmead and others properly asked what the
Government are doing to ensure that people know more about pensions,
particularly in the context of auto-enrolment. For employers, the
principal duty will fall on the Pensions Regulator. It is the regulator
that has the compliance duty. The regulator will alert firms 12 months
before the staging date that they will have that duty in a
year’s time, and will contact them again nearer the time. We are
already working with the regulator, which is now talking to firms and
testing materials.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000028">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We will
supply the employer with templates and literature so that, for example,
the small manufacturer mentioned this morning who does not want to be
engaged in this will be able to download standard literature that can
be sent to employees in fulfilment of that duty. Even though
auto-enrolment is more than a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 288<a class="bkMark" name="Column288">&#160;</a>
                  </div>year away, the detailed guide that the regulator has already published
on its website has been downloaded more than 20,000 times. I hope that
is 20,000 firms rather than one person having trouble with his
computer.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The idea is
that the regulator will be proactive in communicating with firms. The
regulator has an up and running telephone helpline for those with
inquiries. Employers often ask what they should tell their employees.
The Department for Work and Pensions is developing an information
package that employers can make available to employees in the
workplace, and we are doing some of that material on a range of
employers. We are seized of the need to give firms good
information.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We believe
that individuals, too, need good information. The Government will be
spending in the order of £10 million on communications. It will
be done in stages. In the early stages, the emphasis will be on selling
the notion of how important it is to save—not necessarily saving
for pensions but sowing the seeds. We will start that work this autumn
to get the idea into people’s minds. We shall be saying simple
things such as, “You can probably expect to have 20 years in
retirement.” We will not be saying, “You’re going
to live until 97.23 years” or whatever it is; we want to give
people a feel for it so that they say, “Twenty years in
retirement? Gosh, is it as long as that?” We shall be saying
that the basic pension will pay for the basics of life, but that if
people want more they will have to save. We will be trying to
communicate those simple messages.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In the new
year, we will gradually build up the auto-enrolment link
communications. It is a partnership. We have already heard of the
excellent work being done by the National Employment Savings Trust
through its website and its communications strategy. The private
pensions industry will be doing the same. We will be working with the
Pensions Regulator and undertaking work ourselves. Some of this will be
done online. For example, if “pensions” is entered into
Google it will not be my face that pops up but something far more
enticing—information about auto-enrolment. <em>[Interruption.]
</em>For a small fee, perhaps. It will be a web-based solution, after
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The idea is
that people will be directed to information. The point of the exercise
in the build-up to auto-enrolment in summer 2012 and beyond is that
there will be a cumulative effect. Obviously, a lot of the work force
will not be able to enrol until some years later, so we have to target
communication. We know the large firms that will be the first to be
auto-enrolled and so can focus on them in our
strategy.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Briefly,
I flag a little-heralded organisation called TPAS—the Pensions
Advisory Service—which, although I never thought I would say
these words, could be regarded as part of the big society. It is
Government-funded but also involves voluntary experts answering phone
calls and helping with technical pensions questions. I visited TPAS
recently and it is a superb organisation. I say to all hon. Members on
the Committee that if constituents have a difficult pensions question,
it is always worth giving them the phone number for TPAS, which can
often give some very specific information.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000034">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I had a
question about trivial commutation from a constituent and thought,
“Oh my goodness, what shall I do?” I rang TPAS—I
did not admit who I was—and it was brilliant. The chap on the
phone said, “Yes, I know the chap who wrote the legislation, I
will give him a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 289<a class="bkMark" name="Column289">&#160;</a>
                  </div>call,” and I quickly got the answer that I
needed. I do not suppose someone would always get such service, but the
general point is that we are working in partnership with TPAS and with
the Money Advice Service, which is what the Consumer Financial
Education Body or CFEB has now become. We are working in partnership
with such organisations to provide what is called in the trade a
seamless customer journey, by which we mean everything from expert help
for people who have complex queries to basic information. We are
putting money into call-centre capacity so that people have
places to
phone.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
strategy will be a mixture of general publicity and awareness about the
need to save and tailored information, through the Pensions Regulator
for employers, and NEST, the pensions industry and Government reaching
out to individuals. In principle, the idea is fairly simple: many
people do not have a pension, they need to save more for their old age
and this is a scheme to overcome the hassle. Inevitably, however, if we
are not careful, pensions can be complex. We have issued a leaflet this
week about language, again echoing and complementary to some of
NEST’s work on using simple language to communicate. So I
absolutely accept the need for communication.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New clause 8
would give us a statutory duty to have one place for all the things
that someone could ever possibly want to know about pensions, but even
if we had that, we would not be satisfied because we do need to do a
lot more as well. We do not want only to stick the information
somewhere and say, “Go and find it.” We need to reach out
to people and to be proactive, to help firms and
individuals.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000037">&#160;</a>

for setting out the strategy to ensure that people understand the

discussions has he had with the TUC or other unions? Often, in my

advice, and unions can be a good source of advice on pensions

strategy, and the TUC was represented. Obviously, we have entirely
common interests in ensuring that trade union members and others are
properly informed. I assure the hon. Member for Erith and Thamesmead
that we want to make the system work, and we will co-operate with
valued organisations such as trade unions to that effect. I welcome the
chance to answer questions about the issues, which are important, and
although a statutory duty of the sort described is not necessary, I
thank the hon. Lady for moving the new

                  </strong> We are now in part 3 of the Bill,
which deals with a range of issues, one of which is the measurement of
inflation for pension purposes. Clause 15 relates to the use
of the consumer prices index for the indexation of pensions in payment,
and it relates to particular sorts of schemes. If satisfactory to you,
Miss Clark, and to other hon. Members, I suggest that we
discuss the merits—or otherwise—of CPI when we discuss
the next group of amendments, which includes clause stand part and new
clause 11. I will therefore 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 291<a class="bkMark" name="Column291">&#160;</a>
                  </div>restrict my remarks to amendments 38 to 43 and the
specific technical issue of the CPI underpin. I will discuss CPI more
substantively when we debate the next group of
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
the Committee will know, the Government have a role in setting a floor
for the indexation and revaluation of occupational pension rights. They
decided last summer that the measure of inflation used should be CPI
and not the retail prices index—we will discuss the reasons
behind that decision when we debate the next group of amendments. By
and large, that has a substantial beneficial effect on company pension
schemes because their liabilities are reduced if they are able to use
CPI. There are, however, pension schemes that have the words
“retail prices index” hard-wired into their
rules.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000045">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If CPI is set
as the minimum, in times when CPI is higher than RPI—such as in
September 2009—we could have a scheme that was, to use a
colloquial phrase, one of the good guys. The problem with that is that
someone providing what I suspect Labour Members would regard as good
revaluation—RPI every year—could find that the cost of
indexation had actually increased. Not only would they have to pay RPI
every year, but in years when CPI exceeds RPI, they would have to pay
CPI. Perversely, we have given those people who would use RPI anyway an
extra cost, and that was never our intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is
called the CPI underpin. The risk is that if we do not do something,
CPI will be applied even when it is bigger than RPI. That was not the
intention. Clause 15 states that it will be good enough for schemes to
index payments by RPI and that the Government are not going to come
back and say, “But CPI is higher this year, so you must use that
over and above
RPI.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000047">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
consulted on that issue. People often say that Governments do not
listen to consultation, but one point that came out of the consultation
and was raised in the House of Lords was, “That’s fine
for indexation, but what about revaluation?” In other words,
indexation happens once someone has retired regarding how their pension
is increased, as dealt with in clause 15, but revaluation happens once
someone leaves a scheme, up to pension age. We have not tackled a
possible CPI underpin for revaluation.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000048">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Potentially,
that does not matter much. Revaluation can take place over a period of
many years, and although CPI might be higher in the odd year, over a
run of five or 10 years, the overall impact of CPI as against RPI will
almost invariably show the RPI number to be bigger. For someone who has
many years of revaluation, that is immaterial. There could be
circumstances, however, where someone’s revaluation period, over
the whole revaluation linked to CPI, would be greater than RPI. That
was never our intention. Amendment 38 and associated amendments deal
with that by saying that if revaluation is by RPI, that will be good
enough. The Government will not insist on CPI revaluation, even if that
would have been
higher.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000049">&#160;</a>

We had over 150 responses—somebody reads these
documents, which is good. Many of those responses were detailed and
technical, but the issue of CPI underpin and revaluation attracted the
most comments. There were already concerns that the CPI underpin
provision in the Bill is too restrictive and does not help when
companies are restructuring. We have sought to respond positively on
those issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000052">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
have listened to the consultation. The amendment will add to schedule 3
of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 a new method of calculating a
revaluation, which means that schemes can continue calculating
revaluations using RPI. As for the linked amendments and making the
application of the CPI underpin to pensions in payment easier, we
accept that our original plans were too restrictive so, in response to
the consultation, the test now targets whether RPI-based increases have
actually been paid, not simply whether the rules require them. The
advice that we have received is that that will make life easier for
schemes, which want to do RPI. That is fine by us. The other issue is
transfers, and we do not want the possibility of a CPI underpin to
become a barrier to scheme restructuring, so the amendments ensure that
the provision to address the underpin problem survives a transfer if
the result is that the member has received RPI-based increases since
the start of 2011 and will
continue.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000053">&#160;</a>

want to put an inadvertent additional burden on schemes which want to
do RPI revaluation or RPI indexation. I commend the amendments to the

the changes in the Bill. It seeks that assessment from, among others,
pension scheme members, employers, taxpayers and Pension Protection
Fund levy payers, and would be an opportunity to reflect on the RPI-CPI
switch. We have been clear in debates on benefit uprating that we do
not support the decision to adopt permanently the consumer prices index
as currently constructed for the determination of benefit uprating and
of pension revaluation and indexation. While we support the use of CPI,
not RPI, in the short term as a means to reduce the deficit, we do not

                  </strong> There are two points that we need to consider.
First, as the Minister knows, there are moves to reform the consumer
prices index to include housing costs, so we would want to consider
that. Secondly, we have said that we support the use of CPI as a means
to reduce the budget deficit, and we do not know what the financial and
economic circumstances will be at the next election. For those reasons,
we will not be writing our manifesto for the next election now.
However, I can be clear that we do not think that CPI is the most
appropriate way of uprating pensions and other benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000068">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As Committee
members know, the PPF is funded by levy payers rather than taxpayers.
The Minister said earlier that, after consultation, the override for
occupational pensions was not applied by the Government, so why are the
Government going ahead with moving from RPI to CPI for the PPF, rather
than allowing the board of the PPF to make that decision about the
right way to uprate pension payments for those in the PPF?<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
will know that, last year, the PPF was in surplus by £396
million, so why is a change needed to the way in which the PPF makes
payments? In addition, he will know that pensions paid by the PPF that
are not already in payment are reduced by 10%. Does he think it is
right—on top of the 10% reduction to which pensions already paid
are subject—to further reduce the pensions of people who might,
if they were in an occupational pension scheme, have looked forward to
RPI uprating if they had stayed with their employer and if their
employer had not gone
bust?<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000070">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is our understanding of the process and legislation that we do not need
amendments to the Bill to secure changes to the way in which PPF
payments are uprated in future. The issue of uprating pensions,
including the basic state pension, state second pension, public sector
and occupational pensions is determined annually through statutory
instruments. These are now undertaken by the increase in the general
level of prices, which is generally not specified to be RPI or CPI, or
indeed any other measure. Therefore, a future Secretary of State could
take a different view on the most appropriate measure of the increase
in the general level of prices without the need to change primary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
situation with regard to the PPF is similar. Clause 15 removes
reference to the RPI and
substitutes<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000072">&#160;</a>

general level of prices in Great
Britain”.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000394">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>However,
that does not lock in the CPI for all time, so we do not in principle
object to that
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
change to uprating the various facets of pensions by CPI, subject to
statutory powers, will, as we know, have a significant impact,
particularly over time. On average, the RPI is 0.83 percentage points
higher than 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 295<a class="bkMark" name="Column295">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the CPI. So, in any given year, benefits linked to
CPI will give people 0.3% less income. The CPI figure for the year to
September 2010—for the last round of uprating—was 3.1%.
The equivalent RPI figure is 4.6%, so the difference at the moment
between the two indices that we are considering is 1.5 percentage
points. If the Government make this a permanent change, experts
estimate that that change could cost pensioners between 15% and 20% of
their retirement income. Indeed, in his report, Lord Hutton
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“This

have reduced the value of benefits to scheme members by around 15% on
average. When this change is combined with other reforms to date across
the major schemes the value to current members of reformed schemes with

schemes with RPI
indexation.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000396">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have accepted that for the basic state pension and for other benefits,
this is a necessary move for a time-limited period for deficit
reduction purposes. For private sector occupational schemes, the extent
to which the CPI ends up being used for revaluation and indexation
depends on the scheme rules, and we support the Government in not
pursuing the override. Nevertheless, the updated impact assessment
produced by the Department in February shows that the total cost of the
reduction in the anticipated value of members’ pension rights,
including the stop and flow of pensions, is £86 billion. That is
not a deficit reduction saving, but an almost equal and opposite
benefit for sponsoring employers, and there are consequential benefits
to the Pension Protection Fund and levy payers. The Pensions Policy
Institute has calculated that for public sector workers, the switch
could cost a median earner 4% a year at age 75 and 8% a year at age 85.
A deferred member of an occupational scheme who withdraws at age 40
could have their starting pension income reduced by around 20% by age
65.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Whether the
CPI should be the primary measure of inflation is still a subject of
much debate. The UK Statistics Authority has suggested that it should
be used, but only when the index of owner-occupied housing costs is
included, which is not now. The Royal Statistical Society has
questioned whether the coverage of the CPI makes it appropriate for all
purposes. On noting that the CPI’s methodology has many
supporters, the RSS questions whether the comprehensive use of the
geometric mean at the lowest level of aggregation is the best approach
for products for which consumers are typically slow to substitute
expensive outfits, brands or varieties for cheaper ones. It

what the Royal Statistical Society is saying, that while the CPI is
acceptable for macro-economic purposes, its coverage is not appropriate

measure for targeting inflation but another for inflation compensation
purposes. That seems to be an entirely consistent view. However, having

I am sure hon. Members understand, there are two differences between
the RPI and the CPI. The first relates to coverage. The CPI does not

insurance, council tax and other measures associated with living in a
home, which most people do even if they have no mortgage. The second
difference is between the use of the arithmetic and the geometric mean.

               <p class="tabbed">The
Government have made a virtue of using the same measure of inflation
for both purposes, but is it necessarily right to make one index as
relevant to pensioners and those on benefits as to macroeconomic
management? Age UK has created what it calls a silver retail prices
index that better reflects pensioners’ spending patterns and,
therefore, the inflation rate for pensioners. That measure of inflation
differs from others because pensioners have different spending patterns
from other groups. The Minister says that the CPI is more appropriate
for pensioners than the RPI, but Age UK has specifically looked at how
older people spend their money and, on its measure, those aged over 55
have experienced price rises almost 2 percentage points above that
suggested by the headline RPI figures since the beginning of 2008,
rising to 4 percentage points for those aged over
75.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000088">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
pattern is not surprising, because we all know that older people spend
a higher proportion of their income on energy costs and food, the
prices of which have been rising at a faster rate in the past few
years. To change from the RPI to the CPI when pensioners face higher
inflation compared with the overall RPI, let alone with the CPI, seems
particularly unfair to them. If the Government want a measure of
inflation that is more appropriate to pensioners, they should consider
the evidence from Age UK and others showing that, rather than being
lower than the RPI, inflation for older people is usually
higher.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000089">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
gap between real and headline inflation for older people over that
period has cost the average 60-year-old £620 a year, and that
figure rises to more than £700 for someone aged between 65 and
69. That is mainly down to the different impact that fuel and energy
price increases, reductions in savings rates, increases in mortgage
interest payments and so on have on older versus younger
people’s spending
power.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000090">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have tabled the new clause because, as the change has such profound
consequences, the Government should certainly monitor and consider its
impact. We oppose making a commitment to a long-term change, when there
is no settled view on the CPI index as it is currently constructed.
Given the long-term nature of pensions policy, we should move away from
the status quo only with caution and after having made a full analysis,
which we are still
lacking.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000091">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
should also consider the expectations built into the current system,
not least those of millions of workers who believe that they have been
unfairly dealt with over the change from the RPI to the CPI. They
believed that they had built up accrued rights to a pension that would
be uprated in line with the RPI rather than with the lower CPI. The
Minister has said
that<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000092">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>but
many people feel that that promise is not being kept. The
new clause seeks only an ongoing basis for analysing the consequences
of the shift from the RPI to the CPI. It also carries with it the
statement that we do not want to commit ourselves to the CPI index
permanently. I hope that the Government will at least agree to look
at the impact of that switch on pensioners and their living
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000093">&#160;</a>

there is a perfectly proper discussion to be 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 298<a class="bkMark" name="Column298">&#160;</a>
                  </div>had about the measurement and technical appraisal of
inflation. How do we measure inflation for people whom we rather
quaintly refer to as pensioners? Interestingly, when we meet fathers
and mothers, we do not call them child benefit recipients, so it is
curious that a whole group of our society is named after the social
security benefit that they receive. I shall put that to one side, but I
may use the term later to show my inconsistency on the matter. On
measuring inflation, my colleague has expressed concern about the
effect of rising gas and electricity prices on many elderly people. We
should discuss such matters authoritatively and see whether there might
be better measures in future.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000094">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">No doubt
later the Minister will wax eloquent and, as usual, very technical
about the superiority of CPI over RPI, but if CPI gave more generous
pensions to elderly people than RPI, would he be supporting it? It
beggars belief that he would say, “Well, actually, in recent
years CPI has been a percentage point or so more and is likely to be so
in future. That’s rather good for elderly people, because they
will get greater pensions. I am so technically committed to the measure
that I have fought the good fight with the Treasury. I have found the
extra millions for state pensions and I have recommended using
CPI.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000095">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The fact is
that the Minister will present his good, academic, technical appraisal
of CPI—the glory surrounding it and the halo over
it—because actually it is meaner, in terms of pension
beneficiaries in most years, than RPI. That is the reality of the
matter. I shall not be surprised if the Minister has a good argument
against me, because he argues well. However, I use the phrase again: it
beggars belief.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000096">&#160;</a>

will he explain two things? The first is table 2 —he knows it
well, but it is on page 9—and the assumptions about the
proportion of schemes with particular indexation and revaluation rules.
I find that table slightly complicated, but clearly it shows that a
significant number of schemes have rules stating that RPI should rule
the waves. I cannot work out whether it is 25%, or 25% plus 51%. I have
seen an estimate that perhaps 80% of schemes or something of that order
are still pursuing RPI, so many schemes will continue in that way. I
give him notice that it is relevant to the PPF argument, when it will
not apply, and I will raise that later. I should be grateful if the
Minister will talk to us about that in plain
arithmetic.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000110">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has touched on table 3 over the page, but will he explain at
slightly greater length the two issues: revaluation, which is
important, and indexation going forward? When looking at that table,
will he also ensure that I understand it properly? These things may be
complicated, but when it refers to a decline in liabilities of 20% or
so for both men and women, does that mean that over time their real
pension, compared with what it would have been under RPI, will decline
by 20%? That seems to be the common-sense interpretation, but sometimes
it is not as simple as that. That would seem to accord with the shadow
Minister’s figures. No one knows what will happen to RPI and
CPI, but we are talking about substantial declines from the status quo
in what people’s occupational pensions will be in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000111">&#160;</a>

the issues extensively in the debate on the revaluation order, but
since then we have published a revised impact assessment. The hon.
Member for Leeds West quoted the February impact assessment, and I
remind the House that we published it on 12 July. It indicated a
slightly lower impact on pensions. The hon. Lady quoted a figure of
£86 billion, but the revised impact assessment, which is based
on fresh research and further detailed changes, reduces that estimate
to £73 billion. That is still a lot of money, but I
wanted to put on the record the fact that the estimate has been reduced

we are discussing the fundamental issue of CPI and RPI, it is worth
reminding the Committee why we are here. When we were elected in May
2010, indexation of pensions and benefits that had taken place a month
earlier was based on inflation in the year to September 2009. That was
a peculiar year, because the RPI was negative and the CPI was
positive.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000114">&#160;</a>

pension been frozen?” or, “Why has my public sector
pension been frozen?” My answer was, “Don’t you
realise that inflation was negative?” Funnily enough, I could
not sign those letters with a straight face, because I am yet to meet
anyone who thinks that the movement in the retail prices
index in the 12 months to September 2009 was an accurate

their money on and what has happened to food and fuel prices, it would
be hard to maintain that inflation is not higher. There are other
periods when the opposite is true. The hon. Lady quoted the Age UK
silver RPI, which covers a limited time period, but over a two-decade
time period, there is no systematic difference between pensioner
inflation and non-pensioner inflation. Clearly there are times, as now,
when pensioner inflation may be higher because of the basket of goods
impact, but there are times when it is lower. There is no evidence of a

taxpayer who gets the winter fuel payment, but the cold weather payment
recipient—the poorest pensioner, disabled person or family with
young children. We trebled Labour’s planned level of payment.

                  </strong> To explain to the hon. Lady, Governments publish
spending plans beyond the current year and those plans are based on
policies. The Department for Work and Pensions published spending plans
that went well into this Parliament. We know the basis on which those

increase in the winter fuel payment would be reversed, and that cold

                  </strong> My hon. Friend is right, and that point is germane
to the discussions we will come on to about people who will get smaller
increases than they would have done by using CPI, but bigger increases
in the basic state pension. For the record, we estimate that anybody
with a pension of £800 or less a month will do better through
the combination of the triple lock and CPI than they would have done
under a continuation of previous policies. It is true that people with
large occupational pensions will get smaller increases than they would
have done, but I regard the combined impact of our provisions as
relatively progressive, which I am sure will go down well with the
Labour party.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000134">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On the basket
of goods in the index, we want something that is fit for purpose. The
problem with RPI based on mortgage interest is that most pensioners do
not pay mortgages any more—the percentage varies a little bit,
but it is a minority sport. When interest rates are falling, as they
did dramatically in the year before September 2009, that creates a
double whammy for pensioners. Not only does headline RPI fall or go
negative and they receive no increase in their pension, but their rate
of savings falls at the same time. As the hon. Member for Leeds West
said, just at the point that pensioners need extra help, we kick them
in the teeth by not measuring inflation appropriately.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000135">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is a
strong case on the basis of the basket of goods, but I will also
mention that the much-hallowed RPI deliberately and specifically
excludes the poorest quarter of pensioners. The idea that RPI is the
best possible way of indexing pensions, even when it excludes the
spending patterns of the poorest pensioners about whom we are most
concerned, seems a bit odd.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000136">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is a
discussion about CPI, and CPI including owner-occupier housing
costs—just for the record, the hon. Member for Leeds West might
have been understood 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 303<a class="bkMark" name="Column303">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to say that housing costs are not in the CPI. Rent, which for many
pensioners is more important than mortgage interest, is in the CPI, and
it is important to put that on the record. Owner-occupier housing costs
are not incorporated, and the CPI advisory committee has looked at how
those might be included. Interestingly, it rejected the idea of simply
plonking in mortgage interest payments, which is how it is done using
RPI. However, it is doing a detailed programme of work, which I believe
will conclude over the next year or two, to look at ways of including
owner-occupier housing costs. I have repeatedly said on the record that
we will look at that programme once we have it—we cannot do that
now because it does not exist—and see whether that would be a
more appropriate measure. We are entirely open to the possibility of
finding a good way of including owner-occupier housing costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000137">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The second
fundamental problem with RPI over CPI is the substitution effect. It is
the argument that, when prices change, people change their behaviour.
For example, rather than buying best cuts of meat, people might buy
cheaper cuts of meat or shop at a cheaper supermarket. People change
their behaviour, so the impact of price changes will depend on how
people respond. The Institute for Fiscal Studies looked at the
substitution effect in the CPI, not the RPI, and said that it was
“a sound rationale for the change”. In other words, its
judgment, that of the RSS to which the hon. Lady referred, and that of
several people is that RPI “arguably overstates
inflation” because it does not take account of the substitution
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000138">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are using a more robust, accurate measure of inflation in CPI. We are
open to new measures, which is why reference is not made to the
consumer prices index. We do not want to go through such matters again,
but each year—and slightly in relation to new clause
11—we have an uprating order, an uprating statement for debate
in the House and regulations introduced under the affirmative procedure
to give us an annual chance to debate the impact of
CPI.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000139">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
we have produced a detailed analysis of such matters. I often consider
that we go the extra mile. I am referring to the third version of the
impact assessment. I cannot think of the number of hours we have spent
on providing Parliament with accurate information about the impact of
CPI. Because most of the impact of CPI on occupational pension schemes
is about the accumulated liabilities, not the future impact—for
reasons I shall explain—it will not change very much if we
published a report in three years’
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000140">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">One of the
main reasons why the numbers are different in the most recent impact
assessments is that we have done what the Committee is asking us to do,
and have carried out detailed fieldwork research on occupational
pension schemes. We quickly discovered that they all have different
rules. The assessment is a detailed, thorough piece of work, tables 2
and 3 of which I shall refer to in response to the right hon. Member
for Croydon North. I hope that the Committee will welcome the fact
that, rather than say, “We shall not give you an impact
assessment for six months because we have not done the
fieldwork,” we give an early estimate and update it in light of
fresh research, which is what we have
done.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000145">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
response to the right hon. Gentleman’s specific questions about
tables 2 and 3, table 2 splits the 100% of occupational pension schemes
into four groups. That is based on whether the revaluation of the
entitlement of people who leave the scheme before pension age is on RPI
or the statutory basis, CPI, and whether the pensions in payment are
indexed according to RPI or the statutory basis, CPI. The numbers in
the cells add up with a bit of rounding to 99%—the universe of
100%. He quoted the 80% figure, which was our original estimate. If he
adds up the two numbers in the first row—indexation based on
RPI, regardless of the revaluation—he will see that it adds up
to 76%. We had previously estimated 80%, so notwithstanding what the
hon. Member for Leeds West said, I think that is pretty good. We had an
initial estimate before the field research of dozens of pension
schemes, and we came out with 76%, not
80%.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000146">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
for the 51%, we are discussing a percentage of schemes, not a
percentage of members, and if we picked a scheme at random, the most
likely scheme would be one in which, when pensions are in payment, they
are linked to RPI, but when the scheme revalues past service up to
pension age, it will do so by CPI. Under the 25% figure, both of those
processes are done by
RPI.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000147">&#160;</a>

revaluation that has the most significant impact on the pension paid?

                  </strong> It is the most significant in the sense that, as the
right hon. Gentleman will see from the table, three quarters of schemes
are using RPI for indexation. It is the revaluation that matters most
because more schemes are linked to the statutory minimum for
revaluation than for indexation. However, for any given individual, if
the person worked for the same employer up to pension age, it does not
matter at all because there is no revaluation, because the person is
still in employment. It will depend on when the person leaves the firm
and so on. In a sense, what the right hon. Gentleman says is true: the
indexation change has less impact because three quarters of the schemes
use RPI at the moment anyway. I hope that clarifies his questions on
table
2.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000149">&#160;</a>

and women, although, as the right hon. Gentleman will see from the

example, in the final column, we have what we call RPI RPI
schemes—schemes that revalue by and index by RPI, which is about
a quarter of the universe, as it were. Actually, without clause 15,
which does the CPI underpin, we have slightly increased liabilities,
but essentially it is zero. In the second column, in which we have the
most common sort of scheme, the RPI indexation has no effect, but the
revaluation does, and that is where the 16% reduction is. Just to
clarify the right hon. Gentleman’s question, it is the reduction
in pension scheme liabilities. The impact on individuals will vary
enormously according to age, length of service and so on. We have used
a stylised individual to get to those figures, but the answer will be
different for every individual. However, on average, that is the answer
to the

columns beyond the first one, and we divide the pensions universe into
those four columns. Half of all schemes are in the second, substantive
column—column three. A quarter of all schemes are in the final
column where there is no impact, so it is not correct to say that there
is an average 20%. If we happen to have CPI and CPI, a person gets done
by both, as it were. If someone gets done by CPI on revaluation and CPI
on indexation, and they are an average person leaving the scheme
15 years before the end on an average income with average
characteristics, it might be a 20% impact over the course of their
retirement. So it is an average worst-case scenario; that column
applies to less than one in five schemes. These are
averages.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000159">&#160;</a>

right hon. Gentleman was concerned—I think the hon. Member for
Leeds West asked about this—about the use of the CPI for the
Pension Protection Fund, which we may come on to in a separate clause.
The board of the Pension Protection Fund does not have discretion to
make up the rules; it implements the statutory rules of the fund. It
would be very odd to say to the PPF, “But, guys, pick your own
inflation rate.” The Chancellor of the Exchequer has indicated
that for the purposes of indexing social security benefits, state
earnings-related pensions and linked occupational pensions, we are
going to use CPI extensively and pretty comprehensively through
Government. To then say that the Pension Protection Fund down in
Croydon can measure inflation differently, even though it was set up by
the pensions legislation that the right hon. Gentleman was involved in,
would seem
inconsistent.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000167">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As I said, the Pension Protection Fund was in
surplus of, I think, about £396 million last year. This year, it
will reduce its levy by £120 million due to the shift from the
RPI to the CPI alone, and £600 million overall. The
PPF clearly does not need to be made financially viable. The levy is
paid by levy payers, not taxpayers, so it is different from state
pensions. I wonder why the Minister feels the need to change
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000168">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Bear with me a second; I am responding to the
previous point. As we have applied the CPI to the PPF, and because of
other changes—the PPF sets its levy based on a range of
considerations, but the hon. Lady is right in saying that that is a
substantive one—the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 307<a class="bkMark" name="Column307">&#160;</a>
                  </div>PPF has saved pension schemes, which means employers and pension scheme
members, because they are not separate entities, £120 million.
That is either £120 million more that can go into pensions, of
the sort that I assume the hon. Lady would approve of, or £120
million that British business does not have to find, which can help it
through the recession. The suggestion that somehow, because it is not
the taxpayer, it is of no great material importance seems
extraordinary.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000171">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> We managed to have a good scrutiny of Government
policy this morning. The Minister seems to be trying this afternoon to
put words in the mouths of Opposition politicians that they frankly
have not said. He decided not to override occupational pension schemes,
which I believe is the right thing to do. However, as a result, many
pension schemes will continue to pay out under the RPI. Does he
consider that to be a big cost to business? That shows a failure to
understand its concerns, yet the Minister seems to think that I do not
understand.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000172">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
PPF levy is reducing by £480 million this year, without the
£120 million, but I believe that the PPF levy is reducing by
£600 million. Perhaps the Minister can give us the figures of
this year’s reduction in the PPF levy. What is due to the shift
from RPI to CPI, and what is for other purposes? My understanding is
that that levy is falling anyway, so the burden on business is
falling.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000173">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am sure that I will be corrected if I am wrong. My
recollection is that the levy is falling from £720 million to
£600 million, so it is falling by £120 million
a year. I do not believe the PPF has published a breakdown of the
factors behind that, although CPI is clearly significant. I cannot give
a figure for the split because I do not think the PPF has published
one. However, it would be fair to say that the chances are it will be a
pretty big impact, which I think is entirely welcome. The fact that
pension schemes will not have to find that money is good news for the
schemes, employers and their
members.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000174">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important to note that the PPF was set up to reflect the statutory
minima. If we are putting CPI in as the minimum, it would be very odd
indeed to have a pension compensation arrangement that is more generous
than some of the schemes that it is providing insurance for, in terms
of indexation or revaluation. We will discuss PPF in more detail, but
the fundamental point that we risk losing sight of in the whole debate
is that we have a statutory duty to define the general increase in the
price level. We must do so properly. We cannot say, “We know
that inflation is really the RPI, but because we are broke, we are
going to pick a different number for a few years. We can’t even
promise in four years’ time that we won’t be broke, so we
will go on fiddling the inflation numbers until we have some money, and
then we will do proper inflation protection.” That seems to me
the unprincipled
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000175">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
principled approach seems to be to take a look at the detailed, careful
statistical work that has been done on the better measure of inflation.
People imply that the CPI is some number that someone wrote on the back
of a fag packet. The amount of meticulous, careful 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 308<a class="bkMark" name="Column308">&#160;</a>
                  </div>statistical work that goes into creating the Bank of England’s
headline measure of inflation is extraordinary and well beyond me. To
then say that it does not measure inflation properly is extraordinary.
Our judgment is that across the board, for indexing benefits, tax
credits, public sector pensions and state earnings-related pensions, we
need to have a consistent measure of inflation, properly constructed,
with a basket of goods that works and which properly reacts to price
changes. That is what we believe the CPI does, but we do not have a
closed mind on the matter. If the experts come back to us and say that
we can do a better CPI that includes owner-occupied costs in a new way,
we will certainly look at doing so.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000176">&#160;</a>

are we doing for pensioners? For 30 years pensioners were left behind
and we have done something about that. Secondly, does it keep pace with
the cost of living? We have taken a judgment on how that is best
measured. Thirdly, do we want to insult people by giving them pennies?

effect. We could produce another report in three years’ time,

different. The impact assessment is thorough on those points. We have
an annual uprating statement, which we debate every year, so I am not
convinced that we need yet another report in three years’ time.

clause 15.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000189">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I found the tone of the debate on the probing new
clause disappointing, both from the Minister and from some hon. Members
on the Opposition Benches. The point of Committee is to scrutinise the
Bill; the point of the new clause is to scrutinise the shift from the
RPI to the CPI. We might have done that in a way that produced more
light than steam.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000190">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
said that the Government would have looked at the shift from the RPI to
the CPI whether or not financial savings were to be made in the
measure. Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon North, I find
that quite incredible, because the shift was part of the package of
measures to save money in the welfare budget. There is nothing wrong
with trying to save money, but the Minister should at least be honest
about why the Government are pursuing the policy. He can hide behind
his briefings and his special cases, but in reality, the measures will
cause pensioners to be worse off in future. People contributing to
pensions will get lower pensions in retirement than before, including
those who have been paying in to pensions thinking that they would be
uprated by the retail prices index, who now find that they will be
uprated by the consumer prices index. The provision would be laughed
out of court by every pensioner who knows the reality of their level of
inflation. The cost of their shopping and utility bills is going up and
up, and the shift from the RPI to the CPI does nothing to help them. As
my right hon. Friend said, the Minister is pursuing these policies
because they are meaner. That is why the Government are supporting
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000191">&#160;</a>

this: compensation derived from pensionable service on or after 6

compensation, which helps members of failed defined-benefit

introduction to an important subject. I should put a clarification on
the record about how, when the Bill establishing the Pension Protection
Fund was given Royal Assent, the decision was made to locate it in
Croydon. My hands were nowhere near it; the decision was made by
officials, partly because Croydon is usefully about halfway, by train,
between the DWP and the Pensions Regulator in Brighton. It was nothing
to do with me, and my officials were not very astute, because it is in
Croydon Central rather than Croydon
North.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000217">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
a prelude, it might be helpful briefly to remind the Committee why the
PPF and its small brother or sister, the financial assistance scheme,
were established. Before the Pensions Act 2004, there was a growing
scandal in this country, about which all parties were concerned and
which was championed by many colleagues from both sides of the House.
Companies were going bust with defined-benefit or so-called final
salary schemes, with the consequence that, through no fault of the
workers or the existing pensioners, people risked losing not
all—I will not exaggerate—but a very large proportion of
their pension, perhaps receiving only 20% or 30% rather than 100% of
it. Many workers and pensioners lobbied Parliament and it was a great
cause célèbre, if that is not the wrong
phrase.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000218">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
real hero was Ian McCartney, the Pensions Minister, who was very much
seized by the issue and was determined to do something about it.
Therefore, although the DNA test would show some paternity on my part,
I would not want to claim the credit. Therefore, although the DNA test

the PPF delivers—the Minister will correct me if I am out of
date of this—90% of what the pension entitlement would have been
for existing employees, and 100% of the pension for existing
pensioners. However, that is subject to a cap, so that those who would
have not large pensions, but pensions above a certain level would get
only a certain amount; the Minister may have the figures with him now.
That led to some aggrievement, but by and large it was a sensible
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000220">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
way in which it is funded, which is not without difficulty or
controversy, as we have already heard, is by imposing a levy on DB or
the so-called final-salary schemes. In a sense, as an insurance
premium, those people would have to pay a certain risk-based amount. I
am a bit out of date on how that risk basis is worked out, but it is
risk-based. A well funded scheme would still pay a levy, but a smaller
amount than a scheme that looked slightly risky.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000221">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The levy is a
burden on those schemes, particularly when, as we know, final-salary
schemes are in significant decline. More and more companies are
announcing that, certainly for new recruits, the DB scheme no longer
exists. Imposing a levy on a declining sector is not without grave
difficulty, which I acknowledge. However, when schemes go bust, they
often leave behind considerable assets, which, although not enough to
pay their pension liabilities, are taken in by the PPF and invested,
and some of the beneficiaries will be paid from that
income.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000222">&#160;</a>

slightly off of what we are discussing, but I hope the Chair will give
me a bit of licence. The right hon. Gentleman talks about the level of
compensation. We have acknowledged, however, that there is still a
group in the PPF—the early retirees—some of whom, because
of when they retired, the conditions of the PPF and the cap, are still
experiencing losses of up to 70%. The Minister knows that because we
have discussed it, and I will want to continue harping on about it for
the rest of this Parliament, even though I am aware of the difficulties
of dealing with that
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000224">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Yes, I am aware of that. It was not 100%
satisfactory to all those who should have benefitted. Also, the PPF
went forward from the relevant date, but there was the issue of
companies that had already gone bust, and those people cried and
shouted the loudest to Parliament, and rightly so. After some
delay—I recall that the Treasury was not too keen—the
financial assistance scheme was born to provide some benefits, paid for
by the Exchequer, not levy payers, to those
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000225">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Now,
institutionally, I understand that the PPF has taken in the FAS. It is
not an amalgamation, so the two are actuarially separate, which is
wholly appropriate. I do not have the latest figures, but my
understanding from the report is that up to the end of March 2010,
341 schemes were in the PPF, covering about 193,000 members.
However, the scheme is fairly fast-moving, and those numbers will now
be larger. If we link them to the numbers affected by the FAS, I think
the PPF told me—I am not sure whether this is current or very
soon—that about half a million people would be covered by the
PPF or the FAS. That may be going forward a little bit, but not too
far. If I have that wrong, I am happy to be
corrected.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000226">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">By
putting forward such pension arithmetic, I am showing that the PPF and
the FAS are helping a considerable number of people who are now
receiving at least a reasonably significant pension whereas, before the
legislation and the establishment of the fund, they would have received
a small
pension.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000227">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
are talking about people who have had a lot of anxiety in their lives
about companies going bust and who, for several years, were fearful
that they were losing a significant proportion of their pension. They
include people—the hon. Gentleman has just referred to
this—who still consider that they are not receiving their full
dues.

                  </div>Such people are not vulnerable, but they make up a group of people for
whom we should have some regard. It is in that context that we need to
ask the Minister why the move from RPI to CPI—not the CBI, which
I expect would oppose my proposals—should apply to the PPF. The
hon. Gentleman more than alluded to it earlier; he said that it was
Government policy and that, of course, such issues should apply to the
PPF. He is not the libertarian who I used to know in the Opposition
days, such thoughts show that he is a bit of a
centralist.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000228">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope that I have shown my understanding of the funding basis of the PPF
and that we need to nurture the institution carefully in future, not
least because of the decline of final salary schemes. Nevertheless, I
am not convinced that the PPF could not have afforded to have kept RPI
for such a group of people who have been badly treated in the
past—if I can describe them that way. Reporting on progress
during the year, the chief executive’s review for the past
financial year 2009-10
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000229">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Our
deficit of the previous year has been replaced by a reserve of almost
£400 million, equivalent to a funding level of 103 per
cent.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000401">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
is testimony to the good stewardship of the PPF, and seems relatively
healthy. When that report was produced, the assets of the PPF were some
£4.5 billion. I believe that they might now be nearer £7
billion, but the Minister may be able to correct me. I am not being
silly. There are huge liabilities, too, and we have to be careful.
However, I am not convinced that such action was necessary, except to
impose a central edict, to say to the board, “It is not up to
you to make up your mind as stewards. We, the Government, say that you
have to move to
CPI.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000230">&#160;</a>

argument, but is it fair that people in the fund receive uprating with

                  </strong> That seems like quite a good question. I am trying
to be generous before I let the hon. Gentleman down. There are two
flaws in his argument. First, as we have learnt from my exchange with
the Minister, many people in DB schemes will continue to benefit from
RPI. He said that he was proud of the fact that 76% was close to 80%. I
thought that it was pretty good. If 70% to 80% of existing DB scheme
members will still benefit from RPI, that slightly undermines the
argument of the hon. Member for Nuneaton. That is a pity, as it sounded
good as a
question.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000232">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
given how many DB schemes are uprated with RPI, many of the schemes
that the PPF beneficiaries come from would have been in RPI-uprated
schemes, but they went bust. If companies had not gone bust, going
forward they may well have benefited from RPI and—in plain
English—better, higher pensions. Now, because of a central
edict, their PPF pension will be uprated—I think we agree that
it might vary from year to year—at a lower rate. So I think that
is why I am not entirely taken with the question, although for a while
I thought it sounded pretty
impressive.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000233">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Why
did not the Minister and the Treasury leave the decision to the PPF

the moment totally slumber—where we no longer have the central
state and we let key institutions make decisions. We established the
PPF board as an independent board, which has great expertise. Its
members are the stewards of the PPF and the funding. Why did we not say
to them, “This is the Government’s view, but it is up to
you; you’re the board; you have to make this decision”?

is interesting that the Government at one stage considered whether to
introduce legislation that would directly override the rules of

just to help us remember. However, the Government decided against it,
which slightly undermines my central edict point. It is good that you

                  </strong> Well, in terms of establishing the PPF and the
difficult decision to impose a new levy, it was felt that we could not
give everyone the pension to which they were entitled. We had to have
the cap on the amounts of pensions paid out, if that is what the
Minister is referring to. Now that the PPF board is
established—alive—and rather successful in Croydon, it
has to produce annual reports. It has a director of finance or whatever
the title might be, an independent chair and a chief executive. Why not
trust them to make the decision? However, the Government did not trust
them to make the decision, so may I ask the Minister whether the board

               <p class="tabbed">I want to ask
the Minister about the impact of the measure, because he has spoken
often about the needs of pension schemes, but he is a little less sure
to tell us about the effects on pension beneficiaries. I quizzed him a
little on that slightly obscure table, but I think that I have got it
now. It shows that in future, many pension beneficiaries might be 16%
worse off under CPI than if we did not agree the legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000246">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The PPF
relates to a different population of people. Will the Minister give us
figures—average figures, perhaps—to show how the move to
the CPI will affect, I believe adversely, the pension incomes of that
group? In addition, will he give us figures for the financial
assistance scheme? I do not think that such figures were spelt out
clearly in the impact assessment. The key impact to assess is that on
the citizen in the FAS and the PPF. In other words, what will be the
average loss of pension—not just for one year, but going
forward? Any information would be gratefully received.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000247">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To restate
the case, in the past, people have had periods of grave uncertainty and
anxiety about their DB or final-salary schemes—I use that term,
but I know that such schemes are not always final-salary. People have
had a tough time, and we have conceded that they do not always get the
pension to which they think they are entitled because we had to impose
particular limits. Is this really the group on whom to impose by edict
a meaner regime than the current one? That is my main
argument.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000248">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The PPF has
been a success story. I am not cavalier about the future difficulties
of matching liabilities to income, which we must consider carefully,
but so far, so good. The PPF has done a good job. It appears to be
helping a couple of hundreds of thousands of people, if not now, very
soon. Such people are not always the richest in our society and they
have had a tough and anxious time. As we scrutinise the clause, we
should consider carefully whether the Government have got the measure
right or wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000249">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I certainly join in paying tribute to all those who
played a part in creating the PPF and the financial assistance scheme.
I like to think that those of us who were in opposition managed to drag
the Government kicking and screaming into doing something about the
problem when, for many years, they declined to do anything at all. We
welcome the eventual introduction of the financial assistance scheme
and its subsequent improvement, which followed further pressure, and
the PPF, too.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000250">&#160;</a>

                  </div>of the work of the PPF and the security that it provides to tens of
thousands of people. We have some figures: we currently estimate that
approximately 75,000 people are receiving or will receive PPF
compensation; another 208,000 are in assessment; a further 17,000
receive FAS benefits; and another 150,000 will get help. If we add all
those together, we get to 400,000-odd. Obviously, we do not know what
the future holds, but it is striking that new schemes seem to turn up
at our door all the time. Even under the FAS, we still find new ones,

                  </strong> We know that schemes that go into PPF are not like
the average scheme. To the extent that they are broadly like the
average scheme, they will mirror the numbers in table 2, which we were
just talking about. In other words, some three quarters of them will
have had RPI indexation.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000256">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The immediate
reaction by the right hon. Member for Croydon North to the question
from my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton was the correct one, in
that it was a very good question. Why should schemes that are paying
CPI benefits to their members pay insurance for RPI protection for
their members? That is a strange concept, which seems somewhat
inconsistent. We and the right hon. Gentleman recognise that PPF is not
trying to put people exactly where they would have been. It is trying
to provide a measure of security, hence the 90%, the cap and the
standardisation of terms in the PPF. When someone goes into the PPF,
they do not get exactly what their scheme would have provided on their
scheme’s rules. They get, essentially, a safety-net scheme. That
is why using CPI as part of that is the consistent thing to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000257">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman suggested that the board should have discretion,
which I find baffling. He and his colleagues created the Pension
Protection Fund. The board’s job is to implement the Pensions
Act 2004 and to run the Pension Protection Fund according to rules set
down by Parliament. Why today we should suddenly decide to give them
discretion on how to measure inflation is entirely beyond me. The board
has an important job to do and it has lots of decisions to make that
are rightly independent of the Government. We do not tell it what its
investment strategy should be. It decides how to measure risk for the
risk-based premium. Those are the operational things, but the policy is
for the Government to decide. As the right hon. Gentleman said, the PPF
was consulted by officials before the announcement was 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 318<a class="bkMark" name="Column318">&#160;</a>
                  </div>made. Its view, as registered in the document that he quoted from, is
that it is a matter of Government policy how inflation is measured for
PPF purposes. It said that its role is to implement the
Government’s
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000258">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman asked about the impact of the CPI switch on PPF
members. That will clearly vary hugely between individuals. At an
aggregate level, we estimate a reduction of £500 million in the
liabilities of the PPF in net present value. I hope that answers
that question. He also asked about the management’s
assets. On 31 May, they were £6.6 billion, to update
the Committee. To return to my figures on membership of the financial
assistance scheme, the 150,000 includes the 17,000 currently in
payment, just in case there was any
confusion.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000259">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am not sure that there is an awful lot more I can add. The right hon.
Gentleman is making a plea for the PPF to use a different measure of
inflation. The point of the exercise is to protect against losses in
standard of living because of inflation. If the Government think that
inflation is better measured through CPI and they do that across
millions of people for social security benefits, pensions and all the
rest, to do something different in Croydon because the cost falls on
pension fund levy payers rather than on taxpayers seems not to be
coherent.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000260">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This
idea that I am asking for something especially for Croydon is a jokey
shorthand. We have already discussed the reality that many DB schemes
will still have RPI in the future. It is not as if this is just for the
PPF. This will be in line with the many trustees of schemes that will
keep RPI. The Minister mentioned the £500 million figure, but
how does that translate into pension reductions for those who should be
benefiting from PPF and
FAS?<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000262">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> On the right hon. Gentleman’s first point, on
the measurement of inflation in the PPF, it is true that there will be
a lot of DB schemes paying RPI increases. I come back to the point that
the PPF was never supposed to mirror the scheme that someone came from;
it was supposed to be a safety net. In designing the safety net, we
have standard features, essentially. Given that we are requiring
occupational schemes to do CPI or better, it would be odd to require
the PPF to do RPI. That would be an enhancement, rather than a standard
feature, for some schemes, which would be an odd feature for a
protection
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000263">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
terms of the impact on individual scheme members, one of the
difficulties is that it will not only vary hugely between individuals
anyway, as per the previous clause, but that will be compounded by its
depending on what they would have got under the terms of the scheme
they came from, which will be unique to every individual. I cannot give
him a single number, but I hope that I have given him an order of
magnitude: in aggregate, the loss in net present value of PPF members
from CPI is £500 million. I cannot give him a
meaningful average—although, clearly, one could divide the total
figure by the number of people—or a weekly pounds and pence
figure.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000264">&#160;</a>

situation? Some seven years ago, he was standing in a Committee of this
kind urging us to be more generous with the PPF and the FAS and to find
more money to help those people—not a bad argument at the
time—whereas now he will take £500 million out of the
scheme to the disbenefit of those who we are trying to
help.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000265">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The crucial issue is that the scheme is set up to
protect people against inflation, but the right hon. Gentleman is
urging us to use inconsistent measures of inflation in two parts of
what we do. It is not about waking up one morning and deciding that we
want to be mean or generous; it is about coherent legislation. The
right hon. Gentleman knows that the legislation requires us to protect
against inflation. In one part of the public sphere, we have judged
that we will use CPI. To apply something else to another part because
we will not be paying for it but someone else will be and so that is
okay seems

                  </strong> The clause deals with a category of pensions known
as cash balance schemes. I must explain what clause 17 does before I
explain why we want to change it, so I hope that will obviate the
Committee’s need for a separate clause stand part
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000292">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
cash balance scheme is rather unusual. Traditionally, one assumes that
a pension scheme either provides a percentage of salary or is a pot of
money invested in the stock market. With a cash balance scheme,
however, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 320<a class="bkMark" name="Column320">&#160;</a>
                  </div>someone will get a certain amount of cash and the amount of pension it
converts into depends on such things as annuity rates at the time, so
it provides a measure of pension guarantee but not complete certainty,
somewhere between DB and DC in the spectrum of risk. Historically, with
cash balance schemes, when the pension pot is converted into an annuity
there has been an obligation to buy an indexed annuity. In fact,
however, some such schemes could be regarded as having the character
more of a DC scheme than a DB scheme. The clause is about whether cash
balance schemes require mandatory
indexation.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000293">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
give the Committee a feel for the scale of the situation, there are
currently about 80,000 members of cash balance schemes in the UK
and—compared with about 53,000 DC schemes and about 6,000 DB
schemes—there are about 2,000 hybrid schemes, in which older
cash benefit schemes are generally included. The number of such schemes
is likely to grow in the coming years as schemes are opened to new
members and there is
accrual.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000294">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
change included in the clause is not intended to affect the overall
value of an individual’s accrued pension. What will happen is
that the member, not the scheme, will pay for the indexation benefit
through a lowering of the starting annuity rate. As when buying a
normal annuity, an individual can choose a level annuity or an indexed
annuity that starts at a lower level, but gets higher depending on the
inflation rate. In that scenario, if a member chooses to take an
annuity without indexation, the pension would at first be paid at a
higher flat rate, but its relative value would decline over
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000295">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Section
51 of the Pensions Act 1995 sets out the indexation requirements for
occupational pension schemes. The clause amends that section so that,
for schemes that can take advantage of the relaxed requirements, an
annuity or pension paid from the scheme no longer has to include
limited price indexation, which will give scheme members greater
choice.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000296">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
can feel an intervention coming on, with someone asking about schemes
with a guaranteed conversion rate, but I will pre-empt that
intervention. The Committee will be reassured to know that, under the
clause, cash balance schemes that offer a guaranteed rate of conversion
or a guarantee to calculate the pension as a proportion of the accrued
sum are excluded from the relaxation of the indexation requirement,
because such schemes promise a particular rate to their members and
that needs to be funded. For the record, cash balance schemes which are
or have been contracted out on a defined-benefit basis will not be
affected by the clause unless the only period of such contracting out
was before April
1997.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000297">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
group of Government amendments will make minor and technical changes to
clarify the operation of the clause in relation to cash balance schemes
that include periods before 6 April 1997, where the scheme has
contracted out of the state additional pension system in relation to an
earner’s employment. The amendments will ensure that the
indexation requirement continues to apply to schemes that were or are
contracted out on a defined-benefit basis after 6 April 1997. As my
note states, that “limits potential for confusion”, which
might otherwise have arisen. If the amendments are not made, schemes
might be prevented from taking advantage of the relaxed indexation
requirements if they had been contracted out before 6 April 1997 on a
defined-benefit basis. The amendments deal with that potential policy 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>confusion and will restore the policy intent of the clause, which, as it
gives scheme members new choices, will be generally welcomed and I
commend them to the

                  </strong> There is an issue that is important for me to put on
the record. Much of the legislation relates to Great Britain only, but
some of it relates to the United Kingdom. The way it works is that
sometimes we legislate for the whole United Kingdom, and other times we
legislate for Great Britain, and Northern Ireland copies across what we
do. I want to tell the Committee, which I believe I am under a duty to
do, that while the Bill will generally extend to Great Britain, since
pensions and social security are transferred matters in Northern
Ireland, there are exceptions, including clause 19, which is why I am
making this statement now. The exceptions where the provisions of the
Bill will extend to Northern Ireland are clauses 19 and 20, which
relate to the financial assistance scheme, and clause 25 and parts of
schedule 5, which relate to judicial pensions. A legislative consent
motion was required to allow those provisions to extend to Northern
Ireland, and the Northern Ireland Assembly debated and approved such a
motion on 21
March.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000311">&#160;</a>

a reliance of an estimated 5 million to 8 million individuals on the

legal obligations on those who manage people’s savings in funds
to work towards and to protect their best interests.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000319">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
is well aware that pension fund trustees are subject to stringent
obligations known as fiduciary duties, which require them to act in the
best interests of members. However, those are common law duties, so
they are not specifically spelled out in statute. All hon. Members will
have received information from the FairPensions campaign, which
highlights that one consequence has been significant and growing
confusion about the nature and scope of those duties. If that is
considered alongside the predicted effect of auto-enrolment, it is
crucial that the notion of fiduciary duty is understood and applied
properly to ensure good investment outcomes for all such funds and
trusts.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000320">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
main point is that legal clarification of those fiduciary duties would
be helpful in any event, but would also help to lay the foundations for
building confidence in pensions generally, and specifically
auto-enrolment. Those duties exist to ensure that those entrusted to
act on behalf of others do not abuse the trust placed in them to
further their own ends. As a result, fiduciaries have a duty of loyalty
that requires them to put the best interests of their beneficiaries
first, and to avoid any conflict between that duty and their own
self-interest. Yet there is concern that that core protective purpose
seems increasingly to have been subsumed into a mythical notion of a
single fiduciary duty to maximise returns. It is perhaps being
interpreted too narrowly as short-term out-performance of the market
instead of longer-term benefits. I tabled the amendment because it is
right to probe further the extent to which this is a problem, and to
look for ways in which the duty can be clarified.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000321">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It has been
argued that at best there is confusion about the issue, with a
propensity of fund and trust managers seeming to look for short-term
gains, and that at worst there are questions about the boundaries of
where their duties lie. My concern is that many trustees and managers
are either afraid or unwilling to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 324<a class="bkMark" name="Column324">&#160;</a>
                  </div>consider the wider impact of long-term risks and factors, such as
climate change or systemic financial risk, that would impact on their
portfolios, but perhaps cannot be easily quantified in the short
term.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000322">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Such
factors may have a significant impact on investment outcomes,
particularly for younger pension savers with long time horizons. We
have only to look back at the Deepwater Horizon disaster at this time
last year to realise the potential risks to savings and pensions that
stem from short-termism in trust and fund management. Before the
disaster, BP was the largest dividend payer in the UK, but in the
subsequent period, it had to suspend its dividend payments, and when
they resumed they were half their previous level. It is important to
register the significance of that. BP had been warned about its poor
record of health and safety in the past, and greater acknowledgment of
long-term social and environmental risks on behalf of trust and fund
managers could have resulted in greater pressure on BP to correct those
health and safety problems and, by implication, perhaps limited or
avoided the disaster last
summer.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000323">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Bill has been debated in another place, and Lord Freud acknowledged
that there were important issues in relation to BP. He said:<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000324">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“There
has been a consensus in many previous debates on social and
environmental issues that companies perform better when their
activities are monitored by shareholders…One has only to look at
what happened to BP last year with Deepwater Horizon to see that a
greater concern, and perhaps some pressure on the BP board by its
shareholders in relation to environmental issues, might have been
especially valuable to the company.”—[<em>Official Report,

               </p>
               <p>In the
aftermath of the financial crisis, pension funds lost, on average, 17%
of their value. It is now widely accepted that institutional investors
did not do enough to challenge risky strategies in the banks that they
owned, which would have protected their members from such
impacts.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000325">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We need a
proper understanding of the law, which, arguably, requires trustees to
have regard to wider factors. Yet many trustees continue to believe
that to do so would be a breach of their fiduciary obligations and they
might therefore be exposed to the risk of being sued. Such matters must
be clarified. From that perspective, we argue that there should be a
greater acknowledgement of the importance of environmental, social and
governance risks and factors in fiduciary obligations.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000326">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It can also
be argued that acknowledging the potential harm and damage of risks is,
or should be, part of the fiduciary obligation of protecting the
interests of pension fund beneficiaries. Company directors are already
required, in fulfilling their duty to promote the success of their
company, to have regard to long-term and wider issues, such as
environmental and social impacts. Those provisions were introduced by
the Companies Act 2006 and were based on the principle of enlightened
shareholder value. It is reasonable to suggest that we should have
similar provisions, or at least a similar interpretation, in relation
to pension funds.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000327">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The problem
is that shareholders themselves are not subject to those parallel
provisions, and many continue to believe that the law prohibits them
taking a similarly enlightened approach. It is therefore unsurprising
that the progress generated by the 2006 Act has been disappointing, and
directors report feeling under increasing pressure from their investors
to maximise short-term

issues, even if doing so meant sacrificing longer-term business
success. That is a particular issue in relation to pension funds.
Essentially, I am calling for the Minister to provide information on
what he might be able to do to give a legal clarification of the
meaning of fiduciary duty. Such a clarification would align that duty
with the interests of the millions of savers who are soon to be
auto-enrolled.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000328">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We might
align fiduciary duty and the interests of savers across the UK through
greater integration of environmental, social and governance factors on
behalf of fund managers. That view is backed up by empirical evidence
that has been provided to hon. Members by the FairPensions campaign,
which has shown that the incorporation of those risk factors can reduce
risk without damaging levels of returns. I have been very supportive of
and take a great interest in the mutual sector and ethical investments.
However, I do not suggest in the new clause that we move towards solely
ethical investments, although I might do so personally. I was
interested to see that the report suggests that the historical
performance of the eight largest US mutual funds compared with the
eight largest responsible funds, as they have been described, shows
that funds that chose to incorporate and integrate environmental,
social and governance factors delivered higher risk-adjusted returns
over both one-year and three-year periods.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000329">&#160;</a>

concluded that<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000330">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
therefore ask the Minister to say what his Government intend to do to
address the problem that has been identified. With the legal
understanding of fiduciary obligation and duty, many fund managers are
unwilling to accommodate or integrate ESG into their portfolio or model
at present. I am sure that the Minister will share my principles. When
the Pensions Bill comes into effect, I would like to see us move
away—the term “nudge” has been used a great deal
in the Committee, and a firm nudge from the Minister would be
fine—from short-termism in the attitudes of some towards pension
and trust fund management, and for those obligations to be clarified to
protect the interests of millions of savers across the UK. I
am sure that the Minister will share those principles. For that reason,
I tabled the new clause to ensure that we get clarification on the
record, and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to
say.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000333">&#160;</a>

repeating the excellent presentation of the clause made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun—she made the case
extremely well. In recent years, pension schemes have become highly
important players in the financial market. They are important for 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 326<a class="bkMark" name="Column326">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the stability of parts of our economy, and for those
individuals who come to depend on the outcome of investments for their
future. Anyone who is a member of a pension scheme is reliant on the
good and forward thinking of those who are trustees of those schemes.
People often assume that things will go well and that there will be no
problems because it is such a basic issue. Obviously, at times there
have been difficulties with unwise investments, or investments that
people—both members of a pension scheme and people in the wider
society who are not members of a scheme—might feel was
undesirable. A lot of pension scheme members would be concerned to find
out that their scheme was investing in some questionable activities,
both because of the risk to their investment and because they want to
feel that investments are being made responsibly in a broader sense.
There are some big campaigning issues at the moment, and people talk
about things such as tar sands investment, which a lot of people think
is environmental vandalism in certain countries of the world. It would
be desirable to feel that one’s pension fund trustees were
taking such matters into account.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000334">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As my hon.
Friend said, there is no reason to suppose that by taking such matters
fully into account, a worse outcome will necessarily be produced. In
some cases it might take slightly longer, but people will still get the
returns they need with less risk and—hopefully—a more
ethical view of how investments are carried out. That can be only to
the good of us all.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000335">&#160;</a>

for Kilmarnock and Loudoun and for Edinburgh East for tabling the new
clause, but I will not rehearse their comments as I entirely agree with
them. I want to talk about another aspect that has been touched on
rather less—that of long-term value rather than short-term
reward, and the role of pension funds and the importance of fiduciary
duty in terms of creating that long-term value. I shall then refer
briefly to how NEST, in particular, has risen to the challenge of being
a good fiduciary and of designing products that match the concerns of
consumers. On governance, we all agree that part of the cause of the
financial crisis was seeking short-term profit rather than long-term
value in financial services; looking to the next quarterly return and
trying to please the City with great profit numbers, even if those
profits were superficial in their nature and turned out to be huge
losses, which were picked up by the
taxpayer.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000336">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
pension fund sector has a big role to play in restoring trust, and
bringing to our financial markets a greater long-term perspective
rather than a short-term, profit-seeking element, which has been the
cause of at least some part of the financial crisis from which we are
still recovering. There is also the broader issue of trust that does
not relate just to the financial crisis. Clearly, the financial crisis
has created a huge deficit in the trust that people put in financial
markets, banks and financial institutions, and I include pensions in
that group, too. But the erosion of trust did not start with the
financial crisis, particularly in pensions. I draw attention to past
pension crises, whether with the other media tycoon, Maxwell, or
Equitable Life.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000337">&#160;</a>

funds are governed and the steps taken to exercise their fiduciary

in which pension dividends are taxed. He will have seen the answer to a
parliamentary question that I asked of the Treasury about tax relief on
pensions and will know that two thirds of it go to top tax rate payers,
and that overall it is worth about £20 billion a year. Pensions
are still subject to generous treatment under the tax

want to focus specifically on the fiduciary duties of our pension funds
and how they can be better exercised in the interests of both the
pensions industry and the people saving for pensions. It is in the
wider interest of the economy to rebuild the trust that has been eroded
because of the mis-selling scandals that I have mentioned and the
financial crisis that we are still recovering from. A key part of
rebuilding the economy involves looking at the role that financial
services play in the economy, whether it is the banks that have been
nationalised or part-nationalised, or whether it is the pension funds
that play such a huge role in investing our money on our behalf. If we
are to avoid a financial crisis occurring again, we need to think hard
about the role of the financial services in supporting the wider
economy, and corporate governance is key to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000344">&#160;</a>

as contributors could make a huge difference and reward long-term value
rather than short-term profit-seeking, which turns out to be anything
other than profit in the long run, as we have seen in the

               <p class="tabbed">The issue of
fiduciary duty is key. My hon. Friends for Kilmarnock and Loudoun and
for Edinburgh East mentioned the exercise of fiduciary duty. The
FairPensions report states that there is a myth among
trustees<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000346">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“of a

returns’”.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000411">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
is often interpreted narrowly as short-term out-performance of the
market. FairPensions and many of us recognise that that is not what
fiduciary duty means. FairPensions goes on to say that in its
experience this can make trustees afraid or unwilling to consider wider
or longer-term factors such as climate change. That is in the context
of what I am saying about the long-term factors of systemic financial
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000347">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
do not think that fiduciary duty is wrong. Fiduciary duty is the right
thing, which we need. It is how it is interpreted by pension fund
trustees that is the issue. The Minister’s reflections on what
fiduciary duty means in relation to pension trustees would be valuable
in terms of setting the record straight and perhaps giving guidance and
clarity to trustees who make such important decisions on our behalf.
They have the power in financial markets to make a difference for good
and to change the way that financial markets reward
success.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000348">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
said that I also want to touch on NEST and how it is approaching the
issue of fiduciary duty. Research by NEST was mentioned earlier by the
Minister in relation to automatic enrolment. NEST’s research on
its target market shows that financial return is not the only interest
of potential members of NEST, who have demonstrated a clear preference
for financial protection and security above potential returns. So I
come back to the issue of what fiduciary duty is. It is not simply
about maximising short-term return but about ensuring financial
protection, particularly for the people who have that as a higher
stated preference. The risk and the return are more finely balanced for
many people, including the people whom NEST regards as its target
market. Above the returns for more risky investments, many of the
client group that NEST is hoping to attract are looking for that
protection and security. Hence, the portfolio allocations in the NEST
default fund are designed to meet the requirements of that target
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000349">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">NEST
research also shows a substantial demand for ethical investment
decisions, of the sort mentioned by my hon. Friends the Members for
Kilmarnock and Loudoun and for Edinburgh East. Such research means that
NEST has signed up to the UN principles for responsible investment, and
we all welcome that decision. Its stance on the issue is to be
applauded and will, ultimately, drive up standards throughout the
industry, in terms of the types of investments made by other pension
funds. The new clause would provide similarly for pension trusts and
clarify the duties on trustees of schemes. It is important to have this
discussion and to get the Minister’s response because I know,

               <p class="tabbed">The
new clause would ensure that pension fund trustees take into account
the environmental, social and governance issues that are relevant to
the long-term health of a pension fund, which is what is important in
the context of the fiduciary duty of pension trustees—much more
so than for speculative investments with shorter-term outlooks than a
pension fund usually has. Those environmental and social considerations
are undoubtedly 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 329<a class="bkMark" name="Column329">&#160;</a>
                  </div>relevant to the long-term interests of savers, and my hon. Friends
mentioned examples such as the tar sands. Clearly, a pension fund
trustee must think about the long-term viability and coherence of
business strategies when investing, much more so than when only seeking
short-term returns. Again, it is important that the fiduciary duty of
pension fund trustees is interpreted with the long-term interests of
the people contributing in
mind.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000351">&#160;</a>

am grateful to my hon. Friends for tabling the new clause, and I look

                  </strong> I very much want to respond in the spirit in which
the new clause was tabled and in which other hon. Members have spoken.
I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issues again, and to put some
comments on the
record.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000353">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
was slightly horrified when the hon. Lady said that what Ministers say
in Committee is given a certain amount of weight, given everything I
have said in the past four days, but we will give it a go. I want to
say carefully and specifically, on the record, that we as a Government
are very sympathetic to many of her arguments, that we fully support
the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical behaviour,
and that we agree that a socially responsible investment strategy is a
sound choice for pension schemes. I am happy to put that on the record
and, indeed, to go slightly further—making some in the room a
bit more nervous perhaps—and to state categorically that it is
not the duty of trustees simply to maximise short-term returns. That is
not what fiduciary duty means. She is quite right that that can be the
danger.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000354">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important to flag the many players in this space. Trustees are very
important, but we also have employers, fund managers and advisers. The
danger is that if we focus on one bit of the jigsaw, we will miss where
the real action is. For example, for fund managers who live or die by
their performance in the league table, me standing in this room on a
Thursday afternoon and saying, “You don’t have to worry
about all these short-term returns,” will only have them
replying, “Yes, well, that’s for the
birds—we’ll lose business if we don’t maximise
short-term returns.” So we need to provide systematically for
the entire chain—trustees, schemes, investment managers and
corporate behaviour. One of the paradoxes is that the people who own
the shares and could in theory cast the votes at annual general
meetings and so on are often several steps removed from the
beneficiaries of the pension fund, for example. A lot of
interconnections make getting to the right people quite a
challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000355">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
accept that the amendment was probing, but one of our reservations
would be that it would only apply to occupational pension
funds—which is what the Bill is about—and not to other
sorts of investors, such as insurance companies that provide pensions,
which could create an unevenness. The hon. Member for Leeds West might
argue that that is not to the detriment of those included, but we want
to take an holistic approach. The Department for Business, Innovation
and Skills has set up a review under John Kay, who, if I remember
correctly, is the founder and director of the Institute for Fiscal
Studies. His review of equity markets and long-term decision
making—we have talked about short-termism—is due to
publish its findings in summer 2012, and it will 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 330<a class="bkMark" name="Column330">&#160;</a>
                  </div>specifically consider the issues of investment governance raised by the
new clause. I would rather not prejudge the findings of that review,
and I will be careful that any solutions that we find do not put
conditions that are not imposed on other investment vehicles on pension
schemes. However, we will work closely with BIS to support the review,
and we will want to consider the issues again once its recommendations
are
known.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000356">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Hon.
Members have mentioned the work of FairPensions. I think that I am on
record for paying tribute to its work, which goes beyond the fairly
simplistic notions of ethical investment—we can all remember
from decades gone by the boycotting of South Africa—to a
sophisticated assessment of the notion of fiduciary duty, what it does
and does not mean, and why taking a broader approach may be in a
scheme’s interest. I take that point, and we have invited one of
the leading members of FairPensions to attend our departmental
trustees’ meetings. I meet pension fund trustees regularly, and
we have invited FairPensions to be represented in an individual
capacity at those meetings to ensure that when we talk to pension fund
trustees, we have that perspective in the room. I hope that will be
seen as a positive action. Also, both the hon. Member for Leeds West
and I attended the launch of the newly founded all-party group on
socially responsible investment in the House, which was technically the
second launch of the report that we have been talking about. I am happy
to continue engaging FairPensions and hon. Members on the important
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000357">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I echo the
comments made by the hon. Member for Leeds West on the role of NEST. We
have heard in our debates a number of examples of the way in which NEST
is a leader of innovation in its general approach to investment. I
welcome its signing up to the UN principles and the specific offer of
an ethical investment fund. Although “ethical investment”
and “long-termism” are not the same thing, they are
clearly connected. It will be interesting to see how far people, when
they sign up with NEST, actively opt for the specifically ethical
options. I hope that will raise the bar, because people who are
competing with NEST will have to say, “Maybe we have to offer
that sort of thing.” A general raising of standards in the area
would be
valuable.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000358">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady talked about recent trends in the financial markets. Some of
the issues that we are talking about predate the crash. The example of
tar sands and BP bring them to the fore. As she says, BP was, if I
remember correctly, the biggest dividend payer into pension funds. It
shows that when things go wrong, there can be a big impact on pension
funds. Therefore, a trustee looking at their fiduciary duty will be
absolutely right to look at the companies that they are investing in
and the companies’ environmental, social and governance
practices, and to ask searching
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000359">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
want to see people who own British industry, in many cases indirectly,
exercise control and influence. It is a paradox. Many of those who
indirectly own such companies would want to see them acting with more
environmental awareness or become more ethically attractive. Yet,
somehow their voices are never heard when the companies make their
decisions. They are important ongoing issues. I think the previous
Government would accept that they had reached the end of the road on
considering such issues, but we certainly think there is more to be
done. That is why we look forward to the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 331<a class="bkMark" name="Column331">&#160;</a>
                  </div>results of the Kay review, and why I certainly will continue to have an
active dialogue with FairPensions and all those concerned with making
sure that pensions are a force for good, not just for the their
individual members, but for the wider society. While I do not think
that the new clause will be helpful, because it singles out one
particular bit of the market, I welcome the chance to debate the
issues, and I thank the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun for
putting it on our agenda
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000360">&#160;</a>

hear that the review will report in the not-too-distant future, about a

case where necessary, and I am sure that hon. Members will do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000361">&#160;</a>

is also important to have on record the Minister’s words in
relation to the duties. I hope that people out there will read the
record if there is any dubiety and take from it what they need to do
the right thing, which is essentially what we are discussing. The hon.
Members who have spoken have identified the feelings of pension fund
members. They often feel somewhat detached and as though their views
and interests are not necessarily being represented as they would wish.
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, I think that many more people
are now seeking not only responsible and ethical investments but also a
greater say in the process. I therefore welcome the Minister’s
words and will not seek to press the new clause to a vote. I beg to ask

                  </strong> This is probably the last substantive clause that we
will consider, and I will deal with it briefly. The judicial pension
scheme is a bit of an anomaly among public sector pensions. We have
been discussing with our constituents who are nurses, teachers, police
officers or various other kinds of public servant how much they must
put into their public sector pensions and the additional amounts that
might be required, but I think that many of us were surprised to
discover that judges do not have to pay anything for their own
pensions, and that the small contribution that they do make pays only
for survivors’ benefits, for example. We feel that that is now
indefensible, especially as the cost of providing those benefits has
risen considerably. Clause 25 provides a power to introduce
contributions towards the cost of judicial pensions. Judicial pension
schemes are unfunded, as are many public sector pension
schemes.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000365">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Who
will be affected by the clause? The pension scheme under the relevant
Act applies to salaried judicial office holders first appointed to
office from March 1995 and those in other judicial pension schemes who
have transferred their benefits into the JUPRA scheme, as it is known,
currently the main judicial pension scheme. Although clause 25 amends
the current judicial pension scheme, several other judicial pension
schemes remain in existence, and we will make the same amendments to
them. Consequently, schedule 5 inserts provisions into other relevant
Acts such as the well-known District Judges (Magistrates’
Courts) Pensions Act (Northern Ireland)
1960.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000366">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
the principle of the clause, the contribution rates that we impose will
be set through secondary legislation, consistent with the approach
taken to contributions towards the cost of dependants’ pensions.
To give a feel for the scale, in 2009-10, judges paid £4.3
million for dependants’ benefits into their pension schemes,
whereas the taxpayer paid £84 million. Contributions will be
taken only during the period in which the judge accrues pension
benefits, so if the judge retires, resigns or is removed from office
during that period, contributions will stop being taken from the date
that he or she leaves office. The savings on pension costs will make an
important contribution to overall spending review economies, deficit
reduction and—dare I say it—fairness, and are in line
with wider public service pension measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000367">&#160;</a>

grateful for our chance to serve under you and for your generous
chairing, which has allowed some broad discussions, which is very much
the point of the Committee. We had another two sittings available to us
on Tuesday, if anyone had wanted to raise any other issues, but we have
not been taken up on that. We have, however, had a full and thorough
discussion on the key points of division between us, as well as on the
common ground. It is appropriate that we ended on some common ground on
socially responsible investment. There are a number of issues where we
have found common
cause.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000379">&#160;</a>

want to thank those who put the Bill together—the many unseen
officials, some of whom are with us and some of whom are not, including
the specialist lawyers who write the legislation and the officials for
whom every one of these clauses is a labour of love. It is astonishing
for me, as a Minister doing his first Bill, to see how much work goes
on behind the scenes to produce an Act of Parliament. I am enormously
grateful to the officials and the experts who have put this together,

have shared their insights with me in discussion and have intervened

                  </strong> The process has been valuable. I thank Back-Bench
Opposition Members, too. They have had the greater freedom to raise
special issues, table new clauses and draw attention to important
matters. I was interested to learn of the professional background of
several members of the Committee, such as the hon. Member for Erith and
Thamesmead and her tax expertise, and the fact that the hon. Member for
Islwyn used to have a shiny suit and sell pensions. We now understand
matters a lot
better.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000384">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">As
for the unseen hands who help the work of the Committee, we are
obviously grateful to the Clerk to the Committee who has seen us
through our processes,

                  </div>as we are to the <em>Hansard </em>writers who might have struggled
occasionally to keep up with the flow of pensions jargon, but who coped
very well. I thank the police officers who have helped us and, on
occasion, the work experience people; I am sure that one or two of them
who came into the room were under age. We will resume our debates on
the Bill in the autumn, but on a personal note I join my hon. Friends
in wishing the hon. Member for Leeds West well in her preparations for
her wedding later in the summer. I give her our best
wishes.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000385">&#160;</a>

devote my time to wedding cakes and flower arranging, which are my main
pursuits when I am not considering state pension age and fiduciary
duties. I thank Mr Brady and Miss Clark for their excellent chairing of
the Committee. This is my first Committee, and I have much appreciated
their patience and support during the past two weeks. I also thank Ms
Toft, the other Clerks to the Committee, the Doorkeepers and the
officials. I might not agree with all of their labours of love, but I
recognise the work that goes into putting together a
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000387">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
want to thank those groups that have sent briefings to the Opposition.
We do not have people passing us pieces of paper, so it is useful that
FairPensions, Age UK, Saga, the National Association of Pension Funds,
the Federation of Small Businesses and many others have briefed us so
well ahead of our sittings. I thank Government Members. The hon. Member
for High Peak spoke about small businesses and the difference that his
experience of visiting NEST has made. The hon. Member for Eastbourne
spoke about his hope and expectation of the Minister coming forward
with support for 500,000 women—Mrs Reeves, included. I thank him
for his expectation and hope that it will be fulfilled. The hon. Member
for Reading West has certainly stretched the field of debate. If his
questions have not all been germane, they have been of interest to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000388">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
for members of the Opposition, I thank my Whip who has made sure that
we have all been present and, by and large, have voted the right way. I
also thank her for her contributions to the debate on the state pension
age. As a Whip, she did not have the opportunity to speak on Second
Reading, but she has more than made up for that in Committee. It took a
lot of arm-twisting for my right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon
North to become a member of the Committee, but I am glad that it paid
off. We are unanimous about his contributions not only on NEST, but
longevity and the Pension Protection Fund, which he has done much to
support, as well as for reminding us when we become close to elevenses
that it is time to break and eat the Five Boys chocolate bar to which
we have all looked
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000389">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
thank my hon. Friends the Members for Edinburgh East and for Kilmarnock
and Loudoun for their contributions to the debate on fiduciary duties
as well as on auto-enrolment and women affected by the state pension
age. I should not forget the hon. Member for Arfon. He is not in
Committee at the moment, but his contribution to the debate on carers
brought much value to our proceedings. Like the Minister, I feel that I
know members of the family of the hon. Member for Islwyn extremely
well. If they are ever in Parliament, we 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 335<a class="bkMark" name="Column335">&#160;</a>
                  </div>might even recognise them. My hon. Friend the Member for Erith and
Thamesmead has probably tabled more amendments than the rest of us put
together, so I give her huge thanks for raising the important issues of
auto-enrolment and pension credits.<a class="bkMark" name="11071473000390">&#160;</a>
