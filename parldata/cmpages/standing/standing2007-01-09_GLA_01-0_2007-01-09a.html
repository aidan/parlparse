							<b class="B">Michael
Gove</b> (Surrey Heath) (Con): First, I welcome the Minister
to his place and you, Mr. O&#146;Hara, to the Chair. It is
a pleasure to serve under your 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 4</div>chairmanship. I look forward to your wise guidance and that of your
co-Chairman, the hon. Member for Congleton (Ann
Winterton).</div>
					<a name="07010964000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I imagine
that I will rely rather more on your wise guidance than will the
Minister, as this is the first substantial Bill Committee on which I
have served. Due to the vagaries of the operation of my own party, I
find myself serving on the Front Bench. I suspect that in the days to
come I will find myself tripping over schedules, amendments and other
aspects of the legislative process. If your kind, guiding hand,
Mr. O&#146;Hara, can take me out of the thickets into
which I stray and back to the straight and narrow, I will be immensely
grateful.</div>
					<a name="07010964000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On
the time allocated for debate, allow me first to enter a note of
regret. One change suggested by the Leader of the House is that public
Bills coming before the House in this calendar year should be subject
to a new procedure that allows us to take evidence, much though not
entirely in the manner of a Select Committee. Given the nature of the
Bill, and the number of bodies throughout the capital that have an
interest in submitting evidence, we on this side of the
Committee&#151;I suspect that we are joined by the Liberal
Democrats&#151;think it a pity that the new, enhanced scrutiny
procedure is not in place. However, we understand why the Government
have decided to press ahead without that enhanced procedure. While we
express our regret that it is not in place, we will endeavour to do our
best to work within the time constraints.</div>
					<a name="07010964000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given those
constraints&#151;the 10 sittings we have in front of us&#151;we
will try our best to move expeditiously through those measures that are
less controversial to allow sufficient time to debate those that cause
greater controversy and division across the Benches. The Government
have had ample opportunity to prepare the legislation and there has
been pre-legislative consultation. Indeed, it is because of that
pre-legislative consultation that the Government argue that there is no
need for us to operate under the new, enhanced Public Bill Committee
procedure.</div>
					<a name="07010964000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that,
we confidently expect that the Government will not introduce their own
amendments. If they do, and if they acknowledge that their legislation
is flawed and have to hurry into Committee with significant proposals,
we might find the current allocation of time insufficient. With that
caveat&#151;that rider&#151;we are happy to accept the good offices
of the usual
channels.</div>

you to the Chair, Mr. O&#146;Hara, and I am sure that you
will do us proud during our proceedings over the next few weeks. I also
welcome the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="07010964000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the
hon. Member for Surrey Heath, we regret that it has not been possible
to use the enhanced consideration procedure. However, the 10 sittings
that have been allocated to us should be sufficient if we set
priorities. The hon. Gentleman said that he is new to such proceedings.
He will soon learn that, unfortunately, there is no clear correlation
between the amount of time spent in Committee and the number of
amendments that the Government accept. In fact, the two are completely
unconnected. Adding sittings is no guarantee that a Bill will change
beyond recognition.</div>

					<a name="07010964000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2005, the

introduced for the Mayor and assembly members, following a request from
the Greater London authority&#146;s head of paid service to review
the salaries, allowances, pensions and severance payments of the Mayor,
deputy Mayor and assembly members. Allowing such a scheme to be
established will remove an anomaly: although the GLA is allowed to make
pension provision for someone who ceases to be Mayor or an assembly
member, it is not allowed to provide a payment when such a person
ceases to hold office. The change will bring arrangements for the GLA
in line with those for Members of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh

councils&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07010964000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is simple and intended to clarify the consultation procedure
that the Mayor must go through. The Greater London Authority Act 1999
lists bodies to be given priority in consultation. We seek to amend it
to ensure that the consultation procedure takes into account one vital,
currently missing body.</div>
					<a name="07010964000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						If there is a
theme or leitmotif that we shall attempt to introduce in our scrutiny
of the Bill, it is the importance of ensuring that devolution goes to
the lowest possible level. One of our concerns is that while the Bill
will grant welcome additional powers, which currently lie with central
Government and their agencies, to the accountable office of the Mayor,
it will also take from the boroughs powers that should remain in their
hands without ensuring that they and the assembly have a balancing role
in ensuring that the Mayor&#146;s functions are discharged
effectively.</div>
					<a name="07010964000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
keeping with that theme, the amendment would add to the list of primary
consultees the constituent body that represents London councils, so
London Councils&#151;formerly the Association of London
Government&#151;should have equal consultation status with the
Greater London assembly. It seems appropriate that that body should be
given that status, because so many of the Mayor&#146;s
responsibilities depend on the boroughs for their effective discharge.
The original conception of the Mayor&#146;s role was strategic. In
that respect, many of the delivery functions outside the scope of the
functional bodies devolve on to the boroughs. It is only appropriate,
therefore, when it comes to the preparation of the Mayor&#146;s
strategies, that the Mayor take full account of what London boroughs
think, through the representative body that speaks for them all. I hope
that the Government have no objection to making this small but
constructive amendment, in the spirit of increased and enhanced
scrutiny and the principle of
devolution.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07010964000418"></a>
								Tom
Brake:
						</b> We support the Conservative amendment. Clause 2
strengthens the assembly&#146;s role, requiring the Mayor to respond
with reasons to the comments of the assembly and functional bodies on
draft and revised strategies. The amendment proposed by the official
Opposition would require the Mayor to respond similarly to the comments
of London Councils, the representative body of London
government.</div>
					<a name="07010964000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Surrey Heath says that he wants devolution to the lowest
possible level. It could be argued that if he wants to push the matter
further the amendment should call for the obligation to apply in the
case of all London boroughs, because London Councils represents a
collective view rather than that of each borough. Although the
amendment does not go far enough in terms of devolution, it is worthy,
and I shall listen carefully to the Minister to find out whether the
Government accept that it has some
validity.</div>

								Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> The Government do not support the amendment.
I accept what the hon. Member for Surrey Heath says in that we are
trying to achieve the correct balance in many areas of the Bill, but we
do not agree that the amendment addresses that aim. In preparing or
revising his statutory strategies, the Mayor is required to consult
within the GLA group, the assembly and the functional bodies before
consulting more
widely.</div>
					<a name="07010964000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 2, as
the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington says, sharpens up the
Greater London assembly&#146;s role in policy development by placing
an explicit requirement on the Mayor to have regard to the comments of
the assembly and the functional bodies in response to consultation. It
also requires the Mayor to write to the assembly, identifying which
comments he accepts and giving his reasons when he does not accept
assembly
recommendations.</div>
					<a name="07010964000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would require the Mayor to have regard to the comment of any
body representative of the London boroughs when he consults on drafts
or revisions to his strategies. Section 42 of the 1999 Act already
provides that the Mayor should consult the London boroughs on draft
strategies. The views of the London boroughs, alongside those of other
external stakeholders, provide an important contribution to the
development of the Mayor&#146;s strategies. I feel sure that the
Mayor carefully considers all those responses during the consultation
process. It is not, therefore, necessary to place an explicit
requirement on the Mayor to have regard to those comments, as the
amendment would
do.</div>

representative body of London boroughs enjoys the same rights as the
London assembly in the process of consultation. It seems to me that the
existing responsibility that is placed on the Mayor to consult London
boroughs gives them second-class status relative to the London
assembly. The existing responsibility is to consult each London borough
after the priorities are given to the assembly and to the functional
bodies. It is wrong that London boroughs should have that second-class
status. It also seems wrong that the Mayor should have a prior
requirement to consult with the functional bodies, many of which are
composed of his own appointees, before consulting the representative
voice of all London&#146;s local government.</div>
					<a name="07010964000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister must be aware that
there is grave disquiet about other parts of the Bill, which will take
power away from boroughs and place it in the hands of the Mayor. The
amendment would be one small step to acknowledge that when strategies
are developed, the coherent unitary voice of London&#146;s boroughs
is heard. The Minister could make a simple concession to show that the
Bill is intended to respect the rights of the boroughs rather than, as
many of us fear, simply to take their powers away whenever the
possibility is
presented.</div>

to put an explicit duty on the Mayor. For example, we are improving the
procedures for the assembly to hold the Mayor to account, and the Mayor
has to show greater regard to the assembly&#146;s observations on the
strategies by virtue of having to write and explain how he arrives at
his decisions. We believe that the Mayor already takes into account the
observations from London Councils, which I accept entirely is an
important strategic body in local government in London, and that he
already gives due weight to its views. We do not believe that the

					<a name="07010964000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
power to make appointments to London-wide public bodies is a key way
for the Mayor to exert influence in the capital. Clause 4 is therefore
welcome for introducing much greater accountability and transparency to
the appointments process. However, the Bill is overly hesitant, as the
new power will apply to only 10 key mayoral appointments, which leaves
more than 70 additional unelected senior posts in key public bodies to
which the Mayor could make appointments without any public oversight by
the assembly.</div>
					<a name="07010964000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
public bodies are responsible for setting strategic priorities,
delivering key services and spending billions of pounds of London
taxpayers&#146; money. We welcome the fact that the Bill concedes the
usefulness of confirmation hearings in principle, but it is not clear 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 10</div>why that principle should not be extended to all mayoral appointments to
public bodies in London. The public should have confidence that all
mayoral appointments are made on the basis of merit and not as a reward
for political loyalty or as an act of unaccountable mayoral
patronage.</div>
					<a name="07010964000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would not grant the assembly the power of veto over the
Mayor&#146;s powers of appointment, so the Mayor could still appoint.
That would not be an issue. The assembly&#146;s recommendations would
not be binding, but they would provide an opportunity to focus public
scrutiny on the credentials of the candidates for key public posts in
London, which would provide an important test of the credibility and
fitness to hold public office of the proposed appointees. That is the
purpose of the amendments, which also have the support of the official
Opposition.</div>
					<a name="07010964000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">London
assembly members agree with me that it is important that these key
amendments are accepted in Committee. They all have the unanimous
support of all the political parties in the London assembly.
Confirmation hearings are a new concept in this country and Parliament
has a responsibility to get this right first time. Amendments Nos. 7 to
14 and 37 would extend the power to hold confirmation hearings to
members other than chairs and deputy chairs and to the Museum of
London, the Mayor&#146;s cultural strategy group and the Learning and
Skills
Council.</div>
					<a name="07010964000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Appointments
to the boards of those bodies are worthy of the same scrutiny. For
example, the Museum of London is at the heart of London. It is visited
by more than 100,000 schoolchildren every year and it reinforces their
sense of the history of London, their citizenship and their sense of
belonging to the city. The Museum of London website is promoting an
interesting initiative this year: people can buy any year of
London&#146;s history between 1666 and 2012, although I am not sure
who they are buying it from. The Mayor has gone for 2012, for obvious
reasons.</div>
					<a name="07010964000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I point out
to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath the fact that 1979 is still
available for those who want to celebrate the coming to power of
Margaret Thatcher. I understand from a transcript of a recent interview
that the hon. Gentleman believes that she did nearly everything right
and was a heroic character.</div>
					
					<a name="07010964000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07010964000432"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> Will the hon. Gentleman tell us whether 1983 is
available? That is when Aberdeen won the European Cup Winner&#146;s

							<a name="07010964000433"></a>Tom

can look on the website, which clearly indicates which years are for
sale.</div>
					<a name="07010964000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
are necessary to prevent the inconsistency of the chair of a body being
subject to a confirmation hearing, but not his or her immediate
subordinates. Such a chair might be undermined by the Mayor&#146;s
appointees, who would not be subject to the same scrutiny by the
assembly.</div>
					<a name="07010964000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a recent
meeting, London First expressed concern that if this amendment were
supported by the Government and adopted, that would lead to London
grinding to a halt when a new Mayor was elected, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 11</div>because of the need to carry out a large number of confirmation
hearings. It is worth stressing again that the amendment would provide
such a power, but that that power would not have to be exercised except
when the appointment of a board member was deemed to be particularly
controversial. Many of the board posts are four-yearly; confirmation
hearings would therefore not be an annual event for 77 posts. In most
cases, they would happen only every four years, and only if there was a
need for that greater
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07010964000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 38 would require the Secretary of State to consult the assembly and
the Mayor before making an order that amended the list of appointments
that are subject to confirmation hearings. I hope that the Minister
understands why the assembly and the Mayor would want an opportunity to
comment on any such proposals or changes put forward by the Secretary
of State. This is a standard provision for secondary legislation that
relates to specific bodies, and it clearly makes
sense.</div>
					<a name="07010964000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I consider, as
I hope the official Opposition do, that the amendment would strengthen
the Government&#146;s case for improved scrutiny and transparency in
the appointments process. I hope that the Minister is willing to take
on board those very minor
changes.</div>

							<a name="07010964000434"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. O&#146;Hara. Having extended one set of apologies, I
would like to say that I am glad that, for once, it was not the
Minister or me who brought football into the discussion. In case I have
not formally declared it, I remind everyone of my involvement as a
member of the London assembly. I do not think that the clause has any
effect on any potential conflict of interest or any financial
matter.</div>
					<a name="07010964000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I
would like to give an example to reinforce a point made by the hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington. The boards, such as those of
Transport for London, have executive power. As Labour Members will
know, the Mayor sought to push forward a scheme for the Thames Gateway
bridge, which was approved only by a very narrow majority of the board
of Transport for London. There was a prospect&#151;I think there were
only one or two votes in it&#151;that the board would come to a
conclusion different from the Mayor&#146;s. In those circumstances,
it is not unreasonable that there should be an opportunity for the
assembly to know where potential nominees to the board of Transport for
London are coming from on an issue of such significance, which might
have indicated a potential difference of political opinion between the
Mayor and those whom he was nominating to the board. It would have been
useful and desirable to know that in
advance.</div>
					<a name="07010964000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
principle is excellent, and I am grateful to the Minister for listening
to the assembly and taking on board what it said. This a matter that we
raised with him, so I have no problem with it, and what I say is
intended to be wholly constructive. I understand that the names and
posts listed are an initial attempt, but within the Mayor&#146;s
administration, the nature of which may change under this Mayor or in
future, there are other posts of huge significance. It is not
disrespectful to post holders named here to suggest that the
Mayor&#146;s policy directors, who are not subject to any scrutiny, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 12</div>exercise hugely more power and receive significantly greater
remuneration than they do. People such as Redmond O&#146;Neill and
John Ross are well known as powerful figures in the Mayor&#146;s
administration.</div>
					<a name="07010964000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
is nothing wrong with that&#151;no criticism&#151;but if we are
scrutinising the nominees for chairman of the cultural
strategy group, should there not be the opportunity to consider other
powerful posts, on the board of Transport for London or beyond, that
exercise as much influence on the direction of mayoral policy as any of
the posts listed in the clause? In that constructive spirit, I support
the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07010964000440"></a>Robert

						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. The assembly
recognised, when it sought to support an extension along the lines of
the amendment, that it would not always be desirable to scrutinise
every nominee who fell within the potential heads and that, in
practice, the measure would be self-limiting. It is worth remembering
that there was widespread cross-party support for that in the assembly.
This is not a narrow, partisan position. The opportunity for scrutiny
should be included, as the hon. Gentleman has rightly said. The
amendment would strengthen the principle that the Minister and his
colleagues are seeking to introduce and would have a fair wind of
support from all parties in the assembly, which is a good thing that
will enable it to work better, as we all
want.</div>

							<a name="07010964000441"></a>Michael

for Carshalton and Wallington and echo some of the sentiments expressed

Chislehurst.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 13</div>
					<a name="07010964000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principle of confirmation
hearings may seem, at first glance, new to the British constitution and
is something that we more commonly associate with the American system
with its powerful Senate Committees. On the selection of Supreme Court
judges or cabinet appointees in America, Senate Committees can
scrutinise the records of those who are being appointed to important
public offices and, if necessary, recommend their refusal. That
principle is hallowed in America and has increasingly been adopted here
in the United Kingdom. One striking example of its adoption is in
respect of members of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of
England.</div>
					<a name="07010964000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the
decision of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make the Bank of England
independent&#151;probably his first and perhaps his last good
decision&#151;came an acknowledgement that this arm&#146;s length
devolution of power from the Executive should be accompanied by
enhanced parliamentary scrutiny. That is why, when any new member of
the MPC is put forward by the Chancellor and nominated to that body,
the confirmation process takes place and Treasury Committee members
have an opportunity to quiz them to assess their suitability for office
and, importantly, to gauge their position on various issues to ensure
that the MPC is balanced. We recognise that, in developing an
appropriate counter-inflation strategy for this country, the mix of
expertise, background and views matters. There is an established
parliamentary precedent as well as an established international
precedent for confirmation hearings. We welcome the fact that
confirmation hearings should be extended to the
GLA.</div>
					<a name="07010964000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington has pointed out, many of the
people who are appointed by the Mayor are responsible for huge budgets.
The functional bodies&#151;Transport for London, the London
Development Agency and the Metropolitan Police Authority&#151;are
responsible for millions of pounds of public money. They are
responsible, furthermore, for the discharge of services that intimately
affect the lives of all Londoners. In the case of the Metropolitan
Police Authority it is not only Londoners who are affected, because the
MPA is the lead police force in dealing with anti-terrorism, royal
protection and other vital security matters. So the people who are
appointed to the MPA have a role, a status, an influence and a
responsibility that extends beyond London&#146;s boundaries, and the
idea of introducing greater transparency, accountability and scrutiny
into such appointments is one that we wholeheartedly
welcome.</div>
					<a name="07010964000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington has pointed out, however, there is
a flaw in the Government proposal, because the Government seem to have
embraced the idea of confirmation hearings yet flinched from the full
consequences of their logic. The Government proposal would allow
confirmation hearings only for chairmen or deputy chairmen of the
respective bodies. It is important to appreciate that, although those
figures are the most important, they are not the only important
figures. Many of those appointed to other roles&#151;to the MPA, for
instance&#151;can exercise significant influence. An example would be
the position occupied by Mr. Peter Herbert, who sits on the
MPA and who is not elected but directly appointed. He is a figure whose
past record at the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 14</div>Greater London Council and elsewhere might give rise to concerns on the
part of some people about his views and how those views might affect
the discharge of the MPA&#146;s responsibilities. I myself cast no
aspersions on his suitability for the office&#151;on the evidence
that has come to me, he has discharged his responsibilities in an
exemplary fashion. At the time of his appointment, however, it was
understandable that some people might have taken a moment to express
concern, and at some point in the future the Mayor might wish to
appoint to Transport for London, or to the LDA or MPA, individuals
below the level of chair or deputy chair whose views or
responsibilities might cause the public to wonder why there is not more
scrutiny.</div>

							<b class="B">Ms
Karen Buck</b> (Regent's Park and Kensington, North) (Lab): I
am slightly confused by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. He is
drawing parallels with the MPC. However, is it not part of the point of
having confirmation hearings that the authority is not an executive
one? It is precisely because the Mayor has executive power that it is
not comparable. The Mayor is also subject to the scrutiny of the
electoral process, so going beyond key appointments is an entirely
unnecessary level of
intervention.</div>

							<a name="07010964000443"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> It is interesting to hear the hon. Lady make that
point, because she is arguing in effect against Londoners being given
more information on how they are governed and on who governs them. The
whole point of the confirmation hearing and of the amendment is that
with every appointment made to such bodies, there should be an
opportunity for accountable public debate on who is appointed. Whenever
the Mayor makes a nomination at the moment, there can, of course, be
external scrutiny by the press, or in this House, and questions can be
raised. We seek to ensure that the process is regularised and
formalised, and that there is an appropriate way to ensure that due
process is followed. If the current Mayor, or any future Mayor, is
confident that he is appointing the best men and women, he should not
fear scrutiny or a confirmation hearing. In fact, a hearing would only
bolster public confidence in the way in which London is governed and in
the way in which the Mayor makes such decisions. I see no argument for
decreasing scrutiny or
transparency.</div>

							<a name="07010964000444"></a>Ms
Buck:
						</b> The term that the hon. Gentleman has missed out from
his list is &#147;extension&#148;. It is not that key appointments
should not be properly scrutinised, but that a balance must be struck
when someone&#151;in this case, the Mayor&#151;has executive
authority that allows them to retain that authority. That balance must
maintain public confidence in a number of ways, including hearings for
key posts, but it must not over-egg the pudding by extending hearings
right down to the most junior staff members, as the hon. Gentleman has
suggested.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07010964000445"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> Again, I think that the hon. Lady has misunderstood
both the spirit and the letter of the amendment. We are not suggesting
scrutiny of the most junior staff members, such as junior aides or
administrative assistants. We are talking principally about the members
of functional bodies. My hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 15</div>Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has pointed out that some
individuals in other senior posts in the Mayor&#146;s establishment
have responsibilities ranking, in terms of influence and reach, with
those of members of functional bodies.</div>
					<a name="07010964000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall draw an example to the
attention of the hon. Lady and the Committee. The chair and deputy
chair of one of the functional bodies may well go through the scrutiny
process, but those two individuals&#146; freedom of action could be
undermined by the appointment at a future Mayor&#146;s behest of
other members who work against them. To those people who say,
&#147;Oh, the very idea! Imagine the authority of the head of a
London-wide body being subverted from within,&#148; I say remember
what happened to Lord McIntosh many years ago, when another figure
managed to subvert from within. There is a precedent in London
governance for the head of an organisation to find that others burrow
from within to subvert his authority. Talking of
burrowing&#151;</div>

						</b> During his time in this House, the hon. Gentleman
has earned himself a reputation as a skilled forensic scientist, and
his language is normally very precise. He used the word
&#147;principally&#148; in the context of the amendment.
Unfortunately, that word is loose and ill-defined. It worries us that
he seems to be opening up the provisions to a limitless number of
people. Will he remove the word &#147;principally&#148; and
concentrate on precisely those grades of staff to which he is
referring?</div>

confused by some of the&#151;how can I put this?
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> No, no. The word that I was searching for is
&#147;chaff&#148;. He has allowed himself to be confused by the
chaff thrown up by the hon. Member for Regent&#146;s Park and
Kensington, North. The amendment is precise. I am grateful to the hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington for framing it, because it is
perfectly clear to whom it would apply. It would apply precisely to
members of functional bodies and extend to the Museum of London,
because that is an existing body to which the Mayor will have a new
right to appoint
governance.</div>
					<a name="07010964000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
entirely precise whom the amendment would cover. My hon. Friend the
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst pointed out what is no more than a
matter of fact&#151;that other individuals appointed by the Mayor
have significant powers&#151;but all that the amendment seeks to do
is ensure that other members of functional bodies appointed by the
Mayor are subject to the confirmation
process.</div>

Brake:
						</b> It is clear that Government Members have a degree
of support for the proposed measures, but they are seeking clarity as
to which people will be affected. Perhaps we can come to an agreement
that we are literally talking only about the seven individuals who will
serve on the different boards. The amendment sets that out clearly. If
hon. Members would consider it more carefully than they have so far,
they will see to which boards we are referring. It is very
clear.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman has amplified and underlined my
point. We have not only numbered but listed the precise appointments.
If it is not clear after reading the amendment, I suggest that the hon.
Members for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North and for Ealing,
North talk to the Labour members of the Greater London Assembly who
support the proposed measures.</div>
					<a name="07010964000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the striking things
about the amendment is that it has the support of every Member of the
GLA. Why? Because all of them, whatever their ideological views,
recognise that the principal role envisaged for the GLA when it was
established was scrutiny. The principal function of a scrutinising body
is to scrutinise how public money is spent. The principal bodies that
spend public money in London at the Mayor&#146;s behest are the
functional bodies, and the principal individuals who are responsible
for spending that money are members of the board. Four sets of
principles are at the heart of the
amendment.</div>

						I
hope that the Minister will listen to his colleagues on the Greater
London assembly, who are entirely in favour of the extension of the
confirmation process from those figures named under the legislation to
those figures named under our amendment. If he does, he not only will
win the support and applause of Conservative and Liberal Democrat
Members of Parliament, but&#151;this will come sweeter to his
ear&#151;he will win the applause of those hard-working Labour
members of the GLA who want to work even harder in the interests of
Londoners by scrutinising the Mayor&#146;s
work.</div>

							<a name="07010964000450"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> I take the point made by the hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington about getting ahead of ourselves. I am sure
that the Government Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and
Aylesford, via the usual channels and you, Mr.
O&#146;Hara, can reassure us that that will not be the case. I also
acknowledge the experience that the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst brings to the Committee as a serving member of the GLA.
However, that does not mean that we shall accept the conclusions that
he has drawn from his time
there.</div>
					<a name="07010964000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Confirmation
hearings will provide the assembly with an important and exciting new
power that its members could use to good effect. They will allow
assembly members to scrutinise appointments that the Mayor intends to
make; they will assist in assessing the calibre of candidates and their
suitability for appointment; and they will enable assembly members to
establish candidates&#146; plans for their new roles and, if
necessary, to challenge an appointment before the Mayor makes his final
decision.</div>
					<a name="07010964000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
great difficulty with amendments Nos. 7 to 14 and amendment No. 37,
which seek to specify further offices to which confirmation hearings
may apply, which is neither necessary nor desirable at this stage. We
believe that it is sensible to allow the new process to bed down and
for the assembly to make a success of its new role before considering
whether to extend the list of offices to which the hearings may apply.
We propose that the assembly should initially
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 17</div>concentrate on scrutinising the most important appointments that the
Mayor makes&#151;those that have the greatest influence on delivery,
particularly the chairs and deputy chairs of the functional
bodies.</div>
					<a name="07010964000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendments would result in the assembly being faced with a bewildering
array of offices&#151;our calculations indicate that it would be more
than 100 offices. I acknowledge that the calculations by the hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington have produced a different figure,
but none the less there would be a greater number of offices on which
to decide whether to hold a confirmation hearing. We are not setting in
stone the number of offices subject to confirmation hearings. Clause 4
provides for the Secretary of State to specify further offices by
order, should she wish to do so. Should the need arise, it provides the
flexibility to extend the list of offices without the requirement for
primary legislation.</div>
					<a name="07010964000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington for
explaining amendment No. 38. It seems sensible that, should the
Secretary of State wish to consider further offices being subject to
confirmation hearings, she should seek the views of the Mayor and the
assembly before deciding on an appropriate course of action. However, I
do not believe it necessary that the Bill should require the Secretary
of State to have regard to the views of the Mayor and the assembly, but
I welcome the opportunity to consider the amendment more carefully to
see whether we can introduce a suitably drafted proposal at a later
stage.</div>

							<a name="07010964000451"></a>Stephen
Pound:
						</b> On that point, and in the spirit of the search for
clarity and consensus, which is so typical of the Committee, I draw
attention to amendments Nos. 9 and 10, which refer to the MPA and the
London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. If we are to extend the
measure beyond the two titular roles, who will do the confirmations?
Will not the members be interviewing themselves? Has my hon. Friend
given any thought to
that?</div>

							<a name="07010964000452"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> We certainly have. Government officials have
looked at all the functional bodies and those members who are appointed
by the Mayor as opposed to those who are appointed by the boards and
Secretaries of State that make up a variety of different categories.
That is why we are suggesting that it is not appropriate to extend
matters beyond the chairs and vice-chairs, but the issue could be
revisited in due course to see whether there should be an extension of
hearings for appropriate members. The maximum number of appointments
that we calculate from the bodies mentioned in the amendments is 135,
and I can certainly share where we have got that information from with
the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington. With that assurance in
respect of amendment No. 38, I hope that he will not press it now.
However, we do not accept the other amendments, which we ask to be
withdrawn.</div>

the Secretary of State. I am sure that the official Opposition thank
him as well, because that is clearly helpful.</div>

real substance of this debate, the confirmation hearings, I have heard
nothing from the Minister to explain why the Government accept in

deputy chairs of a whole range of bodies, but are not for other board
members, who, in a worst case scenario, could have the power to subvert
the activities of those boards, even if the chair and deputy chair had
been subject to scrutiny and were clearly appropriate for the job.
Being disappointed in that respect, I will therefore press the
amendment.</div>

Gove:
						</b> I confess that we would have been prepared to
withdraw the amendment had the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington and my hon. Friends been successful in the previous debate.
We sought only to improve the scrutiny power of the GLA, and the option
in front of us was to ensure that confirmation hearings extend across
the piece. As I have outlined, the view of every party in the GLA is
that that should happen. Sadly, there is a split in the Labour ranks
between the parliamentary party, perhaps jealous of its privileges or
anxious to shield its old friend the Mayor from scrutiny, and those in
the GLA actively engaged in scrutiny work, who have been deprived of a
valuable scrutinising
power.</div>
					<a name="07010964000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">What can
Conservative Members do to help the GLA enhance its powers of scrutiny?
We have outlined how another weapon can be placed in its hands by
ensuring that its existing scrutiny power on appointments has teeth. We
originally wanted to ensure that the confirmation process involves
probing the views of those appointed to functional bodies, assessing
their suitability and ensuring that their fitness for office and the
views that they carry forward to the discharge of their duties are
examined appropriately and transparently. We have been denied that
opportunity, but we can ensure that the Mayor thinks twice before
making appointments to the crucial roles of chairman or deputy
chairman, because the assembly can block them by a
majority.</div>
					<a name="07010964000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
points about requiring a simple majority in the assembly, as I am sure
the Committee will grasp, is that because it is elected under the
proportional representation additional member system, it is extremely
unlikely that any political party could ever get a simple majority. The
only way in which a Mayor&#146;s unsuitable nominations could be
blocked would be if there were an effective coalition. The electoral
system governing the composition of the GLA means that the tool we wish
to provide the assembly with could not be fashioned into a partisan
billhook. It would give the assembly, or responsible parties within it,
the opportunity to block a future Mayor who wished to exercise his
powers
irresponsibly.</div>
					<a name="07010964000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington has pointed out, chairmen or
deputy chairmen of the various functional bodies have at their disposal
millions of pounds of public money. Through the amendment, we suggest
that before the Mayor appoints individuals to those posts he should
know that if he recommends people who are either politically 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 20</div>convenient or to whom he owes a debt for some reason, and who are not up
to the task, the GLA&#146;s capacity to recommend that they not be
appointed will force him to appoint individuals of real
calibre.</div>
					<a name="07010964000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned
in the previous debate that in the United States the Senate has the
power to recommend refusal in confirmation hearings. In the past, it
has ensured that certain individuals who were inappropriate, either
because of their ideology&#151;such as the Supreme Court nominee
Robert Bork&#151;or because of other executive failings, could not be
appointed. The Senate exercises that power with a degree of
deliberation and an absence of partisanship in most circumstances,
which bolsters its standing. For a simple majority in the GLA to
prevent the Mayor from making an appointment is the most effective
safeguard that we can think of against the frivolous, capricious,
partisan or ideological or the brazen preferment of individuals who are
unsuitable for the serious offices in question.</div>
					<a name="07010964000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the failure of the
Government to accept the amendment, I hope that they will look
favourably on ensuring that the reserve scrutiny power can be exercised
by the
GLA.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman reminds me of a saying of Ernie

say, for modern Labour

					<a name="07010964000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If we

subscribe to Ernie Bevin&#146;s dictum, but nor would I subscribe to
the Boss Prendergast machine that we seem to be hearing about from the
hon. Gentleman. We seem to be hearing a description of a city
Administration that is more akin to James Michael Curley in Boston in
the 1930s&#151;a gloriously, magnificently corrupt Administration, it
has to be said&#151;than what we are actually faced with. There are
checks and balances within this. Our duty as a Committee&#151;it is
an extraordinary privilege to sit for the first time on a Committee
that contains four Fulham season ticket holders, particularly as that
represents about 50 per cent. of the attendance&#151;is to
allow the disinfectant of sunlight to enter in while still allowing the
smooth running of the operation of the GLA.</div>
					<a name="07010964000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Were we to enter the strange,
dystopic world described from the perspective of Surrey Heath, of

						</b> I am following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point
closely, as ever, but would he not concede that it is sometimes
desirable to have a process such as that suggested by my hon. Friend
the Member for Surrey Heath as a safeguard to nominees who might
wrongly be the subject of such a suspicion as the hon. Gentleman
raises? Does he not concede that it could be thought, for example, that
a Mayor might appoint an old friend and former colleague from other
days as the deputy chairman of a significant functional body, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 21</div>because he had signed his nomination paper and been expelled from his
political party for his pains in supporting the Mayor at an earlier
stage? Would it not be better for a nominee&#151;an admirable
person&#151;in such a situation to be able to say that he has the
confidence and support of the assembly in its confirmation of office? I
think that the hon. Gentleman gets my
drift.</div>

							<a name="07010964000490"></a>Stephen
Pound:
						</b> One would have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to
have got that drift this morning; it is about as subtle as a
sledgehammer. I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comment. We tend to
make mistakes if we see policy in terms of personality, and if we tend
to think of legislation in terms of individuals. What we are talking
about here is a system for all eventualities: a GLA for all seasons,
rather than a man for all seasons. The hon. Gentleman, who has at least
two jobs and earns twice as much as I do, is quite right not to apply
for yet another one. That would be erring on the side of greed, which
is an emotion to which he is a complete stranger.</div>
					<a name="07010964000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The whole process and procedure
of the GLA could come to a grinding halt if there were political malice
and if people chose to oppose the appointments. At present, the Mayor
must have heed to the voice of the assembly. Let us not forget that the
Mayor must then notify the assembly, as page 52, line 12 of the Bill
confirms, of his decision whether to accept or reject the
recommendation. There is a strong element of public scrutiny. I have
sympathy with the hon. Member for Surrey Heath&#151;that is not an
expression that I will ever repeat&#151;in his wish to give the
matter teeth, and his own sharp incisors have already been in evidence
in the few hours for which the Committee has so far deliberated.
However, do we need those additional teeth? I think that were we to put
in this additional filter, it would inevitably slow down the process
unnecessarily. There is nothing wrong with slowing down a process if it
is a means to an end. In this case we have that procedure in the Bill.
We have that check and balance. We have that balance whereby the GLA
can operate and appointments can be made subject to scrutiny and
subject to verification and statement by the Mayor, who must explain
it. For us to go further would be a recipe for disaster.</div>
					<a name="07010964000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whereas I know that no men or
women in the Committee today are malicious or would in any way wish to
bring the whole process to a halt, there might at some stage be such
people. I am talking not about particular individuals, but about people
of that type. Let us stick with what we have got. If a relevant
situation occurs in the future, by all means let us look at it, but at
the moment the GLA is not Kansas city in the 1930s or Boston in the
1940s. The world would be rather more exciting if it were. Both those
Administrations had extremely good music, but they were fairly corrupt.
We are talking about a system that is accountable and transparent. We
know what is going on and we have more than enough in the provisions to
provide the essential balance between the legislative checks, the
scrutiny procedure and the smooth running of the
assembly.</div>

						</b> I am afraid that I oppose the amendment, although I
hate to part company with the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, as we have
been doing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 22</div>so well so far. Whether one likes it or not, the model that has been
adopted for London government is very much a Mayor with a GLA to
scrutinise what he does. Our debate about confirmation hearings was
entirely appropriate because that is a way for the assembly to
scrutinise the Mayor&#146;s appointments. This amendment, however,
which would give the assembly the power to block a mayoral nominee,
goes against the grain of what has been agreed in relation to the
GLA&#151;the model of Mayor and a scrutinising assembly. Although I
understand the reasons for the proposal and why it might be appropriate
to have a fallback, on this one amendment I will have to part company
with the hon.
Gentleman.</div>

							<a name="07010964000492"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North
eloquently put the case on which I am about to elaborate. He was
supported by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington; I hope that
it will not be the only time that he will join the Government during
the Bill&#146;s passage.</div>
					<a name="07010964000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have already indicated, I
believe that confirmation hearings provide the assembly with an
important new power. They will enable the assembly to carry out a
rigorous public scrutiny of candidates whom the Mayor wishes to appoint
to the offices specified in clause 4 and to recommend to the Mayor
whether the candidate should be appointed to the office. That is the
crucial point.</div>
					<a name="07010964000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
role of the assembly is to scrutinise the calibre of candidates and
their suitability for appointment to the office in question, but it is
right that the Mayor, as the executive of the GLA, should retain the
final say over the statutory appointments he is required to make.
Accepting the amendment would give the assembly the final say over
which candidate should be appointed. It would risk blurring the
currently clear lines of accountability for these appointments. We
believe that it would compromise the assembly&#146;s scrutiny role
and it could lead to deadlock between the Mayor and the assembly over
whom should be appointed. I hope that hon. Members can agree on the
importance of retaining the distinct roles of the Mayor and the
assembly in the confirmation hearings process, and that they will not
seek to press the
amendment.</div>

Gove:
						</b> I am grateful to all the hon. Members who have
spoken in the debate because I feel that all of them, in their own way,
have only reinforced the case for the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07010964000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Let me first
touch on one of the points that the Minister made. He talked about the
doctrine of accountability and the way in which the amendment would
blur accountability. Let us consider that thought for a moment. In the
Bill as it stands there is provision for confirmation hearings: the
assembly could express itself not content with an individual who has
been put forward for office, and the Mayor could say, &#147;Do you
know what? That is a very good point, and I am afraid that this
individual, now that you have cross-examined them and we know a little
more about their record, is unsuitable. I withdraw the
nomination.&#148; He is perfectly at liberty to do that as part of
the confirmation process. Indeed, it is explicitly made clear in the
Bill that the Mayor will give his reasons for either going ahead in the
event of GLA disquiet, or withdrawing.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 23</div>
					<a name="07010964000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
legislation therefore already allows for the fact that, following
assembly representations, the Mayor would withdraw a nomination, so the
principle of sole mayoral appointment, unfettered by any level of
scrutiny, has already been conceded. In that respect, the Mayor remains
accountable. It is always his decision as to whom he puts forward. The
assembly has no right of nomination; it simply has a right to say,
after scrutinising an individual appointment, that it thinks it
unsuitable. Our amendment would ensure that the Mayor could not ride
roughshod over the assembly&#146;s
view.</div>
					<a name="07010964000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with the
hon. Member for Ealing, North that we should not build legislation
around existing personalities. One of the points about this Mayor is
that he is an inevitably controversial figure. I am sure that we can
all agree that he has done some good and some bad things in office, and
that it would be wrong to paint every one of his actions in deepest
black. Nevertheless, so far he is the only person to have occupied the
role of Mayor of London, so we must use some of his actions as a
precedent when scrutinising new powers or new limits on the power of
the Mayor. One of the interesting things about the way in which the
Mayor has handled his power&#151;I suspect that we will return to it
later&#151;is his handling of the congestion charge. I am sure that
we will hear some interesting comments on
that.</div>

Andrew Slaughter</b> (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush)
(Lab): I have been ruminating on the comment that has just
been made&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I have it with me. The hon.
Gentleman raises a point of general interest. He says that the current
Mayor has been the only Mayor, so we should take heed of what he has
done. However, as he is the only Mayor to have held the
post&#151;there will be others in future&#151;would it not be
sensible, rather than rushing to judgment and to legislation, to leave
in abeyance the point that the hon. Gentleman makes, which he might
advance many times during the Committee&#146;s proceedings, and wait
until we have three or four Mayors under our belts before we start
tinkering around with possibly unnecessary
legislation?</div>

Gove:
						</b> I am grateful, as ever, for the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intervention. It is interesting, because its premise
is that we should wait until we have had three or four incumbents of
the office before changing the powers of the incumbent. That is an
argument against the whole Bill; it is an argument against bringing
forward legislation. If I remember the Division lists correctly, the
hon. Gentleman voted in favour of the Bill. In fact, I remember his
speech in favour of it. He now seems to be disavowing that principle. I
should be grateful if he clarified his position. Does he believe that
it is appropriate, now that we have had a Mayor for several years, to
consider the extent of his powers and influence, and amend it
appropriately? I assume that he thinks that that is appropriate and,
given his earlier vote in favour of limiting confirmation hearings
simply to chairs and deputy chairs, that he accepts that there should
be a new constraint on the Mayor&#146;s capacity to appoint officers.
If he wishes to disavow those votes, I am sure that the Committee will
be very interested in his arguments.</div>

								Mr.
Slaughter:
						</b> I made the mistake, which I shall never make
again, of not being back in the Chamberfor the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s winding-up speech, for which I apologised to him at
the time. Had I been present, I should have been able to correct him
when he said that I spoke in an unqualified way in favour of the powers
that the Mayor had been exercising thus far. He is right that I voted
in favour of Second Reading, but he is generalising from a particular
point that I made. Clearly, it is important after six years to consider
how the job is being done and how the post is going. However, some of
the amendments appear to indicate&#151;as the intervention of the
hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst suggested&#151;if not
vindictiveness, at least personal interest in what the current Mayor is
doing. I am simply advising the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, if I may
be so bold, to steer clear of
that.</div>

am sorry that the hon. Gentleman was not present to hear my summing up,
not because it was a triumph of oratory&#151;far from it&#151;but
because in the course of my remarks, I committed a terrible
solecism&#151;at least one. When I referred to comments made by the
hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush in the debate,
I called him the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham. I would hate
anyone to think that it is possible to confuse my hon. Friend the
Member for Hammersmith and Fulham with the hon. Member for Ealing,
Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush. The reason why I made that mistake is
partly that the hon. Gentleman was in a previous life leader, I
believe, of Hammersmith and Fulham council, when it was led by the
Labour party, before the Conservatives took over and reduced the
council tax by a whopping 3 per
cent.</div>

					<a name="07010968000003"></a><div class="hs_Para">In those
benighted days, the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s
Bush developed something of a reputation. It was because of that
reputation that the mistaken title was indelibly branded on my mind, so
apologies to him for that. I also apologise if I have misunderstood the
burden of his remarks on Second Reading. My understanding was that he
spoke in favour of all the provisions in the Bill. While other Labour
Members who had concerns about key aspects of the Bill are not,
amazingly, on the Committee, the hon. Gentleman, as someone who spoke
in favour of every aspect of the Bill, finds himself here. I do not
know how the process works because, as I explained earlier,
Mr. O&#146;Hara, I am new to these things.</div>
					<a name="07010968000004"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Ealing,
Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush has made an important point. It is
true that we should not attempt to legislate for the Mayor&#146;s
office on the basis of the current Mayor&#146;s personality. However,
we cannot ignore how the Mayor has used his powers, because it suggests
how a future Mayor, who may be less responsible or conscientious, might
exploit the loopholes. I note that the Minister for Housing and
Planning is shaking her head at the thought that any future Mayor could
be less responsible or less conscientious than the incumbent, but I
will pass over those internal Labour matters.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 25</div>
					<a name="07010968000005"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was due to mention the
congestion charge, to which I know that we shall return on its own
merits. I have mentioned it now because when the Mayor was consulting
on the westward extension of the congestion charge, he gave the
impression that the process would be transparent and accountable, that
there would be scrutiny of the new power that he wished to exercise and
that there would be an informed debate. At the end of the consultation
process, the Mayor basically said, &#147;Look, I&#146;m in charge,
I&#146;m the Executive, I&#146;ve got responsibility. We&#146;re
extending it. Fiat, let it be.&#148; And so it was. My concern is
that when it comes to appointments to functional bodies, a future Mayor
will be able to say to the assembly, &#147;Look, you made a very good
case as to why I should not appoint this person but, frankly,
I&#146;m in charge. I&#146;ll do what I like&#148;, which is what
the current Mayor did with the westward extension of the congestion
charge. That would unfortunately discredit the GLA and the whole
process of confirmation that the Government are seeking to include in
the Bill.</div>

disaggregates voting in London, one can see that in those areas
affected by the westward extension of the congestion charge,
particularly the area represented by the leader of the Conservatives on
the GLA, Angie Bray, the Conservative vote went up while the Labour
vote went down. In the subsequent borough elections in Kensington and
Chelsea and in Hammersmith and Fulham, which are the areas affected by
the westward extension of the congestion charge, the Labour vote was
further depressed and the Conservative vote was significantly
increased, which led to the transfer of control in Hammersmith and

						</b> The hon. Members who have intervened on my hon.

charge is but an example, that the imposition of the congestion charge
required a resolution of the board of Transport for London. As the
executive body, Transport for London imposed the charge to reflect the
will of the Mayor, which we accept. Is that not a strong argument for
the boards of all the functional bodies that carry out significant
executive functions being subject to the scrutiny function? That is why
this strengthened measure is the appropriate means by which to compel
the Mayor to refrain from appointing people who may demonstrably not be
up to the discharge of those executive
functions.</div>

was</div>
					<a name="07010968000055"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a little less
democracy and a little more
trust&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07010968000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
unsurprising that someone who had been in charge of the Transport and
General Workers Union should have asked for less democracy and more
trust. It is also unsurprising that Ernie Bevin, a classic old Labour
figure who became addicted to the power of the Executive and
increasingly distrustful of scrutiny, should have taken that position,
but I am sorry to hear those words repeated in tones of reverence by
the hon. Gentleman. I would have thought that one of the key legacies
of Tony Blair&#146;s years in power, which Labour party members
should want to celebrate, is the principle of devolution and the idea
that new gusts of accountability are going through previously closed
corridors of
power.</div>

						</b> In quoting the great Ernie Bevin, who thought that
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was a breakaway branch of the T

and I specifically stated for the record that I was not endorsing those
comments, sympathetic though I may
be.</div>

						</b> I grateful for that clarification. Whether or not
the hon. Gentleman endorses all Ernie Bevin&#146;s sentiments, my
concern is that if the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 27</div>Government were not to accept the amendment, we would see a flawed
confirmation process. I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that
we do not have government in London that bears comparison with the boss
culture in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s, but we are all
aware of the lesson that it is only through the maintenance and use of
effective scrutiny mechanisms that we can avoid the descent into rotten
borough-ism. We have here a power that any responsible Mayor would
welcome. Any responsible Mayor would be happy to see any of his
nominees to these key posts go through a confirmation process and
secure the additional support of an open vote in the assembly, which
would underline their appropriateness for the job. The Mayor has been
perfectly happy to accept that the principle of election is the basis
of the authority on which he operates. Why should there not be a
similar vote for his
nominees?</div>

said that the absence of Liberal Democrat support weakens the force of

defeated the last amendment, he would not be proposing these

Gove:
						</b> No; I was making a point. At first glance, to the
superficial observer of our deliberations, it might seem as though the
desertion of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington weakens the
force of our argument. In fact, his conscientious objection strengthens
it, because for any majority to exist within the GLA, Conservatives and
Liberal Democrats, for the sake of argument, need to work together.
Those people who think that we are joined at the hip and that we are
one unified, raucous, populist caucus intent on subverting the power of
the executive will have been disabused by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
decision not to vote with us. That Tories and Liberal Democrats
disagree emphasises the point that when it comes to the appointment of
individuals, one cannot expect all the Opposition parties to unite
against the Mayor.</div>
					<a name="07010968000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
declining to support the amendment, the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington has underlined the fact that the parties operate
independently in the GLA and that our requirement for a simple majority
for confirmations is an effective new scrutiny weapon which, in the
absence of the previous amendment, can only enhance trust in the
Mayor&#146;s appointments. I therefore hope that the Government will
accept it.</div>

Brake:
						</b> The Great London Authority Act 1999 provides that
the assembly is responsible for appointing staff to the authority,
including those responsible for the three distinct roles of setting the
establishment, agreeing staffing-related policies and procedures and
appointing staff. In practice, assembly members are not involved
directly in the appointment of staff other than to senior posts within
the secretariat, the statutory officers, and director-level
appointments across the rest of the authority. This highlights an
important distinction in respect of the staffing
establishment&#151;the creation and deletion of positions&#151;and
the appointment of staff, filling the posts that have already been
created on the staff establishment. The Bill would transfer
responsibility for creating and deleting posts and appointing staff to
those posts&#151;apart from the head of paid service, the statutory
finance officer and the monitoring officer who would be appointed
jointly by the Mayor and assembly&#151;from the London Assembly to
the Greater London Authority&#146;s head of paid
service.</div>
					<a name="07010964000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 56 and 57 would, if amendments Nos. 39 or 40 were not accepted,
amend the Bill to put in place safeguards requiring the head of paid
service to consult the Mayor and assembly before taking decisions
relating to the establishment of the authority, and prevent the head of
paid service from delegating his functions in relation to the creation
and deletion of posts to any other officer of the authority. The
assembly unanimously supports the introduction of these safeguards, so
again the Minister is in a position where amendments are being put
forward with the full support of all parties on the assembly. Clearly,
GLA members will look carefully at this debate to see why, if the
Minister chooses to refuse these amendments, he has taken that
position.</div>
					<a name="07010964000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The head of
paid service must be placed under a statutory duty to consult the
London assembly and the Mayor in advance of any decision on the
creation and deletion of posts within the authority's staffing
establishment. That would ensure that the head of paid service has
regard to the views of the Mayor and assembly, and is accountable to
them for his decisions. It would also ensure that the current degree of
transparency in decision making about staffing policies and procedures,
and the size and functions of the establishment, is retained.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 31</div>
					<a name="07010964000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The head of paid service should
not be allowed to delegate his powers relating to the creation and
deletion of posts in the authority. The power so to delegate could
result in a diffusion of responsibility and accountability, as well as
potentially making the decision-making process less transparent. If the
Government choose not to accept amendments Nos. 56 and 57, amendment
No. 40 would maintain the status quo so that the assembly remained
responsible for staffing matters within the authority&#151;with the
exception of the head of paid service, the statutory finance officer
and monitoring officer, who would be jointly appointed by the Mayor and
assembly.</div>
					<a name="07010964000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Minister responds, he thus has two options. He, or the Minister for
Housing and Planning, whom I welcome to the Front Bench, could opt to
explain why the status quo is not favoured when it provides certain
safeguards but does not stop the Mayor and the authority functioning
effectively. The Minister for Housing and Planning could say why she is
unhappy with those present arrangements; she also has the opportunity
to explain why she is not supporting safeguards that could be put in
place when this change, if it occurs, will see the head of paid service
take responsibility for staff. I will listen carefully to the
Minister&#146;s reply, and hold fire until I have heard that, before
seeing how I want to proceed with these particular
amendments.</div>

							<b class="B">Michael
Gove</b>: I support the principle and detail of the amendments
standing in the name of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington.
After the briefest of estrangements over this debate, I am happy that
we are once more reunited. It is wonderful to have the warm embrace of
the Liberal Democrats once more restored. I will make no comment about
the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), or about the
Liberal Democrats leaving and then re-embracing other
individuals.</div>
					<a name="07010964000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to
the matter under debate, the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington
pointed out that the current arrangement works well. It has the merit
of ensuring that the assembly has an important role to play in staff
appointments. It is important to clear up any concerns that some may
have. It is not the case that the assembly is responsible for the
meanest and lowliest staff appointment, as some may think. The assembly
is not responsible for every discharge of executive function but,
crucially, it determines the overall staff complement and has a key
role in certain important staff appointments. It is important to
appreciate why this system, which I accept is distinctive and not
replicated in any other part of local government, has worked well so
far. That is because it ensures that debates about staffing can occur
transparently and openly, by operating across parties.</div>
					<a name="07010964000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						One concern
that many people had about the mayoral system, and the idea of an
executive Mayor, was its departure from existing local government
practice in England and Wales. There was concern that we would see
municipal Bonapartism&#151;that rather than a Napoleon of Notting
Hill, there would be a Napoleon for the whole of London&#151;and that
questions of staffing, the discharge of executive functions and policy
would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 32</div>decided by the Mayor and his kitchen cabinet without appropriate
openness or transparency.</div>
					<a name="07010964000218"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">
						The
Liberal Democrats and I, and my Back-Bench colleagues, have been
trying&#151;and will try during the progress on the Bill&#151;to
bring those decisions into the light wherever possible, whether on
planning, housing or any other area, to ensure that there is maximum
transparency and accountability. One good thing about this legislation
which the Government originally brought forward in their first term was
that there was already greater transparency and accountability about
the creation of the staff complement. Because it was the assembly that
debated and fixed those matters, it was not simply the case that the
Mayor, in the privacy of his own kitchen cabinet, could take his
decisions; we could have extensive public scrutiny of them. As a result
of that, there is general agreement that the system has worked well.
What we are likely to see here is a departure from a system that is
transparent and open and works well to a system that will favour the
Mayor and limit the degree of transparency and openness.</div>
					<a name="07010964000219"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">It might be
argued that the new system is closer to local government practice and
to the principle that a chief executive should be responsible for
appointing staff. In fact, it marks a departure away from a welcome
precedent that the Government established in the original legislation.
One of the things that it is important to recognise is that the Mayor
of London occupies a distinctive position in the whole system of
governance that we have in the UK. We do not have any other analogous
individual who exercises such a degree of power. To try to say that the
Mayor should have all the benefits but none of the constraints that
apply in local government elsewhere is to shift the balance in a way
that we consider to be unfortunate.</div>
					<a name="07010964000220"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">I know that some
people will say that all that is proposed is that a
bureaucrat&#151;an enlightened bureaucrat at that, a head of paid
service&#151;is responsible for discharging those functions. However,
that individual will find that he or she comes more under the sway of
the Mayor and the Mayor&#146;s private office, and is less directly
accountable to the assembly than is the case at the moment. Given the
way that the Government seek to try to remove transparency and
accountability from the current process of setting the staff
complement, we believe that the Liberal Democrat amendments, by seeking
to preserve the existing system, strike a blow for greater
accountability, which should be at the heart of every measure within
the Bill. We are therefore more than happy to support the amendments
that stand in the name of the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington.</div>

						</b> May I support the principle of what has been said
by my hon. Friend? I will trespass on the Committee&#146;s time for a
short period to reinforce that in practice. It will be a shame if, for
what I accept are genuinely good intentions, the Government disturb a
system that has worked well, and is regarded by those people who are
members of the assembly and by those who work for the GLA as having
worked well. The assembly has never sought to use its current power to
interfere in the vast majority of appointments. I have referred on
other occasions to one or two rather controversial appointments that
the Mayor has made within the staff of the GLA. There was some
political 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 33</div>controversy about that, and some controversy in the press, but at the
end of the day, those of us who thought that they were mistaken
appointments, having made our point, did not seek to obstruct them
through the mechanism of the assembly.</div>
					<a name="07010964000222"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">It was also
important that the Mayor had to seek an accommodation with the parties
in the assembly to make sure that what he did was acceptable, in broad
terms, to public policy. It is worth paying tribute to the current
leader of the Labour group on the London assembly, Len Duval, who,
during those early periods, was chairman of the business management and
appointments committee of the assembly, and who worked in co-operation
with Conservative and Liberal Democrat leaders&#151;I was one of
them&#151;to ensure that we did not get involved in confrontation.
The assembly has not abused its current powers. On the contrary, it has
used them in a measured way. So why move away from them? &#147;If
it&#146;s not broke, don&#146;t fix it&#148; is a pretty good
maxim. I know that the Minister regards Mr. Duval&#146;s
judgment highly, in these and all matters, including that most
important, which has been alluded to&#151;the fortunes of the great
West Ham United. I hope that he will think again about his judgment
there.</div>
					<a name="07010964000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I make two
other short points? This is not a criticism of the chief executive, the
current head of paid service, who is recognised on all sides as a
public servant of most outstanding calibre who has worked well with all
parties in the assembly and with the Mayor. However, such a post holder
is put in a difficult situation. The assembly has taken decisions on
staffing at a high level, in public, through its business management
and appointments committee, and reports have been made in public to the
full assembly. That transparency is hugely important and should not be
compromised, which is a concern that we have for the integrity of the
working of the
organisation.</div>

the opposite direction. Does he also agree that it would be pertinent
for members to know what the current head of paid service thinks about
the changes? He will be required to implement them and he might have

officers of the GLA have sought the power in question, and it is
difficult to see where it has come from. I do not wish to strike an
uncharitable note, but I hope that it is not the result of a trade-off
to make up for disappointment about other powers being given to the
Mayor. There has been no suggestion from any professional body that the
change is needed. That was the important point that the hon. Gentleman

it is not broke and does not need fixing. I was certainly not
misrepresenting what Labour assembly members say. They certainly agreed
that if there were to be any changes, safeguards needed to be put in

history, it is difficult to discern where the drive for the idea has
come from. The assumption will be that it came from the Mayor or from
his office, but it is worth remembering that the assembly has as good a
mandate as the Mayor&#151;it is elected at the same time by the same
people. It would be interesting to know why the Government feel obliged
to adopt one particular course when there is a clear and coherent
consensus against it and when, as the hon. Gentleman observed, the
proposal flies against the general intellectual thrust of the Bill.
That troubles me.</div>

Minister for Housing and Planning (Yvette Cooper):
						</b> I
apologise for having missed the opening hour of the sitting owing to a
long-standing engagement. It is a pleasure to serve under your
Chairmanship, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I am sure that the debate
will be cheerful throughout our proceedings on the Bill, even when we
disagree.</div>
					<a name="07010964000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">This part
of the debate covers both a number of amendments that have been tabled
and the matter of clause stand part. In my response I shall therefore
first cover the purpose of the proposed provisions and then the
amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington.</div>
					<a name="07010964000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 67
of the Greater London Assembly Act 1999 provides for the
appointment of three categories of authority staff. First, the Mayor
can appoint two political advisers. Those are personal appointments
made by the Mayor alone. Secondly, the Mayor can appoint not more than
10 other members of staff whose posts are open to competition, with
appointment on merit. Finally, the assembly appoints all other
authority staff after consultation with the
Mayor.</div>
					<a name="07010964000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 7
provides for the staff who are currently appointed by the Assembly to
be appointed in future by the authority&#146;s head of paid service,
who is the most senior GLA official. He will be obliged to
consult the Mayor and the assembly before making an appointment, and he
will need to have regard to available resources and to the priorities
of the authority. Clause 7 also amends section 70(2) of 1999
Act to allow the head of paid service to set the terms and conditions
of the staff whom he appoints, again after consultation with the Mayor
and assembly. The appointment terms and conditions of current staff
will have effect as if they were appointed by
him.</div>
					<a name="07010964000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 8 amends
section 72 of the 1999 Act to enable the Mayor and assembly, acting
jointly&#151;which is important, to appoint the authority&#146;s
head of paid service and set his terms and conditions. It also allows
the head of paid service to delegate any of his staffing functions to a
member of staff of the authority, other than to staff appointed by the
Mayor. Finally, it provides that the head of paid service cannot also
be a member of the authority staff appointed by the Mayor under section
67(1).</div>
					<a name="07010964000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						So
a series of safeguards is built into the clauses. The hon. Member for
Surrey Heath was concerned that the Mayor would be given unrestricted
power to appoint a kitchen cabinet, but the reverse is true&#151;we
are establishing a head of paid service whose appointment will be a
joint one, and we are allowing that jointly appointed official to
appoint the remaining GLA staff.

							<a name="07010964000515"></a>
								Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> I shall come to that. The purpose of making the
changes is relatively limited, but the clauses provide some benefits
over the current system. The current system is slightly anomalous in
that, although the GLA&#146;s staff are largely engaged in carrying
out the Mayor&#146;s programme, they depend on the assembly for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 36</div>their terms and conditions; they are, effectively, appointed by the
assembly. The GLA has two branches, one of which largely decides the
work programme, while the other is responsible for staffing,
appointments and terms and conditions. There are certain anomalies and
potential unhealthy tensions in that arrangement. Clearly, it is
important for there to be a certain amount of tension between the Mayor
and the assembly. That is the purpose of scrutiny; it is a healthy
tension to create within a
democracy.</div>
					<a name="07010964000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should
consider with caution whether it is wise for the terms and conditions
of the non-political appointees who carry out the work of the GLA to be
part of the political tension between the Mayor and the assembly, and
so to be potentially subject to the disagreements, rows, trade-offs and
arguments that inevitably take place between them. That is why we
thought that it would be a better arrangement for such staff to have a
jointly appointed head of paid service who, after consulting both
branches of the GLA, could make appointments and staffing decisions in
the interests of the whole
GLA.</div>
					
					<a name="07010964000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07010964000516"></a>Tom

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07010964000517"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> There are accounts of discussions between the
Mayor and the assembly having involved decisions about staffing. The
Bill aims to ensure that there are sensible constitutional arrangements
for the GLA, and to do so in a way that anticipates potential tensions
rather than simply responding to existing arrangements. The hon. Member
for Surrey Heath is very concerned to ensure that we anticipate the
decision making of future Mayors and assemblies. Given his fear that
future Mayors might not be as responsible as the current one, I would
say to him that the way to ensure that that is not the case is to join
us in backing the current Mayor for a further term of office, rather
than engaging, in the style of &#147;The X Factor&#148;, in a
search for an alternative, who would, I am sure, be far more
irresponsible in the execution of all his powers.</div>
					<a name="07010964000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is simply about trying to

Gove:
						</b> In the Minister&#146;s last sentence, even though
there were a number of subordinate clauses, there were more
contradictions than is normally the case in her arguments. Let me
briefly refer to two of them. The first is her invitation for us to
back the current Mayor on the basis that any other alternative would be
less conscientious or less responsible. My argument is that most
alternatives, particularly the Conservative alternative, would be
significantly more conscientious and more responsible.</div>
					<a name="07010964000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it is conceivable that
a future Labour politician will, by some fluke, find himself in that
position and be less conscientious and less responsible. That goes to
the heart of the logical flaw in the Minister&#146;s argument. She
said that she wanted to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 37</div>ensure that in future there could be no irresponsible exercise of power.
However, at the moment, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst pointed out, because decisions are taken in the open,
through the process of negotiation in the assembly, we have a highly
effective check against the abuse of powers. If the Government get
their way, the head of paid service will find himself or herself
susceptible to greater influence from the Mayor acting alone than is
the case at the moment. A deliberative assembly with 25 members
discussing something in the open is clearly less susceptible to covert
pressure than is an individual.

Conservative candidate who is prepared to stand against the current
Mayor. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath has such a strong and growing
personal interest in London that perhaps he could be prevailed upon to
be a candidate himself, should all else
fail.</div>
					<a name="07010964000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman was trying to make a point about the need for negotiation and
open debate, which is extremely important. It is part of the
assembly&#146;s role to hold the Mayor to account, to promote
openness, transparency and debate and to have a healthy tension with
the Mayor about particular issues of disagreement. However, we should
be cautious about making the terms and conditions of non-political GLA
staff part of the territory for political argument, debate and
negotiation. Is that the kind of thing on which we want the assembly to
focus its attention, when it should be concentrating on scrutinising
policies and
delivery?</div>
					<a name="07010964000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why not
leave matters such as staff terms and conditions to the head of paid
service according to long-standing parliamentary and ministerial
tradition? Ministers play one role and are accountable to Parliament,
but we allow Departments and the civil service to take decisions about
staffing and terms and conditions. We are trying to focus the assembly
and the Mayor on what is important to them, rather than allowing them
to get into inappropriate rows, trade-offs and negotiations about
practical matters such as terms and conditions and staffing
arrangements, which might properly be done by the head of paid service.
It is important to note that the head of paid service will be jointly
appointed by the Mayor and the assembly and will be accountable to both
for decisions on
staffing.</div>

						</b> Thank you, Mr. O&#146;Hara. We are
making important changes to the scrutiny of confirmation hearings,
which we have discussed, and to other matters, which the Committee will
have the opportunity to discuss in detail. The issue that we are
discussing now is a practical measure to ensure that attention is
focused on matters that should rightly be the subject of open,
transparent disagreement between the different branches of the GLA,
while allowing the organisation to function as effectively as possible
in managing and organising its staff, terms and conditions and so
on.</div>
					<a name="07010964000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
tabled by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington are unnecessary
and would be too bureaucratic in practice. There is already a
requirement on the head of paid service to consult the Mayor and the
assembly and to have regard to their views when determining the number,
grading and function of GLA staff. However, it would be inappropriate
to prevent the head of paid service from delegating those appointment
functions. The head of paid service continues to have responsibility
and accountability for those functions, but it is not right that that
officer should have to take every decision about every appointment or
staffing issue, as those matters can sensibly be delegated to other
officers as long as the line of accountability is very
clear.</div>
					<a name="07010964000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">A consultation
period of 28 days before the head of paid service can make decisions
would introduce delays and bureaucracy into a system that should be
able to respond flexibly. In particular circumstances, the head of paid
service may want a 28-day consultation period and a series of
engagements and consultations, but specifying a 28-day consultation
period, written representations and written statements and responses
would make it harder for the head of paid service to do a practical
management job in the interests of the GLA as a
whole.</div>

the current arrangements on appointments between the Mayor and the
assembly, because it is anomalous for the work programme to be

						</b> Hon. Members have said throughout that the Bill is
about making sensible changes that do not simply respond to the
existing arrangements, but also anticipate potential arrangements, such
as the future disposition of the Mayor and the assembly. Concerns have
been raised in some quarters about staffing issues being discussed by
the Mayor and the assembly, but those are not the reason for making the
changes. The reason is that the changes seem pretty sensible and allow
us to make long-term arrangements to prevent staffing arrangements

						</b> We have watched the operation of the Mayor and the
assembly and have learned about the importance of focusing on scrutiny,
which needs to take place, and about the need for the Mayor and the
assembly to focus on things that matter. There has been a process
examining whether the original 1999 Act best serves that end or whether
sensible amendments can be made. We have concluded that amending the
system is sensible and will improve how the GLA functions in a
relatively limited way. Opposition Members cannot sensibly object to
those amendments.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): I wonder
whether the Minister has read the London assembly briefing on that
specific point? She thinks that the proposed changes are not
particularly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 40</div>significant or controversial, but the assembly itself has told us that
the Bill provides for changes relating to the appointment of
staff</div>
					<a name="07010964000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which will
constitute a significant shift in power away from the assembly at a

								Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> There are two questions for the assembly. First,
why does it think that its involvement in staff terms and conditions is
so significant? Secondly, should it be the assembly&#146;s function
to be involved in and responsible for the terms and conditions of
junior GLA staff? Should the assembly see that as an important part of
its debate and political tensions with and scrutiny of the Mayor?
Should it not simply concentrate on overall delivery and policy and
allow non-political appointments to the GLA to be conducted by a head
of paid service, who is accountable to the assembly and the Mayor
jointly?</div>
					<a name="07010964000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government were proposing a head of paid service accountable only to
the Mayor, I could understand why the assembly might raise concerns,
but we are not. We are saying that the head of paid service should be
responsible to both the Mayor and the assembly. The measure is a
practical one that will allow a sensible, functional arrangement for
GLA work
patterns.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07010964000558"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> The Minister has referred to potentially unhealthy
tensions. Will she accept that the head of paid service might well sit
in the middle of such tensions, with the Mayor and assembly requiring
him to do different things? How about that for potentially unhealthy
tensions?</div>
					
					<a name="07010964000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07010964000559"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> In those circumstances, the head of paid service
should listen to both, decide the right thing to do and take
responsible decisions on the required staffing arrangements. The
alternative is for the issues to be part of the public territory and of
rows between the Mayor and the assembly.</div>
					<a name="07010964000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both the Mayor and the assembly
need to understand that the staffing arrangements and the terms and
conditions concern the employment of people who do significant jobs for
the assembly but who are not part of the main mayoral appointments or
the three key executive appointments, which are made jointly. Neither
the Mayor nor the assembly should use the more junior appointments that
are part of the GLA as political territory in the debates and rows
between them. All that the measures will do is put such appointments on
a sensible footing. I am not sure whether hon. Members are desperate to
keep this debate going in order to prevent us from reaching other
clauses, but I feel that I have made my points as often as it is
possible to make
them.</div>

							<a name="07010964000562"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> The Minister has only herself to blame on this
occasion. The more she explains, the more obscure the justification
becomes. She has talked about the GLA&#146;s vital role in
scrutinising executive 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 41</div>responsibilities. The GLA has exercised its scrutiny function, and it
has said that such an accretion of executive responsibilities to the
head of paid service is wrong. She cannot say that the GLA should
restrict itself to scrutiny, and then say when it expresses an opinion,
&#147;These people are wrong, I personally find the matter not
particularly interesting and, as ever, executive convenience should
come before scrutiny.&#148; That is no way to deal with the
governance of
London.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07010964000563"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> Opposition Members protest too much. They do not
honestly believe that the terms and conditions of junior staff of the
GLA should be a critical matter of scrutiny for assembly members. They
clearly want to make a political point, and they have had plenty of
opportunity to do so. If they are really thinking sensibly about
practical arrangements for the management of GLA staff, they will
recognise that the provisions are perfectly sensible and respectable
and will have benefits by preventing the staff from becoming political
footballs to be used by various branches of the GLA. The clauses
certainly do not do any of the terrible things that Opposition Members
have suggested, and they should be supported for practical
reasons.</div>

Brake:
						</b> In her opening sentence, the Minister said that she
wanted a cheerful debate. It is a pity that she was not here when the
Under-Secretary gave Opposition Members something to cheer
about&#151;the indication that he would introduce an amendment on the
subject covered by amendment No. 38, which we welcome. It is a pity
that she did not continue in the same vein and maintain the general
sense of bonhomie and festive afterglow.</div>
					<a name="07010964000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">We listened carefully to the
reasons she gave for the &#147;sensible changes&#148;, as the
Minister called them, but I am afraid that we heard no good reasons. We
heard a series of allegations&#151;the phrases used included
&#147;concerns expressed in some quarters&#148;, &#147;heard of
some tensions&#148; and &#147;potential rows between assembly
members and the Mayor&#148;&#151;but she could not provide any
examples. We have in Committee two assembly members who would no doubt
have contributed examples of those rows, tensions and concerns, if
there had been any. The Minister gave no hard facts to justify the
changes.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07010964000565"></a>Mr.
Slaughter:
						</b> I am reluctant to prolong the debate because,
like my hon. Friend the Minister, I suspect that this is a phantom
attack. The more I hear from the Opposition parties, the more I believe
that they are trying to make something out of not very much. As I
understand it, the proposal is that the senior non-political officer of
the authority, with joint responsibility for the assembly and the
Mayor, will deal
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 42</div>with staffing matters. To my mind, that is exactly what happens in most
other local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="07010964000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Minister will not say this, but I shall: there is an anomaly
in the 1999 Act that needs correction. It is surely far more sensible
for non-political officers to have the responsibility in question. The
possibility that the shrinking violet, the head of paid service, might
not be able to arbitrate between political parties was considered in
the regulatory impact assessment, but the argument is clearly nonsense
and was dismissed. The hon. Gentleman is clearly making too much of
it.</div>

Brake:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention,
but it does not divert me from my course. If the Minister is proposing
a change to an Act that has been in place for more than six years and
is, by all accounts, operating effectively, she should present to
members of the Committee hard reasons why she is not happy with the
present arrangements and wants to change them. She has not done so. She
has simply referred to allocations made and concerns expressed by a
source whose identity she has not clarified for the benefit of
Opposition Members&#151;I do not know whether she has clarified the
matter for Government Members. She has not confirmed the source of the
alleged tensions and concerns, and she has done nothing to dispel the
concern, which is shared by me and Conservative Members, that the
change is being driven by the Mayor and flies in the face of a system
that appears to be operating effectively and has the support of
Assembly members. I shall not therefore withdraw the amendment but will
press it to a
Division.</div>
