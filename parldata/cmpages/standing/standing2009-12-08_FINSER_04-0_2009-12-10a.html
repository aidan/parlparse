Chairman:</b> Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I remind
hon. Members and witnesses that we are bound by the deadline agreed to
on Tuesday, which means that the evidence session must end at
2.30. I hope that I will not have to interrupt anyone in the
middle of a speech, but those of you who know me, know me well enough
to know that if I have to do so I
will.</div><a name="09121051000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are going to take evidence from the City of London Law Society,
Clifford Chance and the Investment Management Association. Thank you
for joining us gentlemen. Would you like to introduce yourselves? I
suggest starting from left to right&#151;that is, my left to
right.</div>
<a name="09121051000010"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David

taking its toll on the Chairman; I am finding it a little difficult to

<a name="09121051000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">213</b><a name="09121051000200"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I would like to ask all three
of you a question about the powers in clauses 14 to 17&#151;the
disciplinary powers that have been given to the FSA. Some of the
representations that we have received about them suggest that the
powers are unnecessary, and it cannot quite be worked out why the FSA
needs them. Can you shed any light on why the powers might be
appropriate?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div><a name="09121051000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121051000201"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Sorry, gentlemen; before we proceed, I think
that it might help, given that we have three witnesses, if all Members
were to indicate first whom they would like to
reply.</div>
<a name="09121051000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121051000202"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I would like to ask all three, but perhaps we can
start with David, then Simon and then Guy.</div>
<a name="09121051000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Ereira:</b></i> From my perspective, I do not have a
particular response on that issue. My concerns about the Bill relate
more to its impact on financial transactions, so I do not think that
the FSA&#146;s disciplinary powers per se have a concern on the
operation of the banking and financial markets.</div>
<a name="09121051000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> There are two aspects that I think require
comment, one of which is the idea of punishing a firm by suspending
part of its permission. That is an approach that the Japanese
authorities have tried in the past, almost universally unsuccessfully.
The problems that it creates are that the scope of the impact on the
firm subject to it is unknown. If somebody had banned Citibank from
engaging in structured finance two years ago, the benefit would have
been enormous. The other aspect is that the benefit of the punishment
accrues not to the public, but to the competitors of the firm subject
to it. If the firm is required to exit a business in which it is
already active, there is a significant detriment to the customers of
the firm concerned, who will have to look for other service providers.
It is very hard to envisage circumstances in which the imposition of
this sanction would be useful and valuable.</div>
<a name="09121051000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point&#151;because you asked about the three sections&#151;is the
issue relating to the imposition of penalties where controlled
functions are performed without approval. The issue there is that the
definition of controlled functions is loose and widely drafted. That is
entirely deliberate, to enable the regulator to ensure that all the
appropriate individuals are approved. However, because it is widely
drafted, it is very hard for individuals to know with certainty whether
they are performing an approved function or not. The textbook example
is a main board director of a large international corporate that has a
small UK subsidiary. If it is sought to impose a penalty on people for
breaching an obligation that is so loosely defined, the danger is that
that will potentially require the FSA to reduce the scope of the
requirement for authorisation. So there are very serious technical
difficulties with both of those.</div>
<a name="09121051000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> You ask whether or not they are needed.
Technically, they may well be needed, whether or not there are merits
to them. I suggest that there is a deliberate reason why they were left
out of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 when it was passed,
which is that they are of a different constitutional nature than the
powers that were given to the FSA. These are exercisable powers, which
go either to persons who are not part of the system&#151;in other
words, they are part of the wider citizenry&#151;or they are
exercisable by way of a punishment, as Simon mentioned, in the nature
of the suspension. In the passage of FSMA when it was going through,
there was a lot of discussion as to the civil or criminal nature of the
proceedings being taken by the FSA under the Act and the appropriate
protections that should be put in. Within that, I would suggest that
Government and others took the view that, rather than banning a person
as now, or not banning them, the suspension, which is a period of time
certain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>in which you just can&#146;t appear, is in fact by way of a penalty.
It is a punishment in its nature. So it is of a different nature than
FSMA gave FSA. On the controlled
function&#151;</div><a name="09121051000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121051000203"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Before you
continue&#151;</div><a name="09121051000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> I wasn&#146;t speaking of the merits
though.</div>
<a name="09121051000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">214</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000204"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> No, but just in terms of the nature of whether it
is a penalty or a punishment, there are obviously safeguards built into
FSMA when the existing powers are
exercised.</div><a name="09121051000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> There
are.</div><a name="09121051000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">215</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000205"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Are those safeguards sufficient, given the nature
of the new disciplinary powers that the FSA will be given under the
Bill?</div><a name="09121051000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> I would suspect they are, because of the use
of the financial service markets tribunal. As FSMA went through as a
Bill, of course, there were interventions, by various MPs, that made
amendments and brought in extra protections within the tribunals
process, and also the ability to get representation and legal aid at
times. Those protections, of course, are the classic article 6
protections on fair trial matters, which rendered the whole debate
about whether it was civil or criminal much less important from that
point of
view.</div><a name="09121051000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the control function, a person who has never actually had a controlled
function and is fulfilling that place is in fact just a member of the
citizenry. They have not submitted to the regulatory system, whether by
an authorisation or an approval. That is the usual way. Then there is a
jurisdictional grip by the regulator to punish&#151;or penalise, or
censure, or whatever it may be&#151;a person. Again, I would not
suggest that this is a mistake. When FSMA was passed, it was a
deliberately different treatment&#151;the fact that somebody had
never become part of the system; they were just the citizenry. The one
area where FSMA normally deals with the citizenry at large is in market
abuse. That extends to all people, whether or not you are actually part
of the system. I think that is why there were differences, and I think
that others probably accepted as this was being put together that they
were constitutionally different. It is a different question to whether
or not they are needed.</div>
<a name="09121051000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">216</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000206"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> And are they
needed?</div><a name="09121051000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> It would seem so to me, if we have a system
that seeks in its spirit to ensure that those who carry on important
parts and important roles within regulated activities should be subject
to proper standards on entry and oversight by the FSA. In a sense, if
they do not do that, the FSA has no ability to deal with
them&#151;that seems to me a lacuna. That one is quite
understandable, albeit different
constitutionally.</div>
<a name="09121051000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">217</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000207"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> But what about Simon&#146;s point, though, where
you have a large international corporate with a UK subsidiary that is
regulated and you may be a board member of the corporate? It just seems
a wide power. There is a defence thing in here if you are not aware
that you are exercising a control function. Shouldn&#146;t the
penalty perhaps be on the authorised person, rather than the
individual?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div><a name="09121051000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> The proposal in section 63A included in the
clause is that, if the person did not know and could not reasonably
have known that they were carrying on a control function, they would
not be penalised. I agree that it is wide: the extension of the
FSA&#146;s control function regime at the moment to persons of
significant influence, and lots of firms are having to consider whether
their US parents need to be registered in the UK as part of the work
that is going on at the moment. As Simon mentioned, it is not just
textbook; it is real&#151;people are doing that at the moment. Yes,
there are concerns, of course, but I suppose the likelihood that the
FSA is actually going to get all the way to imposing a penalty on you
if an innocent mistake was promptly rectified is the test in
practice.</div><a name="09121051000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">218</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000208"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> In terms of suspension, we had a conversation this
morning when we took evidence from the British Bankers Association
about how this power might be used, and we linked it back to some of
the issues in the run-up to the financial crisis, whether Northern Rock
lending 125 per cent. loan to value on properties, or people trading
instruments that they did not understand&#151;collateralised debt
obligations and things like that. Is this power in clause 14 there to
prevent people from doing things the FSA feels uncomfortable about them
doing? Could it be used as widely as, &#147;Well, I don&#146;t like
this, so let&#146;s suspend
them&#148;?</div><a name="09121051000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> I think that there are two answers to that.
One is that if that were the intention, it is in the wrong part of the
Bill, because it is inserted in the section on disciplinary powers. I
think the second is that the FSA already has a power to vary
permissions on its own as part of its ordinary supervisory function, so
it seems clear that this is intended as a punitive rather than a merely
supervisory measure. I do not disagree that the power may be required
for supervisory purposes; my question is whether it is at all
appropriate as a
punishment.</div><a name="09121051000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> It is very hard to understand what factual
circumstance it would apply it to. I understand that other trade
associations have said, &#147;You wouldn&#146;t use this against a
high street bank, would you?&#148; It is a matter of practice. It is
not going to suspend a high street bank from trading for two months.
What would that mean in terms of the realities of the situation? If you
felt people were selling a product or had inadequate controls over
activities, you would vary the permission and you would not allow them
to do that&#151;for instance, selling payment protection insurance
policies&#151;so it compared to other things that they were doing.
You would vary the permission and stop it. I am genuinely not quite
sure who it would apply it to, apart from somebody it wanted to punish
in some way and stop having income for a while. The examples that you
could think of where it might just work would be smaller firms; I do
not think that this will get applied across the
board.</div><a name="09121051000036"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">220</b><a name="09121051000210"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): I would like to
explore the venturing into the control of remuneration that is proposed
in the Bill, from two perspectives: first, the difficulty of contract
law&#151;the employer and the employee&#151;and the apparent
intervention into the delivery of what would appear to be a contract
with an employee. Let me develop that one first, and I think
particularly our two legal minds will have some
answers.</div><a name="09121051000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Ereira:</b></i> I think that it would be fair to say that
that section of the Bill provides for an uncertain outcome. The ability
to void a provision in breach of the remuneration regulations would
have a very unpredictable consequence. It is not at all clear what gets
voided. You could, in fact, end up in a situation in which somebody
gets no remuneration but still is under a contractual obligation to
perform their services, which is some kind of slavery. But, you are
dependent at the moment on what the promulgated regulations are going
to say, and as we have no idea what they are going to look like, it is
impossible to
judge.</div><a name="09121051000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">221</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000211"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I am asking for opinion here: would it be perhaps
prudent for the Committee to at least seek some draft regulations in
this area, so that we properly understand this before we pass it into
law?</div><a name="09121051000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Ereira:</b></i> In my view, that would be extremely helpful,
or at least there should be some element of ministerial guidance on
what is intended.</div>
<a name="09121051000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">222</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000212"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> The other area that I want to touch on is the
proportionality of action. The claimed focus of this area is the
control of risk in financial institutions, but I think that those who
read a newspaper would recognise that that is not the entirety of the
public debate on this subject. Is there any risk that the FSA might
chose to interpret its powers, if granted in the Bill, in a way that
goes beyond the narrow definition of a risk being caused by behaviours
incentivised by a contract of some kind?</div>
<a name="09121051000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Ereira:</b></i> That is quite a difficult question to answer.
I think that the best I can say is that the Bill includes, in effect, a
new objective for the FSA, one geared towards economic management and
economic strategy. Therefore, on whether the FSA considers that it is
within its remit and part of its objective from an economic standpoint
to take a perspective that is not necessarily a regulatory perspective,
it would be entitled to do so.</div>
<a name="09121051000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">223</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000213"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> If I can give you an example, it might help you to
think of what I am thinking of. We are currently having some debate
about bonuses that might be offered to investment bankers. I do not
think it has been argued that their activities have increased the risk
to financial stability. Instead, the concern is that either they have
taken advantage of stability produced by the taxpayer&#146;s
investment, or that it is an unethical thing for them to do. We are in
a political environment, and one would imagine that the regulator would
hear all those noises when deciding what to do. Is there any area of
concern that they might have some freedom to act beyond a rather
narrower focus of the purpose of financial stability?</div>
<a name="09121051000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Ereira:</b></i> I think that it would be open to the FSA,
were it so minded, to interpret its objectives to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div>include a broader economic objective. If it was felt that controlling
remuneration better achieved that economic objective, it could say that
is within its
authority.</div><a name="09121051000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">224</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000214"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I&#146;m just wondering whether Mr.
Gleeson has some thoughts in these areas as well, because we ventured
close to it when the Banking Act 2009 was going through Parliament and
I must admit that I had some anxieties there. This is much more
naked.</div>
<a name="09121051000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> I find the idea that an agency has a power
simply to declare a contract of employment to be void an extremely
uncomfortable one, and it is not at all clear to me what the safeguards
are for the benefit of that individual. On your second point, the
subsequent sentence in the Bill does state that the power can be
exercised only for the purpose of ensuring that the remuneration
agreement concerned</div>
<a name="09121051000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is consistent
with...the effective management of risks&#148;.</div>
<a name="09121051000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">But, as you say, there
is nothing here which tells us what that means or how it should be
interpreted. This seems to me to be a very significant power, which is
given really without safeguards of any form.</div>
<a name="09121051000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> The context is that these are trying to do two
things: first, obviously, to be enabling provisions in light of the
European legislation; and secondly, to deal with certain consequences
and powers within the nation. In terms of the European legislation, the
capital requirements directive is progressing. Most of the amendments
in that relate to deferral, and treatment of bonus. That will bind all
the investment firms in this country and the banks, as I am sure you
are well aware.</div>
<a name="09121051000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities
managers are being covered by UCITS level II on remuneration, at
European level. The alternative investment fund managers directive also
has provisions and proposed amendments dealing with remuneration, all
based off the financial stability board, or, as the Bill refers to
them, the implementation standards. The question, therefore, is
slightly more about ensuring that we can appropriately implement what
Europe is doing than about worrying what the FSA is going to do. For
us, as asset managers, our greater concern is to ensure that the FSA
has the flexibility in the UK to implement Europe&#146;s legislation
in a proportionate manner. When we read the clauses, it is with a
slightly different lens. It is of course difficult to see where they
will go&#151;one has to trust that they do not then go
super-equivalent on us&#151;but as such, Europe is doing a good job
of that at the
moment.</div><a name="09121051000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">225</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000215"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Those of us who have been around for a while would
know that we tend to take what Europe does and then add our own tweaks
and spins. I am pleased with your view&#151;I would not say that it
was complacent&#151;that we should be focusing on the European
dimension and not worry about too much about what is happening here. I
am pleased to hear it, but I wonder whether it is entirely
sound.</div><a name="09121051000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> I did not want to come across as complacent. I
appreciate that I was talking for a long time on those points. Our
concern in this area is one that arises in several areas, which is the
requirement not to have regard to the international dimension. The
objectives in making such powers are never conditioned by having regard
to what is happening internationally&#151;not just 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>with the standards, but in terms of the timing and the manner in which
they are being applied. Although you have, at the beginning, aspects
where they must have regard to international measures on financial
stability, there is no corresponding obligation on the FSA in any other
measure, whether it be short selling or remuneration. Those are matters
where&#151;you are absolutely right&#151;competitiveness risks
arise, where we have not got a line in either timing or standard. From
that point of view, there would be
concerns.</div><a name="09121051000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">226</b><a name="09121051000216"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): It was interesting
to hear what you said. At the end of the day, if we have legally set up
companies&#151;banks or financial institutions&#151;with
shareholders putting forward risk capital, with a board that has
responsibilities for corporate governance, and with risk committees
looking after the individual risk aspects of the business, why should
an individual be penalised through FSA intervention into their own
individual service contracts? Perhaps it would be helpful if
Mr. Ereira could answer that question, because he mentioned
something rather
similar.</div><a name="09121051000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Ereira:</b></i> Absolutely. The only rationales behind it
that you can come up with, it seems, are that either the
institution&#146;s own determination of the appropriate remuneration
is somehow wrong, and the regulator has some stake in preventing it to
avoid creating systemic risk, or&#151;this is the broader
point&#151;there is a broader economic argument that the FSA feels is
within its remit to apply, as its objective is now overall financial
stability, and somehow the paying of large bonuses or whatever it may
be is deemed to be putting that at
risk.</div><a name="09121051000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">227</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000217"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b><b class="B"> </b>I think that was probably what I was trying
to suggest; it is pretty
nonsensical.</div><a name="09121051000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Gleeson, can we just briefly have a look at the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme, and particularly one aspect of it? In the last
couple of years, when compensation schemes were operated, the
institutions&#151;the banks and building societies&#151;that failed
were relatively small. Therefore, to a certain extent, the amount of
money that had to be put into any compensation scheme was relatively
small, and perhaps not entirely relevant. We are now moving completely
away from that, even with existing ones&#151;Bradford &amp; Bingley,
I think. They are now pretty substantial amounts of money that will
have to be provided by the industry. Do you find it strange that the
industry does not seem to have any role in a creditors&#146;
committee?</div><a name="09121051000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> The compensation
scheme?</div><a name="09121051000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121051000218"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> No, I mean that the banks or the financial
institutions are going to have to put up a significant amount to this
compensation. They do not seem to have any role in what we would
normally know as a creditors&#146; committee, which would at least
demonstrate that that insolvency or reorganisation is done in a
reasonably cost-effective way. At the moment it seems that the FSA and
presumably the Bank of England can do exactly what they like and then
charge the bill to the
banks.</div><a name="09121051000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> I agree with that. The intellectual model of
what is constructed here is a tax, so the Government will decide what
they will do and will then levy a tax on contributors in order to pay
for it. I think that is clearly the structure
here.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div><a name="09121051000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">228</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000219"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Is that fair? Is that treating the customer fairly?
<i class="I">[Laughter.]</i></div><a name="09121051000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
we move on to the Financial Services Authority? It is going to be given
intensive and intrusive supervisory powers. We have yet to determine
what that will mean. Do you believe that the FSA at the present time
has the capacity to undertake such an approach? If it did undertake
that approach in such a significant, intrusive and intensive way, is it
going to put the credit rating agencies out of business, and indeed
anybody else that might have a role in analysing banking performance as
such?</div><a name="09121051000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> To some extent, that goes back to the
substance of the question that you asked earlier: where private
companies are run as private companies, what business has the regulator
to micro-manage them? The answer to that question is that the
regulator&#146;s justification is systemic stability, whatever that
may be and however that may be defined. I should say that I think it is
the case that the FSA has for a long time had all the powers that it
needed to do that. The issue was that as a matter of policy it elected
not to do that, because it perceived that the market was best left to
its own devices in these respects. The fact that the FSA is publicly
changing its position on that, I&#146;m afraid, is a matter for the
FSA. In reality, if this Bill were abandoned today, it still has in the
existing Act all the powers that it needs to intervene to that extent
in the business of regulating
firms.</div><a name="09121051000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121051000220"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> So it has intensive and intrusive powers already.
We are just flagging it up in this.</div>
<a name="09121051000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> Yes, I think that is
right.</div><a name="09121051000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121051000221"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Do you think it has the capacity&#151;the
individuals, the money and everything else&#151;to actually carry out
such a supervisory
approach?</div><a name="09121051000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> That is an almost impossible question to
answer. If you assume that the number of people needed to run the
system is roughly equal to the number of people currently running the
system, then the answer to that must be
no.</div><a name="09121051000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">229</b><a name="09121051000222"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): Can I go back to the
issue of disciplinary powers? I listened very carefully to what you
said. There has been quite a lot of criticism over the years, since the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, about the ability of the FSA
to regulate the market, in particular in certain areas. Mr.
Gleeson, you mentioned earlier the comparison with Japan. Of course, a
comparison is normally made between London and New York, where it
appears to a layman like myself that they take a much more robust
attitude. Therefore I wonder whether you accept that the powers to
discipline, at least in principle, are relevant compared with the
powers that are available in New York to ensure that this happens. I
would like your view on that.</div>
<a name="09121051000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> I think there are three answers to that.
When I talk to my colleagues in New York on this subject, they make two
points. One of them is that many of the things that we are talking
about here are treated in the US system as criminal offences. This
creates a large number of problems, of which the most important and
something we will probably come on to later is the multiplicity of
prosecutors problem. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>more prosecutors you have, the harder it becomes to anticipate public
action. Secondly, I do not think that the FSA has ever complained that
the reason it has not been more successful is the lack of sanctions.
The problems that the FSA says it faces are procedural. This is in many
respects why the market abuse regime was created in the first place.
The FSA took the view that if you had to overcome a criminal burden,
you could never achieve anything, so what was needed was more
lower-level punishments, which could be imposed at a lower standard of
proof. Whether that is desirable is a different matter, but that is
where this is seeking to go. At the end of the day, the primary issue
with enforcement is and remains the burden of proof and the way that it
can be enforced. No matter what sanctions we give the FSA, the
fundamental problem that it faces, which is how does it collect and
present evidence, will always be there because safeguards to that
extent must necessarily be built into this and every
Act.</div><a name="09121051000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">230</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000223"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> You are drawing me down the line of questioning why
the United States is indeed much more successful than we are,
particularly about market abuse, but I would be testing the Chairman if
I were to do that. My understanding of recent statements made by the
FSA is that it wishes to proceed more on criminal matters than civil
matters. It considers that the penalties available to it are much
greater as a result of it recognising the very great difficulties that
you have already described of collecting evidence and being able to
present it in
court.</div><a name="09121051000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to ask you, and perhaps Mr. Sears as well, about the
appropriate way to improve the situation. I am making the
assumption&#151;perhaps I should not&#151;that we all recognise
that the FSA has not been successful in such areas, so we would all
accept that there needs to be some strengthening of the powers
available to it to increase the possibility of success. In fact, if you
accept that case and that the powers in the present Bill are not
appropriate, what powers should we be thinking
about?</div><a name="09121051000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> To be fair, if we were to ask the FSA, it
would say that it was being more successful and that it is getting more
penalties imposed now than it was a few years ago. I think that is
clearly
correct.</div><a name="09121051000072"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">231</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000224"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> But that is going from nothing to a very low base. I
do not want to be too critical; I understand the difficulties of
collecting the evidence in a market abuse area, but its record was
appalling and it is now just
bad.</div><a name="09121051000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> The difficulties seem to me, and certainly
to my colleagues who are more active in the litigation area in this
respect, that the primary difficulties that the FSA faces are those of
resources and of simply obtaining evidence and are not primarily to do
with a lack of appropriate
sanctions.</div><a name="09121051000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> We have been quite strong on wanting the FSA
to be tougher on market abuse. Both the Treasury and the FSA have seen
senior committees of the IMA where they have been told unanimously,
&#147;Please be tougher on market abuse.&#148; You do not want
money for pension schemes and suchlike frittered away by people abusing
the
market.</div><a name="09121051000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions that the United Kingdom has on market abuse include
super-equivalent ones. We have been pushing very hard for them to be
continued. It was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>only at the last minute that they were continued last time. Legislation
has just been put through to extend them again because we think that
they better express how to deal with market abuse, statutory provisions
and the European approach. It is to do with things like information
that the market would expect to have released and seen&#151;if you
start using that rather than slightly more technical European
things.</div><a name="09121051000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for what goes on and how it goes, Simon has a history with it. I
obviously was a solicitor to the Securities and Investment Board
throughout the litigation until 1993, and then was one of those helping
form the market abuse provisions for FSMA. It is about the industry
having a concern. You asked what we would have in legislation. Ideas
that have been toyed with in the past include things for which firms
can ask for clearance from the FSA. They get clearance, but if the FSA
then reflects on it and decides that it is an inappropriate thing, a
rule is passed; a statement is made and it is not allowed any more. But
you do not go back and shoot the person who sought clearance from you.
At the moment, you have, &#147;Let&#146;s not tell
&#146;em&#148;, &#147;What if?&#148;, &#147;Or they&#146;ll
find out later&#148;. It is very hard at times to approach with
perhaps highly complex transactions, which sometimes might be abusive
with hindsight, but a lot of the time, as Simon says, it is just the
run-of-the-mill small abuses here and there. That needs people to clamp
down on it. I think that the FSA is doing much more. One of the reasons
is that as a result of the fragmentation of the markets that we have
now and the competitive environment, exchange operators no longer have
the vision that they had before&#151;they also played a role in the
system of controlling market abuse. They only get to see a
proportion&#151;perhaps 40 per cent.&#151;of the market now,
because of fragmentation. That puts a far greater onus on the FSA and,
from our point of view, we have also said that this is one of the
matters in which there should be much more consideration of the
Committee of European Securities Regulators and European co-ordination
looking at it, because of market trading going right across Europe. Not
many answers, I&#146;m afraid, Mr. Love, but it is
something that quite a lot of people in the industry push for, even if
it is not published that
much.</div><a name="09121051000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">232</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000225"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> May I ask one final question, which is about
culture? There is still a criticism that is made about the
City&#151;if I can call it the City for all the
institutions&#151;that it does not take market abuse seriously
enough. This is one of the signals that this would be sending. In my
view, the signal from the Financial Services and Markets Act was
ambiguous because it was diluted. Will this measure, even if it does
nothing else, at least send a signal to the City institutions and those
involved in the City that they have to take these things more
seriously?</div><a name="09121051000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> I think it is to do with sectors, if I may say
so. I think that the equity markets would be pretty nervous if they
heard that the FSA was turning up unannounced&#151;they would be very
nervous, not because they have done things wrong, but because there is
a proper fear/respect of the market abuse provisions. I think there
have been other sectors perhaps in which people have not really thought
that market abuse is part of that&#151;much more complex transactions
that go on. So, I think there are those who came up through the
exchanges and the equity markets who have a different 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>culture&#151;that is great. So, the FSA the other day issued a
disciplinary notice concerning pre-soundings in the bond market. That
had a very large impact on firms looking at that area&#151;very
different to equity. Things like that as well&#151;there is that
spreading of
culture.</div><a name="09121051000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">233</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000226"></a>John
Howell:</b> May I move us on to some questions about the
consumer protection aspects of the Bill? We heard the Minister, in an
earlier evidence session, say that the measure, particularly the
collective proceedings provisions, would not take us down the route of
a US-style litigious culture. We had the bankers this morning saying
that it would. Where do you sit on that argument? I start the day with
your
reaction.</div><a name="09121051000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Ereira:</b></i> The answer is that it is entirely unclear
where the collective proceedings of the Bill will take us. They are not
consistent with the approach that has been taken to collective
proceedings in other areas, which is my first point. The second point
is that the scope and range of actions that can be brought within them
seem to be extremely wide. Indeed, they are sufficiently wide to
include things that actually predate the commencement of the
legislation, under its own terms. It is very unfortunate, but we are
dependent upon two sets of regulations being promulgated: a general set
of regulations; and new court rules. The existing court rules will not
cover what is being proposed; there is nothing about how prospective
cases will be vetted, to rule out the frivolous and vexatious, and
there is nothing about costs, which is the main issue in controlling
the spread of spurious
litigation.</div><a name="09121051000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to bring to your attention a couple of other points. One is
that there is some wording in the clauses that allows the regulations
to override limitation periods, which is somewhat surprising, and to
change the rules on damages. It seems conceivable, at least within the
scope of this enabling legislation, that you could allow for punitive
damages&#151;triple damages or whatever it may be. None of this is
catered for in the Bill per se, but the enabling power would cover
it.</div><a name="09121051000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> Two points: first, I flag that it is
actually incorrect to describe this as a consumer measure. There is
nothing that confines these actions to actions brought by consumers.
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs could use this to sue the stock
exchange, which seems like a bit of a
lacuna.</div><a name="09121051000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second point is that, if we look at what has caused the problems in the
United States, there are a number of fairly obvious flags. One of them,
as David Ereira has said, is the damages system. The major constraint
on frivolous litigation in that system is that if you commence
litigation and fail, you must pay for what you did. That is
inappropriate in a purely consumer-based arrangement, which is part of
the reason why we are very concerned about potential misuse of this by
people who are not consumers in the ordinary sense of the
word.</div><a name="09121051000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second is, of course, the problem of claim farming and those who
develop business models that involve commencing class actions for
profit. The question as to whether that will be possible under this
regime entirely depends on the regulations made under clause 23(4)(a),
which effectively enable the court to provide an economic bounty to
whoever organised and led the action. If we go down that route, I think
it is a significant step towards the US class action system. But I
think it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>quite right: there is nothing in the Bill that drives us in that
direction. All it does is create the possibility that that may happen
depending on what the rules say.</div>
<a name="09121051000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> This is not the same form of collective
proceedings as was trailed in the Treasury paper, &#147;Reformed
financial markets&#148;. It does not select one or other of the
options that that put forward; it puts all of them forward. In that
sense, therefore, it actually does not determine some of the big policy
questions; it leaves them to others to determine. It asks you to pass
legislation so that others can determine those policy questions. In
that regard, it is therefore very hard to see how it will turn out.
However, large amounts of the money that our firms manage are managed
for consumers in the traditional sense of the word. We certainly note
that the context of this is that some 900,000 cases have been passed to
the ombudsman this decade&#151;let alone all the complaints that are
handled before getting to the ombudsman&#151;of which over half are
due to only to six issues. I can therefore see why, contextually,
people feel that there is an imbalance of power between consumers and
regulated
firms.</div><a name="09121051000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
situation I would suggest that we need to achieve is one in which a
perceived imbalance of power is properly corrected where it is seen.
The Ministry of Justice and others have had reports on collective
proceedings and whether or not we should have them in the United
Kingdom. Our concerns on these matters are to do with limitation
periods. In other words, will you ever know whether or not you are free
from claims? Or, perhaps less selfishly, will you ever know if a firm
you wish to buy that is not doing very well is itself free of claims?
The need to sometimes rescue or reinvest in firms may be damaged by
this at
times.</div><a name="09121051000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
will consumers know what to do and where to go? We have a complaints
regime that, subject to those broadly put six subjects, worked pretty
well. I am not being complacent, but there are always people who can
work more on that. There is a complaints regime. There is to be a
redress power under section 404, which the Treasury has at the moment
and the FSA could then have. The FSA, consumer bodies or individuals
could then bring the collective proceedings. I would definitely not
seek to say that I know the views of consumers&#151;I see that you
have received evidence from Which? and others; it is very important to
have regard for that&#151;but will consumers actually understand what
they ought to do? And, paradoxically, will some sit back and wait, as
ever, for someone else to sort out their problem because of all these
proceedings?</div><a name="09121051000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
how do we settle with people quickly? Will it actually disincentivise
treating matters and trying to sort them out for fear of how collective
actions will be put together and brought? I haven&#146;t the
faintest, to be
honest.</div><a name="09121051000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">234</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000227"></a>John
Howell:</b> Do you think that the regulatory system for
consumers in the financial services sector is clear enough in where
responsibilities lie, and is it the right structure? The consequential
question to that is: given that structure&#151;or perhaps the lack of
structure&#151;are these appropriate measures to fit in?</div>
<a name="09121051000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> If I am right about what you are asking me, my
answer is that there is no detailed expression of what we would expect
the proper standard of consumer responsibility to be in financial
services, having regard 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>to the level of financial education and the nature of products that are
sold. Many people in the industry would wholly applaud it if somebody
tried to deal with that. Sir Callum McCarthy of course worked on that
quite hard when he was chairman of the FSA, trying to bring the panels
together to get a statement about consumer responsibility. In any
system, if there are balancing powers then they work better. Is it a
bit unjoined-up and uncompleted? Yes, it
is.</div>
<a name="09121051000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> I entirely agree about multiplicity. The
thought occurs that there is an existing wider issues process, whereby
when multiple complaints are brought to the ombudsman on a similar
issue they can be taken together by the FSA as a single issue. In many
respects the mechanism that is sketched out here already exists within
the regulatory system. The difference is that it is proposed to take
that out of the ombudsman system and put it in the courts. I am unable
to see the value of that to the consumer.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121051000228"></a>John

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">235</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000229"></a>John
Howell:</b> Mr. Sears, you picked up on the
question of education. In relation to the consumer financial education
body proposed to be created, what do you think success would look like
for that body? What would you like it to
achieve?</div><a name="09121051000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> That is extremely difficult. That is one
reason why debates about where to put money in financial education are
so hard. What is success ever going to be?</div>
<a name="09121051000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
certainly say this. We welcome the fact that it will be separated from
the FSA. That will allow those involved to have a clearer voice and at
times feel that they set up their own image, their own position, and to
be better understood by people rather than having the FSA logo on
things, which may be slightly confusing for consumers as to its role.
Precisely how you will measure whether or not we have consumer
financial education, I do not know. I am involved with the Credit
Union, and have been for many years. We have genuinely had people
arguing over the fact that its credit cards are better than others
because it has higher APRs. It is very difficult. I am not sure that we
will get education.</div>
<a name="09121051000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I quite like
having examples of how people are affected&#151;a bit like today,
after a pre-Budget report. If we had bodies that could produce more
examples of people like you&#151;a young couple, single, or whatever
you may be&#151;and say that this was the sort of thing they were
doing, that would educate people. Beyond that, it is right that there
is redress against those who mis-sell. That&#146;s how we have to do
it. We will never have
equality.</div><a name="09121051000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">236</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000230"></a>John

you have a view on the success of the new
body?</div><a name="09121051000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> Two thoughts on the new body. One is that it
is generally agreed that the FSA&#146;s retail distribution review
process will substantially reduce the number of private sector IFAs in
the country, and will eliminate the availability of private sector
independent financial advice for large numbers of the lower-paid.
Frankly, if they don&#146;t get the service they are in dire
trouble.</div>
<a name="09121051000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">How do you
measure its success? It would be nice to think that you could measure
it by a reduction in complaints to the ombudsman, or something along 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>those lines. I have done some work in this area, and I am aware that
none of those metrics seems to give any useful answer. It is a
conclusion that I think the FSA has stated in a lot of the research
work into the market that it makes publicly available, but I
don&#146;t think it knows
either.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121051000233"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> Does anyone have a view on that? The issue was
raised. We are talking about financial education. You said that if
people could not get access to independent advisers they really would
be in trouble. The Bill is meant to make things easier for people, but
there seems to be a conflict here.</div>
<a name="09121051000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> The conflict is not within this Bill. The
big policy question is, &#147;Is it better for people to receive bad
and biased advice, or to receive no advice at all?&#148; The FSA has
a policy on that. It is above my pay
grade.</div><a name="09121051000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">239</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000234"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> My understanding is that the new education body is
supposed to wrap up the previous work that has been done on generic
financial advice. The theory is that you get generic financial advice
to tell you whether you need a pension and so on. Then&#151;there is
a very grey line here&#151;you are passed over to an independent
financial adviser, a company or whoever. You don&#146;t think that
will
work?</div><a name="09121051000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> It is asking an awful lot of a public sector
body to give that sort of advice. It is also asking an awful lot of
individual investors to have the self-awareness to realise that they
need to go to a public sector body to get
it.</div><a name="09121051000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> It may be a weak answer, Mr. Love,
but we have already been working with the FSA and talking to it, or to
the team that will almost certainly be part of the consumer financial
education body. We have put a fair amount of time into these bodies and
this work. We think it is worth doing to see whether it can work. You
ask whether it will work ultimately; I do not
know.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">240</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000235"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> There is a pilot scheme in the north-west, but I do
not know what the emerging evidence from that is. I understand it is a
huge ask to be able to deliver this across the board. My understanding
was that those involved were modestly confident that things were moving
in the right direction.</div>
<a name="09121051000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> We have also been working for some years on
the retail distribution review at the most senior level among our
firms. They are very committed to working on it and working with the
FSA. There are a lot of very good ideas within it. I am not sure this
will lead to a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div>desert within the United Kingdom. If we can up standards, then we will
be supportive. As for the products that our firms produce, I do not
think that they want them mis-sold. You want them to go to the right
people. Everybody has a vested interest in this
area.</div>
<a name="09121051000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">241</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000236"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Could we move on to hedge funds and the rules in
the Bill? The FSA introduced a regime for disclosure and short selling
around about the peak of the banking crisis. It seemed to have no
problem producing a regime at that point. Why are we having new powers
in this
Bill?</div><a name="09121051000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> I am not sure that it had the power to do what
it did. That is why this is a very difficult issue. The two backgrounds
are that the ability to stop short selling was pinned on the market
code, which was itself underpinned by the super-equivalent regime of
the United Kingdom in market abuse. In fact, had the Government
stripped back the super-equivalent provision, as they first proposed
doing the Christmas before that, they would have had no power to bring
in the short selling regime. Ironically, I am afraid the lobbying of
the IMA meant that we then had a short selling ban, which I am living
down.</div><a name="09121051000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">242</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000237"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Before you move on, and in relation to that first
point, are you saying that the regime the FSA introduced did or did not
have a firm legal
basis?</div><a name="09121051000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> I think that it is accepted by many people
that it did not have a firm legal basis. That does not mean that there
wasn&#146;t one. In just the same way, in court, sometimes there will
be three days of argument, and then someone will say, &#147;In our
judgment, the following is quite clear&#148;. It is very difficult.
It was an evidential provision under the market code, underpinned by
statute. That is a very different proposition from a direct power to
impose and prevent short selling. It was a little easier to get the
disclosure obligations, although it was still difficult. Ironically,
that is also a reflection of how we implemented the transparency
obligations directive, under which 3 per cent. is needed to make a
disclosure. That is all implemented on the basis of a long position.
There were no powers to make a disclosure on a short position in the
same way. Powers are definitely needed to make clear what is and is not
allowed, and certainly for the disclosures. It was widely accepted
around the City that a better underpinning was needed for what the FSA
has done.</div>
<a name="09121051000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">243</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000238"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> So it needed better underpinning. Does the Bill
provide that? Are the powers proportionate?</div>
<a name="09121051000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> They could not be much wider, but those are
the powers that are given.</div>
<a name="09121051000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> On the short selling point, it is probably
the case that had the FSA&#146;s short-selling regime been challenged
as a matter of administrative law, the challenge would have been
successful. It never happened, because the problem had gone away by the
time anyone could have mounted a challenge. It is clear that the
provisions as currently drafted provide a legal basis for banning short
selling. The problem is that they provide a basis for banning selling;
The definition of short selling, as set out in the legislation, is any
transaction in which someone might benefit if the value subsequently
goes down.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div><a name="09121051000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, what
is intended is for the regulator, under this umbrella, to craft a
slightly more thoughtful definition. Around the world, we have done an
enormous amount of comparative survey work on short-selling regimes in
different jurisdictions. The hardest thing about a short-selling regime
is defining what is meant by short selling. It is not unreasonable that
an over-broad definition has been created and left to the FSA to flesh
out, but that does create concerns. This definition could be
substantially improved if some element of shortness were included
in it.</div>
<a name="09121051000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">244</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000239"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Is there a definition of shortness that we
could&#151;</div><a name="09121051000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> I can certainly provide you with a paper on
that, but I would not dare to give one off the top of my
head.</div>
<a name="09121051000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> The French have banned naked short selling,
according to their publicity. However, what they actually did was
impose a requirement for asset managers to identify for the broker that
the custodian had the stock in place. They did not actually ban it. The
German statement was never supported by any legal power or instrument.
Simon might be right to say that people did not want to mount a
challenge. I think that there was also a recognition that we were in
crisis moments. A lot of people said, &#147;Power or not, the FSA has
led&#148;. That was a good thing. It made its statement and set out
its case. There was a bit of control and leadership coming into the
City at a time when it was pretty febrile. Going forward, people want
to see a proper power, not least where they are asked to reveal
things&#151;which the Bill fails to do&#151;about their clients,
for example, and give protections.</div>
<a name="09121051000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">245</b><a name="09121051000240"></a><b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): There has
been a massive amount of primary and secondary regulation on the
financial services. Given that, and given that this Bill, which is
being rushed through in the space of three months, is being introduced,
is there a risk of the whole industry becoming regulatory-focused and
falling out of touch with either the consumer or the shareholder?
Effectively, we could kill our industry by focusing so much on trying
to protect it.</div>
<a name="09121051000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Ereira:</b></i> The answer is that there is a risk. That risk
is not so much the Bill, but rather the approach to the Bill, which is
really quite difficult. It is fundamentally a series of pieces of
enabling legislation, which will then be followed up by secondary
legislation and further regulation. The problem is about change and
unpredictability. Responding to that change and unpredictability makes
this a difficult environment for people to conduct business in. It
increases the risk of uncertainty and of doing business, and that is an
unfavourable environment. There is a lot to be said for standing back
and asking whether there is some more sensible and stable regime that
can be brought in as an overarching
review.</div><a name="09121051000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> The complaint I hear most regularly from
senior bankers is that they are now spending so much time dealing with
regulatory change that they no longer have time to focus on the running
of their institutions, and they expect that to continue for at least
two or three years. That is not just as a result of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div>activities of this House and this Bill by any means; there is a global
tsunami of regulation that is hitting all of these institutions.
However, I am not sure that many of them would advocate the idea that
that process should simply stop. There is consensus within the industry
that regulation needs to change and to improve. Although the risk that
you mention exists, I do not think there is much resistance to
regulation for the sake of it, even in the outer reaches of the hedge
fund industry.</div>
<a name="09121051000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> I don&#146;t think it will cause damage.
Regulation does get headlines at times, but the whole issue over wealth
creation and such like is a step away from a lot of this. The areas
that we are particular mentioning, such as short selling, are to do
with the market itself and the environment in which we interact with
one another. It is very important that there are clear statements of
what is appropriate and that disclosures are made to ensure that there
is market confidence. We need to co-ordinate with what Europe is doing
on short selling, as it an international issue.</div>
<a name="09121051000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
worst things that occurred, in a regulatory sense, during the crisis
was that everybody had their own idea on what to ban each week, despite
the fact that lots of these instruments were traded across several
countries. There is now an opportunity to ensure that we have a clear
statement, at least from this area in Europe, as to what we expect to
be done and on the disclosures to be made. Frankly, we may have a much
more understanding view of short selling than the United States may end
up with&#151;they have upticks and much more limited stuff. I do not
think that this will restrict us particularly. There are clearly
worries that the FSA would get out of step with Europe, but I do not
think that is where it is at the moment. This measure is just making
sure that the FSA has the powers to get it
right.</div>
<a name="09121051000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">246</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000241"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> Is the direction of travel towards greater
regulation going to continue, or are we seeing a tightening followed by
a loosening, with perhaps a competitive advantage in a few years from
loosening regulation faster than other marketplaces? I will ask Simon
first.</div><a name="09121051000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> Gosh. What is happening at the moment is not
simply an addition of more regulation upon more regulation; it is not
as simple as the pile getting bigger. I think that the shape of the
system is changing: some things are being emphasised, others are being
de-emphasised. We will probably not end up with the imposition of
massively greater regulatory burdens than currently exist. I hope that
if what is done is done properly, the regulation will be more
intelligently applied and more effective. What matters is whether
regulation is effective or ineffective. We know that some of what is
put on the industry in the current couple of years will turn out to be
ineffective. We hope that that will be rapidly removed after the event
and that the processes that prove to be effective will be developed and
imposed. One thing that everybody has learned during this crisis is the
overwhelming importance of international co-ordination. In that
respect, the risk of competitive de-regulation in the future is
probably significantly less than it was perhaps even a few years
ago.</div><a name="09121051000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">247</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000242"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> I&#146;d like to follow on from that point.
Forgive me, I am not a lawyer, but is there sufficient ability in the
Bill to roll back some of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div>regulatory changes, as you describe? Would it be easy for Parliament to
say, &#147;This was right to do at the time. Parliament decided to do
it at the time,&#148; but four years hence, roll back a specific
element on a specific month and then a little bit more three months
later? Or would it take another Bill or a big piece of secondary
legislation put forward by
Government?</div><a name="09121051000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon

forward by Government.</div>
<a name="09121051000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">248</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000243"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> Primary or secondary
legislation?</div><a name="09121051000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> That depends what is being repealed, but,
yes, potentially primary. Governments have developed the technique of
repealing legislation using secondary legislation, but I believe that
it is unpopular.</div>
<a name="09121051000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">249</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000244"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> On the issue of competitiveness, which was raised
by Mr. Duddridge, if we look at proposed new section 6B, we
see that subsection (3)(b)
says</div><a name="09121051000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
desirability of maintaining the competitive position of the United
Kingdom in respect of financial services and
markets.&#148;</div><a name="09121051000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is in the context of promoting international financial regulation and
supervision. How on earth do we manage to do that?</div>
<a name="09121051000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Ereira:</b></i> The most appropriate way of doing that is
through international co-operation. I can give you a tangible example.
In the Bill there is material about recovery and resolution plans and
the living will stuff. That is being worked on at an international
level. The Bill is completely anticipatory of what may or may not come
out of G20 and the international processes. It is not necessarily
terribly helpful because until we know what will come out of those
processes, we will not know if we have the right framing
legislation.</div><a name="09121051000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a small aside to that, the commencement of that particular provision is
two months after the Bill gets Royal Assent, so this goes live when we
have no time even to think about what the international position is
going to be. To be competitive we need a regime that is consistent with
what is going on elsewhere. If we are out of step or thought-leading
the market, we may end up out of step and less
competitive.</div>

be readily available. It means that sometimes it gets forced through
the wrong route&#151;through an Office of Fair Trading process,
rather than a direct case is a good
example.</div><a name="09121051000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> I think that if this is justified, the thing
that must justify it must be shortcomings in the ombudsman process
because, as was said earlier, one of the more important things for
consumers is that it should be obvious to them where to go for redress.
The creation of multiple avenues does not seem to me to be entirely
helpful. If the object of the proposal is to address shortfalls in the
existing ombudsman system, I have to ask why the policy approach taken
is not to address those systems rather than create an entirely new
approach.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">253</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000248"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> It might be the modesty of the penalties that the
ombudsman may be able to
impose.</div><a name="09121051000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> On a purely personal level, I started my
professional career doing small crime as a barrister and I do not
believe that the courts are the ideal recourse for any
consumer.</div>
<a name="09121051000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">254</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000249"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Okay. That&#146;s very helpful. The other area I
wanted to question was the information gathering powers of the FSA,
particularly the slight oddity at the end, where the FSA is empowered
to collect information on behalf of a foreign regulator who may have a
concern about financial stability in their own state and wish to
collect information from a UK-based entity. That appeared to be a quite
loosely worded power. Do you perhaps have concerns? Mr.
Ereira
first.</div><a name="09121051000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Ereira:</b></i> I think my main concern is mutuality. We
should not be allowing for that unless similar arrangements work the
other way and the FSA could obtain similar
information.</div>
<a name="09121051000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">255</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000250"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> That is not what the clause
says.</div><a name="09121051000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Ereira:</b></i> It&#146;s not what it says at the moment,
no.</div>
<a name="09121051000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">256</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000251"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> The same with you, Mr. Gleeson? My slight
concern is that we constantly use this term &#147;financial
stability&#148; as the basis for collecting information. As
I&#146;ve said elsewhere, I think we know when we haven&#146;t got
financial stability, but I am not sure we know the precise key
components of it and they haven&#146;t been defined. So this is a
pretty broad brush with which to sweep information in.</div>
<a name="09121051000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> I agree with that, but we have a global
system and I do not think any national regulator can, on its own,
obtain sufficient information from anyone to derive an accurate picture
of the global financial system. So I think that in order to achieve
that, a power to co-operate among regulators is necessary. However, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>think David Ereira is absolutely right; it is one thing to confer that
power, another to regulate its exercise. There is nothing here that
regulates that
exercise.</div>
<a name="09121051000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121051000252"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> We also know rather little about regulators in any
country as it is in the clause at the moment. I don&#146;t know how
financial services are regulated in central America and whether their
request might be proportionate. It is difficult to speculate on that,
but that speculation is invited by the broad sweep of this particular
clause.</div>
<a name="09121051000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">257</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000253"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> To go on with that point, last week the Treasury
Committee was actually trogging around Europe. It would appear that
within the college of regulators in the EU, they have agreed some sort
of host home country mutuality agreement to be able to go into each
other&#146;s. But that is only in the EU. Obviously, this would be
much wider.</div>
<a name="09121051000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just three
quick questions: when your banking friends were not saddled down with
all this wretched regulation and were being allowed to get on and run
their businesses, do you think they did a good
job?</div><a name="09121051000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> Yes, I do actually. What the industry had
was a common mistake that was shared among those who ran all the major
banks, all the major regulators and, to be fair, all the major
Governments as to the extent of risk to which the system was exposed.
They were all collectively wrong. However, leaving that aside, if you
ask whether they were doing a bad job of running the banks, then it is
impossible to answer that question any way other than, no; they were
actually doing it quite well apart from the fact that the intellectual
structure on which they were basing all of their decisions was
fundamentally flawed.</div>
<a name="09121051000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">258</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000254"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> The outcome of that was the financial instability
that we are now trying to address.</div>
<a name="09121051000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="09121051000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121051000255"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> All three of you have mentioned the importance of
international co-operation. In looking at what we have got here, can
you give us assurances that all these measures will neatly dovetail
into all the EU and G20 regulations? If not, is it a good idea for us
to go first with this
Bill?</div><a name="09121051000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Ereira:</b></i> The answer is that you couldn&#146;t
possibly give that assurance and indeed the example cited about the
living will stuff demonstrates that we are jumping the gun slightly on
that.</div>
<a name="09121051000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">259</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000256"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Do you think that is a good
idea?</div><a name="09121051000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Ereira:</b></i> No, I do not think it is a good idea. It will
probably work out all right, because the wording is sufficiently wide
that in all probability we will be able to come up with appropriate
regulations that fit within whatever comes out of the international
processes. It just seems to me more appropriate to wait and see what
comes out of those international processes and then say, &#147;That
is what we need&#148;. I think the carts and horses have been put the
wrong way
round.</div><a name="09121051000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">260</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000257"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Mr. Gleeson, is there anything in here
that is a hostage to fortune?</div>
<a name="09121051000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Simon
Gleeson:</b></i> No, because there is so relatively little in
here apart from a power given to the Treasury to make further orders at
a future time.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div><a name="09121051000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">261</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000258"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Mr. Sears, do you want to comment on
that?</div><a name="09121051000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> If I may. If we wait for Europe, particularly,
to move, then they will almost certainly do this by way of directives,
and we would use the European Communities Act 1972 to implement many of
these things. The only hostage to fortune is the usual balance that
goes on&#151;as was said by Lord Davidson in his review on
regulation&#151;which is that you want to have thought leadership and
you want to be first there. On the other hand, just talking about some
of these things spooks the horses and causes people to look at other
countries, which in fact within two years bring in exactly the same
thing. So we have people talking about whether to stay in the United
Kingdom. The reality is that most of the places people would think
about going to are going to have the same sort of regulations within
the time scales.</div>
<a name="09121051000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">262</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000259"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> So the balance of risk is that introducing early
regulation may frighten away other things, but the risk that we are
trying to address may not actually happen, so therefore we may be doing
it too early anyway, even in respect of the EU or G20.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div><a name="09121051000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Guy
Sears:</b></i> That is the balance, but equally you are not
actually bringing it in in respect of Parliament; you are just enabling
the FSA to bring it in at some point. So it is a slightly different
timing, and the FSA can choose when to do
it.</div><a name="09121051000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">263</b><b class="B"><a name="09121051000260"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Lastly, Mr. Ereira, on a scale of one to
10, how advantageous is the Bill to
lawyers?</div><a name="09121051000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Ereira:</b></i> To lawyers? I regret to inform you that it is
excellent news for
lawyers.</div><a name="09121051000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121051000261"></a>The
Chairman:</b> If Members have no further questions, that
brings us to the end of the business for the day. Mr.

much for joining us. The Committee and the House are indebted to
