Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): Thank you very
much, Mrs. Anderson. I have not had the opportunity of
welcoming you to the Chair in the amending part of our deliberations. I
would like to give my apologies for the morning session. I had a
hospital appointment that I have had to cancel on a number of previous
occasions.</div>
					<a name="080129143000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I just
have one brief question for the Minister on clause 25 in relation to
subsection (4) and paragraph 71 of the Explanatory Notes. Could he
please outline what type of schemes this subsection has in mind when it
says that those schemes will not be eligible for auto-enrolment by
virtue of the power given to trustees to modify a
scheme?</div>
					<a name="080129143000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080129143000222"></a>The
Minister for Pensions Reform (Mr. Mike
O'Brien):
						</b> The purpose of clause 25 is to enable trustees
to modify an occupational pension scheme that otherwise meets the
quality criteria but does not allow for automatic enrolment. This power
would be used where there are limited powers of amendment within the
scheme. It would provide trustees with a power to change the scheme
rules to allow automatic enrolment, as some schemes currently just do
not allow it. Changes can only be made with the consent of the
employer.</div>
					<a name="080129143000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that both the trustees and the employer agree on the matter
and that the trustees must consider the interests of existing members
in this decision. The employer, who meets the administrative costs and
balance of any defined benefit funding requirements, must consider any
additional costs arising from automatic enrolment. This is a limited
power, as it only provides an override for rule changes necessary to
facilitate automatic enrolment and can only be made with the employer's
agreement, in circumstances where at the moment scheme rules do not
allow it.</div>
					<a name="080129143000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations will provide that the subsection does not apply to
occupational pension schemes within a certain description, so they will
identify the nature of the particular schemes this will apply to. All
this will be set out in more detail in those regulations. We want to
ensure we are able to discuss with various trustees&#146;

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080129143000224"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The reason is that we want the Pensions Regulator
to be able to take these steps. The clause makes clear that failure to
comply with the employers&#146; duties in chapter 1 will not give
rise to an individual right to pursue a case for breach of statutory
duty. Otherwise individuals would have to take individual action in the
courts. Our preference is that the Pensions Regulator will take on the
role of enforcing employer compliance with the new duties, alongside
its responsibility for regulating the new personal accounts
scheme.</div>
					<a name="080129143000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
ensure that the route to a remedy for an individual whose employer has
been non-compliant is through enforcement by the Pensions Regulator
rather than through that kind of individual action. That would ensure
both more effective enforcement and, importantly, clarity for employers
who might otherwise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>fear that they could face action simultaneously on two fronts. Clause 27
clarifies that and also confirms that nothing in chapters 1 and 2
affects any other individual right to take legal action. Other
individual rights to take legal action&#151;concerning employment
contracts for example&#151;will remain and will be dealt with
separately. The clause is therefore crucial in setting out who has the
right to enforce employers&#146; duties. The answer is that the
regulator has that
right.</div>

Friends.</div>
					<a name="080129143000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am curious
as to why what will be in a compliance notice is not specified because,
having looked at clause 28(3), it seems that all four paragraphs (a),
(b), (c) and (d) should be in a compliance notice. Such a notice would
tell the employer by when a remedial action must be taken, what must be
done, how it must be sorted out, and what would happen to him if he
failed to comply with the notice. Those four components strike me as
important and if a compliance notice were to be served on an employer
they would want all those parts there so that they knew what to do and
by why, and what would happen otherwise. I am querying the word
&#147;may&#148;; there is a case for compliance notices being
issued in a set format, covering all the points of information that I
have run
through.</div>
					<a name="080129143000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="080129143000228"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> That is a question I asked too; it seems
reasonable for those various parts of a compliance notice to be
included. The answer I got was, &#147;Yes, but what happens if the
Pensions Regulator already knows that information? Why would one want
the compliance notice to contain a request for information that was
already in the hands of the Pensions Regulator?&#148; So that is the
answer.</div>
					<a name="080129143000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
merit in having a clear, standard form; we do not want lots of
variations in forms and so I will consider the amendments. I am more in
sympathy with amendment No. 143 than with No. 144 because it may be
clear in clause 28(4) what steps the regulator thinks appropriate,
perhaps just compliance in terms of making repayments. It is a
reasonable assumption that we will want to have a standard form. The
best approach is probably that we would want all the points in almost
all notices, but that a minor element of discretion might be
better&#151;with &#147;may&#148;&#151;in order to not have
notices being more complicated for employers than they need to be. If,
for example, we had a standard 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>notice and there were various options as to what an employer might be
required to do; we could end up with a complicated notice if it had to
make a whole list of requests. Particularly if the employer is a small
business person and has not had to deal with the Pensions Regulator
before, he could get a long list that it looks like he has to comply
with, but actually he has done some of those things. He may not have
the best of records, he may not know that he has done some of those
things, so he may be put to more inconvenience than he needs to
be.</div>
					<a name="080129143000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is some
benefit in a bit of discretion here&#151;using &#147;may&#148;
rather than &#147;must&#148;&#151;but I do not feel strongly. I
can see an argument for inserting &#147;must&#148;. It depends on
how far the Opposition wish to push this. I am fairly relaxed, but if
the hon. Gentleman thinks &#147;must&#148; is necessary, I will
reflect on that. However, for the reasons described&#151;to help
small businesses&#151;it is probably better to give a level of
discretion and not to be too prescriptive. We will consult. I think
that most notices will contain all the information, but in practice
having an element of discretion, which we can deal with by regulation
for particular forms, may well be
beneficial.</div>
					<a name="080129143000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
additional argument in favour of &#147;may&#148; rather than
&#147;must&#148; is that &#147;may&#148;, because it gives
discretion, means that a legal challenge against the precise wording of
the compliance notice might be more difficult. If the statute says that
a notice &#147;must&#148; say all those things,
including</div>
					<a name="080129143000187"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;requiring the
employer to inform the Regulator, within a specified period, how the
employer has complied or is complying with the
notice&#148;,</div>
					<a name="080129143000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">then an
employer may be able to challenge on a legal basis, because
&#147;must&#148; is in there and, therefore, things must be done in
a certain way. The courts would probably end up having to interpret
what that &#147;must&#148; is all about. Having &#147;may&#148;
will give some discretion to the Pensions Regulator to have a form that
is fairly standard, but if the regulator made a small error in wording
or was not as fulsome as a difficult employer might want, then a legal
challenge would be more
difficult.</div>
					<a name="080129143000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
reasons and on balance, we are probably better off with
&#147;may&#148;, but I do not feel that strongly about it. I can
see from the hon. Gentleman&#146;s face that he does not feel
particularly strongly either. Let us leave it the way that it
is.</div>

						<a name="080129143000229"></a>
							<b class="B">Paul
Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): I think that the Minister puts the
point well. Yes, there are advantages either way, but in the context of
what we are trying to do, &#147;may&#148; is probably the right way
to go. To me, what we are trying to achieve is covered by subsection
(2), which states clearly that when the compliance notice is issued the
employer must respond. Given that, what might be in the compliance
notice should be left to the discretion of the Pensions
Regulator.</div>

						</b> I am pleased to see that the Minister asked the
same question of his officials that I asked myself when looking at the

do.</div>

Minister&#146;s best answer, which I accept, was about legal
challenge. I realise that, when lawyers get involved, they can get
pernickety, and if the compliance notice is not in the exact format
specified it could cause complications. I was toying with the idea of
pressing this to a vote, given the semi-encouragement the Minister was
giving me. I was wondering whether the Minister would have marched his
troops behind me if I called a division on this matter, because he was
being so emollient about it. However, on the issue of legal challenge,
he has persuaded me.</div>

particularly reassured by what he said about the intention that a
compliance notice would, in general, be a fairly standard document

do, by when he had to do it, and what would happen if he or she did not
comply. Having been reassured, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

						</b> Amendment No. 24 is fairly straightforward, in
that it seeks to put the jobholder back in the position he or she would
have been in if contributions had been made at the correct time by the
employer in the first place. Obviously, there is a time value to money.
Having a contribution today is more valuable than having that
contribution in a month or three months&#146; time. By adding (g) to
the end of the list of requirements in subsection (5), we seek to
ensure that late contributions have the same financial value to the
jobholder as contributions made at the correct time. The omission of
that provision strikes me as slightly surprising in relation to clause
30. No doubt the Minister will shortly tell me there was a very good
reason for it being left
out.</div>
					<a name="080129143000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I see where the
hon. Member for Rochdale is coming from with amendment No. 96, which I
know he will speak shortly. Confusingly, it relates to clause 31,
although we are also speaking to clause 30. I think he has the same
objective that I do, which is to put the jobholder back in the position
that he or she would have been in had the contributions been made on
time. I would just query the figure of 5 per cent. in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div>amendment No. 96, because it is of course possible that interest rates
could be significantly higher, and putting a figure in the Bill may not
put the jobholder back in the position he or she would have been in,
depending on financial circumstances at the
time.</div>

prepared to accept these, will he assure us that something along these
lines will go in the Bill? The details can be worked out and put in
regulations, but I think most people would be very satisfied with a
clause that ensures that there is some protection where there is late
payment or non-payment, and that employers understand that. Within the
context of the compliance regime that has developed here, which is
light-touch, insisting on interest for late payment would be a
light-touch way of making it in the employer&#146;s interest to make

be charged. It is a good point; that power was not there and when we

not entirely sure whether three months would be the right figure. Many
of us get chased up a lot sooner than three months if we owe money, and
rightly so in many cases. Provided, as we have debated, the payment is
made with interest, it perhaps does not matter exactly what that figure
is. The important point is that the payment is made and that it is made

							<a name="080129143000239"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I have a lot of sympathy with the views
expressed by the Liberal Democrats on this issue.
Employees should not be disadvantaged by their employer&#146;s
failure to comply by not paying contributions on time. The compliance
regime is designed to place employees in the position that they would
have been in had their employer complied. Subsection (2)(c) proposes
that after a set time period employers should be required to pay both
their and their employees&#146; contributions. The hon. Member for
Rochdale is right that various stakeholders, including Help the Aged
and the TUC, have expressed an interest in this issue. Before we
identify a period&#151;three months is the one for which I have some
sympathy&#151;I want to discuss with the stakeholders, including
business organisations, what the best period would be. I think the way
forward on this is to allow us to consult properly before taking a
final view, including about the appropriate length of time in question.
We therefore propose that details should be consulted on and set out in
secondary legislation when this issue has been further considered. In
principle, I am with the hon. Gentleman. Although I will not commit the
Government to it, I am even with him in thinking that three months
sounds like a reasonable period. However, I want to hear all the
arguments before I make a final decision, and I want the business
community, as well as other stakeholders, to have a say. On that basis,
I hope he will feel able to withdraw the

jobholders from the employer to whom the fixed penalty notice has been
issued or jobholders more generally, who could be the subject of some
sort of hardship fund if their employer had gone bust and contributions

					<a name="080129143000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are various times in public life when money is raised by fines or
penalties of one sort or another. It is not always clear to the public
where that money goes, what happens to it, or for what purposes it will
be used. Amendment No. 145 is worded in a very wide way. It just gives
the Secretary of State a permissive power to apply such moneys raised
by way of fixed penalty notices for the benefit of jobholders, should
he or she see fit to do so, at any time. It does not require the
Secretary of State to do anything; it is purely a permissive power. On
that basis, I would commend it to the

						</b> The hon. Member
for South-West Bedfordshire has had quite a good run with some of his
amendments, but it has now ended, I am sorry to say. Let me explain why
we are not keen on the amendment.</div>
					<a name="080129143000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 32 gives the Pensions
Regulator the power to issue fixed penalty notices to persons who have
failed to comply with compliance or contribution notices and the
employer duty provisions. The primary role of fixed penalties is to act
as a deterrent and, where necessary, sanction those who have not
complied. The amendment gives the Secretary of State the power to
decide which moneys arising from fixed penalties should be used for the
benefit of qualifying jobholders. However, it is a long-standing
practice that revenue from fixed penalties goes directly to the
consolidated fund of the Exchequer, so that it can be used as
appropriate on a full range of public services.</div>
					<a name="080129143000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulator will not gain
financially from the imposition of fines, and there will be no hidden
incentives for their issuing. Importantly, this measure is fully in
line with the findings of the Macrory review, separating revenue
streams in order to eliminate all perverse incentives. The hon.
Gentleman may know that we are taking forward the recommendations of
the Macrory review via the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Bill,
which is currently at Committee stage in the

will be familiar with what I cite, but I am going to put it on
record.</div>
					<a name="080129143000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Macrory
recommends that we have seven principles for penalties. The seventh is
germane to the argument:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div>
					<a name="080129143000189"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is important that
regulators do not have targets for different types of enforcement
actions or any correlation with salary bonuses or similar incentives.
This might incentivise staff to pursue certain enforcement actions
inappropriately.&#148;</div>

goes
on:</div>
					<a name="080129143000190"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
would emphasise that regulators should not retain the revenue from
Monetary Administrative Penalties, or exercise any control over how
that revenue should be
spent.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080129143000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
points are relevant. Macrory reinforces the argument in a way that will
help hon. Members later
on:</div>
					<a name="080129143000191"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I want to
avoid creating any perverse financial incentives for regulators that
might influence their choice of sanctioning tool. This view is already
entrenched in relevant section of HM-Treasury&#146;s Consolidated
Budgeting Guide and I echo their views on the separation of revenue
streams in order to eliminate perverse
incentives.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080129143000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, he
says:</div>
					<a name="080129143000192"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I have
also emphasised that regulators must avoid creating perverse incentives
(such as staff appraisal criteria) that will encourage the use of
financial penalties without regard to the regulatory outcomes to be
achieved.&#148;</div>
					<a name="080129143000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
that here we are dealing with pensions and company contributions to
pensions, which are therefore related to the other questions, and that,
in implementing Macrory, we are pursuing his recommendations
specifically on the issue, going down the route suggested by the
amendment would take us in the wrong direction. The compliance regime
is designed so that jobholders are not put at any sort of disadvantage.
Where an employer is non-compliant, we are designing the regime based
on the principles that employers are not better off by not complying,
and jobholders are not worse off because their employer failed to
comply. We do not want any risk-perverse incentives coming in. If we
stick with the principle that sanctions of that nature come directly to
the Consolidated Fund and there is no question of the regulator
distributing them in any way, we can remain consistent with that
principle. That is important for both this measure and that on
sanctions regimes in general, which is being considered in the other
place. Given that, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Regulator has the power to review all notices of issues as part of the
new compliance regime. These are compliance notices, third-party
notices, unpaid contribution notices, and fixed and escalating penalty
notices. The Pensions Regulator will have the power to confirm, vary or
revoke notices, or to substitute a different notice if it feels that is
appropriate. Cases in which sanctions for failure to produce
information have been applied incorrectly&#151;for example, if the
required information had actually been provided&#151;would therefore
be corrected through the review
process.</div>
					<a name="080129143000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">A section 72
notice, as set out in the Pensions Act 2004, is a notice requiring
trustees, scheme managers, employers and others who appear to hold
relevant information to provide specified information to the regulator.
The important point is that this is an evidence-gathering power only.
It gives the regulator the power to require from the person information
that is relevant to the exercise of its functions. It is not a sanction
in its own right&#151;that is the difference. A separate notice has
to be issued to penalise those who fail to comply with a section 72
notice. We therefore do not consider it appropriate to have a review
process under clause 35 for people served with a section 72
notice.</div>
					<a name="080129143000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Allowing a
review process for section 72 notices could impair the
regulator&#146;s efficiency when gathering information. In our view,
it is inappropriate to allow people to hinder the notice&#146;s use
by invoking procedures for review and appeal. It is, however, necessary
to give a safeguard to someone who is at risk of being penalised for
refusing to comply. Fixed penalty notices under clause 32 and
escalating penalty notices under clause 33 may be issued for failure to
comply with notices requiring the production of information issued
under section 72 of the 2004 Act. As I have explained, review is
already available at the point at which anyone may face sanctions for
failure to provide information. Given that, I hope that the hon.

While I would not suggest that ministerial motives go quite so far, the
serious point is that while we all back a tough compliance regime, it
must be fair. Those employers who are being hauled up, perhaps for
inadvertent errors, must have rights. It might be that the business is
incredibly busy, that the order book is overflowing, that there are
staff problems, or that the matter has genuinely slipped their minds.
The right to go to a tribunal should be absolute, which is why I query
the word &#147;may&#148; and think that &#147;must&#148; should
be
inserted.</div>

						</b> I hope that the Minister can give us some
indication of why the word used is &#147;may&#148; and not
&#147;must&#148;. We all accept that the compliance regime has to
have a light touch and to be fair. The impact assessment sets out the
three clear areas in which the regime has to meet
standards.</div>
					<a name="080129143000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
side of the coin is missing, however, although I accept that this will
not happen in the vast majority of cases. I am sure&#151;we have seen
the figures&#151;that most employers will operate the scheme without
problems. However, there will be a small number of employers with whom
there are problems, and the compliance regime is meant to deal with
that. Equally, there might be compelling reasons why that employer has
not met his or her obligations, so allowing him or her the right to a
tribunal is the appropriate way
forward.</div>
					<a name="080129143000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister can respond favourably. Given the consensus that has been
developed so far, the slight change from a three-letter word to a
four-letter word might help to get more widespread support for the
measures in the

first.</div>
					<a name="080129143000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Pensions
Regulator is funded by a levy on pension schemes. That levy is used to
pay for a range of activities. We do not believe that the funds raised
by the levy should be used to cover the costs to the Pensions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>Regulator of designing and putting in place its compliance procedures in
the run-up to 2012. That work is essential if the regulator is to
discharge its compliance responsibilities in the future. It is for a
broader public benefit and, therefore, should be funded accordingly. We
propose to do that through grants in aid using powers under schedule 5
of the Pensions Act 2004. Interestingly, that means that the work would
be funded from the Consolidated Fund, into which we have just agreed to
put money under the previous clause. Expenditure and funding given to
the regulator to develop its compliance regime will be accounted for
separately from its current activity and funding
regime.</div>
					<a name="080129143000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">There were
queries at one point about the issue of funding, so I want to respond.
On the question of &#147;may&#148; versus &#147;must&#148;, the
&#147;may&#148; in subsection (1) refers to making regulations.
There is also a right to appeal in subsection (1). I hope that that
covers the point and that the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire
will withdraw the

is very much a probing amendment that was tabled to get more
information from the Minister. He has already partly answered how the
tribunal is to be adequately funded. A lot of people have talked about
making sure that the Pensions Regulator is adequately funded. We will
have that discussion when we come to chapter 5, which deals with the
regulator and the way in which it will operate. Particularly regarding
the run-up period and beyond, I would like to know what the Minister
sees as the funding requirement for the tribunal, and how he will
ensure that the funding is made
available.</div>
					<a name="080129143000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
the Minister has already partly answered the question, but I will be
interested to hear what he says because we want employers to have the
right to go to that tribunal. We also want to ensure that it has enough
resources&#151;human or whatever&#151;to enable adequate and speedy
dealings with any issues arising, especially in the initial stages
following the introduction of the Bill. The worst thing that could
happen would be a backlog of cases before the tribunal that were not
resolved, because that would affect not just the employer, but the
employee. That would have an impact on the success of the scheme and
could well increase the costs. It is important that, in the initial
stages, the tribunal is adequately funded&#151;not just financially,
but with the human resources to ensure that anything put before it is
dealt with speedily.</div>

that that will happen in a reasonably timely manner and that that is
being factored into the Government&#146;s plans. We all know that
justice delayed can be justice denied&#151;there might be adverse
publicity for an employer who has been hauled up before the Pensions

that we know that they can, but they should be able to go reasonably

the interrelationship between the

					<a name="080129143000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">While the Bill
names the Pensions Regulator tribunal as the appellate body to hear
appeals under this regime, we do not envisage that it will actually
perform that function. That is because by the time appeals under the
new regime are ready to be heard, we anticipate that the functions of
the Pensions Regulator tribunal will have moved into the new tribunals
structure, which is being set up under the 2007 Act.</div>
					<a name="080129143000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 3 of
2007 Act establishes new first-tier and upper-tier tribunals. Once the
provision is in force, section 30 of that Act will be used to transfer
the functions of the Pensions Regulator tribunal to the new
arrangements. It is envisaged that the functions relating to the new
duties introduced from 2012 will go to the first-tier tribunal. Given
the likely nature of appeals under this regime, we feel that that
tribunal is indeed the more appropriate appellate body, because it will
be the first-instance tribunal for most jurisdictions, and most appeals
from original decision-making bodies will commence in that tier. We
anticipate that the functions will transfer to the new arrangements in
2009, subject to the completion of recommendations on tax appeals
modernisation work outlined in the Government&#146;s consultation
paper on implementing part 1 of the 2007
Act.</div>
					<a name="080129143000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
proposes that we produce a report on funding the Pensions Regulator
tribunal for references made under this regime. I understand the
concern that has been expressed that the Pensions Regulator and the
tribunal should each be adequately resourced for their roles in
relation to this work.</div>
					<a name="080129143000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
working with the Pensions Regulator to develop the new regime and to
assess the costs and resources required to undertake the new compliance
functions in general. As I have said, we envisage using the first-tier
tribunal. However, we expect the approach on funding 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div>to be similar to that taken to the Pensions Regulator tribunal. The
Department will continue liaising with the Tribunals Service to assess
the additional resource requirements and the funding implications of
the new initiative. I assure the Committee that our officials are
working closely with colleagues at the Tribunals Service to ensure that
the new appellate functions will be successfully accommodated in the
revised structure.</div>

Bedfordshire raised a point about timeliness. Part of the reason why
the Government are implementing the tribunals reform system under the
2007 Act is to try to deliver exactly that. I want to reassure him and
the rest of the Committee that we are committed to funding this

law.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="080129143000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment was tabled in an attempt to get the Minister to comment on
the use of the word &#147;wilfully&#148; in
clause 37. We have heard about the need for the
proportionate use of the big stick. We all know that small,
medium-sized and large businesses often come under intense competitive
pressures, and that employers might have genuinely neglected their
duties regarding pension contributions purely because of the demands of
the business, rather than because they have wilfully determined not to
pay the contributions that they should by law. I would be grateful if
the Minister could clarify how the word &#147;wilfully&#148; will
be interpreted and give the reassurance, which I know that many in the
business community seek, that there will be a graduated response to
non-compliance, that the response will be tough only when it needs to
be, and that minor inadvertent errors or omissions by employers will be
dealt with in a light-touch
way.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080129143000262"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Let me see if I can be reasonable in explaining
the use of the word &#147;wilful&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>
					<a name="080129143000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
sets out the details of the new criminal offence for employers who fail
to comply with their duties under clause 3(2) in respect of automatic
enrolment, under clause 5(2) in terms of re-enrolment, and under clause
6(3) in terms of the jobholder&#146;s right to opt in. The amendment
concerns the important issue of the criminal sanction for
&#147;wilful&#148; failure to fulfil the employers&#146;
duties.</div>
					<a name="080129143000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might help if I briefly outline the compliance strategy and how the
sanction fits into that. The compliance policy has been developed as a
three-stage strategy. The first stage is to educate and inform
employers of their duties, and the second is to enable them to comply
simply and easily with those duties. The third and final step is
enforcement. The criminal sanction is therefore a backstop to the
enforcement strategy. Our expectation is that it will almost certainly
be rarely used. However, the requirements that we have
outlined&#151;automatic enrolment and establishing active membership
of qualifying schemes of a specified standard&#151;are designed to
help jobholders to meet their aspirations in retirement. Failure to
fulfil those duties jeopardises individuals&#146; prospects, so
employers need to take their duties
seriously.</div>
					<a name="080129143000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
right that an employer who &#147;wilfully fails to comply&#148;
should ultimately face a criminal sanction. The manner in which we have
designed the compliance and enforcement regime means that to reach that
ultimate sanction, an employer would have had ample opportunity to
fulfil their duties. Therefore, at that stage there is likely to be
evidence of &#147;wilful&#148; failure to comply because they would
have been given any number of reminders, encouragements and
inducements. If they were still non-compliant, that would be considered
&#147;wilful&#148;
failure.</div>
					<a name="080129143000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
the amendment, there is no reason explicitly to mention reasonableness
in the clause, because there is an underlying understanding that to act
wilfully is unreasonable. The employer who does not comply because of
genuine inadequacy or stupidity would be unlikely to be found guilty of
wilfulness. The use of the term &#147;wilful&#148; ensures that if
employers have failed to fulfil their duties through haphazard
administration or forgetfulness, they will not be criminalised. The
compliance regime will address those employers much earlier in the
process and put them in a position that does not disadvantage them, but
encourages them to
comply.</div>
					<a name="080129143000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
distinction underlines why &#147;wilful&#148; is there, and I hope
that my explanation will be sufficient to enable the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw the
amendment.</div>

it. I am interested in how the legal defence of stupidity would work. I
am not quite sure how that could be applied, but the Minister has been
reassuring, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

return to a point I have made several times; the Bill is going to apply
to a vast range of hugely diverse employers, from sandwich bars,
hairdressers and small builders at one end of the scale to the ICIs,
Vodafones and Shells of the corporate world at the other. Clause
40(1)(a) stipulates a form and a manner to be prescribed in which
records should be kept. I merely seek reassurance that the Government
will not be overly prescriptive. Most employers, probably, are
reasonably computerised these days, but certainly not all. Some may
prefer to have manual records or to keep their records in a
multiplicity of ways. The point is that they need to be efficient,
there needs to be some kind of audit trail, and they need to be
complete. That is what we should seek, rather than being overly
prescriptive as to how employers in a huge range of businesses they

						</b> In terms of the discussion we have had about
compliance and how we expect the system to operate, the requirement to
keep records is a reasonable one. I think it important that we do get
assurance. We hear from employers all the time about the burden that
the legislation we pass places on them, and Ministers always talk about
cutting down on red tape. Often, when new laws are being put in place,
that principle is forgotten and we get carried away with ourselves. I
know this clause says that the details will be laid out in regulations,
but it would be helpful if the Minister explained what minimum he
expects, and what additional burden he expects it to place on a wide
range of employers for whom, at the moment, a very simple PAYE system
may be the extent of their employee record
keeping.</div>

a very important part of those arrangements, and we must have
appropriate measures in place to ensure that employers are compliant
with that. However, as we have said before and as I will say also on
this clause, we are not setting out in any way to be unnecessarily
burdensome to employers, hence the regulations will be designed to
satisfy both objectives. We intend to set out in the regulations which
records should be kept, the form or forms in which they should be kept
and the period for which they should be kept. I think that, as it sets
out the basic requirements, that guidance will be welcomed by
employers. We can agree that it will be simpler and more efficient for
both employers and the regulator if the minimum essential records are
kept in a uniform manner. That will make it straightforward for
employers to respond to the regulator&#146;s requests for
information.</div>

Julie Kirkbride</b> (Bromsgrove) (Con): This discussion
reminds me of a conversation that I had just a few days ago with
someone who sought to obtain some records from an employer. Inevitably,
that was in different circumstances, because this measure has not been
enacted yet. It transpired that that person&#146;s employer had died
and the widow had thrown all the records, including their training

							<a name="080129143000270"></a>Mr.

						</b> I draw attention again to paragraph (b).
Regulations will be made requiring any
person</div>
					<a name="080129143000194"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to preserve
those records for such period, not exceeding 6 years, as may be
prescribed&#148;.</div>
					<a name="080129143000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
already a legal requirement in respect of many other bits of
information. I think that there is a requirement on us as individuals
to retain information for tax purposes for up to that length of time.
It is essential to have those requirements in place, because it is
important to have the means to hand to deal with any dispute that may
arise over records that are
kept.</div>
					<a name="080129143000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The important
point about records relating to contributions to pension schemes of
this type is that the scheme will also hold the records, presumably the
whole way through. There need not be a burdensome duty on employers to
retain the records for ever, but retaining them for a reasonable time
is sensible. The point about the clause is to what extent the
Government take powers to demand that employers maintain the records.
As the clause says, it is for up to six years. Employers will obviously
need to be aware, and will be informed by the education process that we
will have to go into when this measure is introduced, of the importance
of retaining the records. As I said to the hon. Lady, this is not a
unique provision; it exists in respect of many other requirements to

Kirkbride:
						</b> Inevitably, the proposed regulations will apply
to very small family businesses in which the keeping of records will
be, by definition, much more burdensome. Although we all understand
that we keep our own tax records, keeping other people&#146;s
information is so much more difficult for a small employer, especially
in the circumstances that I have described. Given that the agency
collecting the contributions will have the records, should the Minister
not think again about whether the widowed lady should keep them for six
years
afterwards?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080129143000272"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> The hon. Lady is slightly over-egging this. It
is not that difficult to keep the records that are required in this
case. As I have tried to say, we will ensure that the regulations are
not over-burdensome. We want to make absolutely sure that the
information 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>is very straightforward and simple. I do not accept that it will be
significantly burdensome, as I think the hon. Lady said, to retain
records of this type, even for small employers. From my knowledge of
small employers, they are already retaining quite a lot of information.
This will not be a completely new and isolated requirement that is
imposed on them. It will not be much out of line with requirements that
they are already fulfilling. I want to stress that we are trying to
make this straightforward for employers, including small employers,
since they would be holding the information in the format that the
regulator needs. The common standards of holding information will also
make things easier, because the employers will understand what they
have to hold and how they have to hold it. The regulator, on receiving
the information, could judge more easily whether the employers in
question have or have not been
compliant.</div>
					<a name="080129143000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations, which set out the details of the record-keeping duties,
will of course be subject to consultation. Those covered by the
regulations will have every opportunity to give their views on how the
regulations should be set out. We recognise that the intention of the
amendment is to give employers flexibility in how they keep the
required records, but it would give too much flexibility, with no
boundaries, which is what we intend the regulations to prescribe.
Furthermore, as tabled, the amendment would conflict with the power in
clause 40(1). That subsection gives the Secretary of State the power to
specify the forms in which records must be kept. The amendment would
allow employers to choose for themselves how to keep their records, so
long as it was somehow in keeping with the concept of reasonableness.
On those grounds, I hope that the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire will agree to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Selous:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister. The amendment was
probing. The debate has been useful, not least for the contribution of
my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove, who raised some real issues,
particularly about sole traders and unincorporated businesses, where
there are small family issues. Think about where, if the premises have
gone, the widow keeps all the documents. Are they to go up in the loft
or something? There is perhaps a need for some further consultation
with very small business organisations on such issues&#151;perhaps
the records could be lodged in some central place, so that the widow
would not have to keep them in her own home, if her husband&#146;s
business no longer exists. There are some practical issues like that.
However, I have accepted the points that the Minister made. I am
grateful to him for the explanations. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div>

that has to be guarded against, that perhaps at some future time
employees of the Pensions Regulator might be so exasperated by one
employer that they might place demands&#151;of when and where someone
come before them&#151;that were not reasonable. Only a small point,
but this will be the law of the land when it goes through.
&#147;Reasonable&#148; appears further on in the clause and could

Rowen:
						</b> I just wanted to ask the Minister whether there is
a discontinuity between subsections (1) and (2) and subsection (3), and
between the compliance regime in the Bill and provisions in the
Pensions Act 2004. In particular, I picked up on the word
&#147;inspector&#148; in subsection (3). Everything before that
point is talking about the regulator, the regulator requiring
information and compliance notices being issued&#151;all very light
touch&#151;and yet in subsection (3) the Bill suddenly goes back and
uses parts of the 2004 Act, talking about regulators and entering
premises, all of which implies a heavy gang from Her Majesty&#146;s
Revenue and Customs suddenly turning up to grab the records to find out
why somebody has not been paying. That is at variance with what this
chapter is attempting to do in terms of getting a light-touch
compliance regime that is easy to operate and which has penalties that
are easy to
understand.</div>
					<a name="080129143000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather
than using sections of the 2004 Act, should we not ensure that those
are amended to be more in tune with the rest of the Bill? Subsections
(1) and (2) seem different from what has been proposed beforehand. Who
are the inspectors? That is not the language that is used elsewhere in
the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="080129143000276"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I appreciate hon.
Members&#146; contributions. The short answer, on which I shall
expand a little bit more in a moment, is that clause 41 makes
alterations to the 2004 Act and therefore incorporates the same
language and terminology in it. We cannot revisit that Act. The simpler
way of inserting into the Bill the essential powers that we must have
is to take them from the 2004 Act. However, the two powers in the
clause should be regarded as backstop powers to be used for extreme 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>purposes, where there is non-compliance. They have to be included
because not to have them would leave the regulator disarmed in certain
circumstances and I do not think that the Committee would want that to
be so. As I have just outlined, clause 41 amends section 72 of the 2004
Act. The amendment would force the regulator to ensure that such
meetings as are indicated take place at a reasonable time and
place.</div>
					<a name="080129143000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
the intention of the amendment and understand the principle behind it,
but it should be remembered that the regulator will require people to
meet it only in exceptional circumstances. If the regulator is of the
opinion that an employer is not complying or may not comply with their
duties, it will need the appropriate powers to conduct further
investigations. It will also need sufficient flexibility in the
legislation to be able to implement processes that will ensure that it
meets its objectives in an effective and efficient
manner.</div>
					<a name="080129143000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inserting the
word &#147;reasonable&#148; where the amendment would insert it
could make the powers unworkable. It is almost certain that instances
will arise in which there are differences of opinion between the
regulator and the person required to attend about what is a reasonable
time and place to meet. We do not want to hinder those important
powers. I hope that with that explanation the hon. Gentleman will agree
to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Selous:
						</b> These things are always more complicated than they
appear on the surface. I heard the Minister&#146;s explanation. There
could be a counter-argument that might prevent the powers being
inserted into the 2004
Act.</div>
					<a name="080129143000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I just hope that
the Minister takes my general point that we expect the powers that are
given to the regulator to be exercised in a reasonable manner.
Requiring someone to appear at 7 in the morning would clearly be
unreasonable. Requiring them to appear somewhere far away from their
business location would be unreasonable. I hope that those concerns
will be in the minds of the regulator and the Government when the
provisions become
law.</div>
					<a name="080129143000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that the
intentions will be good, and that the regulator has a good record.
However, given the wide scope of the Bill, there is concern about
whether businesses will be treated fairly. I detected that that was the
intention behind what the Minister said, and I hope that we do not have
cause to revisit this
area.</div>
