<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 21, line 10, leave out subsection (2) and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) In section 30(5) of the Finance Act 1999 (which specifies the year in which the children's tax credit is to start) for ``2001–02'' substitute ``2000–01''.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
Mr. Cook, I welcome you back from the weekend and hope that you have had a good time since our previous deliberations.

<P>
The amendment would bring forward by one year the introduction of the children's tax credit. The reason for that is straightforward. When he announced the introduction of the children's tax credit, the Chancellor made it clear that it was to replace the married couples allowance, which ceased to have effect at the end of the last financial year on 4 April 2000. However, the children's tax credit has not been introduced as a replacement. We tabled the amendment to find out from the Minister the reason for that. What will happen this year? Are people to receive no benefit or has an adjustment been made to other benefits that we may not have spotted? After all, this is not an easy year for the average taxpayer. We have had a phasing out of the married couples allowance and of mortgage interest relief at source, which, as I am sure all members of the Committee are aware from their postbags, is just beginning to dawn on the British electorate.

<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): What is beginning to dawn on people is that the 10 pence starting rate in tax is offsetting significantly the change in pay-as-you-earn codes. People are finding that they are not so badly affected as the hon. Gentleman is suggesting.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Well, who are we to quarrel with the starting rate of tax? We have a hiatus of a year. We have had the starting rate of tax this year. We shall have it next year, too, and, I presume, the year after that, but we do not have the children's tax credit this year; nor do we have MIRAS. There will be a year in which nothing will happen at all.

<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> With what did the Conservative party propose to replace the married couples allowance?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am heartened. I was sure that the famed Millbank machine would have at least briefed Labour Back Benchers before they came into Committee. I see that the brief has now been passed to the hon. Lady. It was clear from our manifesto that we would introduce transferable allowances. In 1997, the Conservative manifesto stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We will give priority to future reductions in personal taxation that help families looking after dependent children or relatives by allowing one partner's unused personal allowance to be transferred to a working spouse where they have these responsibilities.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> If the hon. Lady will let me finish reading the quote, she can then start quizzing me on it. As explained in the manifesto,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Around two million one-taxpayer couples with dependent children-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or dependent relatives-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>would gain up to £17.50 a week.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There would be no losers, although 3 million two-taxpayer couples and tax-paying lone parents would not benefit, and the cost would be £1.2 billion.

<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> We would argue that child benefit went up at the time at which married couples allowance was altered. Was 1993 not when the change in the married couples allowance began?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am not sure how far back we want to go. The reductions in married couples allowance began in 1993. In a way, it became a credit rather than a benefit. In one of the hon. Lady's interventions, she asked what we proposed to phase out the married couples allowance with, and I made it clear that that was set out in our manifesto. I am not sure whether that is a sufficient explanation, as she is shaking her head. Perhaps she would like to tell me what is troubling her.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The style of debate is becoming distinctly conversational. We must conform to procedures. Also, we must return to the subject of the amendment. Can we please do so?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am afraid that I have some difficulty discussing the children's tax credit without discussing tax and marriage, as the Chancellor made it clear that the CTC is a replacement for the MCA. I would find it difficult to debate a benefit in isolation without putting it in its context. I defer to your opinions, Mr. Cook, but I would like to make that point.

<P>
The credit is designed to help people. The figures are clear from the explanation of the Budget. The hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) will see, if she glances at page 13 of the Red Book for 1999, that the married couples allowance was worth £2.05 billion when it was abolished, and that the introduction of the children's tax credit from April 2001 will cost £1.4 billion. There is a gap between the phasing out of the married couples allowance and its replacement by the children's tax credit, and the sum is not even similar. There is no benefit whatever this year. If the benefit is considered good for future years, why is it not for this year?

<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> The hon. Gentleman's argument would hold some weight if it were true that there were a straightforward substitution. I have not noticed the hon. Gentleman give a direct quotation to say that there is such a substitution. Is it not the case that other benefits were introduced for children and families when the married couples allowance was changed?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I confess that I have not brought a quotation from the Chancellor with me, as I thought that the fact that the credit was a replacement was such common knowledge. The Financial Secretary will no doubt have heard our exchange and will let us know whether he considers that the children's tax credit is a replacement for the married couples allowance. That may cast some light on the gap. However the matter is considered, the money goes into families' pockets to help families with children, but it is not available this year.

<P>
It is a matter of regret that there is now no recognition of marriage in the tax system. From research, we know that marriage has a beneficial effect on crime rates, strengthens communities, cuts welfare dependency and, I am told, increases happiness. It also provides a psychological benefit for women. I am rather surprised that the party that believes that it has done so much for women is phasing out the recognition and encouragement of marriage in the tax system. Married women with children have far more protection than unmarried women with children.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): My hon. Friend mentions that the Chancellor asserted that the children's tax credit replaced the married couples allowance, and he was challenged on that point. Page 85 of the Red Book states that the children's tax credit
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>will replace the married couple's allowance and its related allowances.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It may have been designed to replace it, but as my hon. Friend correctly pointed out, it will not, because there is a gap of a year and the replacement allowance is much less generous than the one that is being abolished.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am obliged to my right hon. Friend, who has demonstrated that Labour members not only do not know about the Conservative party's policies on marriage, but do not even know about their own party's policies on marriage. I suggest that the quality of briefing be improved before they make such interventions.

<P>
As a replacement of the married couples allowance, the children's tax credit is an important proposal. It is also a means-tested proposal, even though, as we all know, in 1993, the Chancellor said that he would abolish means testing from the benefits system. We have seen a spectacular U-turn on that matter, with all benefits slowly being moved toward means testing. When the Prime Minister said after the general election that he would reduce social security bills, I am not sure that he had in mind reducing the children's tax credit by the sum proposed, which will result in a saving for the Treasury of some £600 million.

<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): Is the hon. Gentleman advising the Government, in introducing the children's tax credit, to increase net spending by £600 million this year, or is he suggesting that it should be compensated for by other tax increases?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I sense the significance behind that intervention: the hon. Gentleman wants to know whether that is an Opposition spending pledge. As our amendment relates only to this year, unless a general election is held before the end of the next financial year, it has no relevance to future spending plans. However, that is the gist of our amendment. Of course the proposal will cost money, and that money will not be available to families. I do not know whether it has dawned on Labour Members that the money involved will be withdrawn from the most needy families.

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I fear that my hon. Friend runs the risk of being churlish in not having acknowledged the great boon that the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) has granted the country, and especially us, by being the first in the history of the Labour party's recorded views on the matter to admit that the children's tax credit, and presumably, therefore, the working families tax credit, too, will constitute public expenditure, notwithstanding the fact that it is so carefully edited in the Red Books as negative taxation rather than public expenditure.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My hon. Friend draws attention to the fact that an advanced degree is necessary to understand the logic of some of the Red Book, with its random, haphazard descriptions and headings that can best be described as spin.

<P>
I shall illustrate with an example my point about the proposal to phase out the MCA this year, but not introduce CTC next year. In the financial year 1999-2000, a one-earner couple who earned £34,000 a year would have paid income tax at the basic rate of 23 per cent. As a result of the abolition of the MCA, the couple would be brought into the 40 per cent., higher-rate tax bracket in 2001. In 2001-02, the couple would be eligible for the children's tax credit, but it would be withdrawn from them because they were paying the higher rate of tax. I want to probe that issue when we come to the stand part debate. The credit is withdrawn at the rate of £1 for every £15, which gives a penal 47 per cent. tax rate. In the space of two years, that family's marginal tax rate might double without there being any increase in their earnings. That could affect up to 1 million people.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Kali Mountford:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. He said earlier that he was concerned about low-earner families with children, but his argument now is about the tapering of taxation at the upper end of earnings. How does that help poor families?

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It depends what you call a poor family. The credit is introduced at the lower end, but starts to taper when it hits the higher rate of taxation and is added on to child benefit. You may feel that this subject would be better debated under stand part, Mr. Cook. The taper of CTC is integrated with national insurance contributions. The system of integrated tax credits and child benefits, contrasted with a non-means-tested child benefit, is fiendishly complicated. I am not surprised that the hon. Lady has difficulty understanding it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Perhaps I might help the hon. Lady by making the following point. Let us imagine that a single mother with one child, on modest earnings of £200 a week, marries a man on identical earnings. After the removal of MCA and the introduction of WFTC, those two people will end up paying £67 a week more tax as a couple than they did when they were living apart. Is that penalty on marriage not of some significance for those on low earnings?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. Let us compare that flaw or anomaly in the proposals with the following one. CTC is given to the highest earner in the family; if that earner earns £40,000 a year, the family do not get the credit because it begins to taper out at £32,000, and is not given to those who earn more than £36,000. If two people in the family earn £30,000 a year, making a family income of £60,000, the highest earner qualifies for the CTC, so the family receive it. Therefore, a family on £60,000 may qualify, although a family on £40,000 may not. What is the logic of the proposal? The benefit is muddled, has done nothing to recognise marriage and has left a hiatus.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bill Rammell </B>(Harlow): I follow the hon. Gentleman's arguments with interest. If the CTC is so fundamentally flawed in principle, why is he arguing that it should be brought forward to 2000-01?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The hon. Gentleman must wait for the stand part debate-that is all I can say. The measure is perverse, but we will not vote against it after the stand part debate. The Conservative party is not in the business of denying benefits to families, either this year or next year. However, the benefits system has become unbelievably complicated, given the gap year and the anomaly whereby the credit may be awarded to a family with £60,000, but not to a family with £40,000. That credit does not recognise marriage and is not a replacement for the married couples allowance. It is a step towards the alleged aim of improving the benefits system, which is not working. I believe that the Minister will confirm that it will in any event be phased out in 2003 and replaced by integrated child credit.

<P>
<B>Mr. Roger Casale </B>(Wimbledon): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have been perorating on the amendment for about five minutes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to be implying that families, particularly working families and families on low incomes, will be worse off in the round, in terms of tax, this year than last year. If he takes into account the increases in child benefit, the child care component of working families tax credit and the 10 pence starting rate of tax, does he still think that working families, and poor families in particular, are worse off under this year's regime than last?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The hon. Gentleman wants to get into debate about whether families are better off this year than last-there may be some benefits for someone who does not smoke, drink, drive a car or have a mortgage. There was a benefit last year in the married couples allowance, but that is being abolished by the Chancellor. Working families tax credit was given last year and this year and will be given next year, and children's tax credit will be given next year-but not this year. Child benefit is on a flat rate-it was given last year and this year and will be given next year-and is not means tested.

<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> The hon. Gentleman acknowledges that families are better off this year as a result of the changes that have been made. Perhaps I can help his argument, which seems to be that families, working families and families on lower incomes are better off this year than last year and next year will be even better off. That is why people want to keep the Government in power for as long as they can.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I suggest that the hon. Gentleman starts listening to his constituents. If he thinks that they are better off this year than last year, he has got another think coming. Since 1997, the burden of taxation on the average family has gone up by £670 a year. Those are not Opposition figures; they are independently verified figures confirmed by the Library. There is no way that the Government can say that they have stuck to their pledge not to raise taxes. They have raised taxes and the consequences of that are becoming apparent, particularly this year with the phasing out of the MCA, as well as MIRAS, and given that other benefits are not coming into play until next year. That is the rationale behind our amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I serve notice on the Committee that I have been lenient, in view of the appeal that was made, and have allowed a fair range of arguments. However, when it comes to clause stand part, I shall take the view that the debate has already taken place.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I hope not to detain the Committee for long. The amendment had been tabled in my name and those of my hon. Friends. The title of this morning's debate could be ``Little red riding hood has a visitor''. The only question is who is the visitor. If one listens to the hon. Member for Colne Valley, one would assume that the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) was the visitor intent on doing mischief to little red riding hood. If one looks at documents produced by the Government and the business and transport section of the Library, one might form a view that the visitor was the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Library briefing paper stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The abolition of the MCA, and its replacement with a tax credit given to parents, is part of a wider reform in the system of child support, first announced by the Chancellor  in his March 1998 Budget.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In that Budget statement, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Giving a child the best start in life takes more than money, but it cannot be done without money.-[Official Report, 17 March 1998; Vol. 308, c. 1107.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I want the Government, including the Financial Secretary, to explain the missing £1.4 billion-the net saving as a result of the abolition of the married couples allowance and the failure to introduce the child support provisions for a year.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rammell:</B> I understand that the hon. Gentleman is arguing, as are the Conservatives, that the introduction of the change should be brought forward. Can I ask whether that change was costed in the Liberal Democrat alternative Budget?

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The hon. Gentleman can certainly ask. If he looks carefully, he will find that his point is covered.
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Rammell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I shall just respond to the point. If it is part of Labour Members' argument that the Government cannot afford it, I would be happy to engage in that dialogue. I would point out, as the hon. Member for Croydon, South did, that we are discussing not a continuing increase in Government expenditure but maintaining the current level of benefit support and expenditure. A Treasury saving is built into the proposals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rammell:</B> The point that I was trying to make was that this debate requires honesty about where the money will be raised and how it will be spent. Will the hon. Gentleman therefore confirm that bringing forward the children's tax credit was not costed in the Liberal Democrat alternative Budget? It is therefore a dishonest proposition to put to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> No, it is not dishonest, although I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that that figure does not appear in the alternative Budget. If he looks at the full range of Liberal Democrat proposals-which you might not be happy for me to develop as part of my argument, Mr. Cook-he will recognise areas of expenditure and saving that are not part of this Finance Bill. It is not my purpose to move the Liberal Democrat alternative Budget. It would be delightful if you were to permit me to do so, Mr. Cook, and no doubt hon. Members would want to table amendments. My point is that the Government have set the context for the Finance Bill in relation to children and families, and have decided to withdraw £1.4 billion. That money was being paid into the system and used to support married couples and their families but will not be for the next 12 months. The purpose of the amendment is to restore that missing £1.4 billion.

<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> May I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Government spent a great deal of money last year? When MCA was withdrawn, they introduced new money for families with children. How would he identify those families, this year, who would be entitled to the new allowance? Who would he give it to, and how would he find them?

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> One argument is that the level of benefit is being sustained, and that there is no missing £1.4 billion. Labour Members have used that argument, at least by inference, in their interventions. As I was about to say, I want to hear the Government justify, with figures, the assertion made from the Labour Back Benches-that, if the changes are netted off, the amount of money being spent on families and children has not fallen. A second argument is that, administratively, the people who need the help cannot be found. Clearly, if that is the Government's argument, the married couples allowance should have been continued until the new system was ready to take over. It is outrageous to leave families and children all over the country in the lurch simply because the administrative procedures are not in place to ensure that the Inland Revenue paperwork is right.

<P>
Will the Financial Secretary explain clearly the reason for the gap? Is the gap the result of some so-called justification that other benefits have filled the gap or is it the result of administrative convenience? Do the Government know the reason? It has been expressed that families are better off this year and that they will be even better off next year. Such a statement needs careful examination. In subsequent years, the reduction in married couples allowance will be significantly higher than the increase that is proposed. However, we are willing to accept the argument that the increase in child benefits and other allowances may bridge the gap.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
We remain deeply sceptical that the gap has been properly bridged this year. Call me a cynic, but if families are better off this year and the £1.4 billion will improve their financial position next year, it is a little surprising that the Chancellor has not made more of that £1.4 billion improvement. So far, his words strongly suggest that we shall not see an improvement until the new system is in place. We have a gap year and the amendment would close it. It has now been hinted that the gap may be more to do with administrative convenience than with the well-being of families and children.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I am not advancing the argument that administrative convenience is the reason for the gap. I am trying to find out to whom the allowance would apply under the amendment, and how we would find the people and ensure that they were appropriately and properly treated.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> If the Financial Secretary were minded to accept amendment No. 65, the hon. Member for Croydon, South and I would be more than happy to help him with consequential amendments to ensure that the scheme came into force in an appropriate way. We have not yet heard the Government's argument in response to the amendment. I am sceptical about it and I doubt whether it can be made successfully, but I shall listen to it with great interest.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): The hon. Member for Colne Valley made a most interesting intervention when she asked sundry questions about where the allowance would go. I do not want to disappoint her, but she will find the answer on page 11 of ``The modernisation of Britain's tax and benefit system No. 6'', which was published by the Treasury in March 2000. Chart 2.4 displays by income decile in the United Kingdom the effects of where the Government would like to be in terms of the measure by 2001. Unless there are dramatic changes to the income distribution in this country, the table gives the hon. Lady precisely the answer that she seeks, except that the amendment would bring such matters forward by one year. I cannot understand the mystery story that she related to us, which was that, by advancing the introduction of the benefit by one year, it would suddenly leave us not knowing to whom it should be distributed.

<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> We ask taxpayers to fill in their tax returns and deal with matters appropriately, but we do ask them to do so in a matter of weeks. Is it not proper to find out who the appropriate people are and deal with their tax matters?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Government seem to have identified clearly to whom the proposal is aimed; otherwise, they would not have introduced it. When people have an opportunity to have their tax burden relieved, most of them will move quickly. The hon. Lady's argument falls, because those who sometimes require help through the social security system manage to fill in forms with remarkable rapidity. Therefore, if the Government had bothered to set out the terms of the scheme a year earlier, those who would have sought assistance from it would have had no difficulty in acquiring the necessary money.

<P>
I want to follow up the interesting point raised by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell). He effectively asked the Financial Secretary to break down the details of the spending of the £1.4 billion from the reduction of married couples allowance and other matters. Knowing the way in which baseline expenditure works in the Treasury, I do not believe that anyone would allege that Conservative Members, in opposition, are talking about additional moneys to be spent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The phasing out of the MCA this year has saved £2 billion; £1.4 billion is the cost of introducing the tax credit next year.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that correction. The Financial Secretary owes the Committee a meticulous explanation of how the moneys have been disbursed. Due to the annual reluctance of the Treasury to answer a parliamentary question originally tabled in 1981 by the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), now the Home Secretary, it has been extremely difficult to answer challenges from Labour members about who would be the winners and losers under the proposals made by my hon. Friend the member for Croydon, South. The right hon. Member for Blackburn asked for a breakdown by income decile of each of the then taxes, credits and benefits, so that, taking direct and indirect tax together, a more complete picture could be produced. Therefore, challenges as to the efficacy of our proposals could be answered in Hansard.

<P>
Now that the government are in power, they have decided that that is all too difficult. When I was at the Treasury, my Government had problems about sometimes having to disclose uncomfortable information.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Although the right hon. Gentleman may have had uncomfortable experiences as a member of the team at the Treasury, will he confirm that he voted for the start of the phasing out of the married couples allowance? Does he regret that?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I was going to deal with that in detail. I wanted to increase the discomfort on the Government Benches about the fact that the subject was raised without consideration of certain key facts. I shall conclude my point first.

<P>
If the Government were prepared to announce today that they would re-answer the question asked by the right hon. Member for Blackburn, if it were tabled in its original 1981 form, we would be in a much better position to respond to some of the challenges and arguments that have been made against the proposals by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. The Treasury's lack of candour and its unwillingness to answer questions about the impact of direct and indirect changes and the tax credit on different income groups makes it extremely difficult to have an informed debate.

<P>
I shall pick up on the points made in the recent intervention and by the hon. Member for Colne Valley. She was talking about the tax year 1993-94. She should bear in mind that the public sector current receipts figure as a percentage of gross domestic product was then 35.9 per cent. The same figure for the current tax year is up to 39.7 per cent. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South made the point in monetary terms, and I put it in terms of gross domestic product. Whatever happens, families already bear a considerable extra tax burden.

<P>
The lack of data available to us makes it difficult to engage in a more detailed argument about the questions that the hon. Member for Colne Valley very properly asks. We do not know what the impact may be. I return to table 2.4 of the Government's document, in which they tell us about the gains that will arise by 2001. However, we are left in the dark about the gap year-as it has been called-which the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South would fill. If Government receipts-taxes and other costs borne by the taxpayer-are rising overall, the families who fall into the gap left by the phasing out of the married couples allowance will be worse off. That is my conclusion, which I draw from the overall figures in Red Book, and the Government have offered no definitive proof to the contrary. If they want to justify their argument, they need to give us the impact study occasioned by the parliamentary question asked by the right hon. Member for Blackburn, instead of simply producing monetary figures. That would help us all.

<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Is it true that the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) regrets that a provision for families was not introduced when MCA was phased out in 1993? Does the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) recognise that there has been a significant increase in family incomes? There has been a generous increase in child benefit and in the range of benefits alongside it, notwithstanding the changes in PAYE. Families will field the benefits that are received as well as the tax that must be paid. Should he not consider that?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The hon. Lady is confusing the change in the value of the married couples allowance with the phasing out of that allowance, which is the policy that she asserts was behind that change. There is a significant difference between those two things. Although I do not have to hand the details that would enable me to respond to all that the hon. Lady said, I can tell her that we increased child benefit and made changes to family credit.

<P>
As was the case with the previous argument, unless we can take the entire package and consider it as a whole, we are in the dark. Evidently, however, there is a gap. Families with children who were beneficiaries of the married couples allowance will be bereft of support for a year. Some of them will be affected by changes in mortgage interest relief at source.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman asserting that the changes made in 1993 did not phase out the married couples allowance but merely adjusted its value, which was compensated for by other factors?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I assert clearly that there was an adjustment of its value in the light of the fiscal circumstances. [Laughter.] It is all very well for jollity to break out among Labour Members, but they have not been listening to what their constituents say. For many of those constituents, the penny is dropping about the tax costs of the Government. As the Red Book conclusively shows, the overall level of Government receipts was four percentage points lower in the 1993-94 tax year than it is now. No family in the land could escape that. The less well-off are being penalised the hardest by the changes to indirect taxation made by the Government of which the hon. Gentleman is a Member, owing to the regressive nature of those taxes. He has the temerity to attack me because, for fiscal reasons, we made a change to the value of the tax allowance. However, the people that he seeks to help are those who, in overall terms, bear the extra tax burden.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I certainly would not want to attack the right hon. Gentleman; I am a humble seeker after truth. To what does he attribute his disagreement with the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks, who said in a speech in January 1998:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We were wrong to start phasing out the Married Couple's Allowance without at least replacing it with an allowance focussed on families with children?<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> As always, people make comments with the benefit of hindsight. I was specifically considering 1993, like the hon. Member for Colne Valley. If, five years later, someone makes a particular comment, I would have to examine the context more carefully. The hon. Member for Broxtowe selectively quoted one sentence of what was probably a longer speech. Had thought developed from that point, I should have been happy to discuss it with him. However, you, Mr. Cook, have been extremely generous in allowing us to wander into wider territory than the specific point of the amendment, and I do not believe that, especially at this juncture, you would want me to have a long debate about the married couples allowance.

<P>
A gap will exist, and the tax burden for families will increase. We do not know the full impact because Treasury Ministers refuse point blank to answer a question that they were happy to have answered in full when they were members of the Opposition. They now shy away from the harsh light of truth on their tax policies by not answering that question. If we had answers, we might all be better informed and able to understand whether the Financial Secretary will make any sense.

<P>

<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> To summarise the Conservatives' argument for the amendment, it is unfortunate that we should be abolishing the married couples allowance, which they started to phase out. Conservative Members accept that families will benefit from the children's tax credit, and would like to spend £600 million on introducing it this year. They are not interested in the shadow Chancellor's comments that net expenditure in the Budget is already at a level that could cause an increase in interest rates-

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I shall finish my summary of the position, and the right hon. Gentleman may subsequently clarify it if he so wishes.

<P>
Conservative Members also seem to be arguing that the married couples allowance should be reintroduced. However, it is not entirely clear whether an equivalent for single parents would also be introduced. In short, the Conservative position seems to be all over the shop.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I give way to two hon. Members.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Every member of the Committee, whether right hon. or hon., is experienced in the procedures of the House. To whom is the hon. Member for Broxtowe giving way?

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I was giving way to the right hon. Member for Fylde.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned expenditure of £600 million. Could he tell me in detail about the disbursements of the £2 billion associated with the saving resulting from the phasing out of the married couples allowance? Is the £600 million to which he refers net extra expenditure or tax forgone? What happened to that £2 billion? The hon. Gentleman seems to be all over the place on the matter.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> The figure of £600 million is taken from the comments of the hon. Member for Croydon, South about the additional cost of the amendment. We can argue until the cows come home about whether it constitutes reduced tax or increased expenditure. I am not worried about that, and neither is the public.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> The right hon. Gentleman should allow me to finish answering his earlier point before he makes a new one.

<P>
The Opposition are criticising the Government for allegedly allowing interest rates to rise as a result of an over-generous Budget while simultaneously demanding that the terms of the Budget be worsened by £600 million. When the right hon. Gentleman addressed the point earlier, he said airily that he assumed that I was considering future spending commitments, whereas the Committee is discussing this year. I am not considering future spending commitments; I am considering this year. The Conservative stance on the Budget and the amendment is inconsistent.

<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Is my hon. Friend, like me, pleased that the money from the phasing out of MCA was used to pay for the 10 pence starting rate of tax, the reduction in the basic rate from 23 pence to 22 pence, the increase in child benefit and the increased element in the working families tax credit? Do those measures not benefit families?

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I shall finish my point first. It was only fear of you, Mr. Cook, that made me hesitate to introduce those additional points, which answer the hon. Gentleman's question about how the money was spent. If he wished, we could go through the entire Budget in that way, but I am not sure that you would allow it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> To follow up the intervention by the hon. Member for Colne Valley, is it not the case that some of the money did not go to families with children?

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> If we consider the overall Budget, we can no doubt explore the impact on each type of family-deep sea divers, air pilots and so on. However, that might be out of order. Clearly, married couples benefit from this package of measures. It would be possible, under the amendment, for them to benefit even more. However, that would cost an additional £600 million, which the Conservative party, with its other hat on, described as reckless.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The hon. Gentleman is discussing four points, which, he claims, show that Conservative policy is confused. First, he said that we thought that the phasing out of the married couples allowance was unfortunate. There is no doubt that we agree with him on that. Secondly, he said that the amendment would cost money; of that, there is no doubt. Thirdly, he said that we were arguing that the change should be brought forward to this year, which is also true. Clearly, if money is handed out, it is beneficial. Finally, he said that we were vague about whether we would recognise marriage in the tax system in the future. I should leave him in no doubt that a future Conservative Government would recognise marriage in the tax and benefits system.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his slightly vague illumination. It would be nice to know whether the Conservatives specifically proposed to restore the MCA and its associated credit for single parents. Alas, that is beyond the remit of our discussion. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's confirmation that he wishes to worsen the Budget's balance of tax and expenditure by the amount stated. I note that he continues not to explain the discrepancy between that and the Leader of the Opposition's comments in response to the Budget speech.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> In relation to the comments made by the hon. Member for Broxtowe, it is important that the Committee understands the nature of the dispute. The removal of the married couples allowance, allied to the introduction of various other measures-including, a year later, CTC-will have an average effect and a marginal effect. Labour Members have concentrated on the average effect. As my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South pointed out, it is difficult to determine the effect on different classes of people with different incomes, partly because the Treasury has been opaque about the impact-consciously and intentionally, I think, although whether that opaqueness is by omission or on purpose is a separate issue-and partly because it is genuinely complicated to determine the impact, given the complexity of the different measures. However, the marginal effect is crystal clear. The specific case that I described can apply to many people on very modest incomes. The effect of the combination of measures will impose a significant penalty-not £2 or 50 pence, but £67 a week on a couple who earn £400 a week and who choose to marry or cohabit, when they have a child. That is a mistaken public policy-not one, I am sure, that the Government intended, but one that they are bringing about.

<P>
The Financial Secretary may tell us that, contrary to those calculations, which come from the Library, those who choose to marry or get together to provide a child with two parents will be subject to a significant penalty. It would be interesting to hear such a denial. However, if he accepts the facts, we have a problem. It is not worth trading political insults about who was to blame for the problem. Our party has grown up sufficiently to admit that we were at the beginning of the problem by partially reducing the married couples allowance. We feel no shame about that; we have admitted our mistake. We want to move on and adopt the right policy rather than engage in political banter.

<P>
I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde that a fiscal reason was behind our action, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South said, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks, the Leader of the Opposition, has made no bones about the fact that, in retrospect we realise that, however good that fiscal reason may have been, the penalty effect was bad. As my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South said, we want a clear reintroduction of some recognition of marriage in the tax system. The measure that we are discussing is not merely a non-recognition of that but an anti-recognition. It is a penalty system for those who currently live apart, but who decide to live together when they have children.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> In the earlier part of his speech, the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) was careful to bracket together married couples and those who cohabit and said that the impact on them was similar. Does he recommend that the changes should apply equally to married couples and those who cohabit? If so, is that Conservative party policy?

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> That is an interesting question, but not one that is relevant to our discussions. It must be of little controversy between Opposition and Labour Members that, if a measure penalises both those who live together and those who are married, something must be wrong with it.

<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument. Is he saying that, when a family is in receipt of income support, the whole household income should not be taken into account? He seems to be saying that people should be dealt with as though they are two individuals rather as a single household. Would he extend that argument to those on income support, for example? I do not understand the argument that he is advancing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am glad that the Financial Secretary is now joining in the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South said that when there was a large-scale and administratively confused introduction of a series of measures, some of which were non-means tested, into an already complex tax and benefit system, the effect of the incentives was often unforeseen and sometimes, as in this case, disastrously misconceived. I am not saying that we can get rid of every means-tested benefit overnight. The right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) started out with the noble ambition, which was widely supported on both sides of the House, of trying to reduce the amount of means testing. That project collapsed. By introducing the measure in place of MCA-I have not yet come to the fact that it is delayed by a year-the Financial Secretary is creating, together with the other measures that he is introducing, a concatenation of benefit and tax changes that will have an effect on such people as a couple who are not on income support. So they should not be caught in the terrible trap in which we all know that people at the lowest end of the income scale are caught, whereby if they choose to get married or live together, they are clobbered by the removal of a large amount of benefit or, if the Treasury insists on the redefinition, by a huge tax increase.

<P>

<B>Kali Mountford:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wants to make an incentive for marriage, at what rate he would reintroduce MCA? Would it be at the original rate or at the rate of-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am interested in listening to a Third Reading debate, but not now. I ask members of the Committee to focus their attention a little more sharply on the children's tax credit. I have been lenient so far, but my patience is diminishing rather rapidly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> You have indeed been lenient, Mr. Cook. I shall move to the precise question of the gap year, which is what we should be debating. The hon. Member for Broxtowe asserted that it was irresponsible for both Opposition parties to point out, through the amendment, an anomaly because by doing so we were somehow suggesting that an additional fiscal loosening of about £600 million should be brought into the Budget judgment this year. The hon. Gentleman is concerned-as am I-with proper public administration and sensible Budget judgments, so I wish to put his mind at rest by telling him that it is not and has never been our position, as my right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor and others have made clear in a series of statements, that there should have been further fiscal loosening. On the contrary, although we do not think that massive fiscal loosening occurred, it was perhaps unfortunate at a time when there probably should have been counter-cyclical tightening.

<P>
So it is not part of our proposition that this measure should not be matched by a counter-balancing measure. It is in the nature of a Finance Bill that it is discussed clause by clause and amendment by amendment. We are pointing out a simple anomaly. The Government said that they would offset-they did not have to do so-the removal of the MCA by something called the children's tax credit. That offsetting element is bizarre, partly because it occurs a year later, for reasons that none of us have been able to determine, and partly because it is not a genuine substitute because it does not have the same incentive effect. Something odd is therefore going on.

<P>
We are narrowly focused on why the measure is a year late. It has been suggested that the reason for that is an administrative one. No one could have managed to introduce it in a way that would have worked in this Budget. I am sure that if, contrary to my expectations, the Financial Secretary had a road to Damascus experience, accepted the amendment and promised today to introduce the children's tax credit a year earlier, considerable administrative difficulties would follow. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South will agree that this is a probing amendment to bring to light an anomaly rather than to propose a measure that should be introduced immediately. There is however a ready remedy, which is not to introduce the measure that the Treasury says that it is offsetting-the abolition of the MCA. That is not an administrative problem, as I am sure that Inland Revenue officials could confirm to anyone who asked. The MCA could be restored tomorrow, making taxpayers throughout the country happy. To say that there is an administrative difficulty is not an argument for the gap year. There never needed to be an administrative difficulty or a gap year, and the MCA could have continued. That leaves us asking why it was decided to phase out one before introducing the other, and then to say that the two were part of the same scheme.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I always admire the hon. Gentleman's honesty, and am grateful for his acceptance that the proposal to increase the Budget commitment by £600 million would need to be balanced by savings or tax increases elsewhere. Will he give the same assurance for his suggestion that the MCA could be reinstated? Does he suggest that the taxpayer should be asked to pay an equivalent sum elsewhere?

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Of course, if the Government decided to retain the MCA and if the position that they set out in the Budget judgment was already rather lax, it flows that the last thing that they should have done was to leave everything else intact. No doubt they could have saved £600 million on their administrative budget or some other piece of expenditure. It is not the business of the Opposition to work out how the Government arrive at the right Budget judgment or how they implement it. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is true that the proposal would need to be matched.

<P>
Why have the Government introduced the gap year? The question is complicated. I do not suppose that I am alone in Committee, and I may be in the great majority, in not having the foggiest clue what the plans are for the children's tax credit. I confess that I do not understand what is happening to the working families tax credit, why it is to be removed shortly after being introduced, how the children's tax credit relates to the integrated child benefit or how all those things coming and going will collectively impact on families. I suspect that no member of the Committee has yet worked those things out, with the possible exception of the Financial Secretary, who has a lightning brain. I assume that the child credit has been delayed by a year because months ago, when one could have imagined that it could be introduced this year, neither the Treasury nor the Inland Revenue could work out how to implement it any earlier.

<P>
The Financial Secretary may tell us that that is not true, and that the Economic Secretary was wrong. I give her the benefit of the doubt. Let us assume that she is right, and that the Treasury and the Inland Revenue, with all their tremendous resources, could not work out how to implement the benefit on time and in schedule with their proclaimed desire to make it match or offset the MCA removal. Does that not tell us something significant about what the Treasury calls the tax credit and I call the benefit? It is so complex that, even some months before the Budget in which it was announced, and knowing that it was coming, the Treasury and the Inland Revenue could not work out how to implement it in time to make it replace what they say that it should replace. Is there a precedent for something so complicated that it cannot be introduced on time according to the Government's own schedule? If there is, I cannot remember it. At the least, it is an exceptional occurrence.

<P>
The Financial Secretary needs to enter the debate head-on and tell us what we have not yet been told. He needs to say what is about the structure of the children's tax credit that makes it so complicated. No amount of talk about fiscal loosening and tightening will help, as that could have been dealt with in all sorts of other ways. At the root, there must be some huge administrative problem.

<P>
When the Financial Secretary has explained what that problem is, we shall all be a great deal clearer about the nature of the children's tax credit. We may also begin to understand why something that has been phased in a year late is, if I have understood correctly, to be phased out two years later. To introduce something a year late because it is complex is a forgiveable error, but to do so only to phase it out two years later begins to seem like carelessness. I hope that the Financial Secretary will give us a clue to explain that peculiar set of gyrations, which is what we, along with the Liberal Democrats, are trying to elicit through the medium of the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I shall briefly add to the line that my hon. Friend has taken. My understanding is that the problem with the children's tax credit relates to the fact that eligibility will depend on both partners' incomes, which may result in administrative nightmares. For example, in my own case, my wife has a modest income and receives the existing, standard child benefit. Although she would seem to be entitled to the new benefit, on examining my tax affairs the Revenue would find that my income was such that I was not entitled to it. I do not understand how the Revenue will be able efficiently to consider both partners or spouses.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We have had an interesting and revealing debate. I am especially grateful to my hon. Friends for their effective and incisive interventions, which have been revealing-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind hon. Members that I am partially deaf, apart from which, procedure demands that remarks be addressed to the Chair.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Cook. I shall ensure that my remarks are addressed to you. I wanted to place on the record my thanks to my hon. Friends for contributing to some revealing exchanges.

<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South had a difficult task in moving the amendment, hinting, as became clearer in a later intervention, that he favoured the married couples allowance. However, clearly he could not go too far down that road, as most of the married couples allowance was abolished by the previous Government-indeed, by the current shadow Chancellor, as Chief Secretary, who said at the time, discussing in Committee the fact that the married couples allowance was to be drastically cut:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have considered the tax system and chosen the allowances that appear to have the least ongoing justification or to be the most anomalous.-[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 22 February 1994; c. 348.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was the view of the present shadow Chancellor.

<P>
As ever, the hon. Member for West Dorset helpfully conceded that in that respect the previous Government were wrong and made mistakes. Last week, he helpfully attacked the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), who was not present, for introducing the landfill tax. Another member of the Committee, the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), had my job when the decisions about the married couples allowance were being made. Sadly, the right hon. Member for Charnwood is absent from our deliberations this morning, so he cannot respond to the attacks made on him by the hon. Member for West Dorset. The Opposition Front Bench has a difficult task in this debate.

<P>
The children's tax credit is part of a package of tax and benefit reforms to improve support for families with children. The timing of the various elements has been carefully considered to balance good management of public finances with the needs of families on the lowest incomes. Taken as a whole, the package will result in an extra £7 billion a year being spent on support for children by April 2001. The composition of that figure is detailed in a pie chart on page 87 of the Red Book.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Financial Secretary cited an additional figure of £7 billion for the measure that he outlined. Will he break down what additional taxes those who receive the £7 billion will have to pay, so that we can understand the net effect of the proposals?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The figure of £7 billion is explained on page 87 of the Red Book. I shall go into more detail later about what is happening to the money that was attached to the married couples allowances. Our priority is to help families with children.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have glanced at the pie chart on page 87, which applies from April 2001 and includes £1.8 billion for children's tax credit. The pie chart for this year has a slice missing from it.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall come in a moment to how we are phasing in the package and building up to such a substantial amount of additional support for families with children. Our priority is to reach those families on the lowest incomes first. We have already implemented record increases in child benefit, which are worth £15 a week for the eldest child and £10 for the other children, which is a 26 per cent. increase in real terms since 1997.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Financial Secretary say what increases in either national or local taxes, direct or indirect, have been borne by families who have been the beneficiaries of the increases in child benefit, so that I can understand the net effect on their budgets?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> All families with children who receive child benefit have benefited from the increase in that benefit. It is paid universally. The overall tax burden on families is at a low level-the lowest level since about 1972.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, I want to answer some of the points that have been raised in the debate.

<P>
We are also raising the child elements in the working families tax credit by a further £4.35 a week in June, with a matching rise in income support in October. Together, those measures will promote fairness and ensure that help is given first to families who need it most.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Financial Secretary continues to outline in some detail who will be the beneficiaries of various cash increases. If he cannot give me the detail, can he confirm that those who have benefited from the sums that he has so far outlined to the Committee have not in any way, shape or form, since 1997, paid out any extra taxes as a result of the actions of the Government?


<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We are improving the support for families with children, the priority being for those on the lowest incomes. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove asked what had happened to the £1.4 billion that is being gained in the current financial year as a result of the abolition of the married couples allowance. There was some discussion about that figure, but the hon. Gentleman's figure is correct and it is referred to on page 157 of the Red Book. We have increased substantially support for families with children through the working families tax credit, through the increase in the children's premium income support and through child benefit. Those three measures that will come into effect this financial year and which were announced at the same time as the abolition of the married couples allowance, add up to a little more than £1.4 billion. In other words, we have used a slightly larger sum to go directly to families with children, especially to help those families on the lowest income.

<P>
There will be a further substantial boost of £1.6 billion for families with children next year through the introduction of the children's tax credit, which together with other measures, adds up to £7 billion of support. That reflects the clear priority that the Government have given to tackling the problem of child poverty and helping families with children. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer set out the Government's ambition to halve the number of children who grow up in poverty during the coming decade, as a step on the way to the Prime Minister's goal of eradicating child poverty within 20 years. That is a major commitment, which we are delivering through a range of measures, including the one under discussion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Financial Secretary tell us whether it was an intentional part of that package that single parents, when they choose to marry, should have a massive additional tax burden? Alternatively, was it an unintended by-product?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I have tried to understand the hon. Gentleman's point on that matter, but have failed to do so. The change to the married couples allowance certainly has not had the effect that he describes. I am not sure whether he is arguing that people should not be dealt with as a household, but should continue to be dealt with as if they were single people, even if they are married or living together. If so, that would have huge and extremely costly implications across the system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does the Financial Secretary accept that if a range of tax and benefit measures have the effect that aggregate household income is taken into account for a large range of purposes, and, as a consequence, when people choose to marry or live together their total tax bill or net tax benefit becomes substantially worse, that is a penalty on marriage?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman is uncharacteristically confusing the argument. On the one hand, he says that the measure is a disincentive to marriage; on the other, he says that it applies equally, whether people are married or cohabiting. Therefore, the disincentive is not to marriage, but to something else. If he is arguing against treating the income of the household as a whole, that would have huge ramifications across the social security and income tax systems. The Government's proposals do not include an undesirable change of that kind.

<P>
The amendment, which would introduce the children's tax credit a year earlier than planned, would disturb the Government's carefully balanced package of measures. The Committee has been given no indication of how the proposal would be financed. Would the increases in child benefit, the child premium for income support and the working families tax credit be scrapped? Or would the additional £1.6 billion be derived from another source? Taxpaying families already benefit from the new 10 pence starting rate of income tax, the cut in the basic rate of tax, and, from April next year, the new children's tax credit. Clause 34 implements the increase in the credit to £442 a year, which will provide extra support for low and middle-income families.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Just to satisfy my interest, what fiscal adjustments have been made by the Treasury so that, next year, it can afford the bill for the measure? Can the Financial Secretary provide a detailed list?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As the right hon. Gentleman has probably noticed, we have managed the economy in an extremely successful way. We are therefore able to fund not only substantial additional support for families, but large increases in spending on the health service, education and the Government's other priorities. It is an impressive achievement.

<P>
The clause will implement an increase of £8.50 a week in extra support for low- and middle-income income families. That is more than twice the value of the married couples allowance. We are committed to maintaining the progress towards eradicating child poverty. The children's tax credit is one of a package of measures that will, between them, lift 1.2 million children out of poverty by the end of the Parliament.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Financial Secretary is going through the positive side of the balance sheet in amazing detail, but is remarkably silent about the negative side. He says nothing about the additional taxes that the recipients of the Government's proposals will have to bear. Will he explain why he cannot tell me what additional taxes the gainers must pay?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is because the picture for families with children is so positive. That is the reality. The additional £7 billion that the measure brings families with children represents a huge improvement; it reflects the Government's priority and shows the progress that we have made on that priority. The tax burden on a single-earner family with average earnings and two children will, by April 2001, be at its lowest level since 1972.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I should conclude, Mr. Cook. We have had a long and revealing debate about the amendment. The hon. Member for Croydon, South talked about the transferable allowances featured in the Conservative party's manifesto before the previous election. People tend to remember what the Conservative party actually did in government, in contrast to what it said that it would do. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made clear, the working families tax credit provides a substantially better deal than would transferable allowances. For example, a family with two children would receive £965 a year on earnings of £15,000 a year through the transferable allowance mechanism, but £2,200 a year through the working families tax credit. Therefore, it is a much better deal for families with modest incomes, which is why we are seeing through the changes-

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Will the Financial Secretary clarify the reason why the Government are delaying the new children's tax credit? Is it delayed because, as we have assumed, there are administrative problems within the proposed arrangements, or is the reason fiscal? If the problems are administrative, will they be solved so that the measure can be implemented?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The delay has allowed us to increase support for families on modest incomes with children; it has made possible more than £1.4 billion of additional spending on the working families tax credit, income support and child benefit. There are some administrative issues to be resolved before the children's tax credit is implemented next year. However, in a year's time that will have been done, without any major difficulty. The delay allows us to set the priority for additional support for families on lower incomes with children. We have made substantial progress on that by means of the mechanism that I have described.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Before I respond to that point, will the Financial Secretary deal with the point that I raised earlier? The anomaly in the children's tax credit is that it relates to the highest earner in a family. Two earners on £30,000 a year-a household income of £60,000-will receive the credit, but one earner on £40,000 will not. Is that the Government's intention and, if so, why?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman may want to make several more points, so perhaps I can respond to all of them when he has finished.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway rose-</B><P>

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It was my distinct impression that the Financial Secretary had finished his response to the amendment and that the hon. Member for Croydon, South was about to respond to him.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I was inviting the Financial Secretary to deal with a point that I had raised earlier, after which time I would have responded to his response. However, I see that the hon. Gentleman is receiving enlightenment, so he may deal with it later.

<P>
The Financial Secretary said that there has been a phase-out this year of the married couples allowance worth £2 billion, that the increase in the working families tax credit amounted to compensation of £1.4 billion and that, next year, the Government would introduce children's tax credit worth another £1.4 billion. We will have an improvement of more than £2.8 billion. Now, if the hon. Gentleman can afford such a measure next year, he can certainly afford it this year. Given that inflationary pressures will be at their highest in the economy, we shall have a fiscal loosening. There is obviously some reason why the measure will not be introduced this year. At the end of his response, the Financial Secretary alluded to administrative difficulties and I believe that they will have long-term financial consequences that the country will regret.
 
<P>
The Financial Secretary also argued that the Conservative party's policy of transferable allowances was not as good as the working families tax credit. The Conservative party would not necessarily introduce transferable allowances; I am simply saying that marriage would be recognised in the tax system. All will come clear. As for the working families tax credit, I draw the Financial Secretary's attention to the paper produced by Christian Action's research and education department, which makes it clear that there is a bias in the working families tax credit against couples either married or cohabiting. The system favours the lone parent. It would be expensive to shake that wrinkle out of the system; it would then favour those who cohabit. We believe strongly that marriage should be recognised under the tax system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Before the Financial Secretary responds, I want to give him one more opportunity to deal with my point. I was interested to hear him refer to the net effect in response to the argument made by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. The hon. Gentleman has singularly failed to answer any questions about the net position and the effect on families of other changes in the tax system. If he had, I might then have been able to adjudge the validity of his argument. When the freedom of information mechanism becomes fully available, it will be interesting to hear what weasel words the Treasury ultimately deploys not to answer the question which, in 1981 and for every year thereafter, the Labour party was happy to receive the answer to. However, when it comes to this Government, the shutters suddenly close on information. Her Majesty's Treasury shows a complete unwillingness to follow a long tradition of attempting to be open and answer questions. It is a Labour Government who have brought the shutters down. [Laughter.] All that we get is embarrassed laughter from Labour Members who do not understand the significance of the question. The penny has probably dropped that if the truth about Labour's tax burden on families were on the record, the £7 billion to which the Financial Secretary refers would not seem to be such a glowing figure.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I completely reject that argument. The right hon. Gentleman should lock at the information about the distributional impact on pages 85 and 86 of the Red Book. We have been open about that, and shall continue to be. I was intrigued by the tantalising comment by the hon. Member for Croydon, South that the Conservative party is about to drop its support for transferable allowances in favour of another policy that will emerge. We shall wait with fascination to find out what that U-turn will consist of. On single-earner families, the effect of independent taxation is that single-earner couples will tend to pay more tax than two-earner couples on the same family income, as they have access to one set of allowances and rate bands. However, that will be addressed in the design of the integrated child credit, to which we shall return in future years.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Financial Secretary finally acknowledged the anomaly, although it has taken him an hour and a half to do so. However, he has not explained why the anomaly exists. He said that the introduction of the integrated credit system would shake it out, but why does it exist currently?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The question is that the amendment be made. Does the hon. Gentleman wish to withdraw it?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Whatever assists the Committee. We do not intend to press the amendments to a Division. If you would prefer it, Mr. Cook, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is it the wish of the Committee that the amendment be withdrawn?

<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): No.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am advised that a Labour Member said no to the withdrawal of the amendment. Is that correct?

<P>
<B>Mr. Allen:</B> I have changed my mind now, Mr. Cook.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I would appreciate it if those who are apparently sworn to silence would in future hold their counsel.

<H4><center>Clause 37</center></H4>
<H4><center>Application of starting rate to capital gains tax</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> This is an interesting clause that might have gone through on the nod were I not inquisitive enough to ask the Financial Secretary questions about its implications. The clause reduces the rate of capital gains tax paid by individual taxpayers to the 10 per cent. starting rate when their total taxable income is less than the starting rate limit of £1,520. I am sure that the Financial Secretary will by now be entirely familiar with life assurance policy formulae-income minus expenditure, or I minus E-which is at the heart of how life assurance is taxed. I want to probe the Financial Secretary on why the clause does not confer on life assurance policy insurance law the benefits that it gives the wider community of capital gains tax payers.

<P>
The economic effect of the clause is interesting. Very few, perhaps less than one in 100, of starting rate or basic rate taxpayers pay capital gains tax, but the 25 million individuals who save money through life insurance policies pay capital gains tax in some shape or form. As the Financial Secretary will know, the internal formula for life assurance taxation involves the creation of certain composite rates under which the I minus E formula enables an individual's personal tax to be dealt with within the terms of life insurance policies. The reason for that is simple. For certain categories of policy, for example those with regular payments lasting for over 10 years, when the money comes out there is no further tax to pay.

<P>
In the composite rate structure, the Treasury has adjusted the changes in personal rates of tax, but not CGT and its impact on life insurance. That point was dealt with in section 26 of the Finance Act 1999. In the Committee of that Bill, Treasury Ministers were pressed on why no adjustment had taken place for the changes in CGT introduced by the new Government. At the time, the Financial Secretary said that the Government would examine all the arguments for and against, but there has been no further ministerial announcement on the issue. I would be interested to know why not.

<P>
Only 36,000 of a total of 21 million basic rate taxpayers paid any CGT for the last full set of Inland Revenue statistics covering the period 1996-97 and only 14,000, or 0.7 per cent., of a total of 2 million starting rate taxpayers paid CGT. Many of the 25 million individuals who save via life insurance policies fall into the categories that I have just outlined. Because the clause does not make provision to change the way in which CGT is dealt with in terms of life insurance taxation, those savers will effectively be worse off. In the light of assurances given in 1999 that Ministers would consider the arguments for and against the measure, perhaps the Financial Secretary will tell us the conclusions of those considerations and whether the Government will be minded, on Report or subsequently, to correct the anomaly that is adversely affecting 25 million savers in the UK.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As the right hon. Gentleman said, the clause provides for the 10 pence starting rate of tax to apply to individuals' capital gains where appropriate. From 6 April this year, tax rates on gains will be brought into line with those on savings income. In future, where a taxpayer has no taxable income or income that does not fully use the starting rate band, capital gains in excess of the annual exempt amount that fall in that band will be taxed at 10 pence. It ensures that for all individual taxpayers the first £1,520 of taxable income or gains will be taxed at 10 pence. For those with little or no taxable income, the capital gains tax payable will be reduced by up to £152. Aligning the tax rates on savings income and capital gains will simplify the rules for calculating tax liabilities. It is therefore a welcome change.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde made several points about life insurance companies. The rules for taxing life companies broadly ensure that the corporation tax on income and gains used to fund policyholder benefits reflects the tax that individuals might have paid on income and gains. The circumstances of policyholders vary widely, and significant differences exist between the rules for taxing the gains of individuals and those of companies. There can be only an approximate relationship between the tax treatment of a life company's policyholder gains and the tax treatment of individuals' gains. Nothing in the present treatment relates the company's tax liability to the tax liability of a particular policyholder or group of policyholders. That would be difficult. Moreover, few people are likely to have significant investment in life insurance policies and benefit from the 10 per cent. rate on their capital gains. We could not justify singling out that small group for special recognition.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> If it was right to change the composite rate with reference to changes in income tax, why is it not right to make a similar adjustment with reference to capital gains tax?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I think, if I have understood the point correctly, that my answer is the point that I was making. Few people are likely to have significant investments in life insurance policies and benefit from the 10 per cent. rate on their capital gains. It would be difficult to justify singling out a small group for special recognition in computing insurance companies' corporation tax liabilities, even if it were practicable to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Does the Financial Secretary acknowledge that, under the I minus E formula, a charge equivalent to capital gains tax is made on the income of life assurance policies, but no corresponding allowance is made in that calculation for the equivalent of the personal allowance available to individuals, who may be subject to capital gains tax?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am aware that a range of arguments has been advanced on that point and that the industry has made a case for a change. Counter-arguments against making a change have been advanced, too. Individuals' gains are subject to an annual exempt amount, and enjoy taper relief, while companies' gains enjoy indexation. The picture is more complicated than the right hon. Gentleman suggests. On the whole, the balance is fairly fine between those who argue for change and those who oppose it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I sense a scintilla of hesitancy from the Financial Secretary in responding to my line of argument. Usually, when confronted with such a question, Treasury Ministers immediately rush to the barriers and say that it will cost x. We do not know what x will be. My comments are intended to be probing. I recognise that the matter is complex but, with respect to the Financial Secretary, he has had since last year to consider it. The person bearing the title of the office that the Financial Secretary now holds assured the Committee that the Government would examine all the arguments for and against. Since then, the Treasury has remained silent. If the Financial Secretary cannot give us the fruits of the labour that has clearly taken place since 1999, he might agree to write to me to explain in more detail the outcome of the considerations. Perhaps he could assure me that I would receive a full answer to explain some of the complexities if I were to table parliamentary questions on the subject.

<P>
It is clear that there are needs to change the internal tax rates in the context of life assurance. The Financial Secretary has missed my point, which is that the internal tax regime is at the point of issue, irrespective of the life assurance policyholder's personal liability to capital gains outside the policy that he might hold. We are making beneficial changes that are not visited on the investments of individuals held in the context of life assurance. Just as the Treasury agrees to make changes to the operation of composite personal rates in life assurance, it should agree that the same changes should be included in equity if there are beneficial changes to the citizen resulting from external matters affecting CGT.

<P>
Perhaps the changes should be phased in; I recognise that a capital gain is a long-term activity, whereas the taxation of dividend income flowing into life insurance policies is a discrete annual affair. Therefore, transitional arrangements might have to be built in to ensure that people's previous capitals gains are not unfairly benefited by prospective changes to the composite rates at which CGT might be dealt with for life assurance policies in future.

<P>
There is an element of equity in the matter, as 25 million individuals will now be effectively worse off because the Government have not introduced a measure to change how CGT operates for life assurance policies. Perhaps the Financial Secretary will be tempted to his feet to be a little more positive, if nothing else, in explaining in more detail why there is no such measure in clause 37.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I will be happy to write to the right hon. Gentleman detailing the Government's thinking on the points that he has made.

<P>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We now come to the provisions about the tax changes for giving to charities. They are an important part of the Bill, and changes on the subject have not been made for a considerable time. The changes will have a big impact on charitable activity.

<P>
When the Government came to power, the Chancellor immediately raided the treasure chest of pension funds by abolishing advance corporation tax. Although he took his £5 billion from that, he forgot that doing so would have the same impact on charities. The Government subsequently established a phased withdrawal of ACT arrangements for charities, and promised charities that they would consider how they could compensate them in some way for a loss of £500 million a year when the full phasing ends in 2004.

<P>
The charity community had expected that the reform with regard to charities would cover the knotty problem of the arbitrary application of value added tax. It had expected a more direct form of compensation for its extra £500 million bill. Instead, the tax rules will be changed in respect of giving.

<P>
Giving to charity is very much an Anglo-Saxon heritage on both sides of the Atlantic. We fare fairly poorly in comparison with the United States of America, where 90 per cent. of households give regularly to charity. Giving amounts to about 2 per cent. of gross national product. About 30 per cent. of households in this country give regularly, which results in about only 0.6 per cent. of gross national product being given. I should be interested to hear that some flesh has been put on the bones of the Government's estimates of the increase in charitable giving that they expect under the measures.

<P>
The measures will result in an enormous increase in paperwork, in record keeping by individuals and the chasing of individuals by the Inland Revenue for those records. I hope that the Government will see fit to respond to some of our amendments that are designed to reduce those activities. I am sure that some aspects of the clauses are errors. I note, in particular, that the British Legion will not pay VAT on poppies if it farms out their manufacture but will pay VAT if it manufactures the poppies itself. I am sure that such an anomaly is unintended.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman referring to the payroll deduction scheme under clause 38?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank you, Mr. Cook, for your indulgence. I am about to focus specifically on clause 38, which is the first of a group of clauses that concentrates on charities. I thought that it was not inappropriate for me to raise first the broad territory of such provisions. Clause 38 deals with improvements in payroll deduction giving, which has not so far been satisfactory. It generates about £25 million per annum, which is a surprisingly small amount. The provisions will abolish the ceiling of £1,200 per annum and give a kick start of a 10 per cent. Government credit for the first three years. I hope that the clause results in the desired effect, but many people who give to charities like to do so in private, not in their employment life.

<P>
The Government have made much of the argument that, whenever income tax applies, so should national insurance. I am surprised that NICs attributable to a person's earnings are calculated before the deduction of a donation to charity under a payroll giving scheme. Perhaps the Government have made a mistake. If they stick to the principles that they have enunciated in relation to national insurance and income tax, clearly that position should be reversed and a person's earnings should be reduced by a gift to charity under a payroll scheme at a gross level, not after the deduction of national insurance. That should give an incentive to people at the lower end of the income spectrum to engage in payroll giving.

<P>
I should declare an interest as I am a trustee of three charities. I am also involved in other charities, as has been recorded in the Register. I wish to express my thanks to the revenue law committee of the Law Society and the Charity Law Association for helping me to understand the clauses and to draft some constructive amendments.

<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> The many points that the hon. Gentleman has raised will be dealt with later in our proceedings. It is probably not sensible to go around the houses and effectively to have a clause stand part debate.

<P>
It is worth highlighting the fact that the reliefs that we have introduced go much further than the proposals in our consultation document a year ago and further than those announced by the Chancellor in November. We listened to the views of the charities and their donors at every stage and we now have this generous package of measures, which has been warmly received in all quarters. Oxfam is delighted with the proposals, which it believes will enable it and other charities, large and small, to increase significantly the number of new donors and the funds that they can raise.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The first of the clauses on charitable giving concerns the payroll scheme. Many people told us that it was not achieving its full potential. Only about 400,000 employees-less than 2 per cent. of employees-are donating to charity in this simple way. The improvements that we propose in the clause will make the scheme more attractive to charities and their donors. We are lifting the ceiling and promoting the scheme. For three years, we are giving the 10 per cent. supplement out of public money. For every £10 that an employee donates, the charity will get £11, at a cost of only £7.80 to the basic rate taxpayer and £6 to a higher rate taxpayer. It is an extremely good deal for the charities and a good incentive for taxpayers to make donations in that way.

<P>
I should like to address one point that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) made about paperwork and bureaucracy. We have made the gift aid and payroll schemes as simple as we can. We have kept the amount of information requested to a minimum, consistent with the proper administration of the tax system. It is a tax relief to encourage giving, and we need to maintain a link to the tax system. Donors will be able to make donations either in writing or orally and a single declaration can cover a number of donations. There is no requirement for the declaration form to be signed, for example. The information required on the new gift aid declaration form is less than many charities already collect from their donors for other purposes such as direct mandates. Indeed, an Oxfam form for monthly donations by direct debit requests more information from the donor than we require under the scheme for tax purposes. I commend the clause, and payroll giving in particular, to the Committee.

<P>
No. 83, in page 27, line 21, leave out ``2.5'' and insert ``4''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendments are designed to remove the cap of £250 on the aggregate value of benefits that can be received by an individual in return for gift aid payments to a charity in any one year. Secondly, they aim to put in a scale of benefits that are permissible for both individuals and corporate donors on a declining basis in relation to the size of the gift. There are two contexts here. The first is the whole territory of formulated membership and sponsorship schemes under which to date sums have been paid to charities under a deed of covenant. Those charities understood from an informal Inland Revenue guide, published back in 1989, that members could receive up to 25 per cent. of the value of their covenant in return.

<P>
One of the changes proposed in the clause is the abolition of the deed of covenant regime, which will have many knock-on effects, not all of which have been fully thought through. The present statutory £250 maximum under gift aid at 2.5 per cent. could cause considerable problems for membership sponsorship schemes, making them much less attractive, and would result in charities having to reformulate schemes at some expense.

<P>
Under the Government's proposals, a donor of £1 million could receive only a benefit of £250 in return. There must be realism here. If the Government's policy is to provide incentives to give more generously, they should accept that that is a ridiculously low cap on benefits that is certainly out of kilter with the arrangements in the United States, which have led to such a massive increase in charitable giving.

<P>
There is also the problem that the set sum of £250 is black and white and that anything deemed to be over it would invalidate the gift aid, at considerable cost to the receiving charity, which would lose the tax relief. This will bring many problems. I trust that the Government have heard the considerable outcry. Charities such as the three choirs festival and various musical charities that look to companies for sponsorship will discover that it is hard to find sponsors. The typical arrangements for such sponsorship are that members of the sponsoring company take guests to concerts. If those arrangements amounted to more than £250, gift aid would be invalidated. The answer might be to pay for guests' tickets separately, but the reaction of companies to that might be, ``Sorry, too complicated. We won't bother.'' The main sufferers from this rather mean-minded tightening up of the benefits rule will be the arts and the artistic performances that charities put on.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 80 and 81 would increase the value of the benefits that charities may give in return for gift aid payments by individuals. The rationale is the same as that which I suggested for removing the cap. The amendments would increase the value proportionately to a maximum of 4 per cent. Amendments Nos. 82 and 83 would insert the same principle for close companies. I cannot think that the Government want to undermine the practical and useful changes to gift aid, both in terms of abolishing the floor and extending the nature of gift aid to securities as well as to cash, by introducing a petty and mean-minded minimum. If the Government do not like the Opposition's formula-we do not say that it is the right one-we hope that they will agree to abolish the minimum and consider slightly more generous benefit rules so that the alleged intent of their objectives here comes to fruition.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Clause 39 encourages individuals to give to charity and maximises the funds that are available to charities to pursue their objective. The basic rate tax which charities may now claim on all donations boosts the value of donations by more than a quarter. I refute the hon. Gentleman's allegation that arts charities are likely to lose out in some way under the clause. Arts charities generally, and others, have accepted that there is a great deal in the package for them and have welcomed it enthusiastically.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> It is axiomatic that all the charity world has welcomed the more generous tax incentives to giving, but I say in a constructive vein that it is the people in the performing arts looking for sponsorship who will face difficulties.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for saying that it is axiomatic that the changes have been welcomed. I shall remind him of that from time to time as we make progress through the clauses. A difference of approach is discernible between what the hon. Gentleman says now and what the previous Conservative Government did historically. Most people give out of generosity or a desire to support what they believe to be a worthy cause, not because they expect something in return. That is a fundamental aspect of charitable giving.

<P>
It has always been recognised that many charities like to mark their appreciation of donations by giving a token benefit in return. When the Conservative Government introduced the gift aid scheme in 1990, they included limits on the amount of benefit that could be received by the donor. The scheme has had, since its inception, an upper limit of £250 on those benefits, irrespective of the size of the donation. That was never varied by the previous Government.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 50, 46 and 47 seek to remove that maximum limit both for individuals and companies and amendments Nos. 80 to 83 seek to increase the benefits allowed to individuals and companies in respect of donations between £100 and £10,000. Removing the limit on benefits would open up all kinds of avoidance opportunities. An obvious suspect would be making gift aid payments to pay school fees. We cannot allow such abuses of the tax system.

<P>
Our objective in introducing the package is to boost the amount of money available to charities to use on good works. If charities return more of their resources to their donors through benefits, less money will be available for their charitable purposes. That cannot be right.

<P>
The benefits that will be allowed under the new gift aid scheme strike a fair balance between encouragement through tax relief on unconditional giving and some charities' desire to show their appreciation for those gifts. The Conservative party placed the maximum limit on benefits when it introduced the gift aid scheme in 1990. Those now occupying the Opposition Benches have made no case for removing it or for increasing the other levels of benefit.

<P>
There may be some problems at the margins, for two possible reasons. Some might argue that payments over £100 by deed of covenant have lost the potential benefit of the 25 per cent. benefit rule; but the limit was applied only to small membership subscriptions of less than £100. The other possibility is that some charities may not have been aware of the benefits rules until recently notified of them. I can only speculate, but some may even have breached the rules. The Government continue to emphasise that the main purpose is to encourage people to give rather than to allow charities to repay the giving through large benefits in kind.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Four weeks ago, I attended a major conference represented by about 1,000 charities. The Minister is a little out of touch. The key issue of the tightening of the benefit rule was raised and a wide cross-section of charities, particularly those related to the performing arts, were concerned about the potential damage of rigid implementation of the Government's proposals. Some rules existed previously and were implemented flexibly by the Revenue.

<P>
This is not a huge issue, but I repeat that if we are to move towards the United States principle of increasing giving to charities and providing tax incentives to do so, it is self-defeating to have such a modest benefit rule. We want universities to be able to secure millions of pounds from those who can afford it, in order to improve their facilities. If a donor is entertained by a university twice in one year, he is likely to breach the benefit rule and, if the Revenue interprets the arrangements strictly, to invalidate the gift aid. The rule is too little in today's world.

<P>
Our proposals may not be ideal, but I am sure, as is the world of charities, that the minimum is far too small. I hope that the Government will give further consideration to the problems that continuing that small minimum will cause by discouraging far greater giving to charities. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> My colleagues and I welcome the overall intention of the clause. The purpose of our amendment is to make it simple and straightforward for the Revenue, charities and donors to operate. The clause amends sections 25 of the Finance Act 1990 and creates a category of document called ``an appropriate declaration''. A number of provisions in proposed new subsection (3A) specify what shall and shall not happen. They will have wide-ranging and generalised effects. New subsection (3A)(a) provides for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>declarations to have effect, to cease to have effect or to be deemed never to have had effect in such circumstances and for such purposes as may be prescribed by the regulations.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our proposed new paragraph (d) might be thought hardly necessary, because it would be preceded by new paragraph (a), which basically says, ``Do anything you want, at any time you want and then imagine it never happened.''

<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary can reassure us about what will be required of non-taxpayers. The purpose of the amendment is to exempt them from the record-keeping requirements that appear to exist, subject to the interpretation of proposed new subsection (3A)(a). Bearing in mind the fact that non-taxpayers are on the whole likely to make small donations, we are trying to avoid bureaucracy and unnecessary paperwork, particularly for charities. Donors, charities and possibly tax authorities will waste considerable time and effort if the declarations apply to them. The majority of non-taxpayers are elderly people and make small donations. The Chartered Institute of Taxation says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We would speculate that the amount of charitable giving by non-taxpayers may approach the trivial.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It seems therefore that there would be little public harm in abolishing the need for record keeping by non-taxpayers.

<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will bear in mind the deterrent effect that the requirements to keep appropriate records will have on elderly people who make small donations. That requirement will reduce the flow of donations from a source that is substantial in commitment, if not in quantity. A number of charities in my area-the Johnny Johnson housing association, Rescare and Age Concern-are beneficiaries of small donations from non-taxpayers on a high numerical, but low financial level. Such charities would be disadvantaged by difficult record-keeping requirements.

<P>
The amendment is straightforward and would exempt non-taxpayers, and the charities that receive donations from them, from the record-keeping requirements. I hope that the Financial Secretary will regard our proposal favourably or, at least, assure us that the wide-ranging words in new subsection (3A)(c) will be interpreted beneficially to avoid the problems that we have mentioned.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I want to ensure that we understand the amendment before the hon. Gentleman continues. Would it be unnecessary for a charity to keep a record only if it felt confident that the donor was not a taxpayer? If so, in the absence of a record, how would it know that that donor was not a taxpayer?

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I am sure that all competent charities keep a record of their donors and the amounts received. The issue is whether there is an appropriate declaration and the question of tax flows from the nature of the donation. I do not think that the issue raised by the hon. Gentleman is significant because, naturally, charities will record donors and amounts most of the time. The main aim of our proposal is to avoid the deterrent effect on small donors who are non-taxpayers of the requirement to keep records in a retrievable form.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Do I understand correctly that the hon. Gentleman means that charities should not have to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>keep records with respect to declarations,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as in new subsection (3A)(b)?

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> That is correct. I hope that the drafing of our amendment is competent from that point of view. The Financial Secretary may suggest some alternative ways of achieving its intention. New subsection (3A)(a) is so wide ranging that that intention may be fulfilled by it. However, we need the Financial Secretary to assure us on that point.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I have been involved in the recent Christian Aid week, during which a field trial has been made of the approach that we are discussing. Collectors used to go from door to door, merely asking donors to put money in envelopes that they would pick up and bring back to the collection point. The new arrangement that Christian Aid is operating invites them to put their name and the declaration on the back of the envelope so that they can reclaim tax.

<P>
The response to the operation in my area, which I supervised, was rather limited; only a small proportion of donors put their names on the envelopes. We discussed why that might be and concluded that they were nervous about being put on to a junk mailing list, although they could tick a box if they did not wish to receive such information. They might also have been reluctant to touch anything that involved the word ``tax'' because they felt a vague sense of unease about it.

<P>
That does not bear directly on the amendment. However, although charities are enthusiastic about the generous changes in the Budget in relation to gift aid, they are concerned about the amount of record taking that will be needed and doubtful that the number of cases caught by it will justify the effort. Problems will arise only when people donate more money than they pay in tax. That is unusual, alas-we might wish that it was common, but it occurs almost exclusively at the lowest end of the scale and involves people who pay a trivial amount of tax, of which they are barely aware, and make a few donations to different charities which, when they are added up, come to a bit more.

<P>
The cost to the charities and to the Inland Revenue of invigilating the system will not be trivial. Does the Minister believe that the game is worth the candle? I accept that in introducing a new system the answer is probably that we do not know-

<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Colman </B>(Putney): Does my hon. Friend accept that when I was collecting for Christian Aid week in my constituency recently, there was a widespread welcome on the doorsteps for the change that the Government have introduced to ensure that individual donations will receive a tax credit?

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I strongly welcome the change, as do the overwhelming majority of those involved in charitable work. However, I wonder whether the administrative aspect of the proposal is strictly necessary. I appreciate that the Minister feels that it is necessary at this stage, but I invite her to consider reviewing the matter in the light of one year's experience, to see whether the additional record keeping has produced sufficient benefit to justify it in future.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The hon. Member for Broxtowe argued that what lies behind the amendment is that charities should claim the basic rate tax on cash that is collected. The Christian Aid model is being repeated and charities that collect in buckets will now give out envelopes left, right and centre to try to recover the tax. The record keeping and invigilation will be substantial and to little avail, because the amount of money that will be given to charities from earnings that have not yet reached the tax base will be small. If the Minister does not want to buy the idea in its entirety, national statistics will show the proportion of people paying tax at the basic rate and the proposal could be refined by allowing charities to claim that tax back on cash gifts given to them.

<P>
I would like to return to the Liberal Democrat amendment No. 130 when we discuss amendment No. 49, which covers the same territory via a different route. Several organisations and charities involved with older members of society say that people do not want to disclose their tax affairs to every charity, and because of that human fact, many elderly people who are generous in giving to charities will find themselves with modest tax bills as a result of the proposal. That would be unjust, and it is not what the Government intend.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Mr. Cook, I seek your guidance on whether you will take amendment No. 130, as I proposed to speak on that amendment with the other two amendments in that group. Amendment No. 130 will be relevant only if the other two are accepted. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs says that he does not want to speak to the amendment now.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 49 is on the same territory as amendment No. 130, but it takes a different route and is a more certain way of tackling the problem. I was simply saying that I intended to raise the issues under amendment No. 49 rather than amendment No. 130.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are discussing amendment No. 130.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful for your guidance on the matter, Mr. Cook. The changes that we have made in clause 39 extend the benefit of gift aid to more taxpayers and more donations. We have carefully maintained the link between the tax paid and the tax reclaimed, which we must do if the scheme is not to count as public expenditure.

Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 would allow charities-
