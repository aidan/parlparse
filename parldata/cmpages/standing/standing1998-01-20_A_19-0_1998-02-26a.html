<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Gentlemen may remove their jackets if they wish to do so. I have, as always, studied with great care the clauses and amendments that the Committee is to discuss this morning. The clauses are specific, as are the amendments, so I shall expect the debate to be along similar lines.
<H4><center>Clause 98</center></H4>
<H4><center>Home-school agreements</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I beg to move amendment No. 188, in page 73, line 33, after "age", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"except where, in the case of a pupil who is over compulsory school age, it shall be taken to mean the pupil himself, in which case "parental responsibilities" shall be taken to mean responsibilities that the pupil assumes himself and subsection (5) shall not apply".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment also stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), who is not yet here. [Hon Members: "Where is he?"] Several other members of the Committee are not here either, including two members of the ministerial Front-Bench team.
<P>
I note your stricture, Mr. Gale, about the precise nature of the amendment. It would require pupils over compulsory school age to sign the home-school agreements themselves rather than to have them signed by their parents. I thought that the Committee would be interested to hear details of the briefing note on the amendment that I received from one of my advisers.
<P>
It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Don, this strikes me as an eminently sensible amendment and I can think of nothing to add, except to say that, by this age, children should be taking responsibility for their own behaviour."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I, too, can think of nothing further to add.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): There is an obvious question that appears not to have occurred to the hon. Gentleman's research assistant or, at this early hour, to the hon. Gentleman himself. Am I correct to assume that the amendment implies that those attending school over the age of 16 are not subject to parental responsibility and that they are, in effect, adults? Is it the view of the Liberal Democrats that the age of majority should be cut from 18 to 16?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> That had occurred to me and, if the right hon. Gentleman had read the Liberal Democrat general election manifesto, he would have found the answer to his question, which is yes. That issue raises interesting questions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are discussing not the age of majority but parental responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I had not intended to talk about the age of majority, even though it was touched on by the right hon. Gentleman. The amendment refers to the signing of the contract by the child. Will the Minister tell us when either the child or that child's parent will be expected to sign the contract? The Bill is remarkably silent about that.
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> I apologise on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris) for her absence from the Committee. She is giving a speech in Edinburgh this morning as part of the United Kingdom's presidency of the European Union.
<P>
I ask the Committee to resist the amendment. I did not consider the briefing note given to the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) particularly good. I think that he should have a word with his researcher. [Hon Members: "Team."] Oh, he has a team. Clearly, we do not need to give additional public funding to the Liberal Democrats to help them in their research. Given the quality of the research, however, there may be an argument for doing so.
<P>
The home-school agreement defines the responsibilites of parents and schools, and we are keen that some responsibilities should rest with the parents. It is wholly appropriate that parents of children of statutory school age should recognise their responsibilities. The agreement is a vehicle to enable that to happen. If 16-year-olds stay on at school voluntarily when they have the option of leaving school, it would be inappropriate to require them to sign such an agreement.
<P>
There is nothing to stop such agreements being entered into voluntarily if a school feels that it is appropriate to give its sixth formers a broad outline of their responsibilities to the school and of the school's responsibilities to its sixth formers. Indeed, some may argue that that would be a good thing. However, the Bill concentrates on clearly stating the responsibilities and duties of parents and school; the home-school agreement will enable that to happen. The amendment muddies the water and dilutes the thrust of our policy. For those reasons, I shall ask the Committee to resist it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath asked about timing. The agreement will be signed between a parent's being offered a place and the child actually taking up that place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Can the Minister confirm that the agreement will be signed after the child is offered a place at a school and before the first day of the first term?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful for that information. The Committee will want to reflect upon that answer when considering subsequent clauses.
<P>
The Minister is right to imply that we have concentrated for far too long on the rights of parents and the responsibilities of schools. It is appropriate now that we consider the reciprocal responsibilities and duties the responsibilities of parents, and the rights of schools and those who work in them. However, we are not convinced that this and subsequent clauses are the right way of going about it.
<P>
We would certainly be concerned if the arrangement was as the Minister described it. It would be like asking people to sign a prenuptial agreement before they had discussed it. I had hoped that some time would elapse between the child arriving at the school and the contract being signed. In developing home-school relationships, it is surely important to allow time for detailed discussions between a school and the parents about the nature of the parents' and the school's responsibilities, and about the responsibilities of the pupils themselves. If the agreement is required to be signed on the very first day of term, there will be no opportunity for discussion and debate.
<P>
Nevertheless, I note what the Minister said about voluntary arrangements, and the fact that individual children can sign an agreement if they wish. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> This is clearly not the most important element of the Bill, but it is important that we pause for a few minutes to reflect on the nature of the relationship envisaged in clauses 98 and 99.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Bath that if the school-family relationship is to succeed it must be understood that the family needs to support the child and that the child and the parents need to understand that, if the school is to be successful, there are obligations on the child and on the family to support the child. That is part of building a successful school relationship with the community. I entirely concur on that with the hon. Gentleman, and the Minister would not disagree either. Indeed, I suspect that the Minister will tell the Committee that the purpose of the home-school agreement is to provide a physical manifestation, a precise statement of what the school expects the family to do to support the child, and of the child's relationship with the school. All that is common ground.
<P>
The question is whether imposing the obligations in clause 98 on the school will develop and reinforce a successful relationship. This is not a decisive point, but the financial memorandum to the Bill states that the Government expect the development of such agreements to cost œ1.6 million more than current spending in the first year and roughly œ500,000 a year thereafter. Those are not huge sums; nevertheless, the Government are inviting us to agree that money should be spent to impose that obligation on schools.
<P>
The second question concerns the precise nature of the obligation imposed on schools under clauses 98 and 99. Too much attention is focused on two pieces of paper the home-school agreement and the parental declaration, the preparation of which must be undertaken according to fairly precise specifications laid down in those clauses. Schools will be obliged to prepare a statement. They will be obliged regularly to review that statement in a process of formal consultation and to show in an auditable fashion that they have done so. So a process of obligation will be imposed on schools to establish the relationships that already exists under general guidance. The Government already have the power to reinforce any aspect of the guidance.
<P>
Why do we need to impose an extra-statutory process, which might be bureaucratic and intrusive, on schools, rather than simply describe the result that everyone wants proper focus on the relationship between the school and the family? The danger which all members of the Committee will recognise, even if not all hon. Members will articulate it here is that that process, which will be imposed on schools by law, is a series of hoops through which people can show that they have gone without being anywhere near delivering the policy objective.
<P>
The policy objective, which we all share, is to produce a proper relationship between the school and the family. The Government's proposal will not do that one cannot legislate for a relationship, but only for a series of hoops. The clause imposes a series of hoops without carrying much conviction that, in going through those hoops, unsuccessful schools will produce any more successful relationships than already exist.
<P>
My scepticism is focused on what will happen when the school is left with two sheets of paper after undertaking the process defined in clause 98. The proposal's weakness is shown in what will happen next. Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The governing body shall take reasonable steps to secure that the parental declaration is signed".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The school is obliged to take reasonable steps, but under subsection (4), it does not have to do so in circumstances when it would be inappropriate. The concept of appropriateness is a glorious one. As a former Minister, if something was inappropriate, I always used to say that it meant that I was uncomfortable with it, but could not articulate the reasons why. The word does not improve understanding of why something should not happen.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The school has an obligation to take reasonable steps, but not when it is inappropriate to do so. That does not strike me as effective machinery for delivering the objective that we all share. Even if parents sign the declaration, what will be the result? Subsection (2) states that the parents will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"take note of the school's aims and values ... and that they acknowledge and accept the parental responsibilities".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The word "accept" appears to have some teeth until we read clause 99, which makes it clear that no consequences are expected to flow from a failure to deliver accepted responsibilities.
<P>
When an hon. Member wants a debate on a subject without fear of the Government's being under any obligation to change their actions as a result of the debate, he or she must table a take note motion. Exactly that phrase is in the text of the Bill, and anyone with a history in the House of Commons understands how weak it is in reality.
<P>
I am sure that the Government will say that clause 98 is the machinery for delivering a better relationship between school and family, but that desirable objective is not a remotely persuasive argument for imposing an extra statutory obligation on schools. I shall, therefore, invite my hon. Friends to vote against it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bob Blizzard </B>(Waveney): Having listened to the right hon. Gentleman's remarks, I feel that he is rather scraping the barrel to find fault with the clause. We all agree that partnership between school and home is the cornerstone of educational success, and that the close relationship between teachers and parents is the key to raising standards. I have always found that the best is achieved when the school and the home stand at each side of the pupil in support of his education.
<P>
Partnership is one of the Bill's themes. The partnership between home and school is the essential one, which my experience in teaching bears out. I always found it valuable when, at parents evenings, the parents, the child and the teacher had a three-way dialogue discussing what had been and would be happening. The effects of such meetings were noticeable and long lasting. One of the most valuable experiences I had was when I taught in Canada for a year. Local telephone calls there are free and it was extremely useful when I was at home marking homework to be able to ring a parent if some homework had not come in on time, or if there was something missing from it. Amazing results came from that. Of course, the child knew that I could ring his parents, so there was no gap to exploit. As parents, we all know that children will exploit a gap if they think they can get away with it.
<P>
The clause is about narrowing the gap and reducing the opportunity for children to take advantage of it. Most of the pupils whom I have taught have wanted their parents to be involved in their school and to take an interest in their education. We have all come across the odd miscreant; his worst fear is his parents knowing what he has done wrong in school. In one school in which I taught in the days when corporal punishment was not illegal, when pupils appeared in the study of the deputy head teacher on what we might call a corporal offence, he used simply to ask, "Would you like the cane, or would you like me to write to your parents?" They all chose the cane, which says something about the sanction.
<P>
It is on that basis that we must build by introducing home-school contracts. The clause will give backing and the seal of Government to what the best schools already do. It will ensure that schools which do not currently pursue that practice do so. Including the process in law will give it greater consistency, formality and substance.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) saw consultation with parents as some sort of hoop or obstacle. One of the great strengths of the clause is that with schools consulting parents at the beginning and from time to time, parents will be involved in shaping the aims and values of the school. Parents will value that involvement and take an interest, and the school will be much the stronger for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> When does the hon. Gentleman imagine that that consultation will take place, if the agreement has to be signed on the first day that the child arrives at the school?
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> Initially it will have to take place with parents of pupils already at the school. One has to start somewhere. The clause makes it clear that the agreement must be reviewed from time to time.
<P>
Most parents want to play their part in shaping the structure which determines what responsibility is theirs and what is the school's. It will be difficult for upcoming parents to take part in the first stage, but when their children join the school and reviews take place, the process will cumulatively be strengthened from review to review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Although we might disagree about the principle, does the hon. Gentleman at least agree that there would be considerable merit in moving the date at which the agreement must be signed to the end of the first term, so that while existing parents will have been consulted and will have worked out the school's overall agreement policy, incoming parents will also be consulted in case changes are needed before they sign? Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Minister might consider such a change?
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> I will touch on that later, but a danger with that proposal is that after half a term parents may say, "I never envisaged this kind of thing." Parents might then think again and look for another school. So there is a down side to what the hon. Gentleman suggests as well as a possibility in it.
<P>
The home-school contract is about creating the right culture of expectation that the school and the home should work together for the common aim of the child's education. For the first time, the Government are strongly proposing the concept of shared responsibility.
<P>
People may ask why contracts are not to be legally binding and whether that is not a weakness. It is easy to say that it is, but we must consider the consequences of trying to make such contracts legally binding. Litigation would inevitably result, and we would not want education budgets to be poured into the pockets of lawyers. A great deal of time and money might be spent by schools on trying to enforce contracts time and money much better spent pursuing non-compliance in other ways. Legal contracts would inevitably spawn challenges and legal action from parents against schools I have heard of such actions being brought in the United States.
<P>
The contract will lay down core responsibilities and expectations that will be there for all to see. Contracts will be effective for the vast majority of parents, who will not dissent from them.
<P>
In response to the point of the hon. Member for Bath, prospective parents evenings, induction evenings or new intake meetings most schools have such events, which take place before children come to the school would enable schools to engage with parents in seeking their views on and shaping the contract. There could even be a special home-school contract meeting. Less enthusiastic parents could be identified early on and could be invited individually or in groups for further discussion with the school.
<P>
The clause puts the onus on parents to accept their responsibilities. I hope that schools will take contracts seriously and not just give them to the form teacher to[Mr. Blizzard]
hand out at registration for pupils to take home and bring back signed the following day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> That is exactly what will happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> The right hon. Gentleman should hear me out. I also hope that they will not be sent out through the post we have all seen such forms. The system will need some back-up and I seek the assurance of my hon. Friend the Minister that the school standards and effectiveness unit will be involved and that Ofsted will monitor the process. The success of the scheme will hinge on the approach taken by the school. It does not require the heavy hand of Government to ensure that that takes place; it requires only a clear understanding and I look to the Minister to give us guidance on that. The clause will set a new baseline and establish a new culture for learning that will drive up standards in all our schools.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): No member of the Committee has any doubt about the key importance of the relationship between the school and the home and of parental interest in the school and in children's performance. We accept that that relationship underpins how a child will succeed at school. As the hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard) said, results are best achieved when the school and home stand together to support the pupil. We all know how sad it is and how many problems can arise when teachers are trying to do their best by certain pupils whose parents are not taking an interest and how that affects those pupils' ability I apologise, Mr. Gale; I shall try not to use the words "ability" and "aptitude" too much today.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am pleased to hear it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> The relationship between home and school is therefore essential. However, my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood and I question whether it is necessary to enshrine in statute a requirement for home-school agreements and the procedure for putting them into place. We all know that good schools ensure that parents understand what is expected of them and the nature of the home-school relationship. We know that problems occur in terms of parents' responsibilities to schools.
<P>
I have an interest in the matter because some years ago, as chairman of an education authority, I considered introducing what were then called parental contracts; we decided not to do so, for several reasons. There were problems relating to the legal status of the contracts; there were also practical difficulties. We were concerned that enshrining the home-school relationship in a contract or agreement might have had according to the law of unintended consequences the undesired effect of leading to a souring of the relationship between parents and school.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): The hon. Lady is drawing on her own experience of contracts; could she describe the teething problems that she had with them in greater detail? Whatever scepticism Opposition Members might have about the process, what specific harm do they believe it will do?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Our scepticism is about whether one needs to legislate for a bureaucratic process to put contracts in place, rather than encouraging schools through a code of practice, for example to use them.
<P>
My concern is that if we actually enshrine in a document the relative responsibilities of the parents and the school, it could lead to both sides sticking to what I might call the letter of the law although I accept that it is not a legal document. It would be interesting to hear the Minister respond not about enshrining parental responsibilities in that document, but about what parents should expect the document to say about the school's responsibilities.
<P>
I am worried that parents could complain that a school had said in the document that it would do something, but it was not being done. Although the document would not have legal force, it could lead to a souring of the relationship between parents and school rather than encouraging and improving it. That is my main worry about the impact of the agreements.

<P>

<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> What is wrong with that? I was teaching when homework diaries were first introduced. Some people said, "We must be careful with these homework diaries because parents might complain that homework has not been set." One of the strengths of homework diaries is that they set out that relationship. They allow transparency. I see nothing wrong in clearly laying out the facts, so that parents and schools know exactly what is to happen.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> That prompts all sorts of questions. There is a basic understanding between school and parents about what is required of both sides. The hon. Gentleman is correct that a parent has every right to go to a school and as in his example say, "I was expecting you to set homework. Why has that not happened?" Such conversations will be quite different if agreements are enshrined in law; it will become a bureaucratic process, required to be done in a particular way.
<P>
We are talking about shades along the spectrum. For example, a school may be genuinely unable to deliver what is set out in such an agreement. It may have expected at the beginning of the school year to provide extra facilities for music lessons, but budgetary requirements imposed from above prevent that. At the moment, parents are entirely at liberty to complain about such matters, but once they are enshrined in agreements part of a legal process, because it has been set down in legislation it tips the balance of that relationship.
<P>
<B>Ms Joan Ryan (Enfield, North):</B> The hon. Lady raises an important point. We are trying to change the culture in schools, but we are not talking about a contract it is an agreement. It is not sanctions-oriented, although some have asked whether it has teeth. Those are valid questions.
<P>
The agreement is based on good practice and it already works in many schools. Indications are that there is a lack of parental involvement in schools that are failing. An agreement would set the right culture to lead to a proper partnership; it would kick-start the relationship and keep it going. It should therefore be included in the Bill. The key influence on children and their educational achievement is their parents. From birth to the age of 16, children spend more time with their parents or carers than in school. That must be recognised.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady has been patient in Committee for many hours over the past few weeks. I try to be lenient, but she must try to catch my eye if she wishes to make a speech.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I was talking about shades of the spectrum and exactly where we stand. The clause is about good practice and we all know of examples when such a system works well when expectations are set out, parents understand them and there is a good relationship between home and school. Why is the provision not enshrined in a code of practice? Why is it necessary to put it into the Bill?
<P>
The contract will have no legal force, there will be no sanctions, and there are questions about the extent to which it has teeth. Given that no parents can have action taken against them if they do not meet the responsibilities set out in the requirement, that again raises the question why is it necessary to have the contract enshrined in legislation rather than as an encouragement of good practice. Furthermore, I doubt that the imposition of a bureaucratic process will change the culture where it most needs to be changed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Enfield, North (Ms Ryan) referred to when a school was failing. We are also talking about circumstances in which parents do not take an interest in the education of their children. Putting such a provision in the Bill will not change that; it will take a great deal more to ensure that such parents take an active interest in the school. I am sure that we all know of teachers who do their very best to ensure that a good relationship is built up with the parents. Sadly, some parents do not take an interest and it is impossible for teachers to build up that relationship.
<P>
Yes, the relationship is key, but the provision enshrines a requirement in the Bill for schools that, I fear, will become a throwaway. The agreement will be adopted automatically because the Government require it, rather than it being done because it is good practice and has genuine benefits for the education of the children. Where such a system is adopted at present, it is being done because it is seen to be good practice and benefits are derived from it.
<P>
<B>Ms Ryan:</B> The Bill is about raising standards, and building a relationship between the school and the parents helps with that process. The hon. Lady and other Conservative Members are saying that, unless we can guarantee that something is 100 per cent. successful, we should not undertake it, despite all the evidence that such a system works and is worth undertaking. That seems to be carping.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I am not saying that if something is not 100 per cent. successful, it should not be attempted. Rules, guidance, and, in some cases, agreements between home and school already exist and work well. I am worried about the perverse result of putting such guidelines in the Bill. It could lead to a situation that will not be good practice or of genuine benefit, but something that the governing body must do each year because it is required of it. It could reduce the success rate and not increase it.
<P>
I question whether clause 98 is necessary. There are many instances in the Bill where the Government have had recourse to the introduction of codes of practice. If they consider that the relationship between a local education authority and the Government is one that is appropriate for a code of practice, it is a little strange that they consider that a relationship between the school and the parent must be enshrined in legislation. Why do not the Government remove the provision from the Bill, put it into a code of practice and consider ways of encouraging schools to have contracts other than through setting up a bureaucratic process that will perversely lead to parents treating them in an offhand manner or to the souring of the home-school relationship? Notwithstanding clause 99, the contracts would have greater force than the Government intend and the relationship between school and parents would be harmed, even in circumstances where good practice has already been followed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) said that the Government refuse to disclose the nature of the relationship between Government and LEAs and between LEAs and schools. A new clause that the Government are tabling today will place a legal requirement on LEAs, governing bodies and head teachers to follow the code of practice with regard to those relationships the code of practice will come later, but that is the nature of legislation. We put legal duties and responsibilities in primary legislation but often subsequently introduce a code of practice that flows from it. Although the clause does not place a legal status on the relationship between parents and schools, it places a legal duty on governing bodies to adopt a home-school agreement, with a parental declaration. The clause is necessary because it enshrine that legal requirement in statute.
<P>
I agree with the general principle underpinning the contribution of the right hon. Member for Charnwood: we cannot legislate for a relationship. That is why the clause establishes a framework that will be conducive to a constructive relationship between parents and schools. We cannot create that by law; that was the previous Government's mistake. They introduced flawed home-school agreements that were part of the admissions criteria. We believe that it is far better to ensure that both parties enter the agreement with a recognition of their respective responsibilities. If, for example, there is a provision in the agreement with regard to music, and music is then withdrawn, schools should explain to parents the reason for that; parents might then lobby the LEA to have that budget heading reinstated. We should not be scared of that. It is part of the flow of information between parents and schools and school and parents something that we hope would be covered by the home-school agreement.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maidenhead asked what detail would be included in the agreement with respect to school's responsibilities. I think that schools will want[Mr. Byers]
to state their particular ethos; they should also state their homework and behaviour policies. Most importantly, as we move to individual school-based targets, one of the main items in the agreement should be the standards targets that the school has set itself.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman raised the issue of the œ1.6 million, saying that schools would have to carry that great financial burden. Even with what members of the Committee know is my inadequate command of figures, I know that with 24,000 schools, that works out at about œ70 per school at least. I hope it does; I do not have a calculator. That is a small amount to pay to develop a home-school agreement, so I am not persuaded by the cost arguments.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Waveney made some important points about the practical details of implementation. Some schools that have not been engaged in the home-school agreement process may struggle and be unsure where to start. My hon. Friend made a good suggestion, which was to get the Department's standards and effectiveness unit to draw up guidance on how schools can develop effective and strong home-school agreements. We will certainly want to ensure that that happens.

My hon. Friend also mentioned the role of Ofsted in considering home-school agreements as part of the inspection process. As he constantly reminds me and other people, Her Majesty's chief inspector is independent of Government, but I will write to him suggesting that he may want to include in Ofsted's inspection regime consideration of how home-school agreements are working in practice.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Minister is right to say that it would be helpful for schools to be given advice on ways to proceed and examples of best practice. Reflecting on the need to draw on advice, can the Minister help the Committee? I have here a letter from the Department dated 8 August it was the covering letter for the consultation document on home-school contracts. The letter requires governing bodies
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to invite all parents of registered pupils of compulsory school age to sign the contract within a reasonable time of the pupil's admission".
<P>
Since then, the Minister has decided that
<P>
"within a reasonable time of the pupil's admission"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
means a matter of a few hours.
<P>
On the basis of what advice did he reach that conclusion? I have read copies of all the responses to the consultation on the issue, and the only one that refers to timing comes from Stockport. It urges that there should be local flexibility in determining both the content of the document and when it is signed. What has persuaded the Minister to move from the original intention that there should be a reasonable time between the child's arrival at the school and the signing of the contract to decide that there should be a matter of a few hours between the two?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> There is confusion over what we mean by admission. Legally, admission is not the day on which the child turns up at the school gates; admission is when a place is offered and accepted. It is the latter sense that "admission" has in the Bill, not attendance on the day. Subsection (6) mentions a "reasonably practicable" time, so the limit is not within hours: it is within a reasonable time.
<P>
For children who are newly admitted, there will be a period of months before they turn up at the school gates. There is good time for the discussions to which the hon. Gentleman has referred to take place and for parents to be made aware of their responsibilities. It is right that there should be a dialogue before the child enters the school, so that parents and the school recognise their mutual responsibilities. That is what clause 98 provides.
<P>
The clause is a vital part of our efforts to raise standards. As my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney said, pupils do best when schools and parents stand shoulder to shoulder with them. Home-school agreements will enable that to happen; that is why it is so important that clause 98 stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Supplementary provisions about home-school agreements</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not wish to prolong unduly the debate, but the Government must clarify what is intended under subsection (2), which states that the Secretary of State will have the power by order to instruct that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any form of words 
<P>
(a) specified in the order, or
<P>
(b) having such effect as is so specified,
<P>
is not used in a home-school agreement".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the Secretary of State is taking the power to proscribe the use of certain forms of words.
<P>
Will the Minister explain that slightly odd provision? What sort of guidance does he envisage the Secretary of State issuing under subsection (1)? How will the Secretary of State determine the nature of that guidance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We shall consult widely with head teachers and parents groups to identify what people regard as appropriate matters to be dealt with in home-school agreements. The Government's view is that the guidance is likely to include provisions relating to the standard of education that the school will provide, the ethos of the school, regular and punctual attendance, discipline, homework and the information that schools and parents will give to one another. Those are the sorts of issues that we think appropriate. We shall give guidance in the light of consultation and after considering the good practice that there is throughout the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the Secretary of State's guidance deal with the relevance of home-school agreements to children who are excluded from other schools? The Minister raised that issue in debating the treatment of excluded children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Exclusions could be reflected upon in the general policies adopted by a school. We might want to consult on that to determine whether it is suitable for inclusion into home-school agreements.
<P>
The Secretary of State will find unacceptable wording that states, for example, that parents will be expected to make a donation of œ100 a year to the parent-teacher fund. That would be inappropriate, although I would not be surprised if a school were to try to get away with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> We can all dream up undesirable forms of words that might be used in the agreements. Presumably, neither the Secretary of State nor anyone on his behalf will try to draw up an exhaustive list of undesirable things that could be included in the agreements. There must be a more focused purpose to that rather extraordinary power, especially given other provisions in the clause which, in several different ways, state that no obligation can arise under those agreements. If they are unenforceable, which is the effect of subsections (4), (5) and (6), this is not belt and braces, but belt, braces and any other forms of suspending trousers not yet invented.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The difficulty is that, largely because of the legacy that we have inherited after 18 years of the previous Government, of which the right hon. Member for Charnwood was a leading member, many parents believe that education is no longer free and that they must make a contribution, either to pay for a teacher or basic equipment.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that there will be no legal requirement to contribute to the parent-teacher fund, but a climate has developed in which too many parents believe that they must make a contribution. Therefore, in the Secretary of State's view, it would be inappropriate to have such wording in a home-school agreement. That is why the power under clause 99 is required.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I am tempted to ask whether the Minister is not confusing this issue with the Government's policy of ending free higher education. Will the guidelines define the circumstances, referred to in clause 98(4), in which it will be inappropriate to require a parent to sign such an agreement? Will he give us an idea of the Government's thinking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> That would arise if a parent had been found guilty of child abuse, for example, when it would be wholly inappropriate to involve that parent in the process. The provision covers exceptional circumstances when it would be clearly inappropriate for a parent to sign the agreement.
<P>
Clause 99 is important. It provides the supplementary provisions to implement home-school agreements, and I hope that it will stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 99 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 100</center></H4>
<H4><center>Extended work experience for Key Stage 4 pupils</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I seek clarification on when the provision is expected to be used. Are we talking about work experience as part of school-based education, or about children under 16 being off school premises and, if so, for how long? I hope that the clause is not about work-based learning, which is relevant only for older pupils. One interpretation of the clause could be that that door is being opened, which I hope is not part of the Government's intention. What is the nature of the work experience that the clause makes possible, but which is not possible under existing law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to explain the effect of clause 100, which is a positive way of giving greater flexibility to key stage 4 provision. It will be far more appealing to many youngsters than the rather rigid national curriculum that they have to follow at present. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is considering the post-14 curriculum to see how it can be made more flexible, more vocationally linked and more work related, so that greater diversity and choice will be offered to young people. Child employment legislation has to be amended to ensure that the scheme, provided by individual schools, will be monitored by the local education authority, which has responsibility for such matters. The LEA will ensure that it does not become a replacement for education, but is an integral part of a far more flexible post-14 curriculum. The clause will allow us to do that. It is a question of balance and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority will make recommendations on how that can be achieved. We are offering a broad and balanced curriculum to all youngsters aged over 14, which does not happen at present. Clause 100 should, therefore, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I seek further clarification. What is not possible now, but will be possible under the clause? Is it not true that no child under 16 ever engages in work experience? That is not an accurate reflection of what happens in schools today. What guidance will be given[Mr. Dorrell]
to LEAs to determine the proper scope of discretion under this sweeping power? We have spent much time discussing the detail of regulations in the Bill. This is a sweeping discretion that must be debated thoroughly. In its most extreme form, it could effectively reduce the school-leaving age.

<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It certainly will not do that. We shall shortly be debating the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough about a child remaining on the school roll. At present, a child can have work experience only for the final four terms of his time in school effectively, the final six terms or the final two years. The clause tidies up the system and will allow pupils to have work experience throughout key stage 4. I have forgotten the right hon. Gentleman's other point.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> What is the limit on LEA discretion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We need to await advice from the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority on the details of creating a flexible package that will allow work experience as a part of education before giving the guidance that the right hon. Gentleman requested.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 100 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 101</center></H4>
<H4><center>Provision of secondary education for Key Stage 4 pupils by FE institutions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I beg to move amendment No. 398, in page 75, line 8, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provided that the pupil should remain enrolled at the school where such pupil was last enrolled if such school were a maintained school".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment follows from the previous clause and the comments of the right hon. Member for Charnwood. It is a probing amendment on an important issue.
<P>
We welcome the freeing up of the key stage 4 curriculum so that young people, often disaffected young people, can have access to a curriculum other than the narrow national curriculum. To be fair to the right hon. Member for Charnwood, I acknowledge that the curriculum was relaxed towards the end of the previous Government's time in office. We welcome FE colleges becoming more involved with key stage 4 students, particularly in GNVQ, foundation or level 1 work. The clause, together with the previous clause, will allow far more students to enter the workplace and have workplace learning, with learning devised by the FE college and the school.
<P>
However, such students should not get lost in the system. If, as has occurred in the past, students go to FE colleges for certain courses, who will be responsible for them? The amendment would ensure that the school does not lose its responsibility for a student, even if he or she spends the majority of time in a workplace learning placement or an FE college learning placement. Whatever the advantages of workplace learning, employers cannot be expected to have the necessary skills to give students the pastoral support that they need. Pastoral support is one of the areas in which FE colleges have cut back most radically, in the need to return to basic unit formulae. The amendment is therefore important. We hope that even if the Minister cannot agree to it, he will give us the assurances necessary to prevent students getting lost in the system.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough is right it is important that pupils do not get lost in the system. In its work on disaffected children, the Select Committee on Education and Employment is examining the provision of a curriculum that offers such children wider opportunities through FE institutions or workplace experience, for example. That is relevant for children for whom the curriculum does not adequately provide. This and the previous clause deal with that requirement, but the Government must clarify who is responsible for such children the responsibility is often shared by several agencies and it should be designated to one. That is important and I would welcome the Minister's comments on it. My one question about the amendment is whether it is appropriate for children who have been excluded from school and have gone to a pupil referral unit or some alternative institution to remain the responsibility of the school from which they have been excluded.
<P>
That is relevant in view of a debate during a previous sitting that arose from a suggestion by the Secretary of State that a school might pass on its financial responsibility for an excluded pupil to another body, so that the money would be transferred with the pupil. That is a real issue that is not addressed by the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> If the amendment is pushed to a vote, I will ask the Committee to resist it. It is unnecessary, because under existing provisions the child remains the responsibility of the school except where the child is excluded, when the responsibility reverts to the local education authority. It is then for the local education authority to make the appropriate placement. If the local education authority chooses to send the child to a further education college, it can do so.
<P>
The lines of responsibility are clear. Although a school or local education authority may choose the flexibility that can be offered by a further education college, the responsibility will rest with the school or with the local education authority. Whereas a few years ago further education colleges would offer free places to youngsters almost as a loss leader, in the hope that at the age of 16 they would choose to continue to attend the college, increasingly they are charging for those places. That financial burden will fall on the school or on the local education authority. One of the simplest ways to ensure that people discharge their responsibilities properly is to make them pay for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Tory!
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> New Labour, actually.
<P>
I hope that I have been able to satisfy the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough; he has raised an important point. There is a wider issue concerning disaffected young people, and we are awaiting the Select Committee's recommendation with great interest. The flexibility allowed by the clause to tailor a programme of work and experience to young people who may for a variety of reasons have become disaffected with school may play an important role. For those reasons, I ask the Committee to resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful for the Chair's reassurances. The hon. Member for Maidenhead raised the issue of excluded pupils. The amendment would make the school retain responsibility for pupils until either they had been placed somewhere else or the LEA had accepted responsibility for them. When I was a practising head, I know that we regarded it as our responsibility, when we excluded a child, to ensure that we looked positively for other placements. Working with FE colleges and employers was a positive way of demonstrating to such children that the school had not just excluded them and given up but regarded it as part of its ongoing responsibility to seek a transition for them.
<P>
It is important to consider two other groups of students. The first group is special needs students, especially those with learning difficulties. At keystage 4, children with severe learning difficulties need to spend a greater part of their time out of the mainstream in FE colleges and on other placements. It is important that they be tracked and supported. The second group is children at risk. It is crucial that there is one central agency the school that looks after them. I am grateful for the Minister's assurances on the matter, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 101 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 102</center></H4>
<H4><center>Nutritional standards for school lunches</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browing </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): I beg to move amendment No. 407, in page 75, line 27, leave out "Regulations" and insert "Guidelines".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 408, in page 75, line 27, leave out "prescribe" and insert "set out".
<P>
No. 409, in page 75, line 29, leave out "complied with" and insert "recommended".
<P>
No. 410, in page 75, leave out lines 32 to 40.
<P>
No. 411, in page 75, line 41, leave out "Regulations" and insert "Guidelines".
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to discover what the Minister believes will be the outcome of imposing regulations rather than setting guidelines in respect of the nutritional content of school meals. We all recognise the need to encourage healthy eating at an early age. The previous Government and the present Government, and particularly the Department of Health, recognise the need to reduce the lifelong diseases that often result from early eating patterns. The Government's job is to put information in the public domain. I would be the first to say that one cannot start early enough if one wants to encourage good eating habits.
<P>
The clause imposes a statutory obligation on those who provide school meals to prescribe nutritional standards, but the Minister will find the outcome extremely disappointing. In a previous incarnation, I spent three years as Minister for food. Part of my brief was to spend time with those who provided the school meals service. We introduced many initiatives to encourage what the Government intend with clause 102. However, it is clear that what constitutes a healthy diet, and, more importantly, what constitutes the take-up of healthy eating, particularly by children, depends on factors other than what is placed before them.
<P>
The Health Education Authority published a report in 1995 on diet in school-age children. That report stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"What children eat is influenced by a variety of factors, including their attitude to, and knowledge and understanding of, food and nutrition."</font></ul>
<P>
I would totally support guidelines on balanced diets. The Government may prescribe in legislation the rigid nutritional guidance that the authorities of the day believe to be appropriate, but more often than not children tend not to select those foods.
<P>
The two different school age groups have different requirements and very different practices. It is less common for primary schools to provide a choice of meals. Many secondary schools, however, operate a cafeteria-style service and the children have a greater say in the foods that they select. It is therefore important that they have the knowledge and information to make a sensible and informed choice.
<P>
All of us, particularly those of us who are parents trying to bring up our children to make sensible eating choices, know that children will more often than not select food different from what adults would prescribe. The challenge for the school meals service is not only to provide nutritionally balanced meals, but also to provide a choice that children will eat.
<P>
I gave an example of what could happen if the regulations are drawn so tightly that children, faced with those nutritious choices, look at the food but decide not to eat it. In October 1996, Mr. John Parsons, the head of Christ Church primary school in Folkestone suddenly found that the school meals had been changed by a healthy eating initiative. He discovered that the children were being poorly served and offered bony fish, beetroot and raw cabbage. We can produce a carefully balanced meal on paper of which fresh fish may be an important component, but that does not mean that children will eat what is in front of them.
<P>
<H5>11. 45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Mr. Parsons pointed out that lack of supplies and quality of ingredients resulted too often in children receiving less than the required quantity of food, which was often unpalatable and indigestible. He went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The children just don't like the new food. We used to reckon on having half a bucket of leftovers after meals, but now it is one, two or even two and a half bucketfuls."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have to take into account what children will eat, as opposed to what is offered. We might have the best[Mrs. Browning]
of intentions in putting a nutritionally balanced meal in front of children, as laid out in the clause, but we know from experience that that is not the solution to the Miniter's desire to ensure that children have better balanced meals, giving them the right uptake of he vitamins and minerals that are essential for their development.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I had hoped to have left school meals behind on 1 May, after 34 years of them. I did not want to intervene in this debate, but I am staggered by the hon. Lady's hypocrisy when the compulsory competitive tendering of the school meals service did more to undermine nutritional standards in school than anything else. Will she comment on that, given that she was a food Minister at the time?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> During the past three years, I have had the pleasure of presenting the national awards for school meal providers, including those from the private sector and those employed directly by local authorities. There was a good mix of public and private sectors providers. Awards were given not just on the basis of the attractiveness of the meals provided on a specific budget, but nutritional composition. The rhetoric and dogma of the old days has gone.
<P>
We also have to take into account the social changes in eating patterns. We all know that, as the Health Education Authority report of 1995 showed, family eating patterns at home and at leisure are reflected in the eating choices that children make at school. I shall spare the Committee a lecture I suspect that you would call me to order, Mr. Gale, and I am sure that we are all familiar with the subject on the changes in social eating patterns that affect the way in which children and adults select food to form a balanced meal.
<P>
I have heard Health Ministers in the present Government say that there are no bad foods, but there are bad diets. I agree. Trying to put together a nutritionally balanced diet, particularly when presented with a choice, as those aged 11 and over are, is a challenge. That challenge will not be met by simply putting nutritional guidelines in the Bill. We need more information, in the school curriculum and outside, because growing children need to make informed choices. That process was begun by the previous Government. There are many areas in which we can highlight nutritional deficiencies. For example, a MORI poll carried out at the end of last year showed that 25 per cent. of girls aged 11 to 15 claimed not to eat red meat. They need information to help them understand the necessity for replacement minerals, such as iron, in other foodstuffs. When those girls are in the school cafeteria deciding whether to eat this or that for lunch, they must be able to make an informed choice. I would have sympathy for and support the Government if they were proposing an initiative to develop children's knowledge of nutrition.
<P>
I must declare an interest: having trained as a home economist, this subject is close to my heart. I have pressed the previous Government, and will continue to press this Government, about it.
<P>
We are all in favour of the "Health of the Nation" targets, preventing obesity, increasing the consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables and decreasing the consumption of saturated fats. However, the Minister will be disappointed, as that will not be achieved by putting into a statute a requirement for nutritional components in the school meals service. Much work can be done to solve the problem that the Minister has identified, but he is not going the right way about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): The amendment strikes hard at the overall philosophy of holistic education that the Government are attempting to adopt. Although I doubt neither the honourable intentions nor the experience of the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton, the amendment goes against the principle of the clause.
<P>
We have established the principle of a holistic approach throughout the Government's education policies. We understand the importance of involving the family in upgrading standards of literacy and numeracy. Part of that holistic approach is ensuring that children, especially those from deprived and difficult backgrounds, receive the most benefit from school food.
<P>
Mens sana in corpore sano is a good principle for this Government, as it has been in the past. It is essential to have nutritional requirements, not guidelines. For example, in the centre of Blackpool where people often go to find seasonal employment there is a school in which 60 to 65 per cent. of children are eligible for free school meals. Many of those children come from difficult backgrounds and single parent families, and many live in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. It is crucial that those children benefit from a proper, nutritional meal in the middle of the day.
<P>
The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton referred to changes in social patterns and family eating habits. We are well aware of those changes, but surely they make the proposal more, not less, important. Given that many of those children do not eat a properly balanced meal prepared by their mother or father when they go home, it is even more important to include a requirement on nutritional standards in the Bill.
<P>
It is often thought that we are talking about feckless families who do not care about their children eating a proper nutritional diet, but that is a misunderstanding. Those families are often working so hard to make ends meet that they simply do not have time to prepare nutritional meals in the evening. That is especially true in my constituency, where often both parents are in part-time jobs.
<P>
If such requirements are not laid down in the Bill, there is a risk that children will experience all the dangers of the short-term budgetary cuts that local education authorities make from time to time. I do not claim that that will not happen under a new Labour Government. If such requirements are not included in the Bill, the pressure will always be to cut standards.
<P>
I hear what the hon. Lady says about choice. It is true that cafeterias present a challenge to the providers of school meals in offering attractive fare. If the food is not attractive, the children will vote with their feet or should I say stomachs? That is not an argument for abandoning the arrangements, or for suggesting that because the number of slop buckets has increased four or five times there should not be a requirement in the Bill to provide meals.
<P>
Simple encouragement is not enough. The hon. Lady referred to her efforts in the past as a Minister with responsibility for food, and I do not want to denigrate that, but the National Children's Bureau, which produced a briefing in July 1997, said that nutritionists are concerned about the nutritional value of school meals. The bureau is also concerned that the provision of school meals, which is so important for low-paid or no-income families, has been steadily declining since the 1980s. We have to be sure that children in Blackpool, in the hon. Lady's constituency and everywhere else, who come from difficult backgrounds, return home having had a meal preferably a hot meal which has a proper nutritional value. Otherwise, they will have problems with illness later in life. I am thinking of osteoporosis, in particular, which mainly affects women, although it increasingly affects men. We all think of rickets as being a disease of the past, but it is not necessarily so.
<P>
I do not want children's school meals to consist of only crisps, a wedge of pizza or the saturated fats of a burger-based diet. I am sure that the hon. Lady has the best intentions, but if she is not careful the impact of her amendments could destroy the whole strategy of a nutritional diet. She will end up becoming the Marie Antoinette of the Opposition Benches, when instead of saying, "Let them eat cake", she will say, "Let them eat junk."
<P>
<B>Helen Jones </B>(Warrington, North): I want to respond briefly to the remarks of the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton. The provisions in the Bill are essential not only to children's health, but to help them to achieve a good educational standard. Anyone who has taught in school knows that many children arrive without having had breakfast; indeed, many are not adequately fed at home. We all wish that it were not true, but it is a sad fact of life. Teachers recognise such children because they lose concentration half way through the morning. Children cannot be taught properly if they are not adequately fed.
<P>
The hon. Lady has suggested that the problem can be tackled by merely introducing guidelines, but her argument is fundamentally flawed. She seemed to be saying that if children are given an inadequate diet at home, that is justification for continuing with an inadequate one at school, but surely they are the very children who need proper nutrition.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I do not recall saying any such thing. Will the hon. Lady clarify what she is saying?
<P>
<B>Helen Jones:</B> The hon. Lady said that people made different choices and that it was very difficult to get round that in school. There must be proper nutritional standards and many schools have made a great deal of effort to promote healthy eating. The sad fact is that far too many children live on a diet of chips, sausage rolls and fizzy drinks. As the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said, the hypocrisy of Conservative Members who set out to destroy the school meals service, to complain now about the results, is absolutely breathtaking. Children eat what is provided for them.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> No, they do not.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Helen Jones:</B> Yes, they do. Unless we provide children with healthy choices that are also attractive, they will continue to eat rubbish. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton said that when healthy meals were provided, such as fish, beetroot and cabbage, children did not eat them. That argument is false. It is possible to provide healthy food that is also attractive and nutritious, and which children will eat. It is essential for their education.
<P>
Healthy food is essential for the future. A ticking time bomb of obesity, heart disease and other diseases will hit our children in later life. Guidelines will not solve the problem. Regulations must be in place to ensure that children receive decent meals at school in the middle of the day. If we do not introduce that system, we will have failed them not only in respect of their health, but their education.

<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I ask the Committee to resist the amendments. It is important that by regulation, not guideline, we ensure that children have a nutritious meal during the school day. At first, I was cynical about why, in a Bill on school standards, we should have provisions relating to school meals and I took a great deal of persuading in the negotiations on its drafting.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> That is another one that the hon. Gentleman has lost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> No, I won in the end because I was convinced by the evidence. It shows clearly that there is a link between performance, improving standards in school and a healthy meal. Teachers are in no doubt about that. Anecdotal evidence, as well as comprehensive research, shows that children perform far better, particularly after lunch, if they have had a healthy and nutritious meal. There are other good reasons why we should support a high-quality school meal, but it is also part of the school standards agenda.
<P>
The previous Government also recognised that point. Yesterday evening, I read with great interest, "Eating Well at School", which was the guidance issued by the previous Government. I am sure that the hon. Lady had a role to play in formulating it. Under the heading:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Why Children's Eating Habits Matter",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"What children and young adults eat is important for ... their development of healthy lifestyles to last into adulthood ... their resistance to illness ... their health, growth and development ... their concentration and performance at school".</ul></font>
<P>
That is absolutely right, but the previous Government did nothing about it. They simply issued guidelines and produced pleasant brochures.
<P>
If we are to guarantee a high-quality meal during the school day, it must be done by regulation. A few years ago, regulations were repealed by the previous Government. Since then, coupled with the effects of compulsory competitive tendering, there has been a dramatic decline both in the uptake of school meals and in their quality. That has had a detrimental effect on health and concentration and the development of the individual child.
[Mr. Byers]
<P>
We do not want to return to the days when there was an enormous prescription of what schools could and could not provide. Another document that I was reading yesterday evening the delights of being a Government Minister contained the detailed regulations that were issued in 1966 about school meal quantities and the type of provision that should be made available. I noticed particularly that beef played a prominent part in those regulations. Under the heading, "Stewing, Braising and Boiling", are the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"beef, silverside, topside, chuck, shoulder steak, neck, flank, brisket and clod and sticking."</ul></font>
<P>
I am setting a test for the hon. Lady as a former Minister with responsibility for food. I am sure that the Committee would like to know the meaning of clod and sticking, and whether it is better stewed, braised or boiled. The mind boggles. The regulations went into detail about the proportions of meat that should be home killed or imported. Roasting beef and all lamb and mutton had to be 50 per cent. home killed and 50 per cent. imported. Stewing, braising or boiling beef had to be 25 per cent. home killed and 75 per cent. imported, whereas veal which was part of the school meal diet in 1966 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If members of the Committee are to have any lunch, I shall have to restrict the culinary detail. Perhaps the Minister would return to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Veal was all imported in those days.
<P>
My official have kindly provided me with a definition of clod [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not certain that that is in order either, but we are all dying to hear it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> When you have heard what it is, Mr. Gale, you may be less enthusiastic. For the benefit of the Committee,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Clod is a British English term for a rather grisly cut of beef taken from the animal's neck. Presumably coined for its being a solid and unpromising lump of meat, it is first recorded in Queen Elizabeth's Household Book (1601): `He hath for his fee two cloddes, one little rumpe, chine of beefe, of every oxe that is sent to the Queene's house'."</ul></font>
<P>
I am grateful to my officials for ensuring that the Committee has the benefit of that definition. We still do not know what "sticking" is.
<P>
There is a serious point here. We recognise the importance of providing nutritious school meals. They must be meals that children will eat I take the point that we can provide the most healthy and nutritious meal in the world, but if it is not appealing to children, it will not be eaten. We must look at school meals in a slightly different way and make them exciting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> It is interesting that we were given more detail on clod than we received the other day on the test for aptitude. Perhaps that is an interesting comment on the work of the civil servants for which we thank them.
<P>
We support the general tenor of the Minister's argument, but does he agree that the cost of meals is also crucial? Unless we get the cost right especially at secondary level children opt out and eat at the burger bar. At primary level, parents may opt for sandwiches that are often less nutritious than anything that children would be given in school. Are the Government prepared to put significant resources into ensuring compliance with their regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The quality of the meal is again the issue. Nutritional standards will be agreed after consultation with local authority caterers and the private sector companies involved in providing school meals, so that we set standards that can be accommodated within budgetary constraints. It is for local authorities to decide how much they want to spend on the school meal service. They should provide a meal that is attractive to school children, but that also provides the nutritional elements that are so important.
<P>
It is important to ensure such provision by regulation, not just to leave it to guidance. For those reasons, I ask the Committee to resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Perhaps I could begin with clod. I thought at first that the Minister was still talking about the 1960s, and I thought, "Gosh, I was training in the 1960s, so I ought to know this." Then he mentioned that the definition came from 1601, which is a wee bit before my time.
<P>
All sorts of cuts of meat were included in the light that the Minister read from the regulations, including topside, which is a prime cut which, if butchered properly, contains little fat or gristle. Topside, a cut which comes from the neck of the animal, would be considered protein for the purpose of the nutritional requirements, but if we consider how much of it might be edible or ultimately consumed by the child, that demonstrates the danger of prescribing in regulations strict requirements such as a certain number of grammes of protein. Anyone seeking to stick to the letter of the law could pick and choose which cut they cooked, yet the nutritional content of different cuts of meat may be quite different. The danger of statutory regulations is that they provide a requirement to comply, but not necessarily to comply in the intended way.
<P>
From my background in the culinary arts and crafts, I think that clod, if cooked for many hours, ideally in a clay pot with plenty of seasoning 
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> What vegetables would accompany it?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I do not know whether I am allowed to answer the hon. Member for Bath now, Mr. Gale. I shall tell him later.
<P>
The amendments are not intended to challenge the need for nutritionally balanced meals for school. children. As I have said, I see what the Minister is trying to achieve but I do not think that he has chosen the right mechanism. It is not true that the previous Government simply produced glossy brochures on this matter. We produced working materials, to be used in the classroom by teachers and pupils, that helped to inform them about nutrition in an attractive and appealing way. That helped to bring a dry subject into their everyday lives. They need knowledge of nutrition, and that information cannot be offered to them at too young an age.
<P>
I hear what the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) says about junk food. He mentioned crisps, but I could make a case in favour of the intake of potassium through crisps. There is no such thing as a bad food or ingredient, but there are such thinks as bad diets. That is where we should be trying to educate children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> I am not pouring scorn on the efforts of previous or future Governments to make nutrition an attractive classroom subject; that must be done. However, I was using crisps to make the point that too many children do not have a hot meal at lunch time or dinner time, as we call it in Blackpool. They have crisps, sandwiches and fizzy drinks, as my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones) has said.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Teachers, governing bodies and parents can determine what does or does not constitute satisfactory provision of school meals. They have that power. If teachers feel that providers are currently providing meals that do not meet the best interests of the children, they can have an input into changing that.
<P>
The position will not be changed by statutory requirement. One could make a clear rota for a week's nutritionally balanced school meals which would not necessarily achieve what the Minister wants. Governing bodies, LEAs and teachers have power over the selection, attractiveness and balance of food. They can, if they wish, say that they are not satisfied and make changes. The clause does not alter that.
<P>
I fear that the Bill will create a requirement to provide meals without ensuring that the meals are taken up. I accept what the hon. Member for Blackpool, South said about children for whom the school meal is the key meal of the day. That is a very important point, but unless those meals are taken up and that is the test it will not help his constituents or the children that he mentioned. I have every sympathy with what the Government are trying to achieve, but they are not going about it in the right way. For that reason, I wish to press the amendment to a vote.

<B>The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 67, That the clause stand part of the Bill:</B> 
<P>

<H4><center>Clause 103</center></H4>
<H4><center>Extension of LEA functions concerning school lunches, etc.</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I have a question for the Minister. I want to make sure that I have correctly interpreted the wording of proposed subsection (1A) in clause 103(2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A local education authority shall, if requested to do so by or on behalf of any registered pupils at a school maintained by the authority, provide school lunches for those pupils".</ul></font>
<P>
The clause then goes on to outline the detail behind that. Is it the Government's intention that the primary provision of school meals should be provided by the LEA? In other words, is the purpose of the clause to eliminate private sector providers and competitive tendering? Will the Minister explain what the word "provide" in that context means?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The provisions would not cut across the existing regime for local government services the one that we inherited from the previous Government or the best value policy that the Government want to implement for local government services. Most important, combined with new clause 7 which I hope we shall debate later this morning if the regulations on local management delegate responsibility for school meals to schools, this clause will ensure that schools can choose who provides the meals. The issue is not about reserving provision for one organisation, whether that is the local authority direct labour organisation or a private sector caterer; it is about ensuring that whoever provides school meals will provide meals of sufficient nutritional standard. Clause 103 complements clause 102 by stating that schools will be under a duty to provide a school lunch.

Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 359.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> This new clause follows on nicely from our previous discussion. Hon. Members will remember that a few weeks ago, when we discussed schemes for local management, we considered the possibility of delegating certain functions from the local authority to schools. One issue that could be delegated would be that of school meals, which has traditionally been regarded as a local authority function. The money for school meals is not delegated to individual schools. After consultation we might decide that school meals and the budget attached to them should be delegated to individual schools, and, if so, we would also want the duties and responsibilities applying under clauses 102 and 103 to be delegated to individual schools. New clause 7 would ensure that those responsibilities would follow the budget, which is wholly appropriate. For those reasons, we feel it necessary to include in the Bill new clause 7 and Government amendment No. 359.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I have no difficulty with the Minister's basic proposition; indeed, I strongly agree with it. It raises a different but related question: how many other powers currently held by he LEA, which we may wish to delegate to schools on policy grounds, would we not be able to delegate without the inclusion of this new clause? The Minister and I share a desire to see the delegation of budgets to schools, and without the new clause it would be impossible to achieve that with regard to school meals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> My understanding is that the new clause was required specifically because of the changes introduced by clauses 102 and 103 regarding school meals and the related duties and responsibilities. My understanding is that no other measures are needed, but I undertake to write to the right hon. Gentleman to confirm that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that undertaking. Given the policy drift towards local management, we should not put an education Bill on the statute book that robs us of the opportunity to delegate responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I want to ask the Minister about subsection (2)(c), which refers to the obligation to provide school milk free of charge. Given that the track record of LEAs on providing school milk has been somewhat patchy, what changes does the Minister have in mind?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The problem is the restrictions that currently apply to free school milk. People may not believe it, but free school milk can be distributed to pupils only at lunchtime. Clause 103 will allow free school milk to be distributed either at the beginning of the school day if a school has a breakfast club or at the midday break. At present, however, we do not have the power to do that. We inherited the restriction under which free school milk must be distributed at lunchtime from the previous Government. Clause 103 says that there should be flexibility in the provision of free school milk, and we will delegate so that individual schools will be able to exercise that flexibility.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> May I probe a little further? The Minister will know that at present LEAs in many parts of the country choose not to make milk available to schools. If the responsibility to distribute milk is to be delegated to schools, they will have the freedom to choose rather than being subject to a universal obligation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The thrust of the proposals is that the duties and responsibilities that currently apply at local authority level will move down as the money moves down, if the budget for school meals and milk is delegated to individual schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Will the Minister clarify one or two points? Much of the new clause flies in the face of what he said in the previous debate about trying to ensure that standards are maintained. However, I do not want to return to that debate.
<P>
Will the Minister clarify how the budget will be devolved to schools? Will it be devolved through the existing formula system, which would make it a per capita agreement whereby the relevant amounts for free school meals would be added by the LEAs back into the school budgets? Alternatively, will the Minister allow LEAs discretion to permit schools with significant numbers of children who are entitled to free school meals to weight the budget allocation accordingly? It is clearly nonsense to apply equality across all schools in an LEA area, especially when some schools have many children who have home-school problems and who rely on benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> As I have made clear several times, the budget that is held at local authority level will be delegated to individual schools. The distribution will be based on a formula that is fair to those schools.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): It is important that governing bodies are given that responsibility. I was slightly bemused when I read the new clause. Having sat on a governing body that discussed whether it would provide school meals with finance from its local authority, I was slightly surprised to see that that was apparently not permitted by the previous legislation. Flexibility is important. Moreover, school meals are more likely to be nutritional and to be taken up by children if decisions about what will be in those meals are made at the school level, with a school cook taking an interest and parents having an input.

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
This is a technical change to allow governors of foundation schools to be ex officio trustees.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> New clause 2 would extend the prohibition that currently exists on corporal punishment to cover all pupils in the private sector. Amendment No. 36, to clause 111, would ensure protection against corporal punishment for all pupils in nursery education as defined in the Bill. Clause 111 as drafted protects only those pupils in nursery education that is provided or supported by the local education authority.
<P>
I am fundamentally opposed to corporal punishment, in principle and in practice. The House has had many opportunities to debate the issue. On examining a previous debate, on 28 January 1997, I was especially struck by remarks made by the former Member for Luton, North, Mr. John Carlisle:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Some of us are somewhat proud of the old school tie. I am wearing mine tonight in deference to the punishment that was inflicted on me and that I inflicted on others on the basis that, in many cases, it is ultimately the only answer to a terrible problem." [Official Report, 28 January 1997; Vol. 289, c. 230.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I fear that the quality of contributions from hon. Members on that occasion was not especially high. I hope that the former Member for Luton, North would now at least acknowledge that there is no evidence that corporal punishment has any beneficial effects. It certainly does not act, as many people want us to believe, as a deterrent. The 1989 Elton Committee examined that issue. It concluded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there is little evidence that Corporal Punishment was in general an effective deterrent either to the pupils punished or to other pupils."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Indeed, so ineffective is corporal punishment as a deterrent that, with the exception of the United Kingdom, no European country, east or west, allows corporal punishment in any of its schools.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>

<P>
Corporal punishment is also a matter of principle; it is a question of fundamental human rights. Three key international human rights monitoring bodies have each expressed concern at the continued legality of corporal punishment in this country; and all three bodies have formally recommended its prohibition. To delay that long overdue reform would not be compatible with the Government's clearly stated commitments to human rights. I therefore hope that they will support the amendments.
<P>
Those principled and practical arguments against corporal punishment apply equally to the private sector. The legality of corporal punishment is particularly dangerous in the relatively unsupervised and much less inspected private sector. I hope that all members of the Committee are particularly concerned at the use of corporal punishment on children at nursery school.
<P>
I said that three international bodies have recently studied the matter. In 1986, following a series of decisions by the European Commission and the European Court of Human Rights, the previous Government introduced legislation to end corporal punishment in all state-supported education. Those decisions are now consolidated in sections 548 and 549 of the Education Act 1996.
<P>
Sadly, the previous Government continued to defend the right of fee-paying parents to have their children beaten. Full prohibition, however, is supported by all the teaching unions and by other education organisations, including many that represent the independent sector and, of course, by all child welfare and child protection groups.
<P>
The national commission of inquiry into the prevention of child abuse, convened by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and chaired by Lord Williams of Mostyn, now a junior Minister at the Home Office, recommended full prohibition, as did the commission on children and violence, chaired by Sir William Utting.
<P>
Sir William was appointed by the previous Government to review the safeguards for children living away from home. His report, "People Like Us", recommended that corporal punishment in independent schools should be abolished. He was particularly concerned with children living away from home and pointed out that corporal punishment was not an effective way of discouraging children from committing physical violence themselves. It is nonsense to suggest that corporal punishment is an effective means of persuading children not to use physical violence against others.
<P>
In 1995, the human right committee, which oversees the international covenant on civil and political rights, and the committee on the rights of the child, which oversees the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, both expressed concern about the persisting legality of corporal punishment for some pupils, and formally recommended abolition to the UK Government. Even more recently, in December 1997, a third treaty body, the committee on economic, social and cultural rights, stated that it was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"alarmed by the fact that corporal punishment continues to be practised in schools which are privately financed, and at the statement by the delegation that the government does not intend to eliminate the practice".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I quote that, because the delegation sent by the UK Government clearly indicated that it was not the new Government's intention to eliminate the practice. I hope that that view has now changed.
<P>
The committee also recommended that the Government should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"take appropriate steps to eliminate corporal punishment in those schools in which this practice is still permitted".
<P>
That is the purpose of the amendments.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Brady:</B> I should like to pursue one point. The hon. Gentleman seems to be arguing that corporal punishment is wrong in all circumstances. Would he support legislation banning parents from using it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> That is outside the scope of the new clause. I have strong views about using physical violence against children or any human being. The new clause seeks to remove corporal punishment from independent schools and from other non-state funded providers of early years education. The previous Government thought it right to introduce legislation abolishing corporal punishment in state schools. I found it bizarre that they did not extend that prohibition to independent schools. The new clause would enable us to complete the job started in 1986, so that we fall into line with every other European country and abolish corporal punishment once and for all in all out schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I rise briefly to speak on a subject that the Conservative party has always dealt with on a free vote basis. I therefore speak only in a personal capacity.
<P>
I do not agree with the new clause. We all know that corporal punishment in the independent sector is extremely rare. I do not agree with those who argue that such punishment is in all circumstances contrary to the rights of the child. Each of us has to make up his own mind about the issue. The hon. Gentleman is of course entitled to quote various bodies, but I do not find their arguments persuasive. No one is in favour of corporal punishment that constitutes abuse of children, but the case has not been made for it to be illegal in all circumstances. I shall continue to support the status quo.

<P>

<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): As has been said, a strong moral element is involved. I sympathise with those who support a free vote, but from my experience, which included attending a school that used corporal punishment vigorously, I would have said at the time I believe that we should abandon it. I am glad that the right hon. Member for Charnwood acknowledged that its use in the private sector has withered. There is an argument for simply allowing it to die out, but I believe that as we move into the new millennium, Parliament should consider outlawing a practice that was better placed in the previous century. The issue should not be delegated to a modest Standing Committee; the whole House would appreciate debate about it. Implementation of the ban would be more effective as a result. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will acknowledge the desire of many hon. Members for such a debate. I shall support the case that has predominated for many years: that corporal punishment belongs to the past, has no place in the modern environment and should be abolished.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty </B>(Harrow, East): Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner), I do not accept that there is a moral dimension to corporal punishment. Child abuse in any form is immoral. Corporal punishment of any sort is child abuse. I understand the right hon. Member for Charnwood's argument for a free vote. That is right and proper. However, I find it perverse to talk of a moral dimension and matters of conscience.
<P>
I shall come clean about my background, because the fact may not have figured in the lists that the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton went through: I was a grammar school boy. At my Catholic grammar school, there was a particularly perverse physical education teacher it always seems to be them who took great delight in giving the slipper to anyone who got back from lunch after 2 pm. It did not work as a deterrent. By the time we were 15 or 16, many of us were minded to give him the slipper back. He was a short little runt. I shall remember him until my dying day, not because he put me in order through corporal punishment, but because I have wanted to meet him in a dark alley one day to give him some back.
<P>
Corporal punishment does not teach children any worthwhile lessons. I agree with the hon. Member for Bath that the job remains unfinished. It is perverse to allow any form of corporal punishment in any institution that declares itself educational. The independent sector has no right to be excluded and given the privilege to thrash children just because the parents are paying for it. It is equally perverse to argue that parents have a human right to pay schools for the privilege of having their children thrashed at any time. The practice is wrong, outdated and arcane. The sooner it is behind us in all educational institutions, the better for all concerned, particularly our children.
<P>
<B>Helen Jones:</B> I have sympathy with the new clause. The hon. Member for Bath quoted organisations that had produced evidence to support his argument. I shall not go through those arguments again. From my experience, corporal punishment is ineffective and barbaric. I remember the cane being administered regularly after every break even at primary school. The same people lined up to be caned day after day. It did not work and it taught the wrong lessons. It teaches children that force will get them what they want and that it is all right to hit someone if you are bigger or more powerful than them.
<P>
All of us who have children know how exasperating they can be. As a pupil and a teacher, I have known many children whose behaviour has been made worse by corporal punishment, but I have never seen one whose behaviour has been improved by it.
<P>
Children have the right to be protected. Parents have rights over their children, but not to do anything that they want. We protect children in many ways. It is time we protected children in the independent sector from the outdated and barbaric ritual of corporal punishment. The right hon. Member for Charnwood rightly pointed out that the practice is withering away even in the independent sector. It is time it was abolished. There should be a free vote on the Floor of the House. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take that on board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I oppose the new clause the Government Whip seems to find that amusing more because of the arguments that have been advanced in support of it than because of the new clause itself. All hon. Members who have argued for the new clause, beginning with the hon. Member for Bath, started from the premise that it is an abuse of human rights in all circumstances for a child to experience corporal punishment. There are serious consequences to pursuing the logic of that argument, which is that it is always wrong for parents to administer physical punishment to children you are watching me carefully, Mr. Gale, but the point is within the remit of the new clause. The argument that it is an abuse of human rights for children to undergo any physical punishment cannot stop with schools; it must apply in all circumstances. I do not doubt the sincerity of hon. Members who said that parents should be denied the right to administer such punishment, but I find the suggestion disturbing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman is struggling. He should explain the connection between the new clause and the question of whether parents should use corporal punishment. I have a view on that issue, but it is not the issue before us. Would he also explain why the previous Government whom he presumably supported,[Mr. Foster]
although he was not a member of it abolished corporal punishment in state schools, but not independent schools?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Not only was I not a member of the Government at that time, I was still at school. I thought at the time that it was wrong to introduce that legislation maybe because I never had the misfortune of suffering corporal punishment at my school.
<P>
It is infinitely better if corporal punishment is never used; it was an effective sanction. [Interruption.] Labour Members may care to reflect on the words of the Prime Minister a few days ago on the Iraqi regime he was prepared to threaten the use of force to back up diplomacy. That is what happened in my school. Caning was technically available, but was virtually never used. That is entirely right and proper.
<P>
To answer the question of the hon. Member for Bath the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) also raised the point there is a logic to the distinction between state and independent schools, although I do not personally support it. It is not inappropriate for the state to take a view on what goes on in schools funded by the state, and parents often have no choice about sending their children to state schools. The independent sector is different. Parents are not required to send their children to a given independent school; they do so entirely from choice and using their own resources. Permitting corporal punishment in that sector is therefore an essential extension of parents' rights. If parents choose to place their children in the care of a particular school, there is no logic in prohibiting their right to delegate their parental powers to the school.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that it is permissible for parents to delegate anything they do to their children, however brutal or ineffective, to independent schools?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Absolutely not. Parental use of corporal punishment is governed by law and only reasonable force may be used. It would be unacceptable for parents or anyone acting in loco parentis to do anything that the law regards as abuse. However, it is usually accepted that it is appropriate for parents to place their children in the care of responsible bodies or adults and that those bodies or adults have the same responsibilities and rights for the children in their care as the parents have.
<P>
It is disingenuous to suggest that giving powers to bodies acting in loco parentis will give them extra rights to inflict harm or abuse. I have no particular belief in corporal punishment. I do not like smacking my child; I do so occasionally, usually with the minimum of force, and I do not take pleasure in it. It is occasionally right for parents to use such punishments, which are occasionally effective. Parents must maintain that right. It is appropriate that if parents decide entirely from their own choice, with no geographical limitation 
<P>
<B>Ms Ryan:</B> The hon. Gentleman is saying that parents with certain resources can have a right that parents with children in state schools do not have. No one should have that right. The hon. Gentleman's argument is not logical.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The hon. Lady is making an eloquent argument for precisely the reverse that is, for extending that right to parents with children in state schools. She is entitled to that view. My view is quite different if parents decide, entirely from their own choice with no geographical or other restriction on their behaviour, to send their children to a certain school, they should have the right to choose the regime that persists in that school. So long as that regime is within the law, is not abusive and involves no force that would be wrong for parents to exercise, there is nothing wrong with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> When I hear Conservative Members speak, I realise why I am a Liberal Democrat. I could never subscribe to the belief that it is right for a certain sector, because of its wealth, to have what the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) describes as a privalege. I do not believe that a single parent sends his or her child to an independent school because that child will be beaten there, which is the logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument.
<P>
I confess that, as a teacher and a head, I administered corporal punishment. At my first appointment in 1963, the head teacher told me that corporal punishment was how teachers kept order in the school. He then put on a cricket glove the inner glove, not one of the thick, outer ones and asked me to cane him. Although it was a bizarre experience, I caned the head teacher because I desperately needed the job. However, he told me that I would not remain at the school unless I could use the cane properly. He then asked me to put on the cricket glove and proceeded to show me how it was done. I have never forgotten the experience of standing there, being caned by the head teacher for doing nothing wrong just applying for the job.
<P>
There is a serious point to my story. The school operated purely on the basis that the children received a stroke of the cane for any misdemeanour. Every member of staff had a punishment book and a cane. One boy in my form was caned for being late, he was caned four times later that morning for every lesson to which he did not bring his homework, he stayed for lunch, but he then ran off. He did that every day of the week because he was living rough. The only way he had a meal was by having five stokes of the cane, eating his free meal and going.
<P>
In 1986, I was head of one of the most difficult schools in an inner-city area. When the then Leeds city council proposed abolishing corporal punishment in all its schools, my staff were horrified. Indeed, my deputy, who was responsible for general discipline, thought that that might be the end of the world it was not; it was the beginning of a new relationship between the staff, the students and the parents.
<P>
If amendments similar to the new clause moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Bath are debated on the Floor of the House, we will have an opportunity to give children in the independent sector the same rights that have existed since 1986 and that it should be the right of any child who is being looked after by the state or any other institution.

<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> In this brief debate, we have heard the strong views of members of the Committee, including the right hon. Member for Charnwood and the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West who referred to schools acting in loco parentis. If parents choose to pay a fee to send their child to a particular school, that is a legitimate exercise of their choice.
<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough outlined his experience as a head teacher and we have heard my hon. Friends the Members for Harrow, East and for North-West Norfolk express their deep belief that corporal punishment is a form of child abuse and that it is inappropriate that we should go into the next century with corporal punishment being allowed in the independent sector.
<P>
It would be inappropriate for the 20 or 22 members of this Standing Committee to determine that matter, because it is one on which the whole House should vote. The Government take the view that there should be a vote on the Floor of the House. As a Minister, I shall listen to the debate and, as always, will vote with my conscience. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Bath to withdraw the motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> We have had a useful debate, but I accept the Minister's point about the merit of having a wider debate on the Floor of the House. I hope that we shall never again hear contributions such as the suggestion that one of the privileges of the wealthy is their right to pay to have their children beaten. I hope that the evidence showing that corporal punishment is completely ineffective will be acknowledged. Members of the Committee have already recounted their stories. I shall never forget seeing the punishment book at Hartcliffe school in Bristol some years ago, before I successfully moved a motion in Avon LEA to have it abolished. The book showed that in a period of only a few days, a child was beaten on 13 separate occasions, and was given three strokes of the cane each time. The reason on the first 12 occasions was for missing detention. On the 13th, the reason given was, "Missing detention, again.", which shows the utter ineffectiveness of corporal punishment.
<P>
Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of this debate is the Minister's suggestion that we shall debate the issueagain on Report, when we can finish some unfinished business. We can debate the issue of the final abolition of all forms of corporal punishment not like last time when, sadly, we debated its possible reinstatement even in state schools. Given the Minister's clear assurances about that debate on the Floor of the House, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
