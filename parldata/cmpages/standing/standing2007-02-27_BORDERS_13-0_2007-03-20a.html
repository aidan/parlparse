						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032047000339"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> These are highly technical amendments. Their
purpose is simple: to ensure that the appeal procedures under clause 31
operate effectively. We want to ensure that three things dovetail
neatly together: first, the powers for automatic deportation that we
seek; secondly, the non-suspension of appeal regime that we are putting
in place, and thirdly, the appeal system that we have sketched out in
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07032047000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments Nos. 111 and 114 are designed to ensure that in-country
appeals can be brought only on arguable human rights and asylum
grounds. Once we have made a decision automatically to deport an
individual and they are still in the country, they usually lodge an
appeal with the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. That appeal can
contain human rights or asylum claims, but as it is an in-country
appeal, it is harder to remove the individual from the country to
conduct an appeal that is made on other grounds. Where the claim on
human rights or asylum grounds is spurious, we want to be able to
certify the claim as unfounded, to stop fraudulent or abusive human
rights and asylum claims.</div>
					<a name="07032047000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The existing certification
powers apply to a claim only before the notice of appeal is lodged with
the tribunal. To use the powers that we want to create in the Bill, we
need to be able to stop the appeal by temporarily withdrawing the
decision automatically to deport, so that we can consider the claim,
certify it as unfounded and remake the decision automatically to
deport. The effect of that process would be to invalidate any further
appeal that is lodged, because the claim has been certified. The appeal
would then have to be heard outside the country, if there is still an
appeal to be heard. That is simply to ensure that the process of
automatic deportation is not hampered by the construction of the
law.</div>

						<a name="07032047000340"></a>
							<b class="B">Damian
Green</b> (Ashford) (Con): I have some sympathy with what the
Government are trying to achieve with this group of amendments. I have
a couple 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>of questions, however. The Minister talked about in-country appeals
having to be unarguable, thereby removing the possibility of unfounded
appeals. He will be aware that that interpretation will be in dispute.
We have all seen instances in which officialdom regards the case for an
appeal as unfounded and regards it as unarguable that an appeal should
not be allowed. Nevertheless, that is what people pay lawyers for: to
argue cases that the other side thinks unarguable. Will the Minister
give a bit more detail as to the circumstances in which a case would be
regarded as either unarguable or
unfounded?</div>
					<a name="07032047000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister may correct me on this point, but my understanding of the
amendments suggests that the Secretary of State will decide whether an
appeal is unfounded. If the Secretary of State is not merely judge and
jury in his own cases, but is deciding whether there can be a judge and
jury in a case on which he has already taken a decision, that is a
recipe for judicial review. I have sympathy with the underlying aim of
reducing unnecessary legal delays in the system of arriving at a
decision about deportation, but I suspect that in practice there might
be one or two gremlins hidden in the interstices of the amendments. I
would be grateful if the Minister could address
them.</div>
					
					<a name="07032047000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032047000341"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> Those are extremely helpful points, which I can
clarify. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his sympathetic
hearing and I wish to make two points in response. The first is that
there is already a process whereby the Secretary of State can certify
claims as clearly unfounded, and it operates for asylum claims. We can
get a sense of the number of decisions being taken from statistics that
are available: for example, between November 2002 and early 2006
something like 5,500 claims were certified by the Secretary of State as
clearly unfounded.</div>
					<a name="07032047000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman is
absolutely right that there is the prospect of judicial review.
Parliament has some history of debating whether there should be
procedures for ousting the process of judicial review. We have had that
debate and we have no ambition to return to it. Judicial review is with
us, and there are no plans in the Bill to oust, diminish or in any way
undermine it. The hon. Gentleman will be interested to know that
something like 9 per cent. of the asylum claims that the Secretary of
State certified as unfounded in the period that I mentioned were
subject to judicial review. He is right to say that there is the
potential for judicial review of some decisions, but on the basis of
our experience that potential is reasonably low. Only 358 judicial
review claims were upheld, as a result of which only 63
certificates were withdrawn. That is a relatively small number given
the number of claims
certified.</div>
					<a name="07032047000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about the grounds on which certification may be
appropriate. They include cases in which no fear of mistreatment has
been expressed, in which the fear of mistreatment is not objective, in
which the feared mistreatment clearly does not amount to persecution or
in which sufficient protection or internal relocation is available. The
hon. Gentleman asked important questions, and we have four or five
years of experience of ensuring that the system works well enough in a
reasonably complex area. That is why we intend to extend its
scope.</div>

James Clappison</b> (Hertsmere) (Con): I beg to move amendment
No. 56, in page 14, line 32, at end
add&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(8) A person convicted
of an offence and made subject to a deportation order either under the
provisions of this section or otherwise may not be awarded compensation
in respect of any period spent in custody following their conviction,
whether the period in custody formed part of their sentence or
not.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07032047000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to place a bar on offenders made subject to
a deportation order receiving compensation. Part of the background to
it is that Lin Homer, the director general of the immigration and
nationality directorate, recently wrote to the Chairman of the Select
Committee on Home Affairs, the right hon. Member for Southampton,
Itchen (Mr. Denham), on the subject of foreign prisoners
facing deportation. She told him
that</div>
					<a name="07032047000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;since 1 April 2006
the Department has paid or payments are being processed to 9 claimants
and the sum total of these taken together is
&#163;55,000...Typically, compensation has been paid out in
these cases due to technical deficiencies around serving the detainee
with appropriate legal
documents.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032047000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendment would prevent any prisoner rightfully convicted from
receiving compensation in respect of time spent in custody. Two points
support that proposition: first, that the prisoners are the architects
of their own misfortune, and whatever else might happen to them and
whatever other rights they enjoy, they have only themselves to blame
for committing offences. Secondly&#151;and even more
saliently&#151;for them to receive compensation is unacceptable to
the general public, and particularly to the victims of their offending.
They must find the receipt of compensation by the perpetrators most
offensive&#151;not least because the victims of the crimes might not
receive any compensation themselves. It is unlikely, in many cases,
that the offenders will have the means to pay compensation to their
victims.</div>
					<a name="07032047000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
victims have to use the criminal injuries compensation scheme for
compensation, they will find that its ambit is very limited and that
the amounts of compensation that are paid&#151;and that is not
applicable in every case&#151;are often relatively modest, even by
the standards of today&#146;s compensation culture. That is one part
of the legal world where the compensation culture does not seem to have
taken root. I invite Members to consider the tariff set down by the
Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority&#151;I think that most
people would come to the conclusion that it is somewhat
modest.</div>
					<a name="07032047000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
unacceptable that rightfully convicted foreign offenders receive
compensation. I believe that the Government will welcome the provision
where the operation of deportation is concerned because, with the best
will in the world, it does not always run smoothly, as the Minister
knows. There are sometimes difficulties regarding the country to which
the person is to be deported. Sometimes, for their convenience, the
Government do not want to be put under the pressure of facing a claim
for compensation, in respect of decisions that they take about the fate
of individual prisoners. The courts might come to a different 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>conclusion under the relevant treaty provisions and decide that
compensation is payable.</div>
					<a name="07032047000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is hard to see circumstances
in which the public will find it acceptable that those criminals should
receive compensation. If the Minister is not with me on that, will he
tell me exactly why not and if there is any legal reason why a bar on
compensation for foreign prisoners cannot be put in place, or if there
is a policy reason why this cannot be done, and if so, what that is? I
hope that this is a way of solving a problem that the Government have
come up against in the past and might come up against in the future,
and that they will welcome the
amendment.</div>

						 I rise to support the amendment and to add
one narrow but important point. My hon. Friend talked about how the
Government have suffered problems with the issue of compensation in the
past and might again in the future. I would make the point that they
are suffering from it at present. It is a continuing problem and, as
the Minister will be aware, I have asked some written questions about
the numbers receiving compensation and the levels of compensation. Tens
of thousands of pounds have been paid out recently to foreign prisoners
who have been kept in over the time of their sentence because of the
Government&#146;s inability to deport them. I know that many
taxpayers will feel that that is, at however small a level, a ludicrous
waste of public
money.</div>

						<a name="07032047000344"></a>
							<b class="B">David
T.C. Davies</b> (Monmouth) (Con): I join my hon. Friend in
supporting the amendment. Does he think that there is any country to
which people cannot be deported, when the Government have shown that
when they wish to rescue people who have been fighting with Jihadi
terrorists they are able to send private jets into countries such as
Somalia at very short notice and at great cost in order to pick people
up? Yet they seem to have this inability to send violent serial
rapists, murderers and other criminals back to countries such as
Somalia.</div>

							<a name="07032047000345"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point, but I think
it is slightly beyond the scope of the amendment. The wider point about
the ability to deport criminals is a difficulty that the Government
have faced and have not yet addressed satisfactorily. Regardless of the
destination of these would-be deportees, I am sure that nobody paying
taxes in this country feels that it is a good use of their money to pay
compensation to people who have been convicted of a serious enough
offence in this country to have been jailed for it, and who are also
eligible to be deported from this country, suggesting that they should
never have been here in the first
place.</div>

							<a name="07032047000346"></a>Mr.
Clappison:
						</b> My hon. Friend mentions the sums that are paid
out. I cited the figure of nine defendants receiving a total of
&#163;55,000, which by my inadequate mathematics comes out at
slightly over &#163;6,000 per criminal. That would be a nice bonus
for a criminal. Would my hon. Friend share my interest in knowing what
these nine offenders were convicted of in the first
place?</div>

								Damian
Green:
						</b> That is exactly right. That is an extremely good
question and one that I hope the Minister can address when he responds.
Notwithstanding the deep problems that the Government are in, I am sure
that the purpose of my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment is to help and to
give proper teeth to this important clause. We support the underlying
principles of the clause but we want to make it effective. We want to
get the Minister off one of the many hooks that his job entails him
being on, which is shelling out taxpayers&#146; money to people who
richly do not deserve it. I hope that the amendment can help him to
solve that
problem.</div>
					
					<a name="07032047000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032047000348"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hertsmere for
his exercise in lifting me off hooks that I find myself on in my day
job. I am enormously sympathetic to the ambitions of the amendment. The
hon. Gentleman, as a member of the Home Affairs Committee, has followed
the evidence on this question in some detail in both the evidence
sessions and the written correspondence that the director general of
the immigration and nationality directorate has
provided.</div>
					<a name="07032047000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The points
that I would make fall into two halves. First, IND should not be
operating a business in such a way that results in actions being taken
that then create claims for compensation downstream. I am doing this
from memory, but I believe that those nine cases were some time ago and
it was a deficiency in IND&#146;s technical process at that time that
led to the papers being served inappropriately. That simply should not
happen. It is a further argument for much stronger oversight of the way
that IND operates its enforcement capability across its business. These
are very often situations that simply should not be allowed to
arise.</div>
					<a name="07032047000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment
individuals have the defence of the courts if they are being held. It
is quite permissible for somebody to apply to the AIT for an
immigration bail hearing. There are judicial remedies such as the
ability to seek judicial review or habeas corpus protection, if an
individual believes that they are being unlawfully detained. It is
perfectly possible for the individual to invoke the right of the
courts. It is down to the courts to decide whether we are detaining
someone lawfully or not. If we are detaining someone lawfully, they
will not be entitled to compensation, but if we are detaining people
unlawfully, the courts should let people out. I would like to be able
to deport people faster to certain parts of the world. However, we need
only look at what is happening in Zimbabwe, for example, to see some of
the arguments for why enforced returns are
difficult.</div>
					<a name="07032047000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my
office, we think that there are few, if any, no-go zones for
deportations. The hon. Member for Monmouth is right that parts of the
world were traditionally thought of as hard to remove to, but to where,
through the efforts of my noble Friend Lord Triesman, we are now
opening up routes back; Somaliland is a very good example. I have
recently received an enormous amount of correspondence about an
enforced charter return to the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
because people were saying that it is not a safe place to return people
to. However, the DRC is a landmass the size of western Europe. There
are parts of that country that are perfectly safe and where
international evidence shows that it is perfectly safe to remove people
to, but sometimes the court will arrive at a different view. That is
why the AIT 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>
						is currently reviewing whether we should be allowed
to return people forcibly to Zimbabwe. We continue with voluntary
returns, but the courts have currently put a bar on forced
returns.</div>

								David
T.C. Davies:
						</b> In his usual eloquent manner, the Minister
makes two points very well. One issue is whether or not it is possible
to deport people to certain places. I would say that flying planes into
some areas is difficult, but there are other ways of doing it. The
second, wider issue, which he raised first, is whether sending people
back to countries like Zimbabwe is morally right. It may be fairly easy
physically to send them back, but my wider point, which we should have
the guts to say, is that somebody who repeatedly breaks our
laws&#151;who robs, rapes and commits murder, grievous bodily harm or
other violent offences that merit prison sentences&#151;ought to lose
the right not to be deported. If they then come to harm in those
countries, that is their own fault for breaking the law; it is not our
responsibility to harbour criminals in this
country.</div>

						</b> Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Amess.
The hon. Gentleman raises a number of important arguments. I will look
for an opportunity to respond to some of his good points during the
course of the day.</div>
					<a name="07032047000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second half of my comments are in reply to the hon. Member for
Hertsmere. He asked if there is a legal barrier to us accepting the
amendment&#151;yes, there is. Article 5(5) of the European convention
on human rights requires provision in domestic law of an enforceable
right to compensation. However extensive my sympathy for his amendment,
to have no right of enforcement against IND when IND gets something
wrong is not desirable, because that would weaken the incentive for IND
to perform its business effectively, efficiently and justly. I think
that the amendment might set up an unhelpful set of incentives. Second,
there is the bar of the ECHR, which also provides bars on our ability
to deport people to certain torture, if not death. I know that that is
for a debate about immigration policy in the round, but some of the
protections are important and this is one of
them.</div>

								Mr.
Clappison:
						</b> I do not want to go along the path of whether
or not people should be deported in circumstances such as those just
outlined. On the question of compensation, the Minister quotes the
ECHR. I do not have the ECHR in front of me, but can he read out the
relevant provision to the Committee,
please?</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman is very good at such questions.
Unfortunately, I do not have the text of the ECHR in front of
me&#151;however, it is arriving quickly from left field. Article 5(5)
very clearly
says:</div>
					<a name="07032047000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Everyone
who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the
provisions of this article shall have an enforceable right to
compensation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032047000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Article
5 is the right to liberty and security. There are ECHR barriers that
prevent me, sympathetic as I am, from accepting the hon.

							<a name="07032047000354"></a>Mr.
Clappison:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for the spirit in
which he responded. However, one could summarise the first part of his
answer as him saying that he hopes from now on that the immigration and
nationality directorate will always get things right. If nothing else,
I admire his confidence in his own abilities in that regard. I do not
want to be unkind to him, but I gently remind him that I heard his
predecessors say similar things about the IND. My recollection goes
back to 1999, when the present Leader of the House, before certain
other reincarnations, was the Home Secretary; I remember him appearing
before the Special Select Committee considering the Immigration and
Asylum Act 1999. I remember that his words were that the single most
important task that he had in front of him as Home Secretary was to get
the IND right, and to make sure that things ran smoothly in future.
With no disrespect to the Minister, I do not share his confidence that
the IND will always get things right, at least as far as observing that
every strict provision and possible interpretation of the law is
concerned, and that there will never be a case brought against the IND
in future, not least by foreign criminals claiming compensation. I
cannot accept that, with the best will in the world.</div>
					<a name="07032047000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the Minister&#146;s point
about a prisoner having the right to the remedy of judicial review,
that is fair enough; they have that remedy. They can seek judicial
review on the ground that they have been unlawfully detained, and the
courts may say that they should be set at liberty. That is one thing,
but it is altogether another for them to be paid compensation as well,
and that is where the statutory bar would come into place.</div>
					<a name="07032047000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the question of the ECHR, if
the Government would like to accept the amendment, but feel that they
cannot because of their interpretation of the ECHR, I would want to
have a very close look at the wording of that convention and the way in
which it has been interpreted by the courts. We often find in this
country that the problem is the Government&#146;s fear of the ECHR,
or their fear of an adverse interpretation of the ECHR. That leads the
Government to take a cautious view of when they would be contravening
the convention, or not. That cautious interpretation can have the
effect of the Government acting in ways that the public find
unacceptable. I am a great supporter of human rights, but I do not feel
that they should extend so far as compensation for periods spent in
custody by foreign criminals as a result of technical deficiencies,
which is what happened in the case I cited to the Committee.</div>
					<a name="07032047000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept what the Minister
says, but I am worried that there is a tendency on the part of the
Government, which has been present throughout the Bill and which he has
done his best to get round, to introduce tough-seeming measures that
are then continuously watered down because of fears of the
Government&#146;s interpretation of the legal consequences. The
lawyers get at what the Government want to do, and it is watered down
and watered down, so that automatic deportation for imprisonable
offences becomes automatic deportation for imprisonment, which then
becomes automatic deportation for 12 months&#146; imprisonment for
certain offences. It is watered down all the way along the
line.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div>
					<a name="07032047000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">There seems to be a paralysis
striking the Government, who are afraid of the most far-fetched
examples of possible injustices that might mean contravention of the
European convention and other conventions. There is a worry there, and
if nothing else, I should emphasise the degree of disquiet that the
public feel at paying compensation to foreign criminals, who are the
architects of their own misfortune in offending in the first place, and
at the disparity between the treatment of the criminals and the
victims. I would be extremely interested to know if any of the victims
of the offenders whom I have quoted&#151;the minor offenders who
received just over &#163;6,000 each&#151;received a penny piece in
compensation. I do not know the answer, but I suspect that victims of
foreign criminals do not always receive much in the way of
compensation, if any. In the light of all those matters, I will be
pressing this to a Division.</div>

							<a name="07032047000370"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> I will speak to amendments Nos. 126 and 140, which
stand in my name; I am aware that they are grouped with others from
various hon. Friends. Both of these are essentially probing amendments
about the capacity of the Home Office to deport foreign criminals in an
effective manner.</div>
					<a name="07032047000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
effect of amendment Nos. 126 would be to require the Secretary of State
to deport a foreign criminal within six months of a deportation order
being made. I would be interested to know what systems and manpower the
Minister has in place to ensure, once the orders have been made and due
process has been gone through, that the Home Office will get these
criminals out of the country.</div>
					<a name="07032047000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">From our previous discussion,
the Committee will be aware that this is a continuing problem, as the
Government recognise; indeed, part of the purpose of this entire
segment of the Bill is to address that. Whatever the aspirations of
Government about criminals not staying in this country if it is
possible and desirable to deport them, it simply does not happen often
enough at present. If it does eventually happen, it is often too late
and, as we were discussing in the previous debate, after expensive
compensation claims have been made on the taxpayer.</div>
					<a name="07032047000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Committee will
hear some practicalities from the Minister this morning. No doubt he
would regard it as extremely desirable to deport a criminal within six
months of the making of a deportation order. I suspect that the general
public would feel that this was itself rather lax; I dare say that
there would be a view that, if a deportation order has been made, then
perhaps one could give a week for various things to happen, and that
six months seems a long time for someone to be here&#151;in detention
or prison, no doubt, and therefore at vast expense to the taxpayer. I
am not urging the Minister to do anything that he does not want to
do&#151;still less, anything that the general public would not want
him to do fairly quickly. I am seeking to establish whether he would be
capable of doing this.</div>
					<a name="07032047000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of amendment No. 140
would be to require the Home Office to start proceedings for
deportation at least six months before the earliest release date for a
person serving more than 12 months, or on the date of a final appeal to
termination for those serving less than 12 months.</div>
					<a name="07032047000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">That, too, is very topical; it
relates to a problem that I am sure the Minister and his officials are
grappling with. The Home Secretary has said that it is vital to
consider deportation early in a prisoner&#146;s term of imprisonment
if we are to avoid a fiasco such as that of last May&#151;which led
to the sacking of the previous Home Secretary&#151;when we discovered
that foreign criminals were not being deported. My understanding from
the director general&#146;s letter to the Home Affairs 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 436</div>Committee is that at the moment the achievement seems to be that
consideration starts some four months before the end of a sentence.
Clearly, progress has been made but more is
needed.</div>
					<a name="07032047000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister can enlighten us about the practical systems that are in
place. If a four-month target has been hit, what is required to meet
the six-month target in the amendment? If systems can be put in place
now, presumably they can be extended so that all future problems
relating to the deportation of foreign criminals will be minimised and
we can achieve the happy situation in which our only difficulties
concern the potential destination of the criminals.</div>
					<a name="07032047000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware that we have had
several exchanges about whether it is desirable to deport certain
people to certain countries, and how difficult that might be. However,
I am sure that the Minister would acknowledge that if that were his
only problem in relation to the deportation of foreign criminals, his
life would be considerably easier than it has been in the past few
months. Ministers will always have genuine difficulties in making
individual judgments about whether a person or group of people should
be sent back to possible torture or even death. However, those genuine
problems have been overlaid with the unnecessary problem of a system
that is inadequate to enable them to handle what one might describe as
routine deportations&#151;those of people who have committed serious
crimes in this country yet whom we find it impossible to
deport.</div>
					<a name="07032047000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the amendments is to probe what is happening in the Home Office, and
equally importantly, what plans Ministers have to improve the
efficiency of their systems in the coming months and years. If they are
not improved, a serious threat to public order and public safety will
continue, and that would be hugely
undesirable.</div>
					
					<a name="07032047000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032047000371"></a>Mr.
Clappison:
						</b> I support the excellent amendment tabled by my
hon. Friend the Member for Ashford, and I rise in the same spirit as he
did to seek further information about the mechanics of deportation. A
certain amount is spelled out in the Bill, but it would be an
improvement if it contained a little more
detail.</div>
					<a name="07032047000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
33 would require the Secretary of State to write to the court
responsible for the sentence triggering deportation if the deportation
order had not been made within one month of the period specified in the
Bill. I say &#147;specified in the Bill&#148; because the Bill sets
out a certain amount about the mechanics of the system, and it is clear
that when a deportation order has been made following the triggering of
the trigger mechanism, time is allowed for an appeal against the
conviction or sentence that triggered the
order.</div>
					<a name="07032047000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
would require the Secretary of State to write to the court if the
deportation order had not been carried out within one month of the end
of that period. I believe that that would have the advantage of
focusing official efforts so as to ensure an efficient process of
deportation. The amendment also gives the Minister an opportunity to
say a little more about the mechanics of the process.</div>
					<a name="07032047000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">More generally, there is a need
for greater communication between the Government and the courts about
what is going on with deportation. I also 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column437" />Column number: 437</div>think that the courts need to have confidence that when a deportation
order has been made&#151;that is, they have recommended deportation
or passed a sentence on a foreign prisoner of a type that would trigger
deportation under the provisions of the Act&#151;it will be carried
out.</div>
					<a name="07032047000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have been
cases in which senior members of the judiciary have said that they do
not have confidence in the deportation process. I could give just one
example from last year, when the recorder of York said that he was not
going to make a recommendation for deportation in the case of a man who
had been jailed for 15 months for offences of fraud. The recorder
said:</div>
					<a name="07032047000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Even if
I did, I would have no confidence that anyone would take any
notice.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032047000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must get back to a position where the courts have confidence in what is
going on regarding deportation. There must be communication between the
Government and the courts. I hope that the Minister will be able to
welcome the amendment.</div>
					
					<a name="07032047000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032047000372"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I am grateful for the chance to sketch out a little
more of this territory than I have had the opportunity to do so far. I
also respect the way that the hon. Member for Ashford is probing in
this territory. Given the events of last spring, it is absolutely right
that a degree of scrutiny is brought to bear on this area, which
includes asking whether the right level of resources is being
applied.</div>
					<a name="07032047000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">In direct
answer to the question by the hon. Member for Ashford, the increase in
resources in this part of the IND&#146;s business has been about
tenfold over the last year. So, about 600 or 700 people are now working
in this particular area. That increase in resources has been an
important part of the changes that the Home Secretary has made over the
last 12 months. For me, the question now is this: how do we ensure not
only that we have increased the number of people who are doing the job
but that they are able to operate a process that is far more efficient,
so that the overall productivity and output are much higher? In broad
terms, that is what the Bill is designed to achieve.</div>
					<a name="07032047000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment, around 72 per
cent.&#151;nearly three quarters&#151;of foreign national prisoners
that we write deportation orders for appeal against the orders.
Although 55 per cent. of those appeals end up being dismissed and a
further 25 per cent. end up being withdrawn, they involve the IND in a
long drawn out process of taking those cases through the appeal system.
What we want to do is effectively to certify the cases, so that those
appeals can be held abroad. We know that that has a dramatic impact on
the number of appeals that we receive. There is a degree of precedent
that we can learn from, which is the number of overseas appeals made
against asylum decisions; in those cases, we have certified
people&#146;s claims as being clearly unfounded and therefore
reported them. As I said a moment ago, only 238 appeals have been
lodged from abroad in about three and a half years, between November
2002 and September 2006.</div>
					<a name="07032047000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, what we have done
over the last 12 months has dramatically increased the level of
resources in this area. What we are now seeking to do in the Bill is to
increase dramatically the efficiency of the process.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column438" />Column number: 438</div>
					<a name="07032047000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yesterday, the hon. Member for
Ashford not unfairly criticised the stream of management speak that he
hears coming from my office. I did not take offence. However, if he
will permit me one further foray into that territory, it is important
that the way that we set objectives for the IND is right and puts the
prioritisation of harm reduction centre-stage. Over the next 12 months,
I will personally oversee the design of new objectives for the IND, and
tackling harm, particularly the harm caused by foreign national
prisoners, will be at the centre of the objectives that I aim to
recommend to the Home Secretary. I hope that that is in direct answer
to some of the questions asked by the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
					
					<a name="07032047000309"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div>
					<a name="07032047000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a
number of technical issues that it is important to draw out. Amendments
Nos. 126, 10 and 140 create constraints on the precise date, time and
moment when the Secretary of State might issue a deportation order. It
is perfectly reasonable to expect the Home Office to undertake the
issue of deportation orders in advance and substantially in advance of
somebody being released from custody. We are currently operating at
about four months; our target is to get to six months by spring and we
are on track to hit that
target.</div>
					<a name="07032047000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem,
however, in setting a specific point in the calendar or in the sentence
when the deportation order is to be issued is that it may get in the
way of our ability to deport people. If, for example, somebody is
serving a 20-year sentence, we would want to write a deportation order
towards the end of their sentence as the situation in that
person&#146;s country may be so unstable that if we were to try a
deportation order the court would throw it out. Waiting for a while can
sometimes help us issue a deportation order, taking into account
conditions in that country which may be more helpful. It may increase
our ability to deport people

					<a name="07032047000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Hertsmere raised a second issue about the feedback to the courts.
There are challenges with the way that the amendment has been drafted.
We do run into issues with writing back to courts. If we do not issue a
deportation order within 30 days we end up snowing the courts
with a large amount of paper and notices, often involving information
that will cause us problems under the Data Protection Act 1998. The
necessity is not there in the way that the hon. Gentleman tries to
describe it because if we want the degree of flexibility and latitude
to write deportation orders in order to deport more people we may very
often find ourselves in a situation where we repeatedly have to write
to judges to say, &#147;We have not done it yet
because...&#148; All we are trying to do is to pick the point in
the sentence when we maximise our chances of getting people
home.</div>
					<a name="07032047000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point that
the hon. Gentleman makes is, however, absolutely right. When I talk to
immigration judges&#151;which I try to do as often as they let
me&#151;very often they do express concern about the misalignment
between the removals process and the court process. We explicitly said
in our enforcement strategy, published a week or two ago, that we would
seek to bring that alignment in. We do have to explore further measures
for feeding back news about individual cases to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column439" />Column number: 439</div>courts. One of the ways that we can do that is through the new single
inspectorate, because it is vital that the judiciary in this country
have confidence in the system so that they can continue to ensure that
justice is done.

T.C. Davies:
						</b> I wonder whether I can help the Government a
little with two amendments that I tabled&#151;Nos. 10 and 11. I gain
the impression that the Minister is genuine in wanting to ensure that
foreign criminals are deported expeditiously wherever that is possible
and wherever the courts will allow that to happen.</div>
					<a name="07032047000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 10 will require
that a deportation order be made within 14 days of conviction for an
offence rather than, as at present, at a time chosen by the Secretary
of State. I think that would help to ensure that matters took place
more quickly. The problem with the wording as it stands is that it
could drag on for many months, with all sorts of people putting
pressure on the Secretary of State not to carry out a deportation
order. By accepting this amendment, that pressure is removed and the
Secretary of State would simply have to issue an order within 14 days.
I think the Minister might find that helpful.</div>
					<a name="07032047000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second amendment would
remove clause 30(2)(b). At the moment, the clause states that a
deportation order may not be made while an appeal &#147;could be
brought&#148;. The problem with the words &#147;could be
brought&#148; is that, as we know, lawyers are very good at using all
sorts of means to bring forward appeals even when they know perfectly
well that those appeals will fail, and since most of them are on legal
aid and being funded at the largesse of the taxpayer, it is well within
their financial interests to do so and they will do so. Amendment No.
11 would simply remove the words &#147;could be
brought&#148;&#151; thereby removing this money feast for
immigration lawyers, who would not be able to bring forward all sorts
of bogus claims to stop an appeal taking place that was
clearly going to
fail.</div>

						</b> I am grateful for the ambition behind this
proposal. My slight concern is that, given the increased resources, we
are trying to create a process that is as rapid and efficient as
possible. Wherever possible, I am therefore seeking to minimise the
necessity to write bits of paper or issue decisions that end up having
to be revoked.</div>
					<a name="07032047000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						At the
moment, an individual has 28 days to appeal against a conviction. If we
were to accept an amendment requiring deportation orders to be issued
14 days after conviction, two consequences would follow. First,
somebody might appeal successfully against the conviction inside the
28-day window, and we would then have to revoke the deportation order.
That would involve resources in issuing the order and then revoking it,
but also in tracking the case in the meantime.</div>
					<a name="07032047000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second concern is that such
an amendment might limit our flexibility to issue a deportation order
closer to the end of a sentence. Sometimes when a sentence is quite
long, that would limit our ability to take into account the current
country information available. My fear is that it would jeopardise the
flexibility that we are seeking to issue deportation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div>orders at the right point to maximise our chances of getting somebody

						As the

difficulties. If he were to attempt to create a system of fully
automatic deportation, he would be in breach of various international
treaties to which Governments have signed up. It is worth putting on
record my understanding that &#147;automatic deportation&#148; is
an unfortunate term, first used, I believe, by the Prime Minister in
Prime Minister&#146;s questions one week. It does not accord with the
reality of life as it is or as it will be when the Bill is on the

it that there has not yet been in our judicial system. In particular,
it creates a clear link between criminality and a route out of the
country. The automatic issue of a deportation order is clear and the
appeal must therefore be out of country. It will speed up the system
dramatically and send a clear signal to the country and to foreign

						The point of my amendment
is that, in my view and that of the law, 16-year-olds know the
difference between right and wrong. For a 16-year-old to get a prison
sentence of 12 months&#151;a situation that would have to pertain for
them to face deportation&#151;they would have to commit a pretty
serious offence, or a large number of moderately serious offences. So,
the point of this amendment is fairly simple. Where do the Government
think that their priorities lie? Do they think that they lie in looking
after the wishes and convenience of a 16 or 17-year-old serious
offender who has made it clear that they have no respect for the rules
or ways of life of this country? Or do they see it as their priority to
protect members of the public who, in many major cities, are facing an
onslaught of criminality?</div>
					
					<a name="07032047000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">My view is quite simple. A 16
or 17-year-old who knows right from wrong, and who has decided to show
no respect whatever for the laws of this country, should not be given
the right to remain here. The British public have the right to be
protected from them, and would be better off without
them.</div>

for Monmouth. My amendment&#146;s purpose is to probe a little more
into one exception to what is termed automatic deportation, which is
exception 3, where</div>
					<a name="07032047000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
removal of the foreign criminal from the United Kingdom in pursuance of

					<a name="07032047000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My hon.
Friend the Member for Ashford has just made some interesting comments
about the concept of automatic deportation. The Bill is being presented
to us, rhetorically at least, as one that would allow for the automatic
deportation of foreign criminals who have committed offences resulting
in a sentence of imprisonment of more than 12 months. Setting aside our
previous debate on the Government&#146;s interesting interpretation
of 12 months imprisonment, there is the question of how big a hole is
left by the subtraction of the exceptions contained in clause 29,
because it seems that quite a substantial number of foreign criminals
who are sentenced to 12 months imprisonment will fall within the
exceptions stated there. The two most important, for these purposes,
are exceptions 1 and 3. As I have said, my amendment relates to
exception 3, but we also have exception 1, where somebody cannot be
deported where it would result in a breach of their rights under the
European convention on human rights. Given that one of those is the
right to family life under article 8 of the convention, one suspects
that that particular right under the convention would apply to quite a
number of people who were convicted in the circumstances that I just
described.</div>
					<a name="07032047000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">On top of
that, all the obligations under the refugee convention would apply to
somebody who has claimed asylum, or who is minded to do so following
their arrest. Then, on top of those two exceptions, there is the one
where deportation would place the United Kingdom in breach of European
Community treaties. In this case, it would apply to all foreign
criminals whose foreign country is a member country of the European
economic area. Reading the Library briefing on this point, we are told
that</div>
					<a name="07032047000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in practice EEA
nationals and their family members will not be affected by most of the
automatic deportation provisions because of the limited circumstances
in which European law allows them to be deported&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 442</div>
					<a name="07032047000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather than ask how big a hole
is created by that exception, I am tempted to ask whether there are any
circumstances in which EEA nationals will be deported. Do we simply
subtract from the automatic deportation provisions all EEA nationals,
together with all the people who can claim rights under the refugee
convention or the European convention on human rights, including the
right to family life? If one takes all those foreign criminals out of
the picture, I submit to the Committee and the world that the term
&#147;automatic&#148; is rather a misnomer, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Ashford rightly
said.</div>

McCarthy</b> (Bristol, East) (Lab): I rise to speak to my
amendment No. 115, which relates to exception 2 under the clause, which
provides that deportation will not happen</div>
					<a name="07032047000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where the Secretary of State
thinks that the foreign criminal was under the age of 18 on the date of
conviction.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032047000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned by the issue of the date of conviction. I shall leave aside
the question of age disputes, which we have addressed previously in the
Committee. There is a general rule of the criminal justice system that
the age of the offender on the date that the offence was committed is
used as a guideline for how they should be sentenced.</div>
					<a name="07032047000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been a long time since I
practised criminal law&#151;nearly 20 years&#151;but my
understanding then was that if somebody committed an offence as a
juvenile but was convicted as an adult, they could not receive a
suspended sentence, because in those days suspended sentences were not
given to juveniles. They could receive only the penalties that were
available according to their age at the date of the offence. We now
have offences, such as possession of a handgun, that incur a minimum
sentence of five years&#146; imprisonment if the offender was over 18
at the time of the offence. If the offender was between the ages of 16
and 18, they could receive only a three-year term of detention.
Clearly, the principle is that the age at the date of
theoffence governs the sentence that somebody should
receive.</div>
					<a name="07032047000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
articles 37 and 40 of the UN convention on the rights of the child,
which deal specifically with the rights of children who commit crimes,
every person under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged commission
of an offence must be treated under the rules of juvenile justice. It
may be that the provisions in the Bill are not seen as part of
sentencing procedure and that deportation is seen as a separate issue,
but I have concerns in that
respect.</div>
					<a name="07032047000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a
practical level, my main concern relates to what happens as somebody
goes through the criminal justice system. There could be a real risk of
miscarriage of justice. If, for example, somebody commits an offence
when they are a few months under the age of 18, there will be
considerable pressure on them to plead guilty, because if they are
convicted before their 18th birthday, they cannot be deported. If they
choose to fight the case&#151;they might be innocent and want the
chance to prove their innocence in court&#151;and are convicted after
a trial after reaching the age of 18, they will be deported.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column443" />Column number: 443</div>
					<a name="07032047000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other side of the coin is
that if the police and prosecution service are considering bringing
charges against somebody who is a few months short of their 18th
birthday, they might think that if they charge them immediately and
bring them before the court, they will plead guilty, but if they wait
until after their birthday, they can be deported. An incentive to delay
could therefore be built into the system.</div>

recently, although I did when it was first established, when I was
working at a magistrates court. I am not saying that there would be a
deliberate intention to slow things down. However, it puts the offender
at risk of the vagaries in the system, in that some cases are obviously
brought quicker than others. It seems unfair that if somebody is
arrested for an offence in an area where the Crown Prosecution Service
is quicker at bringing cases to court than in others, they would be
treated differently. I know that the Minister has concerns about the
difficulty in pinpointing dates of offences, and I understand that that
might be why they have chosen to go along the route of using the date
of conviction. I know that, particularly in cases such as child abuse,
it can be difficult to get the victim of a crime to specify when the
offence happened. I understand why it has been suggested that date of
conviction should be used instead, but I would be keen to know what
safeguards would be built in, so that we do not have an anomaly where
people, particularly close to their 18th birthday, might be treated
differently.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): I rise to support the
amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth. The
Committee and the Minister will probably recall the appalling crime
that was carried out when a mother was holding her baby at a
christening party, and three individuals broke in, and she was shot
dead. Those three gentlemen were convicted and were all, as I
understand it, in the United Kingdom illegally. Two of them refused to
make clear their age to the court, and the judge was not able to
ascertain the age of the two defendants who were convicted, one of whom
was a father at least once. They also then refused, as apparently they
were entitled to do, to take any medical examination to establish their
age. The judge then had to deal with them as though they were under 18,
having taken some days to consider the matter to ensure that the
judgment at which he arrived was going to be proof against any
appeal.</div>
					<a name="07032047000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend&#146;s amendment would assist future judges finding themselves
in that situation. He is absolutely right that defendants over the age
of 16 plainly know the difference between right and wrong. It is pretty
plain that if people convicted of serious offences, whether they are
16, 17 or 18 or older, are not entitled to be in the United Kingdom, we
would not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div>wish them to continue to be here. I strongly urge the Committee to
ensure that we can take at least a small step to ensuring that
situations such as the one that arose in those circumstances, which are
an absolute affront to any sense of justice and an outrage to the
relatives and friends of the victim of that disgraceful crime, do not
recur, by supporting my hon. Friend&#146;s
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07032047000386"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I, too, rise to support my hon.
Friend&#146;s amendment. The fact that we are discussing exceptions
to automatic deportation puts into context what I thought was the
Minister&#146;s elegant formulation that there is a degree of
automaticity about the deportation under the section of the Bill. I
gently point out to him that I think that automaticity is like
virginity; either one has it or not. There are no degrees involved. We
have not got automatic deportation. The exceptions in clause 29 would
be markedly improved by my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment, reducing the
age limit of the commission of the offence. It is important, as has
been said, that we assume a large degree of personal responsibility in
people who are over the age of 16, certainly if they commit the sort of
crime that would render them eligible for deportation. Clearly, that
would not be some kind of youthful prank of the type that we have
discussed on previous clauses of the Bill. I think that in the modern
world people would find it unacceptable that the cut-off point should
be 18, rather than 16. Of course society as a whole still has a duty of
care towards many people under 18, but for many, particularly those
with drug problems that may cause mental illness, that duty of care
will continue well beyond the age of 18. To that extent it is a
question of seeking a cut-off point.</div>
					<a name="07032047000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend&#146;s point
about those who falsely claim to be under 18 is a powerful one. It
would be significantly minimised if the cut-off point were 16. It would
be interesting to see whether the use of dental X-rays leads to any
improvement. My understanding is that these are still not accurate to
within two years. If that is the case, I suspect there will not be much
practical improvement with that innovation. A judgment will still have
to be exercised by immigration officers, police officers and judges
about the age limit. Altogether, I think that the massive argument in
favour of a cut-off point at 16 rather than 18 is pretty overwhelming.
I hope that the Minister will take this amendment on board in the
constructive spirit in which it is
intended.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032047000387"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I shall deal with the amendments in turn. They
would effectively apply the process of automatic deportation, so
obviating consideration for those individuals who are deemed to be 16
or 17, and shift our proposal that the relevant date is not the date of
conviction but the date of the offence. The hon. Member for Hertsmere
raised some important questions about EEA nationals.</div>
					<a name="07032047000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There are two
or three issues that need teasing out here. First, as a matter of
Government policy our decision has been to continue with the principles
set out in 1993 by a Conservative Minister, Charles Wardle, who told
the House that it would be the Government&#146;s policy not to remove
people until the age of 18. We have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>said repeatedly that where there are questions about their age we would
not remove an unaccompanied child back to a country until we were
satisfied that there were adequate reception arrangements in place. The
cut-off date between childhood and adulthood is well discussed in
legislation, most recently and powerfully in the Children Act 1989
where the initial starting point is 18.</div>
					
					<a name="07032047000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">When one has to deal personally
with cases such as that raised by the hon. Member for Reigate and one
has to drill into the detail and make decisions about what actions the
British Government should take, one&#146;s sympathy for the kind of
amendment that the hon. Member for Monmouth proposes grows
considerably. My concern would be that, because of the conflict with
our policy not to remove children without the guarantee of adequate
reception arrangements back in their country of origin, it would entail
a consideration of each case individually. Our proposal in this Bill is
not to remove the sanction of deportation for individuals in these
circumstances, it is simply to retain the flexibility to consider cases
on a case-by-case basis so that individual details can be examined
rather than to trigger the sanction of automatic issue of deportation
orders.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032047000388"></a>Mr.

be absolutely clear, there would be an effort to deport 16 and
17-year-olds if there were adequate reception arrangements and this is
simply an exception from
automaticity.</div>

point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East is
important, too. This is one of those issues where the balance of
justice has to be struck. On the one hand, my hon. Friend posed the
risk of perverse incentives operating on the individual if they are not
far off their 18th birthday. On the other hand, the more important
issue is that we have to be able to pin down a date for an offence. I
think that that is best done at the point of conviction, because it
provides clarity and certainty. She alluded to certain kinds of
offences, whether drug dealing or sexual, and certain kinds of
criminals, who have perpetrated an offence over a considerable period
of time. My fear is that we end up having wrangles about the
appropriate date of the offence to pin down in front of a court, which
would slow down and hinder our ability to automatically deport people
in cases such as that prayed in aid by the hon. Member for Reigate. I
will not go into the case details, but many similarities are relevant
here.</div>
					<a name="07032047000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Actually being
able to pin down a single date of conviction I think is the key. There
are issues as to whether perverse incentives are created, but that kind
of risk can be combated with other measures, such as using the
inspectorate, the Crown Prosecution Service or greater transparency in
the system. The greater necessity is for certainty and for people not
to be able to avoid justice by creating confusion or complexity over
when an offence was committed.</div>

							<a name="07032047000390"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> I apologize for intervening here, but I want to go
back to the original point. The exceptions include breaches
of</div>

Convention rights,...the United Kingdom&#146;s obligations under

					<a name="07032047000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">and, under
subsection (4), rights &#147;under the Community treaties.&#148; In
the circumstances set out by the Minister, subsection (3), unless
amended, would leave the United Kingdom in advance of the rights
position laid out under the convention and other treaties. He can
safely accept the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
Monmouth, because the position of people in such circumstances is still
protected by the wider treaty obligations of the United Kingdom. I do
not see why the United Kingdom should have a position in advance of the
convention rights and the other international agreements listed among
the
exceptions.</div>
					
					<a name="07032047000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032047000391"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> The individual may face risks, to which children
might be especially vulnerable, that are not detected by convention
rights. If we are deporting children, we need to be satisfied that
there are adequate protections in place in order to avoid deporting a
vulnerable person, even though I accept that the individual may have
put themselves beyond the sympathy of an ordinary-thinking person
because of the offences that they have committed in this country.
However, we have obligations to children that merit case-by-case
consideration. That is the important point. We are not taking young
people or children outside the ambit of deportation. We are maintaining
the sanction of deportation; all we are retaining is the ability to
consider that case by case. That does not diminish our ambition or
intention to deport young people who have committed a serious breach of
the law in this
country.</div>
					<a name="07032047000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
turn to the points raised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, because
those too are important. Effectively, we have had to fit the Bill
within the framework of European legislation, within which we find
ourselves today. The result is that, for EEA nationals, we have to
consider cases case by case. As the hon. Member knows&#151;he might
be more familiar with European legislation than I am&#151;that
imposes certain tests. Those who have been resident in this country for
under five years, for example, have to be considered by the Secretary
of State through the lens of whether their deportation can take place
on the grounds of public policy or public security.</div>
					<a name="07032047000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will be open with the
Committee&#151;it is harder to deport EEA nationals than non-EEA
nationals. However, the situation has the upside of our ability to
negotiate, for example, prisoner transfer agreements between European
states. We can, therefore, move European prisoners back to prisons in
their own countries substantially easier than those from Jamaica, parts
of Africa and parts of the less developed world. That is important
because about a third of foreign national prisoners are from an EEA
country; I will be corrected by my officials if I am
wrong.</div>
					<a name="07032047000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our ability to
deport EEA nationals is constrained. There is the upside of prisoner
transfer agreements which allow us to move prisoners back to prisons in
their country of origin. We took the power to remove the need for
prisoner consent for those transfer

of foreign national prisoners.</div>
					<a name="07032047000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The framework that we have
sought to posit the Bill in, is that which comes from our membership of
the EU&#151;a deal done some time ago&#151;and that provided by the
transposition of the free movement of persons directive into
immigration regulations in
2006.</div>

							<a name="07032047000392"></a>Mr.
Clappison:
						</b> My point is on the alleged automaticity of the
provisions. Is the Minister saying that the prisoner transfers are
those with a deportation order? If they are without one, what is to
stop the prisoner coming back to this country at the end of their
sentence?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032047000393"></a>Mr.

						</b> There are grounds on which we can exclude
individuals from coming back into the country, but public policy and
public security grounds must be proven. I am happy to write to the hon.
Gentleman with a more detailed explanation of how those blocks occur.
The prisoner transfer agreements are those where individuals are
serving a sentence, so we are asking them to serve out their time to
society where they came
from.</div>
					<a name="07032047000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
transposition of the free movement of persons directive required the
approval of the House and was not prayed against when it was laid in
2006. One draws the assumption that it commands the support of all
sides of the House. Therefore, it is a constraint, but one that
Parliament has
imposed.</div>

Green:
						</b> Amendment No. 137 disguises the simple question,
what is the purpose of subsection (7)(b)? It seeks to delete it, and
amendment No. 139 essays another version of it. Clause 29 (7)(b)
reads:</div>
					<a name="07032047000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
application of an exception...results in it being assumed neither
that deportation of the person concerned is conducive to the public

good&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032047000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not, on the
surface, apparent what that seeks to achieve or what practical effect
it would have. That is why amendment No. 139 states that the
deportation of a foreign criminal is always deemed to be conducive to
the public good. I am sure that there is a simple explanation for that,
but I find it puzzling that this House is being asked to enact
legislation that will enable it to do something that may or may not be
conducive to the public good. I hope that the Minister can put me out
of my confusion on that.</div>

							<a name="07032047000414"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I will certainly do my best to help the hon.
Gentleman. The subsection aims to make it clear that the legislation
will dovetail with the definitions and terms that are used in the
Immigration Act 1971, in which the power of the Home Secretary is
defined in terms of his ability to exercise certain powers and to
deport people if that is deemed to be conducive to the public good. The
subsection concerns exceptions that are relevant to the cases of
mentally disordered offenders, to whom we might have obligations. For 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 449</div>example, it would not necessarily be to the public good to deport a
mentally disordered offender who had been committed to an institution
and was receiving care. On balance, it might be to the public good for
us to continue to care for him until he was better so that he could be
returned to his country of origin safely rather than as a rampaging
psychopath. We want to reconcile this Bill and the 1971 Act where they
relate to circumstances that trigger an
exception.</div>

					<a name="07032047000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is another probing amendment, which was tabled in the same spirit as
the amendments to clause 28. It would mean that the Secretary
of State 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column450" />Column number: 450</div>could hold a person for only six months after the end of their prison
sentence while considering a decision on what the Bill still calls
automatic deportation. We hope that it will act as a spur on Ministers
to ensure that the extra resources that have already been put into the
IND will be enough to ensure that nobody stays in prison for more than
six months after the end of their sentence before being
deported.</div>
					<a name="07032047000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
importance of the provision almost goes without saying for many
reasons, among which are, first and straightforwardly, the increasing
waste of public money that results from keeping people in prison who
should not be in this country; and secondly, and increasingly
topically, the effect of the extra overcrowding in an already
overcrowded prison estate. That is a problem for the prisoners
themselves, as has been shown in several ways in recent months. It also
spills over, hugely dramatically and unfortunately, to the immigration
removal estate. Only last week there were more disturbances at one of
the centres and at the end of last year the Harmondsworth centre was so
seriously damaged that it had to be evacuated.</div>
					<a name="07032047000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">People in the immigration
removal service have told me, as they will have told Ministers even
more forcefully, that putting large numbers of people who have
committed offences that are bad enough to be jailed for into
immigration removal centres is extremely bad for all concerned.
Inevitably, it makes the centres much more like jails than they would
otherwise be and forces those who may have committed only an
immigration offence to mix with hardened criminals, which is deeply
unfortunate for them. Of course, it is also unfortunate for the staff
involved, who are not particularly trained to look after and control
such people. For all sorts of reasons, both in the IND and for wider
reasons of good order, getting over the crisis of foreign prisoners is
one of the most essential tasks that Ministers face. The purpose of the
amendment is both to probe and to act as a spur, so that the Bill would
state that it is unacceptable simply to keep people locked up while the
processes to enable them to be deported are gone through.</div>
					<a name="07032047000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">As with previous amendments, I
am not urging the Minister to do anything that he does not want to do.
I am sure that he passionately wishes the amendment was unnecessary
because the deportation system was moving so smoothly that there were
no problems. Sadly, we know that there are, and that they are
continuing. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to
say.</div>

						</b> Again I find myself starting from the same position
as the hon. Gentleman. One of the most frustrating aspects of the
removal process for many of the individuals to whom I talk in my
constituency is that they cannot understand why we cannot put people to
whom we have issued deportation orders on a plane, let it take off and
touch down in their country of origin, bundle them out of the back and
leave them to the tender mercies of the reception staff at the
airport.</div>

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column451" />Column number: 451</div>
					<a name="07032047000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">A key part of the removals
process is getting people redocumented. I remember being struck by a
story told to me by immigration officers at Dover immigration removal
centre. As we were going round I asked why people were there for longer
than they needed to be, and the officers said that individuals have
often embedded themselves in such a web of lies about who they are and
where they are from that it is difficult to convince a foreign
Government to reissue them a passport so that they can go back
home.</div>
					<a name="07032047000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the key
things that we need in our system is incentives to encourage people to
co-operate with the redocumentation process so that we can work
effectively with foreign Governments and emergency travel documents can
be issued to individuals. If somebody knew that they would be released
on bail if they strung the process out for six months, we would not
strengthen but rather diminish the incentives for foreign national
prisoners to co-operate with the documentation

						</b> I do not know how hard the Minister has tried
to get foreign Governments to issue passports. Has it not occurred to
him that many Governments may be large beneficiaries of aid, and that
for a consideration they would probably be more than happy to issue
passports or travel documents to people whose names are supplied to
them by the Minister&#146;s staff? If the result is that somebody
ends up somewhere they did not want to be, the message might go back to
others that they should be a bit more truthful when they answer
questions.</div>

Byrne:
						</b> The relationship between co-operation, migration
and international development is a subject that ranges widely not only
in government but in the European Union. I, my noble Friend Lord
Triesman and Department for International Development Ministers talk
about the matter a lot, and I believe that we should be strengthening
the links. We will have more to say on that in the months to
come.</div>
					<a name="07032047000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would basically free foreign national prisoners once they have been
detained for six months. My concern is that that would destroy the
incentive for foreign national prisoners to co-operate with the
documentation process. I understand the ambition behind the amendment;
the hon. Member for Ashford wants to ensure that we do not lock people
up for any longer than necessary. I completely agree with that
intention. We need more detention space, which is why we are building
more, but we also need to increase the throughput rate in our prisons.
Many of the changes that the Home Secretary has proposed will help us
to achieve those increased rates, but we also need these incentives in
place to encourage people to co-operate with the documentation
process.</div>

those people who come here illegally have been trafficked here;
therefore, they will have knowledge of the criminal gangs that are
trafficking them. I think that in previous debates we have been in
agreement on the principle that the organisers should be the main focus
of police investigations. It seems quite likely that, for instance, a
collection of passports or other documents might well be held on some
other premises by the person who is most intimately involved with the
trafficking operation.</div>

						One
could easily envisage huge frustration on the part of investigating
officers if they find that they are only allowed to search some
premises when they reasonably suspect that all the evidence is being
kept on other premises. That is not a theoretical construction. It is
easy to imagine such a situation. There are other situations that one
can easily imagine in which a suspect reveals something under
interrogation that would send police officers in another direction,
looking in other areas for the relevant piece of evidence. The
amendment seeks an extension of powers; we are not universally in
favour of such extensions, but this one seems to be practical and
useful.</div>

						Amendment
No. 152 would mean that individuals who have had their documents seized
might be subject to deportation under the Asylum and
Immigration Act 1999. The purpose of the amendment is to
clarify whether those who are arrested and potentially charged under
the provisions of the Bill are subject to deportation procedures from
the UK by virtue of having committed crimes that are covered by the
clause. It is a probing amendment because I assume that that would be
the intent of the clause, but it is not clear to us that that would be
the effect. I should be grateful for
clarification.</div>

							<a name="07032047000427"></a>
								The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Joan
Ryan):
						</b> This power will assist us in ascertaining or
confirming the nationality of persons in order to consider cases liable
for deportation, which refers to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second
amendment. It is part of our plans for improving the effectiveness of
handling foreign nationals within the criminal justice system and it
will affect persons arrested for criminal offences, so that their
nationality can be established at an earlier stage. That will be when
they first enter the criminal justice system. It will be achieved by
immigration officers and the police having the power to search premises
for documents relating to nationality or identity where a person has
been taken to a police station following their arrest for a criminal
offence. It applies to persons who are suspected of not being British
citizens and where relevant documents may be found on the premises.
Safeguards will be put in place to ensure that that power is not
applied disproportionately, and inquiries will be made to see whether
the individual is already know to the IND before a search is
instigated. Searches will be necessary only where an individual fails
to co-operate in establishing his or her identity, or the officer has
reasonable grounds to believe that he is not telling the truth. The
power of search will be exercised by a constable or an immigration
officer only after authorisation by a senior official, who must give
written authority for the use of the power. We are proposing to operate
a pilot in one or two police areas to test operational details. Any
disproportionate impact will be identified by the pilot and
addressed.</div>
					<a name="07032047000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I can say to
the hon. Gentleman in relation to his amendments that the conditions
and restrictions contained in clause 40 are intended to ensure that the
power to enter premises in order to search for nationality documents is
proportionate. Although I think that it is useful to talk about the
scope of those powers, and how wide they may or may not be, we feel
that it is unnecessary and potentially disproportionate under article 8
of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 454</div>European convention on human rights to widen the power to enter and
search premises for relevant documents to &#147;any other
premises&#148;.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032047000428"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> I take that point, and I explained that I was
trying to probe. However, the scenario that I gave seems extremely
likely. If it can occur to me, no doubt it can occur to the sort of
people who engage in people trafficking that if they remove all the
evidence to a different location, they will have solved one of their
problems as a criminal. That seems both likely to happen and hugely
damaging to police investigations. Could the hon. Lady provide some
comfort on how the police will get around that fairly obvious criminal
practice?</div>
					
					<a name="07032047000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032047000429"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> It is unnecessary and disproportionate because
relevant identity documents are more likely to be found at the home of
the individual arrested, or where the individual was when arrested.
However, in cases where a person is not a British citizen and may be
liable to be deported, in principle, where the Secretary of State has
deemed their deportation to be conducive to the public good, or where
the person has been recommended for deportation by a court following
conviction for an imprisonable offence, such persons may be liable for
deportation even if they do not fit the threshold in criteria set out
in our clauses on automatic deportation.</div>
					<a name="07032047000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment No. 152, the hon.
Gentleman asks about the purpose. That is, indeed, to be able to
facilitate deportation at an appropriate time by ensuring that when
they enter the criminal justice system we are able to establish at an
early stage the nationality of an individual who is suspected of not
being a British citizen. Clause 40 gives powers to search for
nationality documents but does not have bearing on powers for
deportation, whether they exist under this Bill or not. This is about
establishing nationality where necessary so that deportation can take
place in appropriate cases at a later stage.</div>
					<a name="07032047000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No. 149, we feel
that a decision has to be taken about how proportionate the power is,
and about what evidence there is of the need to widen that power. The
evidence is that the scope of the power as drafted will be appropriate
and proportionate, but I also point out to the hon. Gentleman that,
following legislation, we intend to run a number of pilots. Clearly,
that will be instructive on how these powers and their use are working
operationally. Should there be an issue about scope, I am sure that we
will acquire information from those pilots that could be looked at
again in future. However, on the clause before us, we are convinced
that we have got it about right in terms of the proportionality of the
power and in terms of ensuring that we meet our
responsibilities under article 8 of the ECHR.</div>
					<a name="07032047000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have addressed the
amendments, which I understand are probing amendments. I also
understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern that we are able to
search appropriately for evidence of nationality; like him, we
understand the importance of acquiring that evidence as early as
possible so that deportation, if appropriate, is also possible later in
the process. With that, I hope that the hon. Gentleman is able to
withdraw his amendments.</div>

Green:
						</b> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that
explanation, and I hope that she will go away and look at this again.
She said that she believes that these documents are most likely to be
found at the address of the person to whom they directly relate, but I
put it to her that that will not be the case if the legislation were
passed in this way&#151;because that will be the only place where the
police are allowed to investigate. One does not need a great criminal
brain to work out that if one leaves the evidence somewhere else, and
the police are not empowered to investigate it, one is less likely to
be caught. For practical reasons, I hope that Ministers will reconsider
the powers of the police and immigration officers in that regard. The
Bill contains an enormous loophole, and nothing that the Minister has
said persuaded me that its existence has been adequately addressed.
Nevertheless, for the time being, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07032047000433"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> These amendments and new clauses form an important
part of the reforms set out by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary
last July in the IND review, which included a trinity of principles for
the reform of the IND. The first was that it should operate as an
arm&#146;s length agency, with greater operational freedom from the
Home Office. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>We are all Catholics at the Home
Office.</div>
					<a name="07032047000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, we
said that rather than having a monolithic mode of operation the IND
should be much more regionalised, so that its offices and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 457</div>personnel could work more closely with individuals in police forces,
local authorities and other parts of Government that are constructed on
a local basis. We should have a closer relationship than we do with the
communities that we serve.</div>
					<a name="07032047000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments and new clauses
are the third part of that story. I said clearly that I thought that
the way in which the IND was inspected, held accountable and rendered
transparent was not robust enough, and that we would have to change
things if we wanted to set it on a path of sustainable long-term reform
and progress. I do not think that 11 different inspectorates and
agencies looking over the IND&#146;s business are powerful enough. We
need fewer, more powerful organisations, able to look more closely and
more forensically at the IND, so as to report to the Secretary of
State, to this House and to local communities on how it is doing
nationally and in those communities.</div>
					<a name="07032047000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consequently, we launched a
consultation on 18 December 2006. I regret that it was not
possible to provide the relevant clauses to this Bill on Second
Reading, because it would have been helpful to debate them. However, we
were caught between doing that and needing to conduct a thorough
consultation with the public before introducing them. I signalled that
the clauses would arrive and I regret that they were not available in
time.</div>
					<a name="07032047000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consultation paper was favourably received. The consultation closed on
16 February and the Government provided their response on 1 March,
along with a written ministerial statement. I am glad to say that, like
other consultations that we have launched in the past 12 months, this
one was wildly popular, with 92 per cent. of respondents in favour of
the arrangements that we proposed. In particular, 94 per cent of
respondents said they wanted the overall efficiency and effectiveness
of IND to be the subject of inspection. Ninety-three per cent said they
wanted to see the quality of decision making included within the ambit
of the inspectorate and 86 per cent said they wanted to see the use and
the IND&#146;s operation of enforcement policy within the ambit of
the inspectorate as
well.</div>

					<a name="07032047000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debates we
have had over the last couple of weeks in this Committee Room have lent
further argument to the need to include a much more robust inspection
of enforcement than we have today within the ambit of a much more
powerful regulator.</div>
					<a name="07032047000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are, however, a number of
fields of operation which we propose to exclude from the work of the
inspectorate simply because we already have effective, well established
arrangements in place and, to some extent, debates which are already on
the record about whether those inspectorates should be dissolved and
reconstituted with others. In particular I mean detention, where we
propose to preserve the role of Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspectorate
of prisons, where we intend to preserve the role of the prison and
probation ombudsman and where we intend to preserve the role of
independent monitoring boards.</div>
					<a name="07032047000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to place on the
record the debt of gratitude that I and the Home Office owe to
independent monitoring boards, in particular at the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column458" />Column number: 458</div>moment when there are a higher number of foreign national prisoners in
our estate than we have experienced before. I rely extensively on the
feedback that we receive from IMBs. When I met the chair of IMB at
Campsfield on Thursday night last week I was again struck by the
dedication and concern that many people who serve with IMBs give to
their work. We are very lucky to have their
help.</div>
					<a name="07032047000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also intend
to preserve the advisory board on nationality and immigration. This is
the group of individuals who advise us on the way in which we conduct
our work in the field of citizenship and nationality. For the time
being at least we intend to preserve the work of the entry clearance
monitor who looks after and inspects the operation of the IND&#146;s
or rather UKvisas&#146; business abroad. Before any proposals are
brought forward in relation to the entry clearance monitor we need
slightly more time for consideration than we have been given
today.</div>
					<a name="07032047000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
category&#151;this is the subject of the hon. Member&#146;s
amendment&#151;of exclusions that we propose is the exclusion of
consideration of individual cases. I do not think that foreign
nationals in this country are short of judicial protection or judicial
regimes to investigate the merits of their case. The parliamentary and
health service ombudsman provides a way of looking at individual cases
and the way in which the IND conducted the review of them.</div>
					<a name="07032047000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposals that we are
bringing forward, therefore, are not any kind of constitutional
revolution, as Opposition Members will be pleased to hear. They are
modelled on proposals that are tried and tested and found to work. In
particular they are modelled on the proposals that are already in place
for HMIC, HMCIP, the courts and administration inspectorate, the CPS
inspectorate and the inspectorate of probation, all of which were
covered in the Police and Justice Act 2006 and which were the subject
of debate in this
House.</div>
					<a name="07032047000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Broadly
we are asking the new inspectorate to take on a general duty to monitor
and report on the efficiency and the effectiveness of what will become
the new border and immigration agency. It will review the treatment of
claimants and applicants to ensure consistent decision making across
the board. For the first time there will be comprehensive inspection of
the use of enforcement powers by immigration officers,
including&#151;this is important given the debate we have had in this
Committee&#151;the powers of arrest, the power of entry, the power of
search and the power of seizure. It will look further at the
information that is provided to applicants by the border and
immigration agency to applicants and at the information that is
provided to the general public. It will inspect the processes by which
the agencies handle complaints. It will make comparisons with other
bodies that are undertaking similar work. It will look at the way the
Home Secretary exercises his power of certification under section 94 of
the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. It will look at the
quality of inspection and country of origin reports that are provided
and used by the border and immigration
agency.</div>
					<a name="07032047000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Beyond
this&#151;again this is important, given the debates we have had to
date in this Committee&#151;it will take on an enhanced role, looking
at the way in which the IND complies, not only with section 19D of the
Race Relations Act 1976, which covers the way in which ministerial
exemptions are given under 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column459" />Column number: 459</div>immigration powers for provisions in the Race Relations Act, but it will
look more widely still at the way in which the IND is operating its
business in accordance both with the ambitions and the spirit of that
Act and the letter of the law.</div>
					<a name="07032047000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, the IND is an
agency that will benefit from the disinfectant of sunlight. The people
of this country have a right to know how well the immigration service
is working on their behalf. That is an important way in which we can
raise the country&#146;s confidence in the immigration service. The
inspectorate should have the opportunity to respond not just to the
Secretary of State, but to Parliament and to prescribed people under an
order-making power, which we set out. We ask that the inspectorate
co-ordinate their activities with others, including the senior
president of tribunals, to ensure that they do not step on each
other&#146;s toes when it comes to the operation of tribunals. It is
an important step forward on the road to reform and I commend it to the
House.</div>

Green:
						</b> Let me start with something on which I suspect the
Minister will be in agreement. This is one of the most important parts
of the Bill and so I regret that the Committee is unable to have the
wisdom of the Liberal Democrat Benches. They took the trouble to raise
a point of order on the Floor ofthe House yesterday about the
effects of this part of the Bill, but sadly they have not chosen to be
here to debate it this morning. I am sure that their contribution would
have been very
useful.</div>
					<a name="07032047000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
talked about the trinity of reforms, perhaps casting an unnecessarily
holy glow over the Home Secretary&#146;s proposals in this area. But
it is one to which I naturally respond, as I am sure you do,
Mr. Amess. The Minister&#146;s use of language is either
peculiarly appropriate or inappropriate, depending on where one comes
from. His explanation of regionalisation left me even more perplexed
about why he is going down that
route<i class="I">&#151;[</i>

co-ordinate with local police forces.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032047000438"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> Amongst others, none of whom is particularly
relevant on a regional basis. I am glad that we have had that
explanation from the Minister. I have thought all along that
regionalisation was a huge diversion from the reforms that were needed
in the IND. The Minister&#146;s comments this morning rather
confirmed that. What is needed is better co-ordination. I have no
problem with the Minister&#146;s general point 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column460" />Column number: 460</div>that having an independent inspectorate, rather than the mixture of
inspections to which the immigration service is subject at the moment.
It is perfectly sensible. Our problem with parts of these amendments
and new clauses is where they fall short of that ambition.</div>
					<a name="07032047000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two amendments in the
group in my name. The first one, which the Minister dealt with, is
about whether the chief inspector will have the power to investigate
individual cases. One of the more disingenuous parts of the
Minister&#146;s remarks on the Bill was when he appeared to imply
that my amendment would give more protection to individual foreign
nationals, who he said already had enough protections. By contrast, the
purpose of allowing the chief inspector to investigate individual cases
is to improve his or her ability to do the job of delving into the
darker corners of the IND, where the really serious scandals often
emerge. The purpose of the amendment is to reverse what is in the
clause now and to give the inspector specific power to investigate
individual
cases.</div>
					<a name="07032047000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout the
course of our deliberations on the Bill we have praised the
professionalism and dedication of those who work in the immigration
service. We were right to do so, but we all know that from time to time
things go wrong. Things particularly go wrong at Lunar house; we have
seen a succession of scandals there, involving all sorts of deeply
unpleasant corruption, of which the most vivid was the sex-for-visas
scandal. It seems very strange to set up a new inspectorate because the
Minister wanted, he said, to apply the disinfectant of
sunlight&#151;I think that was today&#146;s soundbite&#151;to the
administration over which he presides, but then to say that that
particular disinfectant cannot be used on some of our most toxic cases,
which are the individual scandals that happen. If so, he will produce
an inspectorate that is not able to inspect what they ought to be
inspecting, because he will know that many of the worst examples of the
manifold problems that the immigration system face are often exposed by
the individual case.</div>
					<a name="07032047000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should point out that we are proposing to empower the chief inspector
to inspect every case, but not to mandate him to do so, because that
would clearly involve overload and prevent the inspector from doing all
the other desirable things that we would all want him to do. Without
the power to investigate individual cases, the chief inspector will be
hobbled, not be able to do the job and, more importantly therefore, not
be a suitable tool for Ministers to improve the Department. It would be
a huge shame if one possible method to enable Ministers to do their job
properly does not come into force in the proper way because of drafting
which at best is short-sighted and at worst is actually attempting to
set up an inspectorate designed not to inspect too much that might be
embarrassing for the political masters of the officials who might have
made the mistakes or, even worse, committed the crimes such as we have
seen happen inside the
IND.</div>
					<a name="07032047000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister also
talked about improving public confidence&#151;I think&#151;which is
a good, neutral phrase, since public confidence is clearly at such a
low ebb. He will know as well as I do that nothing serves public
suspicions of cover-ups or fuels feelings that complaints are not being
taken seriously like a series of internal inquiries. That is a
longstanding bugbear with Whitehall. Here is an opportunity to get away
from the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column461" />Column number: 461</div>culture of the internal inquiry. Almost whatever conclusion such an
inquiry comes to, it is always dismissed by the sceptical as a
whitewash, because there is no sign of independence. For the most
serious cases, I strongly urge the Minister that the chief inspector
ought to have the power to investigate individual
cases.</div>
					<a name="07032047000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
does not have to look far to see an inspectorate that works well. I
commend Lord Ramsbotham, the former chief inspector of prisons, as an
example of how to be an inspector in a way that makes waves and causes
ructions and problems, of course, but leads to the long-term exposure
of problems and therefore to the long-term improvement in the quality
of the service. Lord Ramsbotham did not sit behind a desk, look at
statistics and take an overview, he went out and did a lot of work in
individual prisons. It is the ability to get out and look at individual
cases and to draw conclusions from them that will make an inspectorate
successful. Amendment (a) to new clause 6 is extremely important, as it
would help us to further the hope that both sides of the Committee
share that the inspectorate will prove to be as significant
and challenging as we believe it should
be.</div>
					
					<a name="07032047000315"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07032047000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My
second amendment, to new clause 8, is equally important because it
attempts to ensure that the procedures are as open as possible. Under
the new clause as drafted, the Secretary of State can delete material
from the chief inspector&#146;s report to Parliament if he considers
that it would call into question the safety of an individual person or
constitute a threat to national security. Those are reasonable,
underlying desires; the amendment would insert some independence into
the judgment of what should be deleted. It would ensure that the
Information Commissioner considered it and thus obtained an outside
view of whether deleted material had been deleted for proper reasons,
such as those of national security, for example, or for less proper
reasons, such as avoiding embarrassment to Ministers.</div>
					<a name="07032047000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">In principle, new clause 8 is a
good proposal. We have argued repeatedly in our discussions that
Ministers should report to Parliament on the effects of the Bill and
part of me welcomes their late conversion to that principle. The
amendment, like the previous one, would make that reporting effective
rather than half-hearted.</div>
					<a name="07032047000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Home Secretary is clearly
not the only person who can make judgments on whether a person&#146;s
safety might be in danger or, indeed, whether national security would
be affected. The Minister may argue that the Information Commissioner
is not the right person for that purpose, and we would be happy to
table amendments at a later stage to insert someone else. The amendment
would establish the principle that the person must be somebody
independent, who does not rely on the Home Secretary for his
appointment, who is not part of the Whitehall machinery and who can
take a view on whether the important material contained in the chief
inspector&#146;s report should not be pre-censored by the Home
Secretary.</div>
					<a name="07032047000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can tell
the Minister now that if the report has to go through a Home Office
filter before it is published and, for whatever good reason, some
material is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column462" />Column number: 462</div>deleted, there will be an enormous amount of public cynicism about the
ultimate value of the chief inspector&#146;s report. If Ministers are
sincere in their desire not just to allow some sunlight into this
matter but also, in the long term, to improve the workings of the
system, which is just as important, they should be prepared to take
along the way the lumps of the individual problems that the chief
inspector has reported. The slightest suspicion that the chief
inspector is being censored will be hugely damaging to that
confidence-building measure and to the process of finding people of the
appropriate calibre to work for the inspectorate. I urge the Minister
to be bold, and not to try to over-respond to the culture of secrecy
that too often comes from inside Whitehall Departments, and to accept
that if he wants to let in the sunlight, he must do so properly. He has
to allow some independent body to look at what material is being taken
out of the chief inspector&#146;s
report.</div>
					<a name="07032047000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The overall
purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the reality of what appears
in the legislation lives up to the rhetoric that the Minister has put
behind it. He says that it will be important and an opening up of the
system. It is possible that that will be the case, but that will be
much more likely if the two important changes are made: the chief
inspector should be given the power to investigate individual cases, if
he wants to; and somebody other than the Home Secretary has the ability
to decide whether information should be deleted from the annual reports
of the chief inspector. Both the amendments would markedly improve this
part of the Bill, and I commend them to the
Committee.</div>
					
					<a name="07032047000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032047000439"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I am very grateful for the welcome, however
sceptical, that the hon. Gentleman has offered. I should like to make a
couple of points in response. I hope that he will accept that the
underlying principle of my response is that having set up the
inspectorate, we do not want it to be snowed under with applications
for those who are seeking simply to frustrate their removal from this
country with further applications and appeals in order to slow down the
deportation process. We want to be absolutely clear that if people are
to be deported, if they have the right to appeal it will go to the
immigration appeal tribunal, where judgments are made. That will be the
end of the line. We do not want people to see the inspectorate as
something else to which they can apply to delay in some way their
removal from the country where that is the right outcome. I am sure
that that is not the wish, intention or ambition of the hon. Gentleman,
but I think that he would accept, in reflective moments, that that is
indeed a risk. The point that he makes is important, particularly when
it comes to the issue of corruption. We have sought to provide
sufficient powers for the chief inspector to do precisely what he is
seeking. For example, we empower the chief inspector to carry out ad
hoc investigations, and where necessary to carry out unannounced
inspections. That is important.</div>
					<a name="07032047000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">In new clause 6(4), we say that
although the chief inspector should not aim to investigate individual
cases&#151;we do not want the investigation of individual cases to be
the inspector&#146;s day job&#151;we are quite clear in parentheses
that that subsection does not prevent the chief inspector from
considering or drawing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 463</div>conclusions about an individual case for the purpose of, or in the
context of, considering the general issue. The intention that sat at
the heart of the comment made by the hon. Gentleman was about how the
chief inspector was able to have sufficient insight into individual
cases so that he or she might be able to draw general conclusions about
the state of the IND&#146;s business and report to the Secretary of
State, the House and local communities. I will study the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s remarks very carefully. I think that I understand
where he is coming from. I do not think that he wants to put more
barriers to removal, but to ensure that the inspector has sufficient
power to look at individual cases and learn from them, which has a more
general application. I will seek to ensure that new clause 6(4) gives
us the ability to do
that.</div>
					<a name="07032047000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
second issue, however, is the Information Commissioner. It is
important, as a matter of principle, that we do not get ourselves in a
situation in which we are snowing the Information Commissioner from
across Government with a range of information reports, which he or she
must approve a priori, before their release into the public domain.
There is already a reasonably robust process by which people can apply
to the Department to ask for information about omissions. If they are
not satisfied with the response, they can apply to the Information
Commissioner who can investigate. The Information Commissioner can, and
often does, insist on disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.
There is a genuine point of efficiency regarding whether the
Information Commissioner should sit before the report or operate a
process after its issue. I also accept that there are issues that have
to be balanced with confidence and disclosure.</div>
					<a name="07032047000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The comments of the hon. Member
for Ashford are extremely helpful. I think that I have caught the tenor
of his remarks and will ensure that we have got the provisions in line
with them, as far as is
possible.</div>
					
					<a name="07032047000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032047000440"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for those remarks but
do not find them entirely satisfactory in either case&#151;although
the first set were better than the second. However, it is not my
reading of subsection (4) of new clause 6 that it will encourage the
investigation of individual cases by the chief inspector. I made it
clear in my original remarks that the chief inspector should not spend
most of his time dealing with individual cases. The Minister says that
people might bombard him with their individual cases as a means of
delaying their removal from this country. Of course that is
undesirable, but as it will be the chief 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column464" />Column number: 464</div>inspector&#146;s decision as to which individual cases he chooses to
take up, that simply would not happen&#151;they would be
automatically dismissed.</div>
					<a name="07032047000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The drafting of subsection (4)
is extremely careful. It
begins:</div>
					<a name="07032047000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Chief Inspector shall not aim to investigate individual
cases&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07032047000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">which seems to be
a fairly strong instruction to any inspector that that should not be
what he does. It then says
that,</div>
					<a name="07032047000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;this subsection
does not prevent the Chief Inspector from considering or drawing
conclusions about an individual case for the purpose of, or in the
context of, considering a general
issue&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032047000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">It should be for
the chief inspector to decide what is an important general issue, on
the basis of an individual case. Very occasionally, the case itself
might be the issue&#151;if indeed there are visas on sale for sex at
Lunar house, as it has been accused of and as has been reasonably well
attested. Even if there is only one person doing that, it is a general
issue.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032047000441"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I am following the remarks of the hon. Gentleman
carefully and repeat my offer to examine his remarks and check that new
clause 6(4) is in line with his ambitions, which I think I share. On
that specific example, under new clause 6(2)(c),</div>
					<a name="07032047000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the practice and procedure in
making decisions&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032047000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
obviously a general issue, which he is talking about. The ability of a
chief inspector to look at individual cases in the context of a general
issue is, therefore, very clear. The chief inspector has the power to
look at specific cases and it is quite obvious that the example that
the hon. Gentleman prays in aid is
precisely,</div>
					<a name="07032047000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the practice
and procedure in making
decisions&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032047000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way that
subsection (2)(a) to (f) is drawn is rather

clarification but it makes my case stronger&#151;chief inspectors
should not be enjoined in this way from taking a decision that he or

subsection (4) should not be part of the new clause&#151;quite apart
from all of the points that I have already made&#151;because it might
be seen as contradicting subsection (2). I hope that the Minister can
take that away and I give notice that I intend to press the amendment
