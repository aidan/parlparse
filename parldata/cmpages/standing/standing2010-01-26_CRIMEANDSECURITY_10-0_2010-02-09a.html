clause 25. The Minister was actually in the process of sitting down
when I had to adjourn the Committee. I was about to call James
Brokenshire and I call him now.</div>

<a name="1002106000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002106000358"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): When we broke for
luncheon, we were in the midst of debating a finer point of law in
relation to the McCann case and the standard of proof that would be
needed in connection with the first condition set out in clause 25(2),
which states:</div>
<a name="1002106000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
first condition is that the court is satisfied on the balance of
probabilities that P has been violent towards, or has threatened
violence towards, an associated
person.&#148;</div><a name="1002106000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
were debating that measure and what it actually
meant.</div><a name="1002106000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the Minister of State indicated that he recognised the
McCann judgment, which applied a sliding scale in terms of the balance
of probabilities, such that in certain circumstances, that balance of
probabilities might be close to the criminal standard and burden of
proof that would be applied. Having said that, from the manner in which
he responded, it is possible that his intention is to be closer to the
purest interpretation of the civil standard&#151;on the balance of
probabilities&#151;which would be the normal test, rather than
seeking to apply the standard that was set out in the McCann judgment.
That judgment obviously said that, where serious issues were at hand
and where certain facts had to be proved, that standard should be
interpreted on a much more significant basis.</div>
<a name="1002106000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hear what
the Minister says and that, in essence, this is a matter for the
court&#151;it certainly is. However, I assume that those engaged in
the pilot will be told that the normal&#151;if I can describe it like
that&#151;civil standard of proof, that is &#147;the balance of
probabilities&#148; standard, applied rather than the &#147;beyond
all reasonable doubt&#148; standard.</div>
<a name="1002106000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
this will be a question of testing. I think that I have properly
understood the Minister&#146;s intentions and therefore what guidance
will be provided to those involved in the pilot. Obviously, we will
have to wait and see what challenges subsequently come
through.</div>
<a name="1002106000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also note
what the Minister of State said about children, and I welcome that
comment. When we consider domestic violence, issues relating to
children are very 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 336</div>relevant, as we have said in our debates on earlier clauses. Clearly, we
will need to look very closely at the implementation of clause 25
through the pilot, to see whether it will operate in the way that the
Minister of State suggested.</div>
<a name="1002106000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="1002106000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000359"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. Have you
received notification of any additional new clauses or new provisions
in the Bill? It is becoming a fairly regular habit during the
consideration of the Bill. I understand, from an e-mail that I received
at lunchtime, that a letter has been sent relating to new provisions
about control orders. I suppose that that is absolutely fine, in the
context of the time that has now been allowed for the Bill. However, it
seems as if this is turning into the festive season, with so many
things being hung off a Christmas tree Bill. I was wondering whether
you had received any further notification  or season&#146;s
greetings from Ministers or otherwise, in  relation to any
other new provisions that might be added to the
Bill.</div>
<a name="1002106000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000360"></a>The
Chairman:</b> However important that matter might be, it is
not a point of order. I am prepared to use my discretion, in so far as
if the Minister of State wishes to make any comment at this stage to
facilitate the debates in this Committee, I am very happy that he
should do so. However, if he does not wish to do so, we will move on to
our business. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> That is my ruling
and if the Opposition Whip is
unhappy&#151;</div><a name="1002106000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002106000361"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Simon Burns</b> (West Chelmsford) (Con): I just thought that
the Minister might want to say something.
</div><a name="1002106000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000362"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The Minister is remaining in his
seat.</div>
<a name="1002106000016"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
26</h4><a name="1002106000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Breach
of a domestic violence protection
order</div><a name="1002106000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="1002106000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000363"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We now move on to clause 26, which relates to
the breach of a domestic violence protection order. Obviously, we have
debated previously the sanctions that might apply in relation to a
domestic violence protection notice, and the distinction relating to
that was drawn in the preceding debates this morning. It is obvious
that if the order is breached, there is a clear contempt of court for
the reasons outlined by the Minister, with the relevant sanctions that
might apply.</div>
<a name="1002106000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, in that
context, we see the repetition of the language used in the Bill in
clause 26:</div>
<a name="1002106000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person
arrested by virtue of section 25(9) for a breach of a DVPO must be held
in custody and brought before a magistrates&#146; court within the
period of 24 hours beginning with the time of
arrest&#148;.</div><a name="1002106000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Remand
will therefore be approached. We need to ensure that breaches of the
orders are properly enforced because, as the Minister will appreciate,
in the context of other sorts of orders introduced by the Government,
enforcement of breaches has not been a notable factor. At times,
breaches appear either to result in no sanction at all or they are not
followed through properly. Sadly, there have been some notable examples
of that with other orders, such as anti-social behaviour
orders.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 337</div><a name="1002106000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, in
the context of clause 26, it would be helpful to understand what
guidance the Minister intends to give. Obviously, I appreciate that he
said he would issue guidance alongside the measure to ensure that
breaches are dealt with appropriately. I respect and understand the
desire that is reflected in the Bill to protect the victim of domestic
violence. The suspected perpetrator should be held in custody and I
understand and respect the Minister&#146;s emphasis on ensuring that
the relevant person is protected.</div>
<a name="1002106000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
ask the Minister to ensure that the 24-hour period stated here is
sufficient. It would appear that, again, we may have a remand hearing
and a substantive hearing thereafter. The court may wish to apply other
conditions where a domestic violence protection order has been
breached. Obviously, the clause states that if someone breaches an
order they have to be arrested and come before the court. If the matter
is not disposed of, that person may be remanded. Does the court have
discretion to impose other conditions or to modify in some sense the
domestic violence protection order following a
breach?</div><a name="1002106000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
the immediate sanction and protection is arrest, but technically the
matter is a contempt of court, which is punishable by a fine or by
being sent to prison. In the context of these sorts of orders, is there
any discretion or is it appropriate that, for example, conditions are
made more restrictive or reviewed? Should things be considered in that
way? Alternatively, is it the case that once the DVPO for the 14 to
28-day period has been granted, with all the relevant restrictions
contained in it, it is simply maintained and followed up according to
its terms, and that the person concerned is punished  in the
way I have outlined for contempt of
court?</div><a name="1002106000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
come back to the issue of the victim and the support mechanisms that
are in place. From the debate this morning, I am clear that, at that
stage, a caseworker would be engaged&#151;whether an independent
domestic violence adviser or not&#151;so some support mechanism would
be in place. Clearly, if there has been a breach, one would like to
think that additional protection might be offered because, as we know
with domestic violence, there can be further breaches and further
violence. What will be the role of the multi-agency risk assessment
conference in such circumstances? The MARAC is intended to bring
together a number of agencies and organisations to identify victims of
domestic violence. In effect, it combines the police, probation and
social services, the voluntary sector and various other agencies in
local government. Those are the groups that are most likely to be
represented. They will bring together information to help identify high
risk and to allow a co-ordinated
response.</div><a name="1002106000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister said that the MARAC was intended to cover serious cases
rather than something used as a matter of course in cases of domestic
violence. Therefore, one assumes that if a domestic violence protection
order was breached, the MARAC might provide a co-ordinated response.
Other factors may well be relevant to ensure that the needs of the
victim have been properly considered and attended to, putting to one
side the policing issue. There may be other welfare or safety concerns
that require something broader than a law enforcement response. For
example, the health service may be involved&#151;it may be
particularly
relevant.</div><a name="1002106000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have pushed forward with MARACs and IDVAs. How does the
Minister intend the structure to operate in respect of breaches? Will a
MARAC be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 338</div>triggered on the issuance of a DVPN, on the ordering of a DVPO, or on a
breach? Would that be determined on a case-by-case basis, or does the
Minister intend that there should be some kind of protocol in place,
through guidance, to state that where a MARAC exists and a DVPO has
been breached, the intention is that the MARAC becomes involved? It
would be helpful to understand the protocols that he
envisages.</div><a name="1002106000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister knows, in some cases, MARACs meet only every few weeks
because it is difficult to get all the partner agencies together. If
MARACs are intended to be the mechanism, does he expect to issue some
kind of protocol for a more urgent response to deal with an emergency
situation where there is clearly a risk? For example, someone with a
DVPO is arrested and has a court hearing, and the court decides to
release rather than remand in custody. If there is a serious risk of
violence or a serious threat to the associated person, some kind of
mechanism will need to be in place to protect
them.</div><a name="1002106000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful to understand how clause 26 is intended to operate.
What support services would respond, not simply to deal with the law
enforcement aspect of the order and the breach thereof, but to ensure
that the victim is properly catered for and that serious risks are
properly
addressed?</div><a name="1002106000327"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="1002106000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000364"></a>The
Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism (Mr.
David Hanson):</b> Let us cut to the chase. The purpose of the
clause is to ensure that a deterrent is in place to stop people
breaking the DVPOs that we discussed earlier today. They will need to
know that if they are the subject of a DVPO and they breach it, they
will be remanded for 24 hours and subject to the court&#146;s meeting
which, if it were Christmas eve, could be two or three days later. They
will be remanded in custody until such time as the court is in
session.</div><a name="1002106000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the court is in session, the penalty that could be given for a breach
of a DVPO is clear&#151;I have set it out on the Floor of the House
and today in Committee. Under section 63 of the Magistrates&#146;
Courts Act 1980, the court may impose a fine of up to &#163;5,000 or
a custodial sentence for a period not exceeding two months. If somebody
who receives such an order knows that if they breach it they will face
serious consequences such as the loss of liberty or serious financial
limitations, that is a strong deterrent. That is important and it is
the nub of the clause.</div>
<a name="1002106000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hornchurch asked whether  the court could modify the
conditions of a DVPO following its breach. The court cannot modify the
order following such a breach; that is not necessary, given that we
have a maximum 28-day DVPO. If the court wishes to deal with such
issues, it can in theory impose further orders at a later date, and
continue to intervene in that way. The hon. Gentleman also raised an
important point about support for the victim. The purpose of the Bill
is to protect victims and ensure that perpetrators are brought to
justice and removed from the premises to ensure the protection of the
victim. If a person breaches that order, they will face serious
consequences.</div><a name="1002106000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
DVPOs are successful&#151;as I believe they will be, following the
pilot&#151;we want to ensure that caseworkers provide necessary
support for victims of domestic violence to help them take steps to
protect themselves, understand 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column339" />Column number: 339</div>the risks and come to terms with the challenges that they face. For that
reason, in February 2008, we rolled out multi-agency risk assessment
conferences&#151;MARACs&#151;across the country to protect those
victims who face the highest risk. Furthermore, &#163;7.8 million of
Government money was put behind that roll-out to provide independent
domestic violence advisers to support victims in dealing with the
consequences of the fracturing of their domestic
relationships.</div>
<a name="1002106000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have more
than 700 domestic violence advisers in place across England and Wales,
and MARACs are in place in 200 local areas. We have helped and
supported 29,000 victims of domestic violence since February 2008, and
as far as I am concerned, that is crucial to ensuring that the whole
system works. It is about giving respite to the victim at a time of
great stress in their lives, by removing the perpetrator and imposing
severe penalties if the perpetrator returns to the home, while at the
same time providing help and support. I hope that that helps to clarify
the objectives for the hon. Gentleman, and that he will support the
clause in its entirety.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000365"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I understand the point that the right hon.
Gentleman makes about the support mechanisms. My question is about the
protocols that might need to exist for the engagement of MARACs if
there has been a breach of the order&#151;it might be that the right
hon. Gentleman cannot answer that now and that it will be subject to
the pilot in the two areas to which he has referred. It seems that a
heightened state of risk has been identified at that point so what
protocols might need to sit alongside the statutory requirements in
clause 26 to ensure that those support mechanisms are in place? The
MARACs might need to be convened to assess that risk properly. I was
seeking to probe the right hon. Gentleman on that, as it seems that
such protocols would need to be in place to get the system to operate
effectively and ensure a seamless approach.</div>
<a name="1002106000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000366"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I do not have that level of detail about how the
system will work at a local level. That will be determined by the 200
local MARACs in local areas. However, self-evidently, the type of
victims who will benefit from a notice and from a domestic violence
protection order will probably be known to a range of services and have
previously been victims of domestic violence. A breach of an order is a
serious issue that will be registered with local agencies to show that
there is a potential threat of domestic violence. We have had an
individual who has not only been removed from the property and given a
DVPO but has returned to the property or violated the family home.
Self-evidently, that is the sharpest end of an already sharp level of
concern. Although I cannot go into any detail, a breach will certainly
be brought to the attention of the MARAC, and that will be known by the
police. A DVPN has to be agreed by a senior police officer, who, as
part of their duty, liaises with other agencies about the necessary
impact of that order. Although it is a valuable point, and I am not
decrying it, safeguards need to be in place to ensure that concerns are
picked up at a local
level.</div><a name="1002106000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000367"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Clause 28 deals with guidance, and we have
discussed the utilisation of guidance at length in relation to other
provisions. I note what the Minister said about the need for guidance
to supplement the relevant provisions, but it would be useful to know
when it is likely to be made available. I assume that he will say that
the Bill needs to complete its passage through the House, and that
guidance will be issued only when the terms of the Bill have been
finalised, but, as always, this is a point of clarification because the
Committee is signing off provisions on guidance without necessarily
knowing what that guidance may be. It would be helpful to understand
how the provision will work. Obviously, the Minister does not
contemplate parliamentary scrutiny being attached to the guidance, so I
assume that his intention is simply to publish it in advance of the
implementation of the pilot in the two areas that he has mentioned.
Again, it would be helpful to understand his intentions and the timing
of the measures.</div>
<a name="1002106000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (3)
says that before issuing guidance under the clause, the Secretary of
State must consult certain relevant bodies, two of which are named and
the third is effectively left to their discretion. The guidance must
cover enforcement, but because of the issues that we have
discussed&#151;support for victims and other agencies&#151;it would
be useful to understand the categories of person that the Secretary of
State &#147;thinks fit&#148; to consult in subsection (3)(c). In
particular, if we are talking about police constables being involved,
should there be any obligation to consult not just the Association of
Chief Police Officers but the Police Superintendent Association and the
Police Federation? Moreover, it would be useful to which parties the
Secretary of State might want to consult to obtain some sort of
balance. For example, would the Minister envisage consulting
organisations such as Co-ordinated Action Against Domestic Abuse, which
provides training to IDVAs and, therefore, may be able to provide an
overarching perspective?</div>
<a name="1002106000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guidance
must be sympathetic not simply to the needs of policing but to
practical support networks and the views of victims. Moreover, it is
important to obtain the views of prospective case workers. The IDVAs
are directly relevant, because they may well fulfil, in certain serious
cases, a case worker&#146;s function&#151;hence the importance of
CAADA, given the training that it provides to IDVAs. I apologise for
all those acronyms, but it is the way of modern life.</div>
<a name="1002106000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the
Minister envisage giving advice in relation to home visits? Has he
ensured that the police follow up cases and conduct regular home visits
to victims after the issuance of a DVPN? Visits can give victims a much
greater sense of safety and can demonstrate to perpetrators, who may
still be living in the household, that the matter has not been
forgotten or ignored because a notice has been issued. Obviously, the
domestic violence protection order then follows through. Visits can
also ensure that where a perpetrator has been ordered to leave the
relevant property, that order is adhered to. If the alleged victim, in
respect of whom a DVPN and DVPO have been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div>issued, is living in the property and is still in fear, they may not
wish to report a breach of the order. Therefore there should be a
regular follow-up with the police where a notice has been
issued.</div><a name="1002106000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall probe briefly to find out whether the intention behind the
guidance is to provide such advice to ensure that orders are properly
adhered to. The New York Police Department, for example, has domestic
violence protection officers in various precincts across New York City,
who make home visits to ensure that, on a practical level, orders are
properly adhered to. Such a practical issue should be mentioned in the
advice and guidance that the Minister of State may give on clause 28,
to ensure that we are getting the best out of the notices and the order
structure. It would be helpful to understand whether the Government
intend to include in such a model the relevant follow-up, to ensure
adherence to the terms of the notice and the
order.</div><a name="1002106000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
what extent will matters contained in the equality impact assessment be
taken into account in the guidance? The Home Office published its
equality impact assessment on domestic violence protection orders,
which highlighted various factors, including the
following:</div><a name="1002106000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
police should take into account any extended family network and
consider whether making an order against a member of this network will
impact negatively on the victim&#146;s
wellbeing.</div><a name="1002106000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">It
may not be appropriate to issue an order against the main carer for a
disabled or elderly victim...There is a wider consideration as to
when it would be appropriate to evict a perpetrator from a property
which directly relates to their
employment.&#148;</div><a name="1002106000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
needs of certain minority groups and those with disabilities were also
flagged up in the assessment, and I would expect such issues to be
reflected in the guidance. It would be helpful if the Minister
confirmed that the intention is that such matters should be dealt with
in the guidance to ensure that issues relating to victims, and other
relevant factors, are properly considered to make sure that the
application of the notice and order regime is working efficiently and
effectively.</div><a name="1002106000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000368"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I am happy to conduct as wide a consultation and
discussion on the guidance as is practicable. I envisage that, once the
guidance is drafted by Home Office officials post-Royal Assent, which
is normal practice, we would put it in the Library of the House of
Commons and, possibly, on the website. We would certainly consult the
two main agencies&#151;ACPO and the National Policing Improvement
Agency&#151;that would be responsible for drawing up the guidance. I
am happy for it to be circulated widely without any trouble
whatsoever.</div><a name="1002106000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002106000369"></a><b class="B">Alison

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000370"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I would be more than happy for the MOD to be
considered in that regard, given that clause 29 contains
provisions specific to the MOD in relation to the operation of the
orders. I have no problems with that because, if Parliament approves
the clauses, it will have said that it wants to have a protection order
in place to remove the person from the home; that it wants a DVPO to
ensure that there are 28 days for alternative arrangements to be made;
and that it wants penalties in place for severe breaches to deter
people and to encourage them to participate in the
orders.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column342" />Column number: 342</div><a name="1002106000328"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

that works in practice&#151;how we put case workers in place and what
issues we have in relation to the practical application of these
orders&#151;will be matters for the guidance, but they will also be
of interest to a range of bodies. There is no lack of will in having a
wide view on these issues and I would be very relaxed about that as a
whole. Ultimately, we have to settle on a form of guidance and we have
to issue it under the auspices of ACPO and the NPIA, but I have no
problems in looking at that guidance.</div>
<a name="1002106000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to
the hon. Member for Hornchurch, superintendents, the Police Federations
and domestic violence bodies will be informed, if they want to be
informed. We can consider whether we do that on the website, by
consultation or by placing the guidance in the Library of the House. I
am quite relaxed about that issue. The guidance itself will cover a
range of details, such as the breadth and scope of both the DVPN and
the DVPO, including the provisions that we have discussed on the
protection of children and other dependants, what the exclusion for the
perpetrator will mean, what the role of the caseworker will be, what
the police and courts are required to consider, how we ensure that the
court takes into account various matters when issuing a DVPO and what
areas are involved in relation to sign-off procedures and other
practical considerations as they are deemed necessary. There is a range
of things to consider and, quite honestly, I am very relaxed about
them.</div>
<a name="1002106000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I simply say
that ultimately guidance will be published after Royal Assent and prior
to the commencement of the pilot programme. In the light of that
programme, if there are issues that need to be examined, as the
Minister responsible when the pilot is conducted in October this year,
I will be very happy to take those issues forward
too.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000371"></a>James

chairmanship, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="1002106000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is very welcome to my constituents, because, as many Members
will know, I have a constituency with a very large naval base; in fact,
it is the largest naval base in western Europe. We have a considerable
amount of service accommodation, both inside the base and,
significantly, outside. That is why subsection (2) will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 343</div>very reassuring to the families in my constituency who have been victims
of domestic violence. Some of them have become victims after servicemen
and servicewomen who have served in theatre have returned from war. The
experience has affected those men and women for a range of reasons, and
led to domestic violence.</div>
<a name="1002106000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
evidence that this type of domestic violence is significantly
decreasing; it is an ongoing problem. Victims are supported by the
Royal British Legion and by the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families
Association, which do a very good job in trying to help them. The
inclusion of subsection (2) is important, as is the assurance that the
victims will not be evicted from their properties at any stage, because
there has been a history of the Ministry of Defence asking families to
leave their properties when a relationship has broken down. The
Minister of State offered some welcome reassurance on that issue during
the witness
sessions.</div><a name="1002106000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Plymouth
would be the perfect place for a pilot, perhaps alongside Wiltshire,
not only because we have very high levels of domestic violence in the
wider population but because of the MOD interest. We also a sexual
assault referral centre, run in an innovative way by Twelves Company.
So that is my bid for Plymouth to be a pilot
area.</div>
<a name="1002106000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000374"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> As the hon. Lady knows, I have had the
pleasure of visiting Twelves Company, which runs the SARC in Plymouth.
What strikes me is the need for a co-ordinated approach between the
local authority, the health service and police to make this work
effectively. That is certainly an important and innovative model in
responding to sexual violence. The hon. Lady is right to suggest that
there are lessons to be learned for any subsequent pilot that emerges
from these
proposals.</div><a name="1002106000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000375"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b><b class="B"> </b>I thank the hon. Gentleman for his
comments. I know of his interest in the work that Plymouth has been
doing. We have a good single service that is working well, but we need
to bring in the MOD element, and the inclusion of the clause in the
Bill enables us to do that. I welcome the Minister&#146;s comment
that Plymouth may be considered for one of the
pilots.</div>
<a name="1002106000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002106000376"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Oaten</b> (Winchester) (LD): It is a pleasure, Sir
Nicholas, to serve under your chairmanship. There are a couple of
issues relating to the clause on which I seek clarity. First, if the
Ministry of Defence police get involved in issuing a notice, will they
also have to notify the local police? The second question relates to
what happens if an individual leaves the armed forces midway through
this process. Will the responsibility leave the Ministry of Defence
police? What are the transfer arrangements to move over to the ordinary
police?</div>
<a name="1002106000086"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000378"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I rise briefly to welcome the concept of
bringing the MOD police within the ambit of the Bill to deal with
domestic violence. We discussed this subject and the information
received at the time during the evidence sessions. As has been alluded
to, it is important 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 344</div>to have good co-operation and co-ordination between the MOD police and
the local police in the operation of these provisions, and to
acknowledge the MOD as an important partner in ensuring that these
provisions are brought into effect appropriately.</div>
<a name="1002106000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister say whether any disciplinary aspects might sit alongside these
provisions, relating to a serving officer subject to a DVPN or DVPO? I
am sure there will be implications for the rules and requirements
governing service personnel. It would be helpful in understanding the
relative jurisdictions of relevant courts in such cases to know that
there will be a combined approach to ensure that this is undertaken
effectively.</div><a name="1002106000089"></a>

hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport has a very strong
military contingent in her constituency. My first job was in Plymouth,
and I remember vividly looking out of my bedroom window and watching
ships return from the Falklands war. I spent a pleasant 12
months there and know how much the military is
embedded.</div><a name="1002106000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000383"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b> Doing
what?</div><a name="1002106000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000384"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Working for the Co-op, a wonderful
organisation.</div><a name="1002106000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
key thing is that the presence of such a large military contingent
means that there are pressures, particularly when men and women return
from active service. There can be tensions that lead to incidents of
domestic violence. It is important&#151;and clause 29 does
this&#151;that the Ministry of Defence police have a power similar to
that of the civil police to issue domestic violence protection notices.
The scope of clause 21 to allow DVPNs to be issued is exactly the same
as that of clause 29. If a perpetrator was a member of the armed forces
living in accommodation provided by the armed forces, a DVPN would be
issued. That would allow the eviction of the perpetrator from the
premises, not the victim. That is particularly important in a military
context, because the tenancy of military properties will undoubtedly be
with those serving in the military and not their families. That is an
important defence mechanism.</div>
<a name="1002106000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000385"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Does my right hon. Friend acknowledge that it is
important that support networks should be in place for families living
in confined service accommodation? If so, the victim could be offered
really good support. Otherwise, he or she could feel isolated because
of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 345</div>comrades and friends of the perpetrator. Some special and quite
different circumstances surround victims in MOD
accommodation.</div>
<a name="1002106000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000386"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> That is so, and the pastoral role of the military
is extremely important. There will still be relationships with normal
local services in places such as Plymouth, but clause 29 gives the
Ministry of Defence the power to act on MOD property.</div>
<a name="1002106000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a member of
the MOD police issues a DVPN, the application for a DVPO will made to a
magistrates court and will proceed as normal. To a certain extent, that
answers the question of the hon. Member for Winchester. The military
has the power to exclude someone from the premises, but normal
procedures will appertain in relation thereafter, as outlined in the
Bill. They include the powers of arrest in accordance with clause 22,
and in accordance with the provisions of clause 23 on breach in
custody.</div>
<a name="1002106000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to
the first point made by the hon. Member for Winchester, I wrote
&#147;yes&#148; in my notes, but I have forgotten the question. If
he looks at the record in <i class="I">Hansard</i>, he will see what it was. I
hope that I have clarified the second point, which was about dealings
with the magistrates court. If an individual has left the military, we
are talking about a 48-hour initial notice and a 28-day maximum
secondary DVPN. I imagine that those leaving the military within 48
hours or 28 days will be few and far between, but they will
be subject to military jurisdiction for the first part of the order and
to the magistrates court once the breach order has been
completed.</div>
<a name="1002106000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been
reminded of the question to which I wrote the answer
&#147;yes&#148;. It was about whether the military police would
hand over to the regular police. The answer is yes, it would be as
normal. I hope that that helps. I am grateful to hon. Members for
raising those issues.</div>

<a name="1002106000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000387"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We have reached the last clause in the part
of the Bill dealing with domestic violence. The final piece of the
jigsaw is the pilot schemes. As the Minister said, they are important;
should the Bill be enacted, the intention is to pilot the provisions in
two areas. I understand that under the current timetable they have been
pencilled in for October 2010&#151;but subject, of course, to
parliamentary procedures, including Royal
Assent.</div>
<a name="1002106000329"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="1002106000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a few questions for the Minister on the nature of the pilot. I
heard what he said about the intended time scale and the fact that they
are supposed to last six months. The regulatory impact assessment talks
about six to 12 months. Will the Minister confirm whether the time
period may be limited by the use of the funding? The regulatory impact
assessment states that &#163;700,000 has been allocated to the
pilots, of which &#163;250,000 would be set-up costs and
&#163;400,000 running costs. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 346</div>assessment makes it clear that the Home Office will provide that
funding, but if it appears that the cost of the DVPOs will exceed the
budget, the provision in the legislation to stop the pilots will be
enacted. In essence, the time period could therefore be shorter than
six months, if the funding were used more rapidly than forecast, but
the forecast is slightly uncertain, because we do not know how many
notices might be issued, how many orders would be granted and what the
costs of policing and legal aid might be. Is the Minister confident
that the allocated sum would at the very least provide a reasonable
period of time in which to assess the
pilots?</div><a name="1002106000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will obviously have undertaken some analysis to come up with
the &#163;400,000 running costs, and to have some confidence that
there will be a meaningful period of time for the pilots, and a
meaningful number of orders to be assessed as a consequence. That is
important, because the Minister&#146;s approach puts great emphasis
on the pilots being able to test how effective the proposals would be,
and whether they should be rolled out to a wider arena. It would be
helpful to know that analysis, so that we can be comforted that the
Minister is confident that we will get a reasonable period of
time.</div><a name="1002106000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the risk factors is the availability of caseworker support locally.
The success of the DVPO in its pilot form will depend on the existence
of caseworkers who, as we have heard, will work with victims to explore
their options. However, the Home Office&#146;s regulatory impact
assessment makes it clear that many specialist support services are
already stretched locally. To ensure that we have meaningful pilots
that operate effectively, that sort of issue needs to be properly
addressed in the recruitment and set-up
process.</div><a name="1002106000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the funding, will the Minister confirm that the &#163;700,000 will
come from a separate pot and not from money that has already been
identified, for example, the pot going to regional government offices
for IDVAs and MARACs for 2009-10 and 2010-11? That funding pot is
intended to provide IDVAs and MARACs across the country, and it would
be interesting if the funding for the pilots was intended to come out
of
that.</div><a name="1002106000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also the issue of when the decisions will be made about where the
pilots would operate. I hear clearly what the Minister has said about
probably having a small force and a large force, to test the
effectiveness of two areas and look at the use of the DVPNs and DVPOs.
Would he also consider whether an urban force and a rural force should
be reflected in the pilots? The hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport has
highlighted her area, and has made a bid for it to be chosen as one of
the pilot schemes. More seriously, a force such as that in Devon and
Cornwall is rural, and in Cornwall it may be more difficult to obtain
services and support than in a more urban area. If the pilot is be
instructive and provide lessons about how it could be applied across
the country, consideration should be given to that
matter.</div><a name="1002106000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000388"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> The hon. Gentleman is probably aware that
Plymouth falls within the area covered by Devon and Cornwall
police.</div><a name="1002106000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000389"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> That is right. Devon and Cornwall police
cover a wide area, hence my point about dealing with a rural force as
well. I appreciate that there will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 347</div>an assessment, and it is intended that the pilot will stop at the end of
the funding or at the end of the six-month period. The regulatory
impact assessment says that the pilot scheme will run for a period of
time and stop while an evaluation is carried out.</div>
<a name="1002106000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the pilot
is successful and funding, whether locally or through other means,
could be identified, and if it is felt that the domestic violence
protection arrangement is working effectively, does the Home Office
intend to end it, as the regulatory impact assessment states? I
appreciate that lessons need to be learned for a wider roll-out, and
that the more general costs, sustainability and all sorts of factors
need to be considered in the assessment. However, if
&#163;250,000-worth of investment is sunk into the project at the
outset, would it simply stop? Support networks may have been
established and some useful work will have been done on the ground in
the two areas. So is there any flexibility, notwithstanding what might
be stated in the
RIA?</div><a name="1002106000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
how does the Minister expect any subsequent roll-out to operate? He may
say that it is too early and that we need to have the pilot first. So
there is going to be just a six-month project, which then stops for
12 months or however long an assessment might take. Is that
how he intends roll-out to operate or would he hope that an assessment
might be undertaken more quickly? If the use of these notices and
orders is shown to be positive in practice, and the funding is within
the anticipated ambit, how might the national roll-out follow
on?</div><a name="1002106000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000390"></a>Mr.
Oaten:</b> I have three points. The first relates to the
Minister&#146;s assessment of the cost of setting up the pilots.
Would it not have made more sense to have identified which authorities
will be part of the pilot and to ask them to be involved in the
assessment of the costs? Can he give an assurance that once those areas
have been identified they will not lose out financially from being part
of the pilot
scheme?</div><a name="1002106000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
what happens if an individual in the pilot area has an order made
against them but then moves to an area that is not part of the pilot
and is under another force that has no experience or understanding of
what happens in those
circumstances?</div><a name="1002106000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
third question is a slightly different point from that made by the hon.
Member for Hornchurch and is about what happens when the pilot stops. I
am concerned about what happens to the individuals who may be
benefiting from the pilot&#151;who may be getting the follow-up
visits and who may be dependent on the process&#151;when all of a
sudden the support stops. What systems are in place to ensure that
their safety continues when the pilot
ends?</div><a name="1002106000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000391"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I shall try to answer the questions that have been
put. I have been very clear throughout the consideration of these
provisions that there will be a pilot. It will comprise two areas. It
will, to help the hon. Member for Hornchurch, probably have one rural
and one more urban area. I have already pointed out that the chief
constable of Wiltshire, Brian Moore, has expressed an interest in his
force being involved. I note the bid from my hon. Friend the Member for
Plymouth, Devonport for her force to be involved. We will make 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div>an evaluation and post Royal Assent, we will agree a two-area pilot to
reflect training and experimental needs. We will run the pilot for a
minimum of six months up to a maximum of 12 months to look at the areas
of work that are
required.</div><a name="1002106000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
set-up cost that we have agreed, as the memorandum states, is
&#163;700,000, which is generous in relation to our assessment. Home
Office officials and our colleagues in the Ministry of Justice worked
out the cost between them. It comes from a separate funding
pot.</div><a name="1002106000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000392"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear what the Minister says about the six
to 12-month period. Is the regulatory impact assessment incorrect when
it states that the legislation will stop the pilot if the funding costs
are likely to be exceeded? That is what the assessment says, although I
appreciate that the Minister is now saying that there will be a minimum
period.</div><a name="1002106000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000393"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The costings we have established through the
Ministry of Justice and the Home Office are in the region of
&#163;700,000. That will fund, at a minimum, a six-month pilot up to
a potential maximum 12-month pilot. Other partners may join us to share
the cost, because third-party agencies want to look at the support
mechanisms. If I may be so bold as to tell the Committee a secret, we
hope to share some further costs with third-party agencies to ensure
that we undertake savings to the Home Office in due course. The key
element is that there is adequate provision; we have costed it fairly
and we will make sure that it comes from a separate pot to ensure the
roll-out.</div><a name="1002106000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would not have spent three hours of the Committee&#146;s time, as
well as many hours of official preparation time and ministerial time
engaged in the policy, if we did not wish to see the scheme rolled out.
I do not want a postcode lottery based on two pilot areas where it is
not available. There is a proposal so that we can learn lessons from
the practical implications and look at the longer-term funding
requirements, given the comprehensive spending review that will be in
place after the general election, to roll out the scheme. My colleagues
and I will have to make a decision about that downstream. We have to
face the will of the electorate before that, but we will certainly look
at the lessons and the scheme&#146;s potential
roll-out.</div><a name="1002106000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Winchester raised some interesting points. On the
question of what happens if an individual moves away once the clauses
we have considered are put into practice, let me say two things. The
first element is the DVPN, which stops someone entering their property
for 48 hours. Where they go when they are not in the property for the
first 48 hours is a matter for them. The clauses set out that if they
return and breach, there will be a severe penalty. If a magistrates
court imposes a DVPO, it will again be a matter for the individual
where they go. However, if they return to the property, the magistrates
court would be responsible for enforcing the
penalties.</div><a name="1002106000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000394"></a>Mr.
Oaten:</b> What I had in mind was this: if the victim moves to
a different area, who will have responsibility for managing what
happens if the perpetrator tries to go to the victim&#146;s new home
and that house falls outside a pilot area?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div><a name="1002106000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000395"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The whole purpose and thrust of the clauses is not
that we move the victim around the country, but that we ensure that
they stay in the family home and that it is the perpetrator who goes
walkabout, not the victim, although I accept that there may be
occasions when that happens. If the perpetrator comes back to the home,
they face severe penalties. I do not expect that to be the normal
situation, but I will reflect on it and if there are issues, I will
take them from there. I think I have answered all the
points.</div><a name="1002106000330"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000396"></a>Mr.
Oaten:</b> I asked about those who are in a pilot area and
benefiting from the support. What happens on day one after the pilot is
concluded? Is there a scheme to at least follow through and keep the
support in place rather than taking on new
cases?</div><a name="1002106000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000397"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> That is a very important point. If I centre the
whole debate on the victim, the purpose of the provision is to make
sure that the perpetrator is out of the way for a period while the
victim receives support. In that event, I imagine that, as part of the
pilot, arrangements will be made through the local officers dealing
with the matter to ensure that the support follows the victim. The
crucial element is what we do to help the victim to get over the
domestic violence, and to remove the perpetrator from the premises, to
remove the initial threat. I cannot give a specific guarantee, but
those running the pilot scheme, and ultimately the effective scheme,
will want to take strong cognisance of those points. I commend the
clause to the

does not have a source of income and most gang members would not have a
legitimate source. Nor can the court sentence someone under 18 to
detention in a young offenders institution&#151;the penalty for
breaching one of these orders&#151;for a civil contempt of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000402"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Gedling expressed a
number of difficulties about how to operate the provision for
under-18s. We have changed our mind, and those difficulties are being

Bill.</div><a name="1002106000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000403"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Apologies. I understand. I read out the quote
to set out the points that the hon. Member for Gedling and I
debated&#151;probably in this self-same room&#151;as well as to
discuss some of the practical issues and consider why the provisions
are being brought forward in this Bill to address the specific concerns
of the hon. Member for Gedling. My reason for referring to that was not
to suggest that the provisions in the Bill, particularly clause 31, are
defective.</div><a name="1002106000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question for consideration and debate is whether &#147;14 or
over&#148; is the appropriate age to which the orders should apply,
or whether there should be a different age. I want to probe the
Minister on whether 14 is the right age, or whether 16 is more
appropriate.</div><a name="1002106000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
sad reality of gang violence, certainly from my experience of talking
to the police and other agencies throughout the country, is that some
quite young children are involved in gangs. I do not mean loose
terminology to describe a group of friends who hang around as a gang,
but an organised gang intent on criminal activity, violence, selling
drugs and protecting an area in which they may live. Young children may
be exploited by older members of that organised gang to facilitate
criminal activity with all the violence, antisocial behaviour and
associated problems.</div>
<a name="1002106000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">For Committee
members who have not read the Centre for Social Justice&#146;s
report, &#147;Dying to Belong&#148;, I recommend it as a good
summary of the nature of the problems, the extent of the issues and the
fact that, sadly, young children are engaged in that kind of activity
across the country. On the age issue, the CSJ report
states:</div><a name="1002106000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
2004 Offending, Crime and Justice Survey...found gang members
throughout the survey&#146;s age range of 10-19. MPS research found
gang members were typically aged between 12 and 25 and this appears
similar in Manchester. Witnesses speaking to the Working Group in
Liverpool and Glasgow also confirmed this as the general age range.
Worryingly, the Working Group was told by senior police officers and
practitioners that gang members are getting younger and this appears
evidenced in the declining age of gun crime
offenders.&#148;</div><a name="1002106000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
that context, I understand why the Government have sought to plug the
gap in the original gang prevention order provisions in the Policing
and Crime Act 2009, as sadly there are gang members who might be just
on the fringes of the age of criminal
responsibility.</div><a name="1002106000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
officers from Trident&#151;the Metropolitan police specialist service
dealing with violence in London&#146;s black community&#151;gave
evidence on gangs to the Home Affairs Committee, they provided 15
profiles, and those identified as being particularly at risk were
youngsters between the ages of 16 and 18 who are unemployed and cannot
claim benefits. Expulsion from school was a key factor. Progression for
that group can be swift, so that was the relevant profile.
Interestingly, there was a suggestion that 16 to 18 was the key age
range for Trident, although it was accepted that arrests had taken
place by the age of 15, so there is a pattern of persistent and
prolific offending.</div>
<a name="1002106000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is becoming
increasingly clear that too many young lives are being lost as a result
of absurd disputes over postcodes and territories, and minor
disagreements and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 351</div>a perverse notion of respect. Members of the Committee will certainly be
well aware of the number of young teenagers across the country who have
lost their lives as a result of knife and gun crime that may be linked
to organised criminal gangs.</div>
<a name="1002106000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">For me, one of
the most insidious aspects of the problem, and one reason why we must
be careful in judging the right age range and, more generally, the
application of the injunctions, is that often the most vulnerable
members of the community are preyed on. The organisation Defending da
Hood, which brings together gang members in east London to reduce the
risk of violence, has suggested that some of the gangs actively target
more vulnerable members of the community, with low educational
attainment or from single-parent families, as part of their recruitment
policy. The gang adopts tactics to undermine family ties to draw the
individual away from traditional social support structures. Individuals
are then encouraged to prove themselves as part of the gang structure,
even going to prison as part of a rite of passage.</div>
<a name="1002106000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
clearly a need for early intervention. The central question is whether
the gang injunction is the right approach for younger gang members, or
whether it would be more appropriate to have other interventions based
more on support and intervention and on examining the child&#146;s
needs and behavioural issues. That is why we wish to test the
Government&#146;s views on bringing the  14 to 18 age range
within the scope of the Bill, rather than a different age
range.</div>
<a name="1002106000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to put the proposal to change the age range in the context of
the orders used before the introduction of gang injunctions under the
Policing and Crime Act 2009. The West Midlands police used injunctions
under section 222 of the Local Government Act&#151;a civil remedy
intended for use by local government to deal with nuisance
behaviour&#151;to deal with gang issues. Other areas have used ASBOs
and other mechanisms to disrupt gang activity.</div>
<a name="1002106000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The West
Midlands police found such injunctions a useful method for dealing with
gang activity in the area. The Policy Exchange report &#147;Going
Ballistic&#148;
states:</div><a name="1002106000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;West
Midlands police were able to use Section 222 to exclude dangerous
individuals from certain areas so that they could no longer exert
influence, trade drugs or intimidate residents there. It allowed them
to control dangerous gang members by enforcing non-association or
restraining orders, exclusion zones around certain areas (barring known
gang members from the area in which their gang operates) and specific
exclusions (buses or
parks).&#148;</div><a name="1002106000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was the basis in law until the Nottingham county court ruled in
Birmingham city council <i class="I">v</i>. Marnie Shafi and Tyrone Ellis that
the West Midlands police&#146;s use of section 222 in that way was
inappropriate and could not continue, a decision upheld by the Court of
Appeal. The court said essentially that except in exceptional
circumstances, an injunction should not be granted where an application
for an antisocial behaviour order could have been made and that if it
were, the evidence would have to be proved to the criminal standard. In
some ways, there is a cross-over between this debate and our discussion
of the McCann case this morning. As a result of the ruling, the orders
were no longer used. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 352</div>Government responded by introducing gang injunctions in the Policing and
Crime Act 2009, to which clause 31 relates.</div>
<a name="1002106000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it
was understood that the orders would apply only to adults, which is how
the West Midlands police targeted their approach. As they were civil
injunctions, the only penalties that could be awarded for breach were a
fine or a term of imprisonment, which would have meant sending a young
person to an adult prison rather than a young offender institution
simply because a civil court rather than a youth court would have been
involved. That is the reason for clause 31 and the subsequent clauses
in this part of the Bill; they seek to address the issue by applying or
making available different sanctions in the civil court
setting.</div><a name="1002106000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Gedling, in his comments on the Policing and Crime
Bill, highlighted the fact that there was a gap. I heard what the
Minister of State has said loudly and clearly about the provisions in
the Bill, but the hon. Member for Gedling
said:</div><a name="1002106000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
should find a way, no matter how difficult or controversial, to
legislate and create a civil preventive tool that prevents a
16-year-old from going to an area, wearing colours, associating with
others or being used by people over 18 to do their errands  or
dirty work, which is increasingly
happening&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Policing and
Crime Public Bill Committee, </i>26 February 2009; c.
566.]</div><a name="1002106000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is what we are doing in these provisions. The hon. Member for Gedling
used a 16-year-old as his example. I am not implying that he was
discussing an isolated case or a minimum age, but we must understand
clearly what we are doing in setting an appropriate age range. Should
it be 16, as some of the evidence seems to indicate, or should it be
younger, as the Government have maintained in setting the minimum age
at
14?</div><a name="1002106000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
justification for such orders is that they should be preventive. For
example, a gang member might be prevented from being the victim of a
reprisal attack by the provisions of the order. That preventive or
protective approach was made clear when we discussed gang orders in
Committee during the passage of the Policing and Crime Bill. Is this
the right mechanism to provide child protection, for example? If a
child, particularly a young child, is at serious risk of harm, there
are existing powers to take them to a place of safety. If the police
are concerned about lack of response from child protection agencies,
they may, for example, use an emergency protection order to put a child
into a place of safety&#151;in a way, to force the issue with the
relevant agencies in the locality if
necessary.</div><a name="1002106000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Significant
numbers of those involved in gang activity are children. If parents are
not prepared to engage with support services to change behaviour,
action needs to be taken to protect the child&#146;s safety and
welfare.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000404"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We were debating gang injunctions and the
appropriate minimum age at which they might operate: should it be 14,
as the Government assert, or it should be higher, as I suggest? This is
a probing amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div>to test the preventive nature of the orders, because, if the age range
is set too low, other factors may come into play under the European
convention on human rights or the UN convention on the rights of the
child.</div><a name="1002106000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are looking at preventive activity, is the gang injunction the right
mechanism to use for positive activity that will engage young people
and take them off the gang pathway, or is it intended to have punitive
aspects as
well?</div><a name="1002106000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
age of the respondent may be relevant in understanding the order. One
of the criticisms of ASBOs that have been levelled in some parts is
that the conditions that are attached to them may not be sufficiently
clear or may be too wide ranging. There is a need for clarity and
certainty in this
context.</div><a name="1002106000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
issue emerged during the original consideration of the Bill, but it is
particularly relevant when we are considering where to set the age
limit. In the context of imposing all kinds of significant and
draconian provisions on younger people, possibly quite rightly in the
context of their activities, interestingly the Standing Committee for
Youth Justice stated in its comments on the gang-related violence
provisions:</div><a name="1002106000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Many
young people involved in gangs often have limited choice in joining
them and are perhaps not aware of the implications of being involved.
For girls in particular, membership in gangs may be exploitative in
nature, and a welfare response rather than a punitive one is
required.&#148;</div><a name="1002106000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
genuinely understand what the Government are trying to do by filling
the gap in the Policing and Crime Act, but the question is where to
strike the balance for a very young person&#151;a
child&#151;between the child welfare provisions that might equally
apply and much harder-edged gang injunctions.</div>
<a name="1002106000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulatory
impact assessment acknowledges that age is a factor in young people
being used to commit gang-related
crime:</div><a name="1002106000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Race
on the Agenda (ROTA)&#146;s response to an EIA consultation raised
the possibility that those under the age of 18 may be used by more
senior gang members to commit gang-related violence because they cannot
be given an
injunction.&#148;</div><a name="1002106000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was speculative, because the injunctions have yet to come into effect,
as we heard in the evidence-taking session, but, sadly, very young
people have been forced or coerced to carry drugs, contraband, weapons
and other things. Age can therefore be a relevant factor, so there
needs to be sensitivity in respect of where the provisions
fit.</div><a name="1002106000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
this stage we have no evidence and no sense of the practical
implications of the application of gang injunctions, which have only
just come into effect and none has been issued, but we should consider
whether other sanctions could be used against the younger age group.
For example, I understand that antisocial behaviour orders have been
quite effective in disrupting gang-related violence in
Manchester.</div><a name="1002106000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
tools might be used. The order we are discussing is intended to replace
the section 222 order, which was not intended to deal with very young
children. The nature of the civil order, as I have explained, did not
lend itself to such use. This type of injunctive relief was in essence
applied and developed in Birmingham. The Birmingham reducing gang
violence partnership targeted its work on 16 to 24-year-olds, which may
have reflected the child welfare and child protection issues that I
have mentioned in respect of that younger age group. We 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div>should consider whether targeting children in that group to stop and
challenge their behaviour should be undertaken by working through
education departments or children&#146;s services and social services
departments.</div><a name="1002106000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
probing amendment aims to help us to understand why the Government
alighted on the age of 14. I recognise that there is a place for
injunctive relief. The mechanisms that were used in the west midlands
highlighted the fact that the utilisation of the old-form injunctions
had an impact on disrupting gang-related violence. The focus should be
on the exploitation of children by gangs and protecting communities
from violence. We need to consider whether orders can be used
proportionately and can take factors into consideration in trying not
only to stop someone&#146;s behaviour, but getting them to take a
different
path.</div><a name="1002106000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
big challenge is trying to break gang members out of their gangs. There
is no single answer to that problem: the solution must sit within a
multi-agency strategy, as we have seen in certain parts of the country.
However, it is worth probing the Minister and understanding whether the
age range of 14 and above is right or whether the bar should be set
slightly higher. Once practice has developed, perhaps we can review

group.</div><a name="1002106000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth understanding how the Government identified the age of 14, as
against an even younger age, given the evidence that, sadly, gang

Committee members understood the Government&#146;s thinking and found
out what evidence the Government have garnered to support their
approach.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000405"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> There is general agreement that gang injunctions
can be a useful tool. I accept that to date the over-18 injunctions
have not yet been implemented in a way that we can evaluate. Indeed, no
injunctions have been granted. If the clause is agreed, that power will
be extended from gang injunctions for over-18s to gang injunctions for
under-18s for the purposes of preventing acts of serious violence,
breaking down gang culture and preventing younger gang members from
escalating their behaviour, and providing an opportunity for local
agencies to engage with gang members and develop effective strategies
for them to exit the gang. The provision could be a useful
tool.</div>
<a name="1002106000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
is where we draw the line. The age of criminal responsibility is 10,
and adult injunctions come into effect at 18. Therefore, we have an
eight-year period in which we could draw the line at any point. The
amendment suggests the age of 16, while evidence given to the Committee
by Councillor Jim Battle of Manchester city council and Maureen Noble,
head of the crime and disorder reduction partnership, suggests that we
should apply such injunctions to children as young as 10. Sadly, they
indicated that there were occasions where children as young as 10 were
involved in such behaviour.</div>
<a name="1002106000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had to
draw the line somewhere, and we have drawn it at the age of 14. That is
where we think that such a line will be most effective in terms of the
prime age at which gang membership starts to develop into potential
criminal activity. The Home Office commissioned a report monitoring
data from the tackling gangs action programme in May 2008. The report
found that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div>average age of first conviction for young gang members was 14. I do not
want to over-dramatise by reducing the age of those whom the gang
injunction would affect to 10, 11 or 12, but I want to look at how we
can make it have the most effect. On the basis of age at first
conviction, 14 seemed
appropriate.</div>
<a name="1002106000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002106000406"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Flello</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab): If I heard my
right hon. Friend correctly, he said that the age at which the first
conviction was received was 14.  I may have misheard, and I
would be grateful for his clarification. However, if that is the case,
surely that evidence would suggest an age of 13. We are looking to
intervene before things gets to that stage. From that evidence, is
there not an argument to say that the age of the injunction should be
set slightly younger than 14?</div>
<a name="1002106000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000407"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I accept that there are arguments for any age. I
could indicate that we would accept ages 10, 11, 12, 13 up to 18. We
are trying to put something in place that begins to tackle gang culture
so that individuals can benefit from measures that the
alternative  injunction could provide in terms of diversionary
activity or intervention. The judgment&#151;which is open to
suggestion&#151;is that 14 is the correct age to choose. We could
have made it 13, 12 or 16. The key point is about when it would be most
effective.</div>
<a name="1002106000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had
support for the age of 14 from a range of police forces and local
councils across the country. They supported injunctions for people of
ages 14 to 17&#151;which effectively means from age 14 to their 18th
birthday&#151;who would be the principal applicants for this type of
injunction should it be enacted. One of the key areas where such a
measure has already effectively been used as an injunction is
Birmingham city council. The assistant chief constable of West Midlands
police, Suzette Davenport,
wrote:</div><a name="1002106000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
community recognised the importance of these orders. Some mothers
implored us to seek an order for their son so that &#145;he
doesn&#146;t end up dead.&#146;&#148;</div>
<a name="1002106000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">We supported Birmingham
city council in its use of injunctions, granted under the inherent
jurisdiction of the courts and applied for under section 222 of the
Local Government Act 1972, to put similar provisions in place
accordingly and help reduce gang violence and robberies. We have had
debates on that under previous legislation regarding adult injunctions,
and Birmingham city council&#146;s evidence suggested that
injunctions were able to reduce serious harm by about 15 per cent.,
robbery by 12.5 per cent. and violent crime by 6 per cent.</div>
<a name="1002106000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nothing is an
exact science, but the murder of Kodjo Yenga in west London in March
2007 showed that children as young as 14 can be involved in gangs and
in the most brutal and violent acts. There is a judgment to be made and
a line to be taken. We will&#151;and have&#151;faced external
criticism for even considering an injunction on a gang member under the
age of 18. We have been proportionate, and we have determined that 14
is the age range. I hope that the Committee will accept
that.</div><a name="1002106000333"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="1002106000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me try to give some comfort to my hon. Friend the Member for
Stoke-on-Trent, South and the hon. Member for Hornchurch. They will
know that ASBOs 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div>can be imposed on individuals aged 10 and above. They are used regularly
for even younger individuals. I am only sad that we have to have these
provisions in the first place. In the area where I grew up in Liverpool
and in Cheshire near your constituency, Sir Nicholas, even on some of
the challenging estates there was not the current level of antisocial
behaviour and gang activity.</div>
<a name="1002106000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was a member
of a gang and I was quite proud of it, but we did not undertake some of
the activities of gangs today. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> My
hon. Friend the Under-Secretary saves me by saying that we did not
undertake any of the activities of the gangs of today. There are honest
agreements on this. I cannot give a definitive answer to why it is 14
as opposed to 16 or 10 or 11. It is an age that we put as a line. I
commend it to the
Committee.</div><a name="1002106000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000408"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I appreciate the way in which the Minister
responded, and where to draw the line is a difficult and delicate
issue. The sad reality is that there are third and fourth generation
gang members, and there is the whole issue of social justice and being
able to escape from a gang situation. Yes, people make decisions. They
make decisions about whether to commit crime and antisocial behaviour,
but, sadly, some factors that might encourage or promote that type of
activity exist in certain communities. Young children are being drawn
into the criminal gang structure.</div>
<a name="1002106000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I equally
recognise that the transition from primary to secondary school is a key
time of recruitment into some criminal gangs. Some young people who are
moving to secondary school are more vulnerable and want to fit in with
the new group at school. There is the whole concept of elders and the
foot soldiers who sit within these perverse gang structures that we see
organised in certain parts of the country. I find that level of
organisation highly disturbing.</div>
<a name="1002106000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
need to look very calmly at the measures that should be applied for use
in conjunction with teenagers and children to try to break this cycle
and to get young people out of the gangs and out of their exposure to
risk, because simply hanging around a known gang member puts them at
risk. They could be vulnerable to attack by being in the locality where
a gang member&#151;a nominal as they are described&#151;is known to
reside.</div>
<a name="1002106000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are key
issues of child welfare and child protection, and I recognise that one
of the conditions of the orders is preventive and is intended to stop
an individual from falling victim to an appalling act of violence,
whether by way of reprisal or simply through a wanton act. The question
is where we set the line.</div>
<a name="1002106000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened
carefully to the Minister on the decision to set the age at 14, and
there are arguments that it could be somewhat lower. That is the sad
reality facing young people in some parts of this country at the
moment. In the light of what the Minister has said, however, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="1002106000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Romford to
speak.</div><a name="1002106000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1002106000411"></a><b class="B">Andrew
Rosindell</b> (Romford) (Con): Thank you, Sir
Nicholas. New clause 29 amends the provisions of the Policing and Crime
Act 2009 on gangs. My hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch has talked
extensively about gang crime, describing how human beings get involved
in such crime and how it can affect communities, but we have yet to
hear about the use of animals in that respect and the effect on them,
and I should like to speak extensively on the
subject.</div><a name="1002106000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000412"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>Did you mean
succinctly?</div><a name="1002106000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000413"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> Indeed I did, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="1002106000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
many hon. Members will have examples from their own constituencies of
dogs being used in crime, the one member of a gang that has not been
mentioned in today&#146;s debate is the dog. Any animal can be used
in crime, but in this modern age, dogs have been used extensively,
particularly on estates. There are cases in which young people use
their pet as a weapon&#151;as something that puts fear into other
people&#151;so that people are afraid to walk in the park, on estates
and in the areas in which they live. I hope that the subject will be
addressed in the Bill, which is why I proposed my new
clause.</div><a name="1002106000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000414"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> It is not for me to curtail the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s speech, but it may help if I say to him that the
definition of gang-related violence includes violence or threat of
violence that involves a dog or an animal. Essentially, the Bill covers
the points on which he wants to elaborate in
detail.</div>
<a name="1002106000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000415"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is grateful
for that, as is the Committee. Nevertheless, I am sure that he will
present his
case.</div><a name="1002106000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000416"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> If that was an attempt to curtail my remarks,
the Minister will not succeed. None the less, I will say how inspired I
was on 18 January when the Home Secretary referred to the use of dogs
in gang crime. I was disappointed to see that there was no reference to
the use of animals in the Bill, which is what I seek to rectify
today.</div>
<a name="1002106000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I propose that
reference to the specific use of an animal, whether it be a dog or any
other type of creature, should be in the Bill to make it clear to those
involved in crime, the authorities, police and local government that
those who use an animal for criminal purposes are breaking the law. New
clause 29 would insert such a reference into legislation. Currently, no
provisions deal with animals that are used as weapons, although the
Minister says that that is implicit in the Bill. We all know that
dangerous dogs and status dogs are a modern-day phenomenon,
particularly in inner city areas&#151;</div>

<a name="1002106000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000418"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> Exactly, and I know that we will encounter them
in the weeks ahead. That aside, this is a very serious problem. My
mailbag is full of letters from people who fear the damage that dogs
can do to a local community and the harm they can do to children and
other dogs. In my own constituency, I have had many examples of such
problems. We need action.</div>
<a name="1002106000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both Ministers
know that I have spoken extensively on the subject in the House of
Commons, and particularly on the need to strengthen the law to ensure
that existing legislation is effective. At the moment, it is not
effective, but the Bill is a great opportunity to move it in the right
direction. I am not suggesting that root-and-branch reform of the
Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 can take place today; however, my new clause
would start a gradual move in that direction, to tackle a very serious
problem that blights the streets of many towns, cities, communities and
estates across the
country.</div><a name="1002106000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000419"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely good point.
We have all seen the problem, but it is nothing new. We must all have
read the tale of Bill Sikes and his dog in &#147;Oliver
Twist&#148;. That is the archetype from
history&#151;</div><a name="1002106000198"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000421"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> Indeed, literature, of using a dangerous dog. Does
the hon. Gentleman agree with me that, although it may be outside the
remit of the Bill, we should be looking more fundamentally at the sale
of dogs and the right to breed them? We should be getting to the heart
of the problem, rather than dealing with the
outcome.</div><a name="1002106000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000422"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I believe that intervention was slightly
beyond the scope of the Bill, even if I use my widest discretion. Will
the hon. Member for Romford deal with it in one
sentence?</div><a name="1002106000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000423"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South makes
an extremely valid point. It is an issue I am dealing with but I am
afraid we cannot go into detail in this Committee. I intend to take it
further at a more appropriate
stage.</div><a name="1002106000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
dogs are far and away the primary concern of the proposed new clause,
it is important to make provisions covering the use as weapons of all
and any animals, particularly considering the illegal importation of
exotic and poisonous species. I do not wish to frighten people more
than necessary but there are examples of problems that could occur,
particularly on estates where people decide to buy a pet&#151;an
exotic animal of some sort&#151;and that animal is then used for
inappropriate purposes. I have seen a snake on a council estate in my
constituency. Although that is not the main focus of my remarks, there
is potential for crime to be made far worse if animals are used. I hope
the Bill can go some way to deal with that; maybe not as far as we
would like, or as far as we are permitted. Nevertheless, it is an
opportunity for the Minister to tell us what he intends to do, both in
the Bill and in the future.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div><a name="1002106000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The training
and abuse of dogs as a means of acquiring and nurturing a living,
breathing offensive weapon, needs to be addressed from the view of both
public security and animal welfare&#151;let us remember that side of
things. I know in the Bill we are considering first and foremost the
welfare of human beings, but we must also consider the well-being of
the animal kingdom. Human beings on occasion use animals for
inappropriate purposes and we should stamp it out. If gangs are using
animals for inappropriate and cruel purposes and the welfare of the
animal is not being considered, there should be appropriate law to deal
with it and to remove that animal, to ensure the safety of the people
who live in that community and the welfare of the animal.</div>
<a name="1002106000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dogs are used
as weapons in fighting and attacks, as well as general status symbols.
That is where it all comes from in recent times: a dog is now a status
symbol. Some Members of the Committee will be aware that I own a
Staffordshire bull terrier. Sadly, that is the type of dog, along with
pit bull terriers, Rottweilers and other breeds, that people tend to
buy for status purposes. I believe that the culture of owning an animal
as a status symbol is wholly wrong&#151;wrong for the animal and
wrong in what the owner uses that animal for. An animal is to be
cherished as a gift and looked after as a member of the family, not
used for inappropriate purposes, which happens all too often in our
society
today.</div><a name="1002106000334"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6

Oaten:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman explain what exactly he
seeks to add to the Bill that the Minister has not already
outlined?</div><a name="1002106000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000425"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> I explained that at the beginning, when the
Minister mentioned that he felt that the matter was implicit in the
Bill. I want to see reference to the use of an animal in the Bill. New
clause 29 makes it clear that reference to animals used as weapons
should be in the legislation on gang-related
crime.</div><a name="1002106000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000426"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman wish me to table
amendments on Report that cover every potential aspect of violence? We
know the meaning of violence under common law. How it is undertaken and
by what means are irrelevant. It could be an iron bar, a dog or driving
a car in front of somebody. The act of violence is the defining factor
that we are considering. I would have to add a whole list of other
provisions to cover all
eventualities.</div><a name="1002106000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000427"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> If the Minister wishes to do that, perhaps he
could suggest it. All sorts have additions have been proposed for
inclusion in the Bill at this late stage. My concern is to highlight
the issue, to debate it with Ministers and to find out exactly how they
intend to deal with it. The Minister&#146;s interpretation is that
the matter is implicit in the Bill, and I accept that. I do not suggest
that we list every weapon that could be used. However, the right hon.
Gentleman should understand from all the debates in the House, all the
letters that he must receive on the subject and all the reports in the
national press how serious the problem is. The Bill presents an
opportunity to put in black and white in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div>legislation that the use of an animal in the context of gang violence is
against the law. I therefore hope that the Minister considers my
points.</div><a name="1002106000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would provide a welcome step in the direction of focusing on
gangs and their violent actions, as opposed to the current flawed
legislation that focuses on the breeding and ownership of specific
types of dog, as outlined in the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. The Minister
knows about the Dangerous Dogs Act study group, which is a body
established by the Kennel Club and includes representatives from
Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, The Blue Cross, the British Veterinary
Association, Dogs Trust, the Metropolitan police, the Royal College of
Veterinary Surgeons and Wandsworth borough council. The latter has
taken the matter seriously and has dealt with many of the problems on
their estates. I urge the Minister to visit Wandsworth to witness the
council&#146;s success. The study group also includes the Wood Green
Animal Shelters. It is not possible to find more eminent animal welfare
organisations that are dealing with the problem of dogs used in crime
on
estates.</div><a name="1002106000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000428"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I do not wish to prolong the discussion. I am
trying to be helpful and do not deny that there is a problem in certain
areas with dogs. However, if I accept the new clause, do I then have to
introduce provisions on snakes&#151;as the hon. Member for Romford
mentioned&#151;or other species of animal or other types of weapon?
The key issue here is the definition of violence, and it is the
violence itself, not the means of committing it, that is crucial to
securing convictions and injunctions under the
measure.</div><a name="1002106000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000429"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> Perhaps we are going around in circles. I
understand what the Minister says, and I do not suggest that he list
every animal that could be used in crime or could harm a person. I
mentioned snakes as an example of an exotic creature that could be
used. I do not suggest that he list every type of snake and reptile,
and every breed of dog. The new clause specifically mentions animals,
and could refer to any kind of
creature.</div><a name="1002106000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000430"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Taking the analogy further, one would have to
list every conceivable weapon&#151;a spanner or a piece of wood, a
knife or a gun. The list would be endless. The overarching word
violence clearly covers the matter.</div>
<a name="1002106000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000431"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> I hear what the hon. Lady says, but we are
talking about gang violence and the use of animals and I am trying to
focus on that aspect.</div>
<a name="1002106000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will take on board what I am saying. He may consider
accepting the amendment, but the matter is in his hands. The Government
have included additional provisions as the Bill has developed, so I
hope that the he will consider adding my new clause to the
Bill.</div>
<a name="1002106000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">One or two
facts will emphasise the importance of the subject in today&#146;s
modern society. The RSPCA saw a twelvefold increase in the number of
complaints about status and dangerous dogs between 2004 and 2008. I
believe that action needs to be taken to deal with the problem. The new
clause gives the Government the opportunity to deal with this aspect of
gang violence.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 361</div><a name="1002106000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a London MP,
I know that it is a great problem. I am not sure whether any other
London MPs are present, although the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden

London, where the problem is most severe, have seen a 79 per cent.
increase in admissions for dog-inflicted wounds; nationwide, there has
been a 43 per cent. increase. The problem cannot be ignored or brushed
aside&#151;it must be dealt with. If it cannot be done through the
Bill, I hope that the Government will consider it later&#151;if they
last long enough to produce a new Bill. The problem must be addressed,
and we have the opportunity to debate it now.</div>
<a name="1002106000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Seizures of
pit bull-type dogs shot up by 65 per cent. over the past
year&#151;evidence that the current legislation has not succeeded in
reducing their number on our estates or in our towns and cities. The
Minister may recall that, last summer, there was a major police raid in
London&#151;Operation Navara&#151;which was one of the biggest
operations of its kind. The Metropolitan police status dog unit
undertook a raid of 12 addresses of suspected gang members in south
London. It seized 20 illegal pit bull-type dogs, some as young
as four weeks old.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000432"></a>Mr.
Oaten:</b> On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. I seek your
guidance on whether the hon. Gentleman is straying from the Bill when
talking about dog violence in such detail.</div>
<a name="1002106000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000433"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am listening carefully to what the hon. Member
for Romford is saying, which is still within the scope of the Bill and
his new clause.</div>
<a name="1002106000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I say that
members of the Committee should be patient when listening to the hon.
Gentleman speaking on this subject? He has established an amazing
reputation over his years as a Member. Although for some it may be less
important than many of the other measures contained in the Bill, I
believe that he has every right to advance his new clause and give the
detailed statistics that he uses to present his
case.</div><a name="1002106000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000434"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas, for allowing me to
continue. May I first respond to the hon. Member for Winchester? I am
sorry that he feels that the topic should not be aired in Committee,
because I believe that his constituents would be interested in it. If
he were to ask, he would find that people believed it to be of equal
importance to many of the other matters that we have spent much of our
time debating. It is worth spending at least a few minutes to consider
this matter in more detail. I therefore hope that the Government will
consider what is being said and respond accordingly. Maybe he will
consider that
himself.</div><a name="1002106000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was talking about last year&#146;s Operation Navara. Puppies were
being bred to be turned into devil dogs. Let us be honest&#151;that
is what they are being bred for, and that is what they will be used
for: to spread fear and intimidation, and to threaten violence and harm
to local communities. It is a growing problem, which I hope will be
addressed. In that operation, specialist 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 362</div>officers in protective padded gear smashed down the doors of several
suspected gang members in early morning raids at 12 addresses in south
London. The problem is strongly gang-related&#151;of course,
individuals and their animals can also participate, but it is very much
a gang problem. People are using dogs as part of their gang in local
parks and recreation grounds and on estates. That is why I have raised
the subject during debate on this part of the Bill.</div>
<a name="1002106000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition
are highly concerned that current legislation is failing to tackle a
fast-growing problem with a long-term view to a complete overhaul,
which  I believe is necessary, of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.
I will not detain the Committee by reading all the different
recommendations of the Dangerous Dogs Act study group, but I urge the
Minister to obtain a copy of them and consider them for the
future.</div>
<a name="1002106000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that
we should begin by strengthening and reinforcing current law through
the proposed amendments. I therefore move new clause
29.</div><a name="1002106000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000435"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The hon. Member for Romford does not have to
move the new clause, as it is being taken with clause stand part. There
might be the possibility of putting it to the Committee at a later
stage. He was wise not to quote from the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, as he
would definitely have been out of order, and I would have been
reluctant to so
rule.</div><a name="1002106000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000436"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> We have had a reasonable debate on amendments to
the clause, so I do not propose to spend any time on clause stand part,
as I think that Committee members from all parties understand the
clause&#146;s
purpose.</div><a name="1002106000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 29 was tabled by the hon. Member for Romford. My intended
approach is not to decry the amount of concern that he has expressed.
There are problems relating to the use of dogs as a weapon, not just a
status symbol, by many people in certain parts of the country. That has
caused difficulty to ordinary members of the community as well as to
police and the enforcement agencies that deal with it. It is a serious
matter. The facts that he mentioned about the operations in Greater
London are absolutely correct. The problem needs to be addressed as
part of the overall examination of the
issues.</div><a name="1002106000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has discussed with the Secretary
of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs the wider issues,
which you may rule out of order, Sir Nicholas, relating to the
Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 and concerns about their criminal aspects. I am
not telling the Committee any secrets, as that has been mentioned
during Home Office questions and in the opening speeches on the Bill by
my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. There is a problem, and it
needs to be
addressed.</div><a name="1002106000335"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="1002106000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
ask the hon. Gentleman not to press his new clause, because we want to
ensure that we consider the definition of violence, as I said in my
intervention. Under section 34(5) of the Policing and Crime
Act 2009, we define gang-related violence as</div>
<a name="1002106000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;violence or a
threat of violence which occurs in the course of, or is otherwise
related to, the activities of a group
that&#151;</div><a name="1002106000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
consists of at least 3 people,</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 363</div><a name="1002106000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) uses a

is associated with a particular
area.&#148;</div><a name="1002106000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
used the
phrase</div><a name="1002106000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;violence
or a threat of
violence&#148;</div><a name="1002106000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">because
the use of an animal, particularly a dog, may not actually cause
physical damage to an individual, but would certainly be
terrifying&#151;very frightening&#151;and would constitute a threat
of
violence.</div><a name="1002106000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definition of violence, as I mentioned, is a common law
definition&#151;it is not in statute&#151;that indicates what
violence against the person or the property means and that has been
tested in law. The weapon used to commit the violence or threat of
violence is unnecessary in the legislation. It could be a crowbar, a
pit bull terrier or a piece of wood. It could be physical violence
without the use of any weapon whatsoever, or the threat of violence. We
know the common law definition of violence, and the courts understand
it.</div><a name="1002106000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000437"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear what the Minister is saying, but does
he agree that at times ownership of a dog may be a defining
characteristic of a gang, so it may be relevant in supporting an
application for a gang prevention order? Secondly, does he agree that
there may be a relevant use of the powers under such orders to restrict
someone who is in receipt of an order from being in possession of a dog
or taking it out into the community, for example, because of evidence
about the use of the animal in the
past?</div><a name="1002106000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000438"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Yes, but let me return to where we are with the
Bill. Clause 31 amends section 34 of the Policing and Crime Act 2009.
It refers to the gang-related violence or threat of violence in section
34(5) of that legislation. In essence, we are working with a common law
definition of
violence.</div><a name="1002106000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept entirely the position of the hon. Member for Romford that
violence or the threat of violence is the key defining characteristic.
I am advised that at present there is a trial in the Old Bailey where a
gang member over the age of 18 is being prosecuted under the current
Act, charged with the offence of serious violence against the person. A
dog was used as the weapon, and it falls within the definition in a
prosecution that I cannot comment on in detail but which is before the
courts  at
present.</div><a name="1002106000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000439"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> I fully accept what the Minister is saying, but
my point is that specifically referring to the use of an animal in the
legislation makes it crystal clear to everybody and also emphasises
strongly, because of the new threat on estates and in our towns and
cities, that it is an offence to use an animal. I know that is implicit
in the Bill&#151;the Minister is right to say that&#151;but what is
the objection to making it crystal clear by specifically referring to
animals in the
legislation?</div><a name="1002106000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000440"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The objection is clear: I would be highlighting
animals at the expense of any other form of violence or threat of
violence. If I include animals, someone could say as their defence,
&#147;Actually, I was using a piece of wood. The legislation does not
refer  to a piece of wood. I was not using an animal in
a  violent or threatening way.&#148; That would make it more
difficult to achieve the potential we have with the present
definition.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div><a name="1002106000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
disagree with the hon. Gentleman. There is  a problem with
animals in some parts of Greater London and some other areas, but I do
not believe that highlighting them will add to the overall ability to
prosecute cases of violence or threats of violence that are brought
before the courts or, in connection to clause 31, which is linked to
section 34 of the 2009 Act, to get the gang injunction we
seek.</div><a name="1002106000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000441"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> I accept what the Minister says. One cannot
list every instrument that could be used as a weapon, but an animal is
a living creature. That is the difference between listing a piece of
wood, a knife, a crowbar and so on, and a living, breathing animal.
They cannot be
compared.</div><a name="1002106000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000442"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Although I cannot quote them in detail, there is a
range of measures on the statute book to help to protect animals and
prevent cruelty against them. I do not have chapter and verse, but the
hon. Gentleman will know that a range of legislative options is
available in the event of an animal being abused by its owner. There
are daily prosecutions by a range of organisations, many of which have
supported the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="1002106000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
key for me is the definition of violence or threat of violence in
relation to clause 31, which goes back to section 34(5) of the 2009
Act. That is where we are. If I defined violence as less than that, I
would have to rewrite section 34 of the 2009
Act.</div><a name="1002106000242"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000443"></a>Mr.
Oaten:</b> I am suddenly warming to the theme of the hon.
Member for Romford. An individual must hold a pipe, a piece of wood, a
gun or a knife to carry out the action that creates the violence. The
difference with an animal is that it may independently carry out the
violence. I want the Minister to assure me that that aspect is covered,
because the person who perpetrated such violence could argue, &#147;I
didn&#146;t do anything&#151;the dog did it&#148;. Would those
circumstances be
covered?</div><a name="1002106000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000444"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> If a dog bites or attacks someone in the
community, a range of legislation, not least the Dangerous Dogs Act
1991&#151;I do not have the details in my head&#151;is available to
allow action to be taken, including action against the dog and/or the
owner, even if the owner did not have a dog on a lead at the time. That
aspect is covered under other measures.</div>
<a name="1002106000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
discussing the use of the gang injunction, which applies if there is
evidence of violence or threat of violence by a gang member as part of
their concern. All we are saying is that section 34 of the 2009 Act
defines that as someone who is a member of a gang involved in violence
or the threat of violence. Clause 31 simply adds that to section 34 and
says that the test for over-18s is the same as for under-18s, and it
means
&#147;violence&#148;.</div><a name="1002106000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know whether I can progress the debate much further, because my
arguments are becoming circular, which is not a good place to be.
Essentially, that is where I am at the moment. I am receiving
confirmation from elsewhere that it is already an offence to have a dog
dangerously out of control. Under the clause as drafted, if a dog is
used as a weapon by a gang member, an injunction is possible, and if
the gang member does not use the dog as a weapon, an injunction 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column365" />Column number: 365</div>is still possible. I do not believe that amendment is necessary and I do
not want to go round in circles, so I shall sit down. I ask the hon.
Member for Romford not to press his new clause, and to support the
clause as
drafted.</div><a name="1002106000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000445"></a>Andrew
Rosindell:</b> I do not intend to pursue the discussion
further. The purpose of my new clause was to air the matter and to
highlight to the Government that the issue is serious. I accept the
Minister&#146;s reassurance and hope that, whatever happens, it will
not be neglected in future

want to be helpful to the Committee. I understand that the usual

is now almost half-past six and we have been sitting for two and a half

hon. Members to have some sustenance. Whether we make sufficient
progress so as not to have to return after refreshment is entirely in
the hands of the Committee. I am a servant of the Committee. I am happy
to be here until and beyond the Adjournment of the House at
10.30pm&#151;I understand that it could be even later on the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000447"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendment 166, in
clause 32, page 65, line 24, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1A) In section
36 (contents of injunctions: supplemental), at the end of subsection
(3) there is inserted &#147;provided that in the case of a person
under the age of 18 a review hearing shall be held at least every six
months.&#148;&#146;.</div><a name="1002106000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
come to somewhat drier territory, I am sorry to say, after our
interesting debate about the use of dogs  as weapons and the
sad situation that dogs are part  of the gang culture and gang
violence that the clauses speak
to.</div><a name="1002106000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
166 would establish a six-month period in relation to review hearings
of a gang injunction issued to a child aged under 18. The reason for
that suggestion is that there are various aspects to the orders that
are granted. Some of them are restrictive; they try to prevent gang
activity by providing restrictions on someone who has been identified
as part of a gang and has carried out the activities that the Minister
has alluded to. Some aspects are preventive; they try to stop the
person from getting into harm as a consequence of being in a gang.
However, some aspects are intended to be positive&#151;to provide
engagement with services; it is envisaged that they will try to provide
assistance to a gang member in exiting their
gang.</div><a name="1002106000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is in that context that I raise the issue of a review. There are
certain parallels&#151; although they are not exact&#151;with the
issues dealt with by specialist drugs 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 366</div>courts, for example. At the North Liverpool community justice centre,
the concept of regular reviews is regarded as quite important, to
monitor the behaviour of the person and to see whether they are
adhering to the requirements imposed on them, in a positive sense of
ensuring that there is visible support in the system to aid them to
break either their pattern of behaviour or their pattern of
criminality.</div>
<a name="1002106000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000448"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> I think the hon. Gentleman was touching on the
point I wished to press him on. There is, of course, an issue about
whether the statutory agencies and indeed other agencies are living up
to their side of the bargain. For me, that is probably the most
important issue in many respects, because although it is all very well
that the young person who has been brought to task through the
injunction is willing to take the support and help, it is really
important to ensure that the help and support is
available.</div>
<a name="1002106000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000449"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely
important point. I was struck when I went to the North Liverpool
community justice centre that Judge Fletcher, who is in charge of that
court, uses the assessing and monitoring process not only to assess the
individual offender, but to ensure that statutory agencies that have
promised support on housing, welfare and other issues are adhering to
their side of the bargain.</div>
<a name="1002106000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">A review
process can be quite instrumental and not simply for the purposes of
focusing on the offender or, in this case, the recipient of an order.
If we are serious about trying to get some of those troubled youngsters
away from the gang path, it is important that the statutory agencies,
and the voluntary agencies that might provide them with support, adhere
to the requirements&#151;promises to assist the person in breaking
their pattern of offending, to challenge their behaviour, and get them
on a different
path.</div><a name="1002106000336"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="1002106000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
important aspect to young children under the age of 18 being subject to
this order is that early intervention presents a better chance to try
to change a pattern of behaviour, and a regular review might be of
assistance. I understand that the review period for ASBOs is every 12
months&#151;I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I have
misstated that in some way. I have suggested a period of six months in
relation to gang activity, because the pattern of behaviour is likely
to be much more severe and significant. The need for more regular
monitoring and reviewing justifies a more interventionist approach to
ensure&#151;for the reason given by the hon. Member for
Stoke-on-Trent, South&#151;that support services provide their end of
the bargain. Such an approach would ensure that a suspected gang member
knows that their behaviour is not only followed up by law
enforcement&#151;I am sure the police would seek to use these orders
in a way that presses that person to ensure that their lives are well
understood and that they will, in part, be constrained by these orders
to challenge their behaviour&#151;but by the court process as well.
Those two limbs are essential to break the pattern of
behaviour.</div>
<a name="1002106000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
requirements of the orders might be described as having a paternalistic
sense. That was something that was criticised by certain groups when
the original injunctions were proposed under the Policing and Crime Act
2009. However, that is an important part of making the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 367</div>orders effective in breaking patterns and preventing further gang
crime&#151;indeed, preventing some of these young kids from being
killed in tit-for-tat reprisals and other activity that takes place
between rival gangs. There is merit in considering the requirements to
try and ensure that the orders will be effective for this younger age
group.</div>
<a name="1002106000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The summary
RIA talks about a pilot being used to test the injunctions for this age
group, saying that</div>
<a name="1002106000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the estimated
costs of the pilot are between &#163;24,750 and &#163;92,300. The
Home Office has agreed to fund any costs arising from the pilot, either
in whole or in partnership with pilot agencies.&#148;</div>
<a name="1002106000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">That appears, when one
looks at some of the other focused costs, to be about court security
costs, legal fees, legal aid, supervision orders and custody. On the
costs that may be attributed to the pilot for the use of the orders for
young people, I would hope that either directly or indirectly, through
the partnership arrangements that are being drawn up, funding can be
drawn to focus on those preventive measures that perhaps try to use the
window of the injunction and the criminal justice intervention to break
that pattern of offending.</div>
<a name="1002106000302"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">It is
important to use the order in that way, and not simply to be
protective. Of course, I feel very strongly about protecting
communities from the scourge of gang violence that far too many
inner-city areas suffer, and these orders could be effective in that
way. However, it is also important to look at how we change behaviour
and why the regular reviews&#151;checking that the interventions are
there, that the support is there, and that those measures that might
change long-term patterns of behaviour are there&#151;are effective
through this mechanism. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will
consider the proposal
seriously.</div>
<a name="1002106000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000450"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> As the hon. Gentleman knows, there is a review
after 12 months. That process is understood and accepted, and it
operates under the Policing and Crime Act in respect of those over 18
who receive an injunction under section 36(4), which specifically
states that that review should take place. The under-18 injunction
would operate in a similar
way.</div><a name="1002106000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the review period were shortened to six months, officers dealing with
the injunction would spend a lot of time bureaucratically working
through the review at that point rather than getting on with running
the injunction. That would be a diversionary activity, not for the
young person, but for the officers dealing with the injunction, That is
not how we seek to make progress on these
matters.</div><a name="1002106000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is provision in the Bill both for an application to remove the
injunction before the 12-month period if the authorities think that
progress has been made by the young person and for the young person to
apply to have the injunction lifted, if they wish. The Bill contains
proposals that would allow a young person to discharge the injunction,
should they feel that they are no longer involved in a gang or
gang-related
violence.</div><a name="1002106000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to be quick, because this matter is relatively simple. The
individual can apply to lift the injunction, those who receive one can
apply to have it lifted and we have a review at 12 months anyway. A
review at six months would lead to too much extra work and bureaucracy
and to a focus on the review rather than on the individual. I therefore
urge the hon. Member for Hornchurch to ask leave to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000451"></a>Mr.
Flello:</b> Will my right hon. Friend consider whether, when
the injunction is reviewed at 12 months, a view should be taken about
the level of support from the statutory and other agencies, through
guidance or in some other way, so that that is at the forefront of
people&#146;s minds when reviewing injunctions at the 12-month point
and so that, if action needs to be taken against the authorities, it is
taken?</div><a name="1002106000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000452"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> That is a helpful suggestion, because
generally&#151;let us go back to basics&#151;the purpose of the
injunction is to stop an individual being involved in gang-related
activity or gang-related violence. Therefore the injunction is a tool
used, under the under-18 proposals, to divert the young person away
from the gang and to engage them in other activity. Sufficient progress
may have been made to lift the injunction, but insufficient progress
may have made with the individual to ensure that they return to society
in a positive way and play a positive role generally, and they may need
further support outside the injunction, and that would be a matter of
course.</div><a name="1002106000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are investing time, energy and resources into ensuring that the
individual can be diverted from a future life of crime, meaning not
just gang activity up  to the age of 18, but invariably a long
conviction with 20 or 30 years in prison for murder at some point
downstream. I have no objection to my hon. Friend&#146;s proposal,
which will be considered as part of the management of the gang
injunction and the individual to whom the injunction
applies.</div><a name="1002106000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000453"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> This short debate has been helpful. The
contribution of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South helped to
elucidate some of the arguments on the need for support services to
respond. Sadly, that is not necessarily the reality. Sometimes we need
checks and balances in the system to ensure that the orders, which are
intended to be preventive and provide support services through the
mechanism we are discussing, operate in that way.</div>
<a name="1002106000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Home
Office&#146;s equality impact assessment report
states:</div><a name="1002106000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
ability to lever respondents into support programmes and mentoring is a
key component that is designed to ensure that the benefits of exiting
the gang lifestyle are felt by the respondent as well as the community
they live
in.&#148;</div><a name="1002106000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
has to be what we seek to use the order for. It is both preventive and
protective. I know that the Minister is unwilling to accept the
amendment, but I hope that he will reflect on the points that have been
raised on guidance, because the orders must take that into account if
they are to be effective in directing a troubled young person away from
the gang and the long jail time to which the Minister rightly alluded.
Sadly, the reality is that for some gang members a spell in prison is
seen as a rite of passage that shows they have proved themselves to the
gang. That is the sick reality of what we see  with some of
those organised criminal gangs in parts of the country.</div>
<a name="1002106000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my journeys
across the country, whether in Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool or
here in London, I have been struck by the way in which some of those
gangs operate. The debate has been helpful. I note what the Minister
has said and the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent,
South, and I hope 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 369</div>that the matter will be reflected, if not in the Bill, at least in the
guidance on how those provisions are to be implemented. I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000454"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendment 167, in

now come to the requirement for consultation with certain agencies, in
some ways developing the matters that we have just debated. The
amendment would add children&#146;s social services departments to
the list of consultees in the clause when an order is sought for a
young person. I certainly agree that youth offending teams should be
added, but the circumstances of a troubled young person within a gang
are likely to be complex. I appreciate that there are some consultation
requirements with the local authority, but in relation to the young
person, we need to ensure that that is not at a high-end level and that
the children&#146;s social services department or the
children&#146;s safeguarding board are
consulted.</div><a name="1002106000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
its report on knife crime, the Home Affairs Committee highlighted
evidence it received from the National Youth Agency on the critical
factors, identified in research in the UK and the US, that can heighten
the risk of a young person becoming involved in street violence,
including</div>
<a name="1002106000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Detachment from
families; Absence of or poor/inconsistent parental support;...Weak
bonds with school and other institutions;...High levels of
association with delinquent peers;...High levels of hopelessness:
having negative expectations about oneself and one&#146;s future
life;...Propensity to be impulsive and engage in risk taking
behaviour; and...Living in neighbourhoods where positive
opportunities are few, where social controls are weak, and where gangs
are already
embedded.&#148;</div><a name="1002106000303"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">If
we are to structure the terms of the orders correctly, it is important
that there is a specific requirement to consult children&#146;s
social services departments, because the clause envisages issues
relating to education, health and well-being and the important need to
assess appropriate family situations. Another reason for flagging that
up with the children&#146;s social services department in the council
might be the presence of
siblings.</div><a name="1002106000278"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000455"></a>Mr.
Oaten:</b> I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. However,
my understanding of the youth offending teams is that such consultation
is already embedded in their work, so there is a danger of
duplication.</div><a name="1002106000337"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="1002106000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000456"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> It is right that the youth offending team is
structured as an agency that deals with youth offending. However, the
delivery of some of the preventive services will not necessarily reside
with the youth offending teams. The teams will need to look outside
their organisation to the local authorities to provide some of the
support services that we debated previously, and in relation to this
specific provision on consultation. Although there may be consultation
with the YOT, that does not necessarily 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div>mean that there will be a wider engagement with the children&#146;s
social services and the local safeguarding children boards, which look
into the wider aspects of services that might need to be provided to
make the order effective.</div>
<a name="1002106000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the big
risk factors is educational underachievement. Kids may be excluded from
school, which then may lead them down a particular path. So the role of
the local authority is critical, as is the role of the
children&#146;s social services department. I know that the Minister
will probably rise and say that local authorities are already
incorporated in this measure under the Policing and Crime Act 2009, but
what do we mean by that? We need to be specific in relation to
children&#146;s social services in this context, because we are
talking about the under-18s. We want to ensure that the right section
of the local authorities is consulted. Local authorities often say that
part of the problem with partnership is not simply with the relevant
agencies outside the local authority but in getting the bits within the
local authority to talk to each other. That is why there is merit in
inserting in the Bill a specific requirement to ensure that a
particular part of the local authority is engaged with a young person
who may be isolated.</div>
<a name="1002106000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
justification of my position relates to siblings. I was struck when I
met members of the Excalibur taskforce recently in Manchester, who said
that a young person who is identified as a gang member may well have
siblings. The relationship that a sibling has with the gang
member&#151;even though they may not be a gang member
themselves&#151;puts them at considerable risk. If we identify a gang
member who may need to be subject to an order, the consultation
requirement is not necessarily simply to speak with that person but to
consult their family and the other young people who reside in the
household. We have to ensure that appropriate protective services are
provided for the siblings. I tabled my proposal to be helpful and to
gain clarity. I suspect I know what the Minister will say in response,
but I hope that he will appreciate the context in which I am raising
the matter. We wish to ensure that support services are delivered
appropriately by the local authority as a key agency, and that the
position of siblings is properly reflected in any action that is
taken.</div>
<a name="1002106000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000457"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The hon. Gentleman is not only writing his own
speeches but writing mine before I rise to make them. The points that
he has mentioned for me to reflect back to him are the very points that
I was going to reflect back to him. Section 38(2) of the Policing and
Crime Act 2009 states:</div>
<a name="1002106000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
consultation requirement is that the applicant must
consult&#151;</div>
<a name="1002106000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) any local authority,
and any chief police officer, that the applicant thinks it appropriate
to consult, and</div>
<a name="1002106000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) any other body or
individual that the applicant thinks it appropriate to
consult.&#148;</div><a name="1002106000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
33 adds to that section a requirement to consult the youth offending
team. Local authorities are responsible for children&#146;s services.
The amendment is interesting, and I am not decrying it, because there
may be merits in focusing particularly on that issue, but I believe
that it is covered in a way that also allows consultation with housing,
transport, and education departments, not just children&#146;s
services. An individual of 14, 15, 16 or 17, may well have left
full-time education and have become involved with housing, transport or
other  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 371</div>support services. The Policing and Crime Act will allow the wider
consultation that the hon. Gentleman seeks with his
amendment.</div>
<a name="1002106000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The nature of
the assessment for a gang injunction will come under the assessment of
the managing and risk of violent offenders. Multi-agency risk
assessment arrangements were set up in 2001. They bring together
police, probation and prison services, together with other agencies,
such as social care, health, housing, children and education services
and local authorities, to look at the potential risk posed by serious
sexual and violent
offenders.</div><a name="1002106000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
services available and the injunctions that will be granted if the
clause is passed will operate in that context. Guidance will be
produced by the Home Office on the management of those issues. Only
last month, colleague officials from the Home Office held a gang
management event in London with 33 of the 43 police forces in
attendance to look at the issue of guidance, which I know the hon.
Gentleman seeks to have in place. Therefore, that guidance is covered.
It is an interesting amendment and the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points
are relevant and will be reflected on. However, I believe that they are
covered by section 38 of the 2009 Act, and I therefore ask him to
withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="1002106000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000458"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his
response. I remember the debate on the consultation requirements in the
2009 Act, which is perhaps why I was able to second guess his reply.
However, if we are making changes elsewhere so as to reflect slight
differences in the application of these orders to children, it is worth
reflecting that the appropriate consultee within the local authority is
incorporated in that.</div>
<a name="1002106000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have put forward their Every Child Matters agenda, which is intended to
reflect that age group and ensure that that responsibility resides
there.  I hear what the Minister says about the consultation
requirements and I certainly will not press the amendment to a vote. I
hope that with guidance, there will be a strong means of ensuring that
the appropriate parts of the local authority structure are properly
engaged, in managing not simply the risk to the individual identified
as a gang member, which I have already spoken about, but the risk to
siblings. It is of significant concern to me that we ensure that, if
necessary, protective services are put in place so that a young life is
not put at risk simply because of the familial relationship with a gang
member. I hear what the Minister has said; I am not surprised by it and
in the light of the debate, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000459"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendment 170, in clause 34,
page 66, line 19, leave out &#145;any&#146; and insert
&#145;that&#146;.</div><a name="1002106000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
shall see if we can rattle through a few points before 7 o&#146;clock
and supper. This is a probing amendment to help us understand the
purpose of the clause, which would apply to all gang injunctions. The
clause states 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column372" />Column number: 372</div>that if an application to vary or discharge an order is made but
dismissed, no further applications can be made by any person without
the consent of the court.</div>
<a name="1002106000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
appears to apply not only to injunctions or orders that are available
for those under 18, but more generally. It would be helpful to
understand why that is needed. It also seems strange because it cannot
have been developed by way of practice&#151;we know that there has
not been any practice. Why is the measure being introduced at this
point? Why was it not considered at the outset? Why should an
application of one party prejudice the application of another? In any
event, one of the applications would have to be determined by the
court. If one person has applied and been unsuccessful, there is
perhaps merit in saying that that person cannot reapply, to prevent an
abuse of process. Equally, another party may wish to apply in certain
circumstances.</div>
<a name="1002106000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
question of understanding what prejudice or administrative burden the
Minister is seeking to deal with or correct in the clause. If it is
thought there might be abuse it would be useful to know, so that we can
understand better why the clause is in the Bill. The amendment would
make the clause say that the application relates to that
person&#151;in other words, if a person has applied for some form of
variation, they should be prevented from making a further application.
The question is why that should prejudice an application by any other
person.</div><a name="1002106000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000460"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I hope that the points made by the hon. Member for
Hornchurch will be deemed unnecessary, because the clause meets those
objectives. Clause 34 provides that once the court has dismissed an
application by either party to vary or discharge the injunction, no
future application by either party will be heard unless the court
consents. The straightforward purpose is to ensure that we prevent
repeated and vexatious applications to the court, which I know the hon.
Gentleman would not wish.</div>
<a name="1002106000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
seeks, in essence, to provide each party with an automatic bite of the
cherry before requiring the consent of the court to hear an application
to vary or discharge. Once the court has dismissed an application to
vary or discharge, it is required to consider any future applications
made by either party before deciding whether a full hearing is
necessary. The clause is proportionate and will ensure that we do not
get vexatious applications to the court. I hope the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="1002106000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1002106000461"></a>James
