<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000456"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before we begin, I have a few points to make.
Members may, if they wish, remove their jackets during the sittings.
Will they ensure that their mobile phones and pagers are turned off or
at least switched to silent running during our proceedings? I would
hate interruptions. I will have enough difficulty concentrating on the
detail myself, without there being distractions. I remind the Committee
that there is a money resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of
which are available in the room. Adequate notice should be given of
amendments and, to be eligible for selection at a Tuesday sitting, they
must be tabled by the rise of the House on the previous Thursday. To be
eligible for selection at a Thursday sitting, they must be tabled by
the previous Monday. As a general rule, I and my fellow Chairmen do not
intend to call starred
amendments.</div><a name="08110469000006"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
everyone is familiar with the process of taking oral evidence in Public
Bill Committees, so it might help if I explain briefly what is proposed
so that we can all be clear about it, especially me. The Committee will
be asked first to consider the programme motion on the amendment paper
for which debate is limited to half an hour. We shall then consider a
motion to report written evidence, followed by a motion to permit the
Committee to deliberate in private in advance of the oral evidence
sessions, which I hope that we can take formally to save
time.</div><a name="08110469000007"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assuming
that the second motion has been agreed, the Committee will then move
into private session. After it has deliberated, witnesses and members
of the public will be invited back into the room and our oral evidence
session will commence. That should be at about 10.30. We shall not be
starting the evidence session before then. If the Committee agrees to
the programme motion, it will hear oral evidence today and on Thursday,
and revert to the more familiar proceedings of clause-by-clause
scrutiny next week. I call the Minister to move the programme
motion.</div><a name="08110469000008"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion

<a name="08110469000009"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110469000457"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): I wish to say a few
words about the programme motion. The sub-committee&#146;s
deliberations were a somewhat tortuous affair. We appreciate that a
number of difficulties and irregularities involved in the process made
it complicated and, as you will appreciate, Mr. Cook, we put
our various protests on the record. We have lingering doubts about the
timetable, even though we do not intend to oppose the motion. We are
worried whether there will be adequate time for the tabling of
amendments. I accept that there will be several hours after the close
of the final evidence session on Thursday before the rise of the House,
as you said in your opening remarks, when we shall have time to table
amendments. Having said that, we would have preferred a longer period
in which to contemplate amendments, rather than just a few hours
following the end of the evidential process. On that basis, we are
reserving our position on the timetable to some extent and hope, as
discussed in a sub-committee, that the Government will be open-minded
if it seems that more time is
required.</div><a name="08110469000010"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110469000458"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Alan Reid</b> (Argyll and Bute) (LD): I welcome you to the
Chair this morning, Mr. Cook. I have one point about the
programme motion, echoing what has just been said. If, following the
evidence sitting on the Thursday, we have only a few hours or, if the
House rises early, no time at all to submit amendments, I ask you and
your fellow Chairs, Mr. Cook, to take cognisance of that and
perhaps accept starred amendments, if they arise as a result of
evidence that we take on the Thursday and they ought to be
debated on the following Tuesday.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 3</div><a name="08110469000011"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000459"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We shall bear that in
mind.</div><a name="08110469000012"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000460"></a>The
Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Mr. Michael
Wills):</b> I shall respond briefly to those comments. As
reference has been made to the informal proceedings, in keeping with
the spirit in which the Government approached the informal proceedings
setting the programme motion, we were determined to do everything we
possibly could to accommodate the timetable of Opposition spokespeople.
They had a certain amount of confusion about their diaries and we did
everything that we could to accommodate them. We shall continue in that
spirit. If there is a need to find further time, we shall do everything
possible. The subject is important and we want to debate it properly.
We would not want the Opposition to be constrained by a lack of time
for tabling amendments, if we can possibly avoid
it.</div><a name="08110469000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000461"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you. I am sure that is
helpful.</div><a name="08110469000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110469000462"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Tyrie</b> (Chichester) (Con): I did not participate in
the informal sub-committee, so I am not privy to any of those alleged
confusions, difficulties or complexities, but it strikes me that the
crucial issue, if we are to make sense of the evidence sittings, is to
be given enough time to think through how to translate the evidence
that we have had into amendments. I am grateful, Mr. Cook,
that you will bear starred amendments in mind. It would be hugely
helpful if you could give us a feel later in our proceedings, but
before Thursday, what your attitude will be on the specific issue of
amendments derived from evidence that may have been collected only in
the hours prior to what at the moment is the
deadline.</div><a name="08110469000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000463"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Like you, Mr. Tyrie, I was not able
to attend the pre-meeting, but I am reliably informed that matters have
been discussed in considerable detail. It is a matter for the usual
channels to sort out on the way through. There is nothing cast in stone
or iron here. I am sure that, with the Government&#146;s intention to
be extremely reasonable and rational, as we heard, everyone will have
every
chance.</div><a name="08110469000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110469000464"></a><b class="B">Pete

serving under the chairmanship of yourself and Sir Nicholas over the
coming weeks.</div>
<a name="08110469000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secretary of

confidence in our electoral
system?</div><a name="08110469000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> I hope that that is one of the effects. Within
that, the purpose of the Bill is also to improve the operation and
effectiveness of the Electoral Commission, not least in the light of
the significant criticism of its effectiveness which was made by the
Committee on Standards in Public Life.</div>

3</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000471"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> There is indeed, Secretary of State. Given that
the vast majority of alleged, or real, crimes in relation to elections
occur in respect of electoral fraud&#151;I believe that there were
some 450 incidents of reported alleged crimes, of which only 40 were
prosecuted in the event&#151;why does the Bill not deal with that
issue at
all?</div><a name="08110469000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> There is already a substantial body of law in
the principal Act, as well as in common law and other statutes. You
will be aware that the provenance of this Bill goes back to the
establishment of the Hayden Phillips inquiry at the beginning of 2006.
I may be wrong about this, but I cannot recall any representations by
any political party, or other outsiders, that the law in respect of
fraudulent practices needs to be changed or improved. However, we are
open to further representations, including from your party. I may be
wrong and there have been representations, but I do not recall any
suggesting that that should be the focus of the Bill, which, as I said,
builds on substantial legislation that, ultimately, was passed with
all-party agreement in
2000.</div><a name="08110469000035"></a>

move on to the next question. How many incidents of or investigations
into malpractice relating to party funding have there been over the
past five years?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div><a name="08110469000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> On your first assertion, that the Conservative
party says that the Bill should focus on fraud, I was party to the
Hayden Phillips discussions over a long period and to the statement
that I made in the House in March 2007. The focus was on different
things. We are happy to receive representations from your party and, if
your party feels that amendments should be made, obviously we shall
look at them, as we always do, on the merits. I have made it clear,
ever since I started dealing with this area 10 or 11 years ago, that it
is important to work on a consensual basis, and I still think
so.</div><a name="08110469000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000473"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I totally accept that the Hayden Phillips
discussions were on party funding. What is not the case is that the
Bill is anything to do with the Hayden Phillips discussions. In fact,
you yourself said on Second Reading that we have moved beyond Hayden
Phillips and that you were looking for another way to move forward.
Returning to my question, how many incidents have there been of
prosecutions, or even investigations, over the past five
years?</div><a name="08110469000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
6</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000474"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is that not central to the
Bill?</div><a name="08110469000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> No. I do not have the figures to hand, but if
you want to ask such specific questions&#151;detailed statistical
evidence, which I do not know whether my officials have to
hand&#151;I would be happy to provide the
information.</div><a name="08110469000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
matter of correction, Mr. Djanogly, on what I said about the
provenance of a significant part of the Bill, although obviously the
policy has been developed. Quite a number of clauses relate to
improving how the Electoral Commission is constituted and operates.
Those parts of the Bill follow from the reports of three, separate,
independent investigations, in date order, from the Select Committee on
Constitutional Affairs&#151;precursor of the Justice
Committee&#151;the Committee on Standards in Public Life and the
Hayden Phillips inquiry. All three inquiries addressed the question of
how the Electoral Commission could and should be
improved.</div><a name="08110469000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000475"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> You said that the Bill relates to Hayden
Phillips, which is not exactly what you said on Second
Reading.</div><a name="08110469000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> What I said was its
provenance.</div><a name="08110469000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000476"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We are well post-Hayden Phillips. However, given
that, I find your further point rather disturbing. You said that the
figures relating to the prosecutions for party funding misdemeanours
are not known to you, and I think you said that they were not relevant
to our discussions. On the basis of what you said, which was that this
should be about party funding rather than electoral fraud, the figures
are directly relevant and the core of what the Bill is about. That is
what you are seriously maintaining the Bill should be dealing with, yet
you cannot provide the
figures.</div><a name="08110469000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> You are tilting at a windmill, if I may say
so. I have been completely inserted into all the discussions since I
became Leader of the House in May 2007. As sure as I am sitting here,
the focus has been on how we improve the Electoral Commission and the
crucial area of dealing with the arms race. It has been acknowledged on
all sides that it is absolutely essential to the operation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>of good elections in this country that there should be effective limits
on the totality of campaign spending&#151;in the generic
sense&#151;by political parties, so that we do not get into the
position of other countries. Particular concerns have been made by
some, though not all, parties, that there is a lacuna in this
Act&#151;unintended, I may say&#151;which does not provide for
regulation of expenditure by candidates until the election period
itself.</div>
<a name="08110469000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because these
were the terms of reference of the Hayden Phillips inquiry, there was
extensive discussion within both that inquiry and then the
all&#151;party talks, which he chaired, about whether there was scope
to introduce donation limits in return for state funding. However, you
will be aware that those discussions were aborted when the Conservative
party, as it happens, were unable to proceed on the basis of a draft
agreement, which had been brokered with those three parties in the
early part of
2007.</div><a name="08110469000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><a name="08110469000477"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): It is again very pleasurable to
sit under your chairmanship, Mr.
Cook.</div><a name="08110469000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlike
Jonathan Djanogly, I agree with you, Secretary of State, that the heart
of this Bill is donations and expenditure. The relationship of the Bill
with the Hayden Phillips&#146; compromise, which itself draws on what
the Select Committee did, is at the heart of the matter. Can you talk
about the Hayden Phillips proposals? Do you agree with me that it is
disappointing that, as far as I can see, you are not in a position to
submit anything of the major proposals that Hayden Phillips put
forward? Those proposals were: a global cap on spending to cover the
entire electoral cycle at national level; a donation cap of
&#163;50,000; and a way of dealing with the vexed issue of the union
relationship with the Labour party, which would separate out donations
on the one hand and affiliations on the other.</div>
<a name="08110469000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> It is disappointing. All three parties went in
good faith into the negotiations following the Hayden Phillips final
report in March 2007. Certainly, that was the impression that both your
party representatives and mine had of the approach of the Conservative
party up until the summer break. A draft heads of agreement was then
put together by Sir Hayden&#146;s team, which I understand was
brokered with each of the party representatives, and has now been made
public. Then the original meeting that was to take place on 3 September
was deferred at the request of the Conservatives. There was then a
discussion about whether it should take place in early October. We
finally had the meeting on 30 October last year when&#151;as
David Heath, the then Liberal Democrat representative on the inquiry
said&#151;the Conservative party walked away. They did walk
away&#151;I was present too.</div>
<a name="08110469000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Hayden
proposals required movement by all three political parties&#151;that
is in the nature of an effective compromise. We were ready to move; I
believe that the Liberal Democrat party was ready to move. But I am
clear about one thing&#151;and I have said it repeatedly. Although
there will be some heated discussions about what should go into
electoral law, our political system is not served if we end up with
legislation which is partisan and not accepted by all parties, however
reluctantly I come to that view.</div>
<a name="08110469000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">It could be
said that the political climate was different back in 1999-2000. But
since we had a very large majority and there was every possibility at
that stage 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>that we would be in power for a decade, which has turned out to be the
case, I and colleagues in Cabinet at that time, and on the Floor of the
House, were determined that although we could have pushed a partisan
point, we did not, so that we ended up with an agreed Act. That is what
I hope we can achieve here, notwithstanding my own disappointment and
your party&#146;s about the fact that we came very close to a
sensible and reforming set of proposals, which were not
accepted.</div>
<a name="08110469000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
10</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000478"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The question now is what to do, given that the
talks broke down then. Notwithstanding what you said about consensus,
two things could have been done: to propose at least what Hayden
Phillips proposed, and to challenge parties that were against it to
explain why they were against it. One point of view is that at that
point a different consensus would break out; a consensus backed by
where the public is rather than where the parties
are.</div><a name="08110469000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
you talked about the political climate. Is it not possible to say now
that the political climate has changed again? We have had a new round
of scandals, of possible donation scandals and so on. We have also seen
the collapse of the financial sector of the economy from where a lot of
donations previously came. Would now not be a good time at least to try
to reopen the talks, so instead of having a tiny Bill&#151;I shall
come on to its proposals in a minute&#151;that will do virtually
nothing about such issues, we do something more comprehensive; more
what the public
want?</div><a name="08110469000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> As for the new round of scandals, it is
important to put things into perspective. If it emerges that a leading
spokesman for one party or another has been discussing donations, that
could conceivably not come within the 2000 Act regime. It would be a
story, but there are proper processes for it to be investigated and, as
far as I know, such matters have been referred to the Electoral
Commission. It is up to each individual to judge whether they amount to
a scandal&#151;they certainly amount to a story. The regime for
handling, for example, allegations of donations that have been made
unlawfully because they are from overseas, subject to proposals in the
context of the Bill, is substantial, but perhaps it needs to be
improved.</div><a name="08110469000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the heart of your question, Mr. Howarth, which is
whether we can get the talks going, that would only be if there were
suddenly indications from all three parties that the time was right,
otherwise we would be wasting our time. If we were to go for a scheme
of donation limits, it is fundamental and it was accepted that that
would have to be paralleled by the introduction of state funding
because there would be a loss of income to all three political parties
and to the smaller parties if it were to happen. There have been many
proposals for how mechanisms would operate, some of which I personally
find attractive, but it is the case that, for example, the Leader of
the Conservative party for understandable reasons said explicitly last
November that</div>
<a name="08110469000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there can be no
justification for more state funding of political parties unless a
tough
cap&#148;</div><a name="08110469000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
applied on
donations.</div><a name="08110469000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty is to arrive at a regime that balances the two issues and
there must be a judgment, especially at a time of economic difficulty,
about whether it would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>acceptable to our constituents to pay a sum approaching &#163;100
million by way of state funding. It would be their money, not ours. I
am nervous about that proposition, as are many others at the moment, so
it will take some time, and there might need to be further
consideration of the issue down the track, once the revised regime
established by the Bill settles down, by a body such as the Committee
on Standards in Public Life, which did a good job&#151;although not a
perfect job&#151;11 years
ago.</div><a name="08110469000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
11</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000479"></a>David
Howarth:</b> But the amount of state funding that might be
required should be revisited in light of what has happened in the US,
with Barack Obama raising hundreds of millions of dollars in small
amounts in a place where there is a donation cap. It might be worth
going back to the talks with the question of how much state funding
there should be and how long it would need to last to get us into a
completely different system, where parties supported themselves out of
small
donations.</div><a name="08110469000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
may I come to what is in the Bill with regard to the return of
triggering? That is the only proposal that tries to deal with those
issues, and to a lot of people it seems an inadequate tool. That is
because, first, it deals only with candidate spending and not with the
heart of the matter, which is party spending outside elections. Parties
can continue to pour money into particular constituencies, and as long
as they do not refer to a particular candidate&#146;s campaign, that
spending will not be covered and therefore there is no change from the
current
system.</div><a name="08110469000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
when we had triggering previously, it led to a situation where agents
would send threatening letters to one another, no case would ever go to
court and no one really knew whose election expenses had started. It
did not work and was generally considered unenforceable. Instead of
bringing back the triggering mechanism, would it not be better to have
something like the Hayden Phillips proposal, but targeted at local
party spending? We could have the Hayden Phillips proposal for a
national cap and, underneath that, a local cap throughout the electoral
cycle. That would catch all this, targeting local spending outside
elections.</div>
<a name="08110469000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> Of course there is a case, which was looked at
in some detail by Hayden, for comprehensive and continuous spending
limits that essentially include all aspects of political
parties&#146; activities, apart from such things as pension
contributions for their staff. It would be assumed that political
parties existed principally for the purpose of winning elections and
that all their activities, national and local, were covered by a
cap.</div><a name="08110469000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are various of ways of doing that. One way would be to have a national
limit of x million pounds a year, with an increase for the 12 months
prior to a general election, and then&#151;either within or outwith
that limit&#151;to set a specific local limit as well. That is
certainly a proposition and Hayden Phillips came close to endorsing it,
but not completely. He was trying to search for a consensus, as I have
been trying to do since May 2006. However, Hayden did say, at page 15
of his March 2007
report:</div><a name="08110469000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
parties will need to consider carefully what level of local control is
necessary to realise their commitment to limit campaign spending as a
whole.&#148;</div><a name="08110469000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a supplement to the answer that I gave Mr. Djanogly,
indicating that on that issue, too, the provenance of the Bill is what
Hayden Phillips said.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div><a name="08110469000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">We might argue
about whether the triggering proposals are adequate or fair. My view is
that when they existed before, of course they were not
perfect&#151;these things rarely are&#151;but they acted as a
dampener on activity. A judgment had to be made about what was covered
by the definition, as it then stood, in the Representation of the
People Act 1983, as expenses
incurred</div><a name="08110469000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
respect of the conduct or management of the
election&#148;.</div><a name="08110469000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
terms were altered slightly by the 2000
Act.</div><a name="08110469000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will be familiar with the judgment in the Fiona Jones case,
in which the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham,
said:</div><a name="08110469000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Election
expenses are not incurred where a constituency party carries on its
ordinary political activity otherwise than with reference to a specific
election which is reasonably imminent, even though such activity has
the ultimate aim of winning public support and gaining or retaining
power in the constituency; nor are they incurred by a candidate who
nurses the constituency. An election expense means expenses incurred,
by or on behalf of a particular
candidate&#148;.</div><a name="08110469000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
long as we have a distinction&#151;some of the parties are keen on
maintaining it&#151;between the general activity of political parties
and activities that are related to</div>
<a name="08110469000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the conduct or
management of the
election&#148;,</div><a name="08110469000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
in the old definition, or for the purposes of an election, as in the
new definition, we must make a judgment about where the division
falls.</div><a name="08110469000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
said, I have not suggested that I think the reintroduction of
triggering is a perfect answer. The reason I put it forward is that
there had been, without any question, a consensus for it. I appreciate
that there are different views now, but there was a consensus,
including when the 2000 Act was considered, and we had experience of it
working. In a more perfect world, you would be right. However, unless
we abandon the approach that all political parties have adopted for a
long time, certainly post war&#151;which is that while we have fairly
spirited arguments about the party funding regime, ultimately it is not
used as a partisan tool against other parties&#151;we must proceed by
agreement. I do not see any
alternative.</div><a name="08110469000070"></a>

o&#146;clock today, so it is better to ask him. He chose to interpret
his terms of reference in the way that he did, and he produced the
report.</div><a name="08110469000092"></a>

was a very clear
question.</div><a name="08110469000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> It depends on what you mean by
&#147;talks&#148;. What happened, as you will recall, was that
there was a process leading up to the interim report and then to the
final report on 15 March last year where Sir Hayden interviewed the
different parties. Following that report and its acceptance in general
terms by all three parties, there was a detailed process of all-party
talks.</div><a name="08110469000096"></a>

20</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000494"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I was at that meeting. I attended every meeting. Do
you think it relevant that the then Prime Minister made it clear that
the purpose of the talks was to examine state funding, caps on
donations and transparency? If you read the terms of reference, you
will find that they exactly match the wishes of the Prime Minister and
the Leader of the Opposition in that respect. Do you accept that there
has been a change of attitude by the Labour party towards the need for
fundamental reform, as a consequence of the change of
leader?</div><a name="08110469000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

reports. There was an interim report in October 2006. There was a final

negotiations. Tony Blair ceased to be Prime Minister on 28 June
2007.</div><a name="08110469000104"></a>

the final report, Sir Hayden discussed limits on spending. Your party

accept Sir Hayden&#146;s call for caps on spending...Sir

them&#148;.</div><a name="08110469000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have never understood what point&#151;if I may say so, Mr.

the time that Hayden published his 15 March report and
subsequently.</div>

December, after the breakdown of the talks, Nick Herbert, now the
shadow Justice Secretary,

were not present, it was clear that the difficulty in the whole area
would be affiliation fees. It would be the extent to which we could
include trade unions and a cap on donations. That was the primary task
given to Hayden Phillips subsequently. Do you agree that the talks in
fact broke down because it was clear that genuine choice of whether to
donate would not be given to affiliated members? It was likely that we
would continue with a situation in which a large proportion of
affiliated members who do not even vote for the Labour party would none
the less be forced, in practice, to continue contributing to
it.</div><a name="08110469000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.

from talking to those who were I do not accept your interpretation of

followed from that meeting&#151;that is, how Sir Hayden Phillips, a
distinguished public servant, operated. How he interpreted his terms of
reference was, with respect, rather different from how you have
interpreted them. I think that we are entitled to rely on his opinion
there. Secondly, as I have already spelt out, your party welcomed Sir
Hayden&#146;s recommendations&#151;not with an aberrant
back-of-the-envelope remark to a political journalist, but with a
statement in the House, reinforced by Francis Maude outside the House.

Linton</b> (Battersea) (Lab): The Secretary of State may be
relieved to know that I am not going to ask about what is not in the
Bill, nor about the history of the talks with Sir Hayden Phillips,
which I am sure that we can come back to. I am interested in the issue
of party funding, which I have always understood to include both income
and expenditure of political parties. I regard the Political Parties
and Elections Bill as landmark legislation in the field. I support some
wider reform of donations and spending limits, but the Secretary of
State was right to go ahead with a limited Bill, which deals with the
most urgent loopholes in existing legislation, specifically those that
allow unincorporated associations to make, effectively, undisclosed
donations and candidates to spend without limit at least up until
Dissolution.</div><a name="08110469000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
questions are specific, mainly designed to draw out detailed points
from the Department. Would clause 8 really close the door on
all undeclared donations from unincorporated associations, or oblige
all donations over &#163;200 to be disclosed? I have another couple
of small points to add at this stage. I should like to know whether
clause 8 will also catch donations through British companies that are
foreign owned. It seems to me that if it does not catch them, that
could be put right in this Bill.</div>
<a name="08110469000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should also
like to know&#151;if the Chairman agrees&#151;a bit more about
clause 10 on triggering. There are a lot of questions about when it
would come into force and what will happen to people who have already
declared themselves candidates on the date this Bill receives Royal
Assent. Will they have to stop handing out leaflets, or pull down
websites that describe them as candidates? Can we have some of the
practical details of how this Bill will work? I do not know whether I
am anticipating another section of the discussion in asking
that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000502"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Proceed with the clause 8 interrogation.
Mr. Tyrie has already indicated that he wants to come on to
the triggering clause, so we can roll those together later.</div>
<a name="08110469000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> I will ask one of my excellent officials to
comment on clause 8 as well. By way of background, there is a consensus
that there has to be greater transparency; that was the whole purpose
of the 2000 Act. As far as I can see, no one is arguing on the issue of
transparency. You can argue about levels of total spending and how it
has happened but these days, subject to the minimum limit which I know
parties have concerns about, there ought to be transparency about who
is giving what. There have been concerns about some of the
unincorporated associations. The leaders of all parties have said that
they want the source to be made clear. That has been the aim of the
parliamentary draftsperson in producing the Bill.</div>
<a name="08110469000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can I say
with absolutely certainty that it will work as we intend? No, because I
am afraid that Acts are subject to interpretation and sometimes subject
to error&#151;including mine. You can get gaps&#151;as happened
unintentionally in this Act. I do not know whether Mr.
Sweeney or Mr. Smith wishes to add anything.</div>
<a name="08110469000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Sweeney:</b></i> Clause 8 is not intended to add any
additional requirements, in terms of who may or may not donate, or the
way in which they may do so. It is intended to amplify the existing
requirements in sections 54(4) and (6) of the Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Act, which deal with agency, or the
true source of a donation. The new clause requires that somebody has
consciously to consider whether, if they are giving money, those bits
of the original legislation are engaged&#151;that is to say whether
they are acting as an agent for somebody else. The precise
circumstances of whether somebody is acting as an agent will vary from
case to case.</div>
<a name="08110469000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">You asked
specifically about unincorporated association, for example. Where
somebody gives money to an unincorporated association and says,
&#147;Here you are. I would like you to give this to x party&#148;
and that is duly handed on, so that the unincorporated association acts
as an intermediary, we would expect that to be &#147;agency&#148;,
under the terms of the existing legislation. A declaration under this
clause would therefore say, &#147;I have acted as an agent.&#148;
The circumstances may not always be as clear cut as that. Somebody may
not give an explicit instruction for what they wish to be done with the
money and a court might then wish to look at contextual factors, such
as the purpose of an unincorporated association and whether the person
giving the money would have reasonably expected that anything else
would be done with it once it was handed over.</div>
<a name="08110469000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation
to your specific point about donations by companies that have foreign
ownership, the clause does nothing to change the rules in relation to
donations by those companies. I shall pause at that point. Matthew, do
you want to add to or subtract from anything I have
said?</div><a name="08110469000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Matthew
Smith:</b></i> No, just to say that on the companies point,
the Act is clear at the moment that if a company is carrying out
business in the UK and is registered here, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>it can give money regardless of ownership, but of course, that takes
effect subject to the agency provision that Mark has
outlined.</div>
<a name="08110469000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
28</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000503"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> If a foreign-owned company gives a large donation
to a political party, is that not regarded as an overseas
donation?</div><a name="08110469000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Sweeney:</b></i> Not if the company is carrying on business
within the United Kingdom, as PPERA currently
requires.</div>
<a name="08110469000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000504"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Is that not a loophole in the
legislation?</div><a name="08110469000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Sweeney:</b></i> One could take that view, but that is what
Parliament settled on in 2000, and it is not something that clause 8
seeks to address directly.</div>
<a name="08110469000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
30</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000505"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> But if we were concerned to close the loopholes in
the legislation, we should perhaps close that one as well.</div>
<a name="08110469000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Sweeney:</b></i> Certainly, this provision would not deal
with that particular type of donation, so further legislation would be
required.</div>
<a name="08110469000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Matthew
Smith:</b></i> In that sort of circumstance the question
would come down to whether the UK company was being used purely as a
vehicle through which to channel money, and if that were so, there
would then be a question about whether there was an agency
relationship. If there is an agency relationship, the Act requires that
to be declared, and our provisions will require a declaration to be
made about that.</div>
<a name="08110469000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
31</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000506"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> The company may be carrying on legitimate
business, but a foreign shareholder might phone up the chief executive
and say, &#147;Will you please make a donation of &#163;50,000 to
this party?&#148; and the chief executive would be in a poor position
to say
no.</div><a name="08110469000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Sweeney:</b></i> Subject to anything that Matthew wants to
say, without speculating on what would happen in an individual case,
the greater the degree to which somebody&#146;s wishes are being
followed through by an entity, the more there might be a case for
saying that there is agency. In the example you gave, if somebody who
wholly owns a company that carries on business in the United Kingdom
rings up the chief executive and says, &#147;I command you to give
&#163;X,000 to a political party,&#148; it might be the case that
that is agency, although it has not been tested in the courts since
2000. Is that
fair?</div><a name="08110469000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Matthew
Smith:</b></i> I would say that is
fair.</div>
<a name="08110469000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
32</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000507"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Who has to make the judgment about whether an
unincorporated association is a conduit for money to political parties
or a legitimate organisation? For instance, the East Surrey Business
Club, the Billericay Westminster dining club and the Midlands
Industrial Council just happen to have addresses that are the same as
local Conservative associations, but apart from that, nothing in their
titles specifically suggests that they are acting as conduits. However,
it is well established that they are. Who makes that decision about
whether they are conduits?</div>
<a name="08110469000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Sweeney:</b></i> Ultimately, it would be the courts. The
Electoral Commission is empowered&#151;and would have further powers
that we may come on to&#151;to investigate in individual
circumstances where there might be cause 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>to believe that an agency relationship existed and had not been
correctly declared. I am sorry to fall back on this phrase, but it
would depend on the circumstances of the case. In my earlier remarks I
suggested that where an organisation is not named in a way that
necessarily suggests it is affiliated to a particular party, it could
still be acting as an agent, but that would depend on the
circumstances.</div>
<a name="08110469000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to use one of the organisations that you mentioned, but if there was an
unincorporated association that was, for the sake of argument, just
called &#147;The Committee&#148;, and some money was given to it by
an individual, if the individual said &#147;I want you to pass this
to x political party,&#148; that would be agency. If all that the
committee did was collect donations and give them to a political party,
and that was the only thing on which it spent money, but there was no
spoken transaction or contract between it and an individual giving it
money stating that that would happen, that would potentially be agency
as well. The further that you move away from a direct instruction and
an unincorporated association having that as its sole purpose, the less
likely it is that a court will find that that is an agency
relationship.</div><a name="08110469000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Matthew
Smith:</b></i> We have to stress that at the moment the
precise confines of agency as given in the 2000 Act&#151;whether
something is
given</div><a name="08110469000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by
or on behalf
of&#148;</div><a name="08110469000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
donor, for example by an unincorporated association&#151;has yet to
be tested by the courts, so it is inherently quite
uncertain.</div><a name="08110469000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
33</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000508"></a>Martin
Linton:</b><b class="B"> </b>But they would have to make a declaration
under clause 8 of the
Bill.</div><a name="08110469000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Matthew
Smith:</b></i> Absolutely. You talk about who is responsible,
and in fact in the first instance it is for the person giving money
over to declare whether they are the donor or whether they are giving
it on behalf of someone else. The clause is designed to focus the minds
of both the person handing the money to the political party and the
recipient political party, so that they must consider whether there is
agency and so that there is a dialogue between those two individuals or
organisations about that very
point.</div><a name="08110469000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
34</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000509"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> And the declaration would have to give a list of
all donations of more than &#163;200, and who they came
from.</div><a name="08110469000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Matthew
Smith:</b></i> They would have to declare whether anyone had
given them &#163;200 with a view to the making of the eventual
donation to a political party. So if the money has been handed over on
the understanding that it will be passed on, under the new provisions
one would expect someone to make a declaration about that. The
declaration has to say whether there is an agency relationship, and if
there is not, it has to explain why
not.</div><a name="08110469000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

would it be a public

able to access it using its

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000511"></a>Martin

<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div><a name="08110469000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark

donor or the Electoral Commission to publish the
declaration.</div><a name="08110469000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Matthew
Smith:</b></i> To fill in on that point, as part of its
donation report, when the political party records the donation it has
to pass on to the Electoral Commission the fact that a declaration has
been made. That will form part of its donation report, which will
itself be a public

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
36</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000512"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> May I gently remind the Secretary of State that
there are more than three parties in the UK political process? In fact,
some of those political parties are now the Government of some nations,
and one of them is also looking to increase its number by a quarter in
the course of the next few
days.</div><a name="08110469000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been very disappointed by the way in which the Secretary of State,
and probably all the other political parties in the House, have tried
to engage the minority parties in the House. Our involvement has been
pretty woeful, and the failure to invite us to the discussions with
Hayden Phillips was a big omission. However, we will leave that aside
just now, especially given our particular role. I am sure that the
Secretary of State is eternally grateful to the Scottish National party
for highlighting the practice of people being ennobled to the House of
Lords for making donations to political parties. I am sure that he is
grateful also for the robust and thorough police investigations to
challenge whether that was
legal.</div><a name="08110469000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I ask the Secretary of State where in the Bill there is any indication
that that type of practice could be dealt with efficiently and
effectively, and will never be allowed to happen
again?</div><a name="08110469000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> I appreciate your concern and your perception
of the way that smaller parties in the Westminster Parliament have been
treated. Let me say that no offence was intended at
all.</div><a name="08110469000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that you are to hear from Sir Hayden Phillips later,
Mr. Cook, but may I say on his behalf that I am absolutely
certain that no offence was meant by him
either?</div><a name="08110469000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Wishart, you will probably find what I am about to say offensive, too,
but there is a practical problem in trying to reach agreement with a
very large number of parties. I am not thinking about the Scottish
National party in that respect, but I shall leave that point
there.</div><a name="08110469000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as allegations of favours are concerned, you will note that no
prosecutions took place notwithstanding what, as you say, was a very
thorough and proper inquiry. I hope that no false conclusions are being
drawn from that process. I have had no representations that the basic
law on the matter&#151;which goes back to the Honours (Prevention of
Abuses) Act 1925, as well as much wider law&#151;needs to be changed,
although if it does, I am happy to consider
it.</div><a name="08110469000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
37</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000513"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b><b class="B"> </b>There was a recent issue in the Scottish
Parliament when one of Mr. Straw&#146;s party colleagues
was found guilty of securing a foreign donation for part of a
leadership campaign. A number of us in Scotland believe that foreign
donations&#151;or outside donations, if we want to term them as
such&#151;should be included in the Bill to cover Scottish elections.
Surely it is right and proper that elections fought and contested in
Scotland should be contested only with Scottish money. Why should money
from London and Westminster, for example, be used to contest Scottish
elections?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="08110469000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> The proposition now is this: if I had a
relative living in Scotland, and as it happens I do, who was
married&#151;sadly, the person has now passed away&#151;to someone
as truly Scottish as you, Mr. Wishart, and they were
standing in an election, because I happen to be domiciled in England, I
would be banned from making a donation to that person&#146;s
campaign. That is an interesting idea, but it is not one that I
share.</div><a name="08110469000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
38</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000514"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> The same applies in European elections, so the
same criteria could be applied, too. It would be easy to resolve. If
you were registered to vote in Scotland, that would be the defining
rule that allowed contributions to be
made.</div><a name="08110469000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> I understand entirely. Your approach to the
future of the United Kingdom and mine&#151;indeed, that of all the
other parties represented around this table&#151;are different. We
have no such
proposals.</div><a name="08110469000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Cook, Mr. Djanogly asked me a factual question earlier, to
which I now have the answer thanks to my excellent officials. Would it
be appropriate to read it to the Committee? It is short. It gives the
number of
convictions.</div><a name="08110469000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000515"></a>The

State.</div><a name="08110469000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> It is pertinent to Mr.
Djanogly&#146;s question. The answer is that, as at 16 June 2008, 29
people had been prosecuted under the 2000 Act, resulting in
23 convictions. That was shown at paragraph 2.8 of the White
Paper. I apologise to Mr. Djanogly for not remembering that,
although it was my White
Paper.</div><a name="08110469000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
39</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000516"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The point that I wanted to make, which I think
you have made for me, Secretary of State, was that, compared with the
relevant prosecutions for electoral fraud, this is a relatively small
issue, yet electoral fraud is ignored by the Bill. You say 29, which
compares with 450 for electoral fraud.</div>
<a name="08110469000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> I do not recognise those figures, but I note
that the Electoral Commission evaluation reports on the 2007-08 local
elections show that allegations of electoral fraud are decreasing. That
is certainly my own
perception.</div><a name="08110469000172"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
42</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000524"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Thank you, Mr. Cook. Mr.
Linton asked an interesting series of questions and I would like to
look more at that area. If a company wishes to make a donation, what
must
happen?</div><a name="08110469000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Sweeney:</b></i> We must first be satisfied that the company
is complying with the law under, I think, section 54(2) of the
Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 in respect of
carrying on business in the United Kingdom. There are also procedures
under the Companies Acts, which I do not have in front of me, to do
with the degree to which a company must go through a procedure
internally to make it clear that it will make a political
donation.</div><a name="08110469000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Matthew
Smith:</b></i> A certain resolution has to be made to ensure
that the company agrees that a donation to a political party can be
made out of its
funds.</div><a name="08110469000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
43</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000525"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> How frequently would that resolution have to be
passed?</div><a name="08110469000184"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Matthew
Smith:</b></i> I do not have the provisions in front of me.
My belief is that it would have to be passed each time that a donation
was
made.</div><a name="08110469000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
44</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000526"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Or at least
annually?</div><a name="08110469000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Matthew
Smith:</b></i> At least annually. We can probably provide
some clarity on that at a later date, but certainly a resolution must
be made, and my belief is that it is each time a donation is
made.</div><a name="08110469000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
45</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000527"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Do you know what would have to be in that
resolution?</div><a name="08110469000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Matthew

provide them to the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
46</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000528"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> To be more specific, would it include an amount
that had to be
given?</div><a name="08110469000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> With apologies for interrupting, I am very
happy to ask officials, through Mr. Wills, to provide the
Committee with a note setting out exactly how this works, if that would
be of
assistance.</div><a name="08110469000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000529"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> For the counter side to that, let us look at a
trade union. If a trade union wants to give a donation, what does it
have to do in terms of voting, or having a political fund, let us
say?</div><a name="08110469000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> You will be familiar with the rules for
political funds, which are consolidated in the 1992 Act. I do not
apologise for not having that with me, but I am again happy to provide
the Committee with a detailed
note.</div><a name="08110469000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regime for the operation of political funds was tightened considerably
during the 1980s and early 1990s. The regime is now a significant one,
because it requires that every 10 years there should be a ballot of all
the members of the trade union&#151;regardless of whether they are
paying the political levy&#151;to decide whether to continue to
operate a political
fund.</div><a name="08110469000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regime is very transparent&#151;I am glad you asked the question.
There is then a decision made by individual unions whether to affiliate
to the Labour party. They either are or are not. Classically, the
general unions&#151;ones involved in the private sector&#151;have
been and remain affiliated to the Labour party; those involved in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>public sector, for obvious reasons, have not been. There is then a
process of further openness, through the certification officer. In one
or other of the official documents, which I published, there is
reference made to the fact that we checked back, in the context of the
Hayden Phillips inquiry and subsequent
talks&#151;</div><a name="08110469000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000530"></a>Mr.
Djanogly</b><b class="B"> </b>Secretary of State&#151;</div>
<a name="08110469000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> Sorry, if I may just finish this point. I know
for certain that, in the 10-year period, there were 10 complaints about
the operation of the political
levy.</div><a name="08110469000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
48</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000531"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am not asking about the certification officer,
with respect. I did not go anywhere near
that.</div><a name="08110469000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> You asked about what the checks were. Only one
of those complaints was ever found against a trade union&#151;that
was the prison officers, who are not affiliated to the Labour
party.</div><a name="08110469000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
49</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000532"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thought that the answer we had about the
information not being known was delivered as though it were not
relevant to the Committee. This is directly relevant to party funding
issues, and I am surprised at the lack of knowledge of the Committee in
relation to
it.</div><a name="08110469000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful to the Committee if information could be given as to
how often companies and unions have to vote. I think you will find that
companies have to vote annually and unions every 10 years. The form of
the resolution should be analysed in relation to both. I think you will
find that companies have to vote on who the money goes to and how much
goes, whereas unions do not have to do either. A full breakdown of the
party funding voting issues would be
relevant.</div><a name="08110469000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000533"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The purpose of this particular period is
to take evidence from witnesses, rather than to make statements about a
previous belief. I ask all hon. and right hon. Members to pose
questions, rather than to make lengthy
statements.</div><a name="08110469000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
50</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000534"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Could the Secretary of State provide that
information?</div><a name="08110469000203"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> Yes, happy to do
so.</div><a name="08110469000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
51</b><a name="08110469000535"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): It appears that the
donor declarations will not be sent to the Electoral Commission. Such
declarations do not even need to be kept for a minimum period. Does
that constitute a lack of transparency? That is what the Bill is trying
to get at, but what is the point of such donor declarations at such a
low
level?</div><a name="08110469000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> Two points. First, I am afraid that I am to
blame for this Public Bill Committee process. I long had the gleam in
my eye of setting up the process, and I chaired the Modernisation
Committee for a year and persuaded colleagues to go with it. Anyway, I
happen to think that it is a very good thing, not least because it
forces the Secretary of State to engage his brain about the detail and
the wider policy behind a Bill. Whether or not this part of the Bill
operates satisfactorily is a subject that should be examined in
Committee.</div>
<a name="08110469000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
seeking all the time to secure a balance between ensuring proper
transparency and not imposing onerous burdens on political parties.
Contrary to myth, political parties are not run by money-grabbing,
self-seeking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>people. Almost exclusively, they are run by volunteers who do it because
they believe in their cause and are willing to go out on wet Wednesdays
nights and so on. I feel that passionately, but sometimes, informed as
well as ill-informed reporting about how parties operate can give the
wrong
impression.</div><a name="08110469000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that I have spoken formally to the House about the limit, and I
will speak about it now. We are happy to look at raising clause 8
limits, perhaps bringing them into line with other appropriate limits.
That can be discussed outside the Committee as well as inside. A Bill
is just that&#151;it is open to improvement. The original limit was
set too low, and we have listened to representations about
that.</div>
<a name="08110469000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
52</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000536"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am grateful for that. Last year, the Prime
Minister promised a liberty test for all new powers of entry. Why does
no liberty test accompany new powers of entry for the Electoral
Commission? Should we not be more careful about giving the Electoral
Commission powers to go into people&#146;s private
homes?</div><a name="08110469000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> The Prime Minister not only said that there
would be a liberty test, but such a test is inherent in all these
proposals. Those powers of entry can be exercised only when the
Electoral Commission has a reasonable belief that an offence has been
committed and has obtained a warrant from a justice of the peace. It is
not its decision, but that of a justice of the
peace.</div><a name="08110469000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the concerns raised about the precise operation of the
clauses. I have heard representations on that subject from all parties,
as it came up on Second Reading. I am actively looking at whether we
can tighten the test further&#151;it is already tight&#151;and
raise the judicial level at which warrants are issued from magistrate
to judge. Mr. Wills hopes to come back to the Committee on
that.</div><a name="08110469000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000537"></a>The

intend to switch the discussion to triggering. Mr. Tyrie and

what you have just said, I was intending to switch to triggering
now.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000540"></a>Mrs.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000541"></a>The

dreaming.</div><a name="08110469000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
53</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000542"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Secretary of State, may I take you back to your
opening remarks at the beginning of the Committee when you said that
one of the main purposes of the Bill was to increase confidence in the
electoral system? Without putting the question, I am sure that you will
agree that uncertainty reduces confidence in the system and that
uncertain law is bad law.</div>
<a name="08110469000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to my
concern about this area of the Bill, which we colloquially refer to as
&#147;triggering&#148;&#151;but I think that all members of the
Committee understand what we mean by triggering&#151;do you accept,
Secretary of State, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>that the Bill will have a retrospective effect? How can you justify the
retrospective nature of the Bill, when there are people who are now
acting perfectly legally and within the law, in preparing for when an
election&#151;general or otherwise&#151;may occur, who, when the
Bill becomes law, if it becomes law in the form in which it is put
before us today, will find that they have been acting illegally? The
retrospective nature of the Bill makes it unfair, does it
not?</div><a name="08110469000218"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> It is not my purpose that it should operate
retrospectively. I appreciate that I raised the possibility that it
might operate in the same way that some tax provisions sometimes do,
from earlier dates than is normal with legislation&#151;not in a
retrospective way; but again, that point was raised in the House, and
we have received other representations about it.</div>
<a name="08110469000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">You are
correct that currently, under the commencement provision in clause 19,
the provisions are planned to come into force on the day when the Bill
receives Royal Assent, not retrospectively&#151;clause 10(5), as you
will recall, is specifically to avoid that. Even if the clause as
drafted and clause 19 were passed without any amendment, subsection (5)
of clause 10
states:</div><a name="08110469000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
amendments made by this section do not apply to any expenses incurred
before the commencement of this
section.&#148;</div><a name="08110469000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is certainly not the case, and it was never the intention, that if a
political party is lawfully printing leaflets in support of a candidate
at the moment&#151;even though they are dished out
afterwards&#151;the provisions would catch that. It would obviously,
I accept, be unfair. Clause 10(5) makes that clear.</div>
<a name="08110469000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
have also said that we are open to argument about whether commencement
should take place on Royal Assent or later. Just to anticipate a point,
if I may, Mr. Cook, I acknowledged, I think, on Second
Reading, that the Electoral Commission said that it would need to take
time to seek guidance once it had seen the legislation. I am certainly
willing to consider
that.</div><a name="08110469000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
54</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000543"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> This might be a ray of light. Are you saying,
Secretary of State, that it is not your intention that the Bill should
have retrospective effect, and that therefore if it transpires during
the deliberations of the Committee and later in the consideration of
the Bill that it will have a significant retrospective effect, the
Government will accept amendments to stop that retrospective
effect?</div><a name="08110469000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000544"></a>Mr.
Straw:</b> Yes. I do not accept that it is retrospective at
the moment, but I also want to say that it is a general principle of
legislation that it should not have retrospective effect, save in very
specific circumstances. The principal one is where a wrong has been
done to an individual, and you want to right it. Whatever benefits the
Bill has, that is not one of
them.</div><a name="08110469000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
55</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000545"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Indeed. Thank you very much, Secretary of State.
That was very helpful. Can I take you further on the question of
clarity&#151;about the triggering rules? Again, I am concerned that
if the Bill becomes law it should be clear. None of us wants another
Fiona Jones case, with its ultimately tragic consequences.</div>
<a name="08110469000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clarity in
election matters is extremely important. At present, the triggering
rules, as we refer to them, are not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>clear. What is the event that will trigger the spending of election
expenses? Is it not the case that the triggering rules are designed, at
present, to make it more difficult for a candidate to campaign
effectively, thus benefiting the sitting MP? In my constituency, which
the Secretary of State knows to be a place of wonderful political
activity, as the sitting MP, I can spend &#163;10,000 of
taxpayers&#146; money, not on campaigning&#151;certainly never
campaigning on party matters&#151;but on communicating with the
electorate in my constituency. Meanwhile, the Labour candidate who
might stand against me at the next general election will be prevented
from spending money that he might have raised himself, as a result of
the Bill.</div>
<a name="08110469000226"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> Where I agree with you is on the quality of
your constituency. To let the Committee into a secret, I was born and
brought up in Mrs. Laing&#146;s constituency and my mother
was a Labour councillor for quite a period, into her late 70s, and she
still lives there.</div>
<a name="08110469000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
specifics, I should first explain that I made the decision in the light
of discussions that have taken place, using my judgment and not Hayden
Phillips&#146; judgment, but also having considered what he said on
page 15, which I have already quoted. Also, given what everybody
accepts, that there was an unintended gap in the law because everybody
thought that triggering would continue under the 1983 regime and it did
not, I thought that we ought to reintroduce it. I thought that there
would be a broad consensus for that, not least because Lord Mackay of
Ardbrecknish&#151;not Lord Mackay of Clashfern, who was Lord
Chancellor, but the late Lord Mackay who was leading on the Bill in the
House of Lords&#151;moved amendments to make it clear that the 1983
regime would continue. I regret that Ministers were reassured that that
was unnecessary, but there we are. I have never suggested that the
trigger arrangements are perfect, but they did act as a
dampener.</div>
<a name="08110469000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">With respect,
I do not accept that with the communications allowance somehow
incumbent MPs will be advantaged over those who are candidates. Again,
I draw attention to what the then Lord Chief Justice, now Lord Bingham,
said in the Fiona Jones Court of Appeal judgment. He drew a
distinction, which is there under the 1983 Act and will still be
broadly there under the revised
definition:</div><a name="08110469000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Election
expenses are not incurred where a constituency party carries on its
ordinary political activity otherwise than with reference to a specific
election which is reasonably imminent, even though such activity has
the ultimate aim of winning public support and gaining or retaining
power in the constituency; nor are they incurred by a candidate who
nurses the constituency. An election expense means expenses incurred,
by or on behalf of a particular
candidate&#148;</div><a name="08110469000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
respect of the conduct or management of the election, which has now
been widened slightly to the purposes of the election. That distinction
will have to remain in the law for as long as we do not arrive at an
arrangement&#151;which Mr. Howarth raised with me, but for
which there is currently no consensus&#151;where all spending by
political parties at all times is subject to an overall limit, whether
national or local.</div>
<a name="08110469000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Electoral
Commission made recommendations for trying to fill what is accepted on
all sides as an unintended gap in the law. As we control campaign
spending for 12 months before a general election, it was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>expected that candidate spending would be controlled, not least by the
continuation of the trigger, which is not there. The Electoral
Commission said that the way to fill the gap is to have a four-month
period before an election where the candidate spending is controlled.
We put that forward in what became the Electoral Administration Act
2006, but it did not find favour.</div>
<a name="08110469000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
agreement about the objective here. I do not say that this triggering
proposal is perfect. If there were better ways of doing it and if, for
example, we could find a way of improving what went into the 2006 Bill
and was then dropped, let us look at it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
56</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000546"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> The Secretary of State has, I think, just proved my
point, which is that there is a lack clarity in this Bill. I thank him
for that long and difficult answer. I appreciate that his intentions
are good in the restoration of triggering, but, just by the very nature
of his answer, it has become even more obvious that this part of this
Bill is not clear. If we have an unclear law, we will end up with
election results that are challengeable. Election results that are
challengeable means that the validity of a future Government could be
challengeable, and the very basis of our whole democratic process is
weakened rather than strengthened.</div>
<a name="08110469000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">All that I am
asking here is that the triggering mechanism should be more clear than
it is at present. Our interpretation of the Bill is different from that
of the Secretary of State and that proves the point, which is that
lawyers on both sides have a different interpretation of this. It must
be clear so that the election result will be clear.</div>
<a name="08110469000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it not
possible that there might be a candidate at this very moment, raising
and spending money? It might be the Secretary of State&#146;s mother
raising money for the Labour candidate in my constituency, I hope so
because we want to make sure that the Liberals do not do too
well.</div><a name="08110469000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000547"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Please keep within the scope of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08110469000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
57</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000548"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I was merely showing a great respect for the
Secretary of State&#146;s mother, who is a fine campaigner in my
constituency. My real point is that, at this very moment, there might
be candidates out there raising and spending money. It might be that,
when this Bill comes into effect, they then find that they have spent
up to the limit that will be imposed upon them. Therefore, a candidate
could be in the position, after the Bill comes into force, of not being
able to spend another pound on electoral matters and an electoral
campaign. That would be particularly unfair, since there are far more
Conservative, Liberal, Scottish nationalist and other candidates out
there than there are Labour candidates, by the very nature of the
Government&#146;s majority.</div>
<a name="08110469000237"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> First, it is your interpretation of what I
said, and not my view that this is not clear. Secondly, the law on what
is, or what is not, an expense for the purpose of the 1983 Act, is now
more explicit than it was by what was put into that Act by the 2006
Act, on an all-party basis. That is in clause 11, which amends
paragraph 14 of schedule 4A to the 1983 Act and which lists election
expenses in a way that they were not listed before. That is helpful for
people in all parties who have to determine what an election expense
is.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div><a name="08110469000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">My other
point, which I am happy to have confirmed to you by Mr.
Sweeney or Mr. Smith, is that it is not my, or the
Government&#146;s, purpose to make this provision retrospective. It
is improper to have retrospective legislation, except in the
circumstances that I have described. Clause 10(5) could not be more
explicit,
stating:</div><a name="08110469000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
amendments made by this section do not apply to expenses incurred
before the commencement of this
section.&#148;</div><a name="08110469000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
58</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000549"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> But with respect, Secretary of State, if the
commencement of the section were, let us say, more than four months
before a general election, which of course is difficult to predict
because no one knows when a general election is going to be&#151;you
might, but not the rest of us&#151;there would still not be
certainty. Are you suggesting that you will take steps to ensure that
that part of the Bill does not come into effect until, let us say, a
year or more from
now?</div><a name="08110469000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> I am certainly not proposing that, but as I
say, I am happy to consider representations. I have already made it
clear, as has Mr. Wills, that the commencement of the clause
should not automatically be on Royal Assent but should be by order. I
have said that, and I think that I said it to the Justice Committee in
answer to Mr. Tyrie. I now recall that it was not on Second
Reading. Anyway, it is on the record. The Electoral Commission made
representations about the need for
guidance.</div><a name="08110469000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of uncertainty, Mrs. Laing, we do not have
fixed-term Parliaments&#151;some think that we should, others think
that we should not. We have managed to find a way around that problem,
which I think has worked reasonably satisfactorily, in the regime for
the control of campaign spending, which is from 365 days before a
general election&#151;we simply work backwards.</div>
<a name="08110469000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
trigger, I first stood in a general election in 1974. I cannot remember
how many I have stood in, but apart from the October 1974 election, I
have stood in every election since February 1974&#151;quite a lot of
elections.</div><a name="08110469000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000550"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Tonbridge and
Malling.</div><a name="08110469000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> Tonbridge and Malling. I did not
win.</div><a name="08110469000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been a candidate, as opposed to a Member of Parliament, on two
occasions. The trigger had a dampening effect on expenditure. It did
not wholly prevent spending, not least for the reason set out by Lord
Bingham. I believe that with guidance from the Electoral Commission the
trigger, which after all is now clearer than it was under the unamended
1983 legislation, will work. I also say, through you, Mr.
Cook, that if there are proposals for other ways of arriving at the
same end that are seen as better, we are open to discussion about
them.</div><a name="08110469000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
59</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000551"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> May I ask you finally, Secretary of State, whether
you will therefore undertake to ensure that the Electoral Commission is
able to publish its guidance and have it examined before that clause
comes into
law?</div><a name="08110469000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> We are trying to align the two. I cannot give
an absolute undertaking on that until I know how long the Electoral
Commission will take to do that, but I appreciate that if I were to
bring the clause into effect before the commission had a chance to
issue its guidance, I would come under some criticism, to put it at its
lowest.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div><a name="08110469000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
60</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000552"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Surely it could not be clearer. The Bill is
intended to reinstate the legislation passed by the Conservative
Government in 1983 in exactly the form that it was in then. Indeed,
that applies also to the rules on MPs&#146; expenditure that were in
force in 1983. The situation was exactly the same, and the Bill is
reversing an accidental loophole to take us back to the situation that
the Conservative Government passed in 1983.</div>
<a name="08110469000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is only
one area that is possibly unclear, and on which I seek the Secretary of
State&#146;s explicit guidance. Presumably, when the clause comes
into force, those candidates who already have websites up describing
themselves as a candidate, or who have leaflets or business cards
stacked in their stationery cupboard describing themselves as a
candidate, will have to amend them. It does not guarantee that any
money spent before the date it comes into force can
stand.</div><a name="08110469000250"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> I am open to correction by officials, but I
think&#151;I may disappoint you on this&#151;clause 10(5) means
what it says. If a political party has spent money on business cards or
setting up a website before this clause comes into force, the
amendments made by this clause do not apply to that
expenditure.</div><a name="08110469000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
61</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000553"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Then they can publish
50,000?</div><a name="08110469000252"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> All these things are possible, but the other
side of this is that if we were to do what I know you would wish in
relation to expenditure incurred before the date of Royal Assent, we
would be open to equal opposite complaints of acting
unfairly&#151;that is the difficulty&#151;and, certainly so far as
expenditure was incurred before Royal Assent, of acting
retrospectively. I have already, if I may say so, dealt with
that.</div><a name="08110469000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an inherent difficulty in seeking to change the electoral regime
during a Parliament, because it is bound to be the case&#151;we are
trying to find a way through this&#151;that political parties,
whatever the loopholes, will have worked within the current legal
regime perfectly lawfully and they will have grounds for complaint if
they say, &#147;Well, hang on. We were working within this. You may
disapprove of it; it may be a loophole, but we were working lawfully
and then it suddenly changed.&#148; There has to be a process of
getting from A to B, which is what I am trying to
do.</div><a name="08110469000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
62</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000554"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> But surely candidates will have ample forewarning
that the law is going to change. Whenever the Act comes into force on
Royal Assent, that will still be several months away, at the very
least, so they must be aware of the fact that the law is being returned
to what it always had been before. A loophole is being closed. They
have been told. People know that is going to happen. Surely it is
reasonable to expect people not to print extra leaflets when they know
that the law is about to
change.</div><a name="08110469000255"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> With respect, I think I have answered that.
May I just say this for the avoidance of doubt? Mr. Linton
is absolutely right that in broad substance what we are doing is to
reintroduce the 1983 Act, whose provenance goes back to the 1883
legislation. There are two differences. They are not particularly
significant. One is that the original provision in the 1983 Act said
that election expenses were defined as meaning expenses incurred,
whether before, during or after the election,</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div><a name="08110469000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on account of or
in respect of the conduct or management of the
election&#148;.</div><a name="08110469000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was changed by the 2000 Act to a reference to the purposes of the
election.</div><a name="08110469000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second change, to which I drew Mrs. Laing&#146;s
attention, is in the 2006 Act, on page 30. There is clarification of
detail about what constitutes election expenses, which was not there
before. I think that was agreed on an all-party basis. I am not
absolutely certain about that. That is new schedule 4A to the 1983
Act.</div><a name="08110469000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000555"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We must finish this part of the sitting by 12
noon. There can be no argument about that. I do not want to have to
interrupt witnesses or Committee members, but four Committee members
are seeking to catch my eye. They are, in order of registration, Tyrie,
Howarth, Djanogly and Reid, so please make your questions brief, and
the answers, too, Secretary of
State.</div><a name="08110469000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
63</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000556"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Thank you, Mr. Cook. First, thank you
very much, Secretary of State, for the flexibility that you have been
showing on making adjustments to the triggering clauses. I have two
quick questions. Why was this not subject to
consultation?</div><a name="08110469000260"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> It was and it wasn&#146;t is the answer. We
had the Hayden Phillips report and the inquiries. I then published the
White Paper in June. The Bill was published on 17 July. We then allowed
a period of getting on for three months before Second
Reading.</div><a name="08110469000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000557"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I will take, &#147;It was and it
wasn&#146;t&#148;.</div><a name="08110469000262"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> There was no formal consultation, but I
invited comments on
it.</div><a name="08110469000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
64</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000558"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I want quickly to get on to one other question. You
have made it clear that the MPs&#146; communications allowance will
not be covered by the triggering rules because it is not held to be
party political. If an MP was found guilty by the Standards and
Privileges Committee of abusing the communications allowance, under the
Bill would they be deemed to have triggered their own campaign
expenses?</div><a name="08110469000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> That is a very good question.</div>
<a name="08110469000265"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mark
Sweeney:</b></i> The answer is potentially yes, but we shall
have to reflect and give you a more detailed answer, if that is all
right.</div><a name="08110469000266"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> I thought that yes was the answer. That was my
instinct.</div><a name="08110469000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000559"></a>Mr.

answer.</div><a name="08110469000268"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> I said that I would have thought that it was
yes, but we will come back to
it.</div><a name="08110469000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
65</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000560"></a>David
Howarth:</b> May I come back to the retrospectivity question
and put an example to the Secretary of State? It has been bothering me,
and possibly other people. The issue is not what counts as an expense,
but who counts as a candidate, and when. This cannot be cured by the
commencement date. I shall give the example. Let us suppose that either
an existing Member of Parliament or a candidate from another party has
already acted as a candidate. What happens when the Bill comes into
force? Will it mean at that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>point that what the person did previously makes them a candidate at that
point, so any expenses that they incur from then count as election
expenses? It is about not whether expenses before that time count, but
whether they have started the ball rolling. That degree of
retrospectivity ought to be ruled
out.</div><a name="08110469000270"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> The definition under the 2000 Act, which we
are not proposing to change, relates to activities that are for the
purpose of any election. It will be subject to further guidance. If the
activities are related to the purpose of any election and
self-evidently&#151;</div><a name="08110469000271"></a>

past?</div><a name="08110469000272"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Straw:</b></i> Hang on a second. For the future. In respect
of the past, if the expenses were incurred before the commencement,
they would not be
covered.</div><a name="08110469000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us take another example. A candidate for the XYZ party decides to
produce loads of flyers saying what a great person he is, and a
newspaper that is not dated goes round the constituency giving further
and better particulars of what a great person he is. If the expenses of
printing and preparing the material were incurred before the
commencement date, even if they were dished out afterwards, they would
not be covered. However, if the material was dished out after the
election date, the expenses incurred to dish them out would be
covered.</div>

Straw:</b></i> The content is a different matter. It depends
on a proper reading of the term &#147;for the purposes of the
election&#148;. In my example, it is likely that such expenditure
would be regarded as for the purposes of the election. On the other
hand, if the material is simply saying that F. Bloggs who lives down
the street has done something about the bus service, it might not be so
regarded. That is a matter of
fact.</div><a name="08110469000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is inherent in any system that is not all-encompassing that there has
to be a distinction made as Lord Bingham made it. It is just there. The
judgments were not that difficult to make in the end, when the 1983 Act
was in force. It goes back to 1883. With the additional schedule, which
is in here, and the greater clarity provided by the phrase &#147;for
the purposes&#148;, it should be all
right.</div><a name="08110469000277"></a>

us in our deliberations. You have seen the pattern that we are

Tyrie.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div><a name="08110469000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
68</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000567"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> The questions that I want to ask mainly concern the
future, but before that, I wanted to ask one historical question of Sir
Hayden. We have an accumulated literature on the matter as the result
of the work that you and I did through your committee. Would you have
any difficulty with publishing any of the papers or minutes summarising
meetings from those
talks?</div><a name="08110469000282"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i> I do not personally have any problem
releasing the papers that we prepared for the meetings of the three
parties. My only concern, if you will excuse me for not answering with
a simple yes or no, is that I need to look carefully at the
minutes.</div><a name="08110469000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
you know, we had very wide-ranging discussions, and all sorts of things
came up. We all agreed to keep our confidences in the nature of the
conversations that we had and the results that would be published. I
would like to think about it. However, if the three parties, having
checked the minutes themselves, were satisfied that they could be
published as well, I do not think that I would want to stand in the
way.</div><a name="08110469000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
69</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000568"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Just to be clear, you would be happy for both the
minutes and the main papers put before the committee to be put in the
public domain, provided that all three participating parties
agreed?</div><a name="08110469000285"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i> Yes, I think I would. That is the
right way to proceed. I do not think that it is a judgment that I
should simply make on my own in my cell, as it were. I would make it in
consultation with those
involved.</div><a name="08110469000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
70</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000569"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Our party&#146;s view on publication is well
known. Turning to affiliation fees, I have only one more question,
which will give Sir Christopher a moment or two to think about it. Do
you think that it will be possible to find an agreement for a new
long-term structure for party funding and control of donations that
does not provide each individual affiliated member genuine choice on an
annual basis over whether to
donate?</div><a name="08110469000287"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i> Perhaps I may answer that in two
ways. The first concerns the proposals that I put before the parties
just a year ago. It is a happy, or perhaps unhappy, anniversary that we
are celebrating here: the fact that we did not come to an agreement. I
think my proposals went as far, at that stage, as I believed the Labour
party could manage in ensuring on affiliation fees that the precise
amount that was paid in was the precise amount that came out, that it
was not mediated by the trade union leadership in any way, and that
there was a clear and regular opportunity to opt
out.</div><a name="08110469000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is where we got to, and it is very much a matter for the Labour party
and the trade unions to say whether they see a prospect down the line
of adopting what I know has been the Conservative party&#146;s
preferred position of individual affiliated members being given a
choice of what to do, and that they should be able to donate to parties
other than the Labour
party.</div><a name="08110469000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other way of answering the question is to say that I do not think
things will necessarily remain absolutely as they are now, because I
believe, as you know, that a comprehensive agreement on party funding
is essential. If we do not have it, there will be problems all the way
along the line, and every single year something will come up and cause
a row. That is not healthy.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div><a name="08110469000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Canada, to
answer your question elliptically, the relationship between the New
Democratic party and the trade unions was similar to the one we have
had here. It made the sort of change that you have suggested, and it is
fair to say that both the political party concerned and the trade
unions have found that system perfectly satisfactory. The world did not
fall apart, and people thought the system was clearer and, if I might
put it this way, cleaner. If experience from abroad can apply here,
that is the example that I have in
mind.</div><a name="08110469000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
71</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000570"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> To be clear, what exactly did that Canadian reform
consist of with respect to donations by individual trade
unionists?</div>
<a name="08110469000292"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i> If my memory serves me right, it
gave people the opportunity to donate their fee through their trade
union to the party of their
choice.</div><a name="08110469000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
72</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000571"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Thank you. Sir Christopher, may I ask you the same
question?</div><a name="08110469000294"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Christopher Kelly:</b></i> I am not sure what my answer to
that question will be worth, as I have not sat through the detailed
discussions that you and Sir Hayden Phillips have sat through, but I
shall say two things. First, I very much agree with what Sir Hayden
said, which is that some form of agreement between the parties is a
very important objective. Secondly, it is clear that some form of
compromise on all sides is probably necessary. Quite what the details
of that compromise are, and whether it is possible to obtain agreement
only on the basis that you put forward, I frankly do not
know.</div><a name="08110469000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
73</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000572"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Do you think that in the long term it is
sustainable for standards and confidence in the way that parties are
funded, given your job as chairman of the Committee on Standards in
Public Life, that one party should be subject to a cap with no
exceptions, but another should retain a privileged collection mechanism
with a unique relationship with a mass pressure group, however august
it may be and however much built into our legislative
process?</div><a name="08110469000296"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Christopher Kelly:</b></i> I think that what is important for
confidence in the standards that are applied is that all the parties
reach agreement on what is an acceptable way of financing political
parties.</div><a name="08110469000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
74</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000573"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> But will any agreement
do?</div><a name="08110469000298"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Christopher Kelly:</b></i> Not any agreement, but on this
issue, on which so much discussion has taken place, we are not talking
about any agreement. We are talking about reaching compromises on
issues that go back into the history and constitution of political
parties, and clearly raise many difficult issues for
everyone.</div>
<a name="08110469000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
75</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000574"></a>David
Howarth:</b> May I ask Sir Hayden to comment on the Bill and
its contents, compared with his proposed agreement? Is it true that the
Bill is a very long way from where the talks that you were brokering
had
reached?</div><a name="08110469000300"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i> It is very much narrower than the
set of proposals that I published, with the agreement of the parties,
at the end of October last year, which covered a whole range of the
issues that arise in relation to party funding. On the other hand, the
Secretary of State and the White Paper made it perfectly clear that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>what he wanted to do, which is what I wanted to do and tried to achieve,
was to find an agreement between the parties on all those
issues.</div><a name="08110469000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the absence of that consensus, the judgment was that it was not wise or
sensible to proceed with something much more comprehensive. It seemed
to me wholly reasonable for the Government to say, &#147;Look, one
area where we know we can and ought to make an advance is in reforms to
the Electoral Commission.&#148; That is the central thread of the
Bill. Personally, I think that that is worth
doing.</div><a name="08110469000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
76</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000575"></a>David
Howarth:</b> To come back to your proposed agreement, to what
extent at the time did you think that you had a consensus, particularly
on the issue of expenditure caps? What place did you think that the
expenditure cap had in the overall
package?</div><a name="08110469000303"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i> The point about expenditure in this
was to make sure that there was an overall package. The focus obviously
began with the issue of donations: I observe from reading the
newspapers as a private citizen that issues around big donations
continue to vex people, and I fear that they will go on doing so until
a change is made. To try to get that balance between those who thought
it was more important to control spending and those who thought it was
more important to control donations, it seemed to me natural common
sense to try to persuade the parties to cover the whole waterfront,
which they agreed to
do.</div><a name="08110469000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that we made good progress, although others will have their own
views about that. Over a year and a bit, we went quite a long
way&#151;as did the Select Committee&#151;in agreeing the
principles on which an agreement might be made, but I always made it
clear to those I was talking to, and we had all agreed it, that nothing
was agreed until everything was agreed. That was the basis on which we
did it. Otherwise, it could fall apart at any time when we got down to
the detail in a whole range of areas. We did not come on to negotiating
the detail of some areas, such as spending limits, although in
principle people were in favour of greater and more comprehensive
control.</div><a name="08110469000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
precise proposals were not agreed. Equally true, the arrangements in
relation to donations and affiliation fees, to which Mr.
Tyrie referred, were not agreed. Nor had we agreed my precise proposals
for additional public expenditure, partly to make up the losses that
would otherwise be incurred from donations caps and partly&#151;I
thought in a reasonable way in the modern world&#151;to engage the
public more directly in a sense of ownership of party politics. That is
a long and rather rambling answer, I am
afraid.</div><a name="08110469000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
77</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000576"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I suppose the question arising out of it is
whether in your view the talks broke down because of the failure to
agree on those details, in the light of the agreement on the
principles, or was there any reversal on the principles themselves by
any of the parties taking
part?</div><a name="08110469000307"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i> No, I do not think so. If I look
back to my report&#151;I published it in March 2007&#151;I was very
careful to ensure that the words I used, where I said that we had
reached agreement on the principles, were indeed ones that were
acceptable to the three parties. I think that Andrew would confirm that
that was the case.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div><a name="08110469000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">No, I do not
think that people went back on the principles we had agreed.
Translating them into precise reality was the problem. In relation to
affiliation fees, I had always been conscious of the Conservative
party&#146;s preferred position, so it was not a surprise&#151;it
may have been a slight disappointment&#151;that I could not shove the
Conservatives a bit further towards the proposals, but that is a
different
issue.</div><a name="08110469000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
78</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000577"></a>David
Howarth:</b> A final detail point. On expenditure caps, you
will recall that the methodology you followed was heavily criticised by
Mr. Pinto-Duschinsky. Do you have any response to what he
said? He will be appearing as a witness later in the
week.</div><a name="08110469000310"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i> I did not really enter into that
argument, nor do I think it valuable or
interesting.</div><a name="08110469000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that there was a general feeling on the part of all parties that
if we could try to dampen down the amount of money spent, it would
probably be a pretty good thing, without going into the question
whether there was an arms race or not, what the statistics said or
anything
else.</div><a name="08110469000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
put a personal view about the bill poster expenditure that goes on, if
I talk to individual Members of Parliament from all parties, they will
mostly say to me with great frankness that it is a waste of time. If
you know that as a matter of common sense, you try to do something
about it. That is what I was
doing.</div><a name="08110469000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
79</b><a name="08110469000578"></a><b class="B">Nick
Ainger</b> (Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire) (Lab):
Sir Hayden, you will be well aware that it is not only funding that is
important to political parties; it is also membership and volunteers,
because at the end of the day, they are the people who go out and do
the work. On Second Reading, a number of Members raised the issue of
the new powers that would be given to the Electoral Commission,
particularly those involving entering people&#146;s homes to seek
information about alleged breaches of the regulation. What effect, if
any, do you think that that will have on the cohorts of volunteers on
which all political parties
depend?</div><a name="08110469000314"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i> That is something that I was very
conscious of in the work that I did with the parties. I was always very
conscious that we had to try to have a proportionate regulatory system,
and that not every single volunteer was a forensic
accountant.</div><a name="08110469000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue here, as I understand it, is that the existing powers of the
Electoral Commission under the present law are pretty extreme and
robust. What the Bill has done is reveal that underlying reality,
rather than fundamentally changing the position. My personal view is
that the Committee will want to ensure if those powers are to be
implemented that the safeguards are real, so that we do not find that
people who are not experts in the field but are good volunteers are
being harried and pursued unreasonably. That is a general position of
mine, not a specific issue. It is very much up to the Committee to try
to find the sorts of amendment that will make everyone feel comfortable
that the powers are not excessive.</div>
<a name="08110469000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
80</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000579"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> What safeguards would you recommend to the
Committee, bearing in mind your support for the contentions that we
must keep that great cohort of volunteers enthusiastic and not make
them increasingly concerned that they may face criminal
charges?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div><a name="08110469000317"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i> There are two key elements. I do not
pretend to be an expert on the detail of this; I have not gone into it
to the extent that you have done. I think that one would need to be
satisfied that the Electoral Commission intended to operate in a way
that would be fair and be seen to be fair. That is an area in which it
is given powers to issue guidance. I think that we should ask the
Electoral Commission to set out guidance about the way that it intends
to operate in that area.</div>
<a name="08110469000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
thing that I would want to assure myself of is that the process through
which the authorities had to go in order to get to that point was
sufficiently well policed by an independent judicial or other mechanism
that that pathway was clear and had to be carefully trodden. But if you
want, I will go away and think further about it, and if the Chairman
wants me to and I have any thoughts, I will let the Committee have
them, but I would need to look at it in much more detail than I have so
far to answer your question
fully.</div><a name="08110469000319"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
81</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000580"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> Thank you. I believe that draft guidance should be
presented to Public Bill Committees so that it can be examined during
the scrutiny process. Do you agree that in both this area and the area
covering the triggering mechanism, draft guidance should be produced by
the Electoral Commission as quickly as possible so that this Committee
can look at
it?</div><a name="08110469000320"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i> I heard what the Secretary of State
said earlier. It depends how long the Electoral Commission takes. In
this sort of area, how and when something is done&#151;talking about
triggering, for example&#151;is very important. Having looked at it,
I think that although one is, in a sense, going back to a previous
regime, no one should assume that because that is the case, all these
people out here who might be potential candidates will understand what
that means. It is important that Electoral Commission guidance on how
that would work in relation to triggering is available as soon as
possible. Whether that can be done during the course of your
deliberations is another question. The relevant people are appearing
before you, so you can ask them directly. I think it is very important
that that guidance is in place and has been consulted on well before
provisions are brought into
effect.</div><a name="08110469000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
82</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000581"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> I am sure that you, Sir Hayden, will agree fully
that public confidence about party political donations has been shaken
to its core in the past couple of years by what have been seen as
abuses. The cash for honours matter, for example, has raised public
concern about how public money is spent. Do you believe that the Bill
addresses the big public concern about party political
donations?</div><a name="08110469000322"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i> I think that the Bill addresses two
issues that ought to be of concern to the public, the first of which is
the need for a more vigorous regulator with more flexible powers. That
is important in any circumstance. The second is that if we can find a
mechanism for dampening down expenditure that is better&#151;or,
rather, longer&#151;than the current one, that is worth having. I do
not think that the Government have suggested or pretended that the Bill
goes to the heart of the anxieties that you and I have expressed, which
are the basis of the work that I did for that period. That can be done
only if there is a comprehensive new mechanism for controlling party
funding in this country.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div><a name="08110469000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
83</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000582"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> Part of that new mechanism could be suggested in
the Bill. There is a proposal that four commissioners from the
political parties should be added to the Electoral Commission. There is
a difficulty with deciding who should be the fourth commissioner, who
is supposed to come from the smaller parties. I have not got a clue how
that could be decided, and I used to be a joint Whip for all the
minority parties in the House. Do you believe that having political
party representatives on the Electoral Commission would be a good thing
and would help to deal with outstanding issues about which the public
are
concerned?</div><a name="08110469000324"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i> Yes, I do. I must be consistent. I
was a party to making recommendations, and I agree with that proposal.
I think that it is important, and I do not agree that if you want to
have party representatives or senior party figures involved that will
somehow make the Electoral Commission a non-independent or partisan
body. That is way over the top. A regulator has to have the confidence
of those whom it regulates. It is not just a question of public
confidence; it is also a question of party political confidence. The
successful regulators in this country always have the confidence of
those whom they regulate and have an open dialogue with them. I think
that this will help the Electoral Commission, and will help political
parties to feel more comfortable with the Electoral Commission. Those
four people will be in a minority, and will never be a majority.
Presumably, they will have to be appointed through a mechanism, such as
the Speaker&#146;s Conference, in the same way as everybody
else.</div>
<a name="08110469000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for how
the minority party representative would be chosen, I bow to your
wisdom. I rather cavalierly felt that an agreement could be reached.
Men and women of good will could sit down and hammer out an agreement
on how that could be done. I think that that is what will
happen.</div><a name="08110469000326"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
88</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000589"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Sir Hayden, I am reluctant to raise issues that
are not in the Bill yet, but since they have been raised, I will seek
clarification on a couple of points. First, I understand that the terms
of reference of your committee include the word
&#147;funding&#148;. I have been interested in party funding for a
long time and I understand that it includes both income and expenditure
of political parties. It has been put to us by the other side that you
were asked to look at only income and not at expenditure. Is that how
you understood your terms of
reference?</div><a name="08110469000338"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i> Well, no, because I proceeded
differently. I agree with the broad interpretation that you take. You
can look at the terms of reference and ask where the words
&#147;expenditure control&#148; are, and you would find that they
are not there. It seems to me that if I was being asked, with the
understanding of all the three main party leaders, to try to tackle the
subject in a comprehensive way, I would be quite wrong to avoid looking
at spending. So we behaved as though that was in the terms of
reference.</div><a name="08110469000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000590"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> I am glad that you
did.</div><a name="08110469000340"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>I think that it is a
matter of common sense, and I do not want to enter into that
debate.</div><a name="08110469000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
89</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000591"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Thank you. On another point, on trade union
affiliation, you speak as though trade unions have the opportunity to
affiliate only with one party. As a matter of historical record, there
were trade unions that were affiliated to the Conservative party.
Opposition Members may look surprised, but I spoke to the national
secretary of the National Union of Small Shopkeepers when the
legislation came into force and the union was affiliated to the
Conservative party. Therefore, is it right to expect an independent,
non-state organisation such as a trade union that has made a decision
to affiliate to a particular party also to act as the collecting agent
for another party? Given that all its members are free to contribute to
any party they wish, why should it be a trade union&#146;s obligation
to collect money for a party with which it does not
agree?</div><a name="08110469000342"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Hayden Phillips:</b></i> You have illustrated one of the
stumbling blocks in trying to create an agreed position. On the one
hand, one position says, &#147;In the modern world, this should all
be much clearer and we should not have this relationship. People should
have freedom of choice.&#148; On the other, we wanted to try to
respect the historic traditions of the different parties. I am
referring not just to the Labour party, but to the structure of the
Conservative party in which some of the proposals presented some
internal constitutional problems. Trying to get the balance right
between respecting the way in which parties have developed and grown
and what their traditions are with greater clarity and freedom of
choice got me to the position that I was in a year ago when I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>published my proposals. I did not believe that at that stage the Labour
party could go any further in making changes along the lines preferred
by the Conservative party without creating severe difficulties for
itself. I respect that&#151;it is a pity, but there we are. That is
my general answer.</div>
<a name="08110469000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
90</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000592"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Thank you. I have a quick question for Sir
Christopher. You express disappointment but not surprise about the fact
that registration is not in the Bill. You are aware that an estimated
3.5 million people in this country are not registered, and that the
experiment in individual registration in Northern Ireland led to a 10
per cent. reduction. A simple back of the envelope calculation shows
that if we had the same experience in this country, we would lose
350,000 people from the electoral register. When you say that you are
not surprised that people are opposed to individual registration, is
that what you mean?</div>
<a name="08110469000344"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Christopher Kelly:</b></i> No, it is not what I mean. My
committee made its report some time ago. I have seen the reaction to it
and we have continued to make the argument for individual registration.
We usually get that response. At the time my committee made that
recommendation, under my predecessor, it was well aware of the
situation in Northern Ireland and of what has happened since the
measure was introduced. That includes the much greater confidence that
now exists in the integrity of the electoral system there. My committee
made that report&#151;although of course I took no part in its
production&#151;but if something is fundamentally flawed, as we now
believe the electoral system in the country to be with the combination
of household registration and postal voting on demand, we should not
keep it because of concern about some other issue. One should address
that other issue directly and that is what is happening in Northern
Ireland.</div>
<a name="08110469000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
91</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000593"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Sir Christopher has just about answered the
question that I was going to put to him. It might interest our guests
to know that I have tabled a new clause to amend the Bill and introduce
individual voter registration. If the Government are persuaded by the
deliberations of Sir Christopher&#146;s committee, this Committee and
the two Houses of Parliament, it is possible that they might also
accept that individual voter registration should go ahead. Let me take
you further on this, Sir Christopher. In your committee&#146;s
deliberations&#151;I appreciate that this is before it was your
committee&#151;was a distinction made between the particular problems
that occurred in Northern Ireland, which were correctly put right by
the introduction of individual voter registration, and the completely
different situation in the rest of the United Kingdom? That different
situation would be likely to lead not to a similar reduction in those
who are registered&#151;as Mr. Linton suggested&#151;but
rather to a fairer system where those who ought to be registered are,
and those who ought not to be registered are not.</div>
<a name="08110469000346"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Christopher Kelly:</b></i> As you say, I was not there. I
believe everybody is conscious of the very different circumstances that
exist in Northern Ireland. It would be rash to assume that if such a
system was introduced here, there would not be a fall-off in
registration. There are a number of reasons for that. When the system
was introduced into Northern Ireland, the issue was not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>only about individual registration but also, as I understand, the fact
that in the past, even if someone did not reply to the annual canvass,
their name remained on the register for a further 12 months. When
individual registration was introduced, that 12 months&#146; leeway
was also abolished, and I am told that much of the fall-off in
registration may have been down to that as well. Northern Ireland also
demonstrates that if you have an energetic administrator who is charged
with the maintenance of the register and prepared to look at different
ways of maintaining it, they could begin to make use of the powers that
are available to them. In Northern Ireland, although this may not
receive universal acclaim, I believe that the administrator even
started writing to people saying, &#147;I believe you should be on
the register and if you&#146;re not, you should realise that I have
the ability to cause a fine of &#163;1,000 to be levied on
you.&#148; Clearly, that would not be a good thing all over the place
or in many circumstances, but the fact is that an energetic person is
beginning to make use of the powers available to him, presumably in a
way that is visible to people who have not put their names on the
register. I suggest that that model could be followed in England if we
had a system of electoral administration that was administered rather
more robustly than the present
one.</div><a name="08110469000347"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
92</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000594"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> That is very helpful, Sir Christopher. You
expressed no surprise that the Government have not taken the
opportunity to introduce individual voter registration in the Bill. Has
anyone on your committee come forward with a good reason why the system
should remain as it is, and why there should be one person in a
household who effectively has the power to disfranchise others in the
household?</div><a name="08110469000348"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Christopher Kelly:</b></i> The committee&#146;s report was
unanimous.</div>
<a name="08110469000349"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
93</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000595"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Sir Christopher, may I ask two brief questions? I
note that you say that, in your view, the current system is
fundamentally flawed&#151;I think that I am quoting you correctly.
Will you share with the Committee the evidential basis for that? How
many prosecutions are there and how geographically widespread are
they?</div>
<a name="08110469000350"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Christopher Kelly:</b></i> As you will recall, that
information was given earlier in the sitting. I do not think that my
belief is based so much on the number of prosecutions as on the
principle of combining household registration with postal voting on
demand without the requirement to produce personal
identifiers.</div>
<a name="08110469000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000596"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Thank you, Sir Christopher. I am quite sure that we
will come back in the process of the Bill to the particular measures
that we have taken to protect the integrity of postal votes&#151;I
will not trouble the Committee with that at this stage. May I ask a
more fundamental question that picks up on your point about principles?
Are you aware that the Government actually share your view that, in
principle, individual registration is a good
thing?</div><a name="08110469000352"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Christopher Kelly:</b></i> I am.</div>
<a name="08110469000353"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
94</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000597"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I think that you are also aware that the Government
share your worry that a move to individual registration could well lead
to a significant decline in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>enfranchisement. Mr. Linton has already alluded to the fact
that probably 3.5 million people in this country  are not on
the register who should be, as the best estimates suggest. There is a
very significant degree of disfranchisement already, so we share your
worry that any moves that lead to further disfranchisement are a very
serious democratic problem. In moving forward on this, as everybody
wants to, do you agree that it would be a good idea to take every step
we can to improve the register as part of any process of moving towards
individual
registration?</div><a name="08110469000354"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Christopher Kelly:</b></i> There can be no answer to that
other than yes, of
course.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000599"></a>The

<a name="08110469000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
96</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000600"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I shall put my question differently since I have
been given the opportunity. How quickly do you
think&#151;realistically&#151;we can and should get ahead with the
introduction of individual voter registration with voter
identifiers?</div><a name="08110469000358"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Christopher Kelly:</b></i> I do not know the answer to that
question because it is on a practical matter on which I am not an
expert. If the burden of the question that Mr. Wills asked
me earlier was, &#147;Should we do all these things first before we
introduce individual registration?&#148;, I may have given a
misleading answer, because it seems to me that we need someone to look
carefully at how quickly it can be done and what steps need to be
taken. On whether those steps need to be taken before such a scheme is
introduced or as part of its introduction, I bow to the wisdom of
others who know much more about the practicalities of implementation
than
I.</div><a name="08110469000359"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
97</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000601"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Two further questions. Just to be clear, I do not
want to put words in your mouth, but I think that you have described
the Northern Ireland experience in a way that suggests that you think
it was a considerable
success.</div><a name="08110469000360"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110469000602"></a>Mr.

individual registration but voter identifiers. You see those as coming

package.</div><a name="08110469000362"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir

98</b><b class="B"><a name="08110469000603"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> My last question. You have said that the
combination of household registration and postal voting on demand is
fundamentally flawed&#151;toxic, one could perhaps argue, to the
integrity of the system. In the absence of the reform that you would
prefer and that your committee and your predecessor argued for
strongly, do you see a case for withdrawing postal voting on demand and
returning to the pre-existing system for postal voting, to try to bring
some measure of integrity back into the system and make it less
vulnerable and flawed?</div>

both of
you.</div><a name="08110469000369"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir

achieve that
result.</div><a name="08110469000370"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir

just add, though, that I happen to favour individual voter

serious and vigorous campaign to get more registration going. That
costs money, and if we want it to succeed we have to pay for that
campaign to get people on it.</div>

are hiding from electoral registration, possibly not knowing so, being
harried through the criminal courts would make the authorities pause
before pursuing the policy that you have described. Were I to return to
my old role of advising Ministers, I would say that it would be
courageous. Vigorous leadership of a programme of encouraging
registration, and being prepared to spend some money on
it&#151;whether local authorities or the Electoral
