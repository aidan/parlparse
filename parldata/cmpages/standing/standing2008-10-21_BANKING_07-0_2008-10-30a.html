<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
214</h4><a name="08103034000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Consolidated

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000204"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Angela Eagle):</b> I beg
to move amendment No. 28, in clause 214, page 102, line 9, leave out
&#145;UK authorised institution&#146; and insert &#145;bank or
other financial
institution&#146;.</div><a name="08103034000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000205"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments Nos. 29 to 31 and Government new clause
3&#151;<i class="I">&#147;Financial
institution&#148;.</i></div><a name="08103034000014"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000206"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The purpose of the clause is to put the use of
public money in the proposed bank resolution or insolvency
arrangements, or in the provision of financial assistance to banks, on
a more regular footing. The Treasury has the power, as a matter of
common law, to make loans to any person or to give them financial
assistance in any form, but it has the money to make those loans or to
make good on any commitment it has given only if Parliament, rightly,
provides the money in estimates. The annual Appropriation Acts can give
full statutory cover for expenditure on estimates, but in line with the
Public Accounts Committee concordat of 1932, specific enabling
legislation is normally required to enable the finance for a new
service to be provided from public funds. That is what the clause
provides.</div><a name="08103034000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
215, which fits with this clause, enables the Treasury to draw money
from the national loans fund to make loans to financial institutions
where it needs to do so urgently to protect financial stability.
Financial crises can arise at any time and it might not be possible to
get an estimate approved quickly enough for the Treasury to make a loan
from voted money, most obviously during a recess when Parliament is not
sitting.</div><a name="08103034000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
originally drafted, clauses 214 and 215 provided for loans or financial
assistance to be given only to UK authorised institutions that have
permission to accept deposits, in other words UK deposit takers. It was
realised in the light of recent events, including those surrounding the
Icelandic banks, that such a limitation could make it more difficult to
protect the interests of UK consumers or safeguard the interests of UK
taxpayers where there is a failure of an overseas institution. The
amendments address that limitation which, as we all know, has been
shown to be actual rather than potential in the last few
days.</div><a name="08103034000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08103034000207"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): I am curious about what
the Minister is saying about the clause. Has there been any thinking as
to the spread over the cost of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div>Government capital when they make that sort of financial assistance? Is
there a fix in mind? Have there been discussions about it? Will it be
at the Government&#146;s cost of capital&#151;we are curious to
know what that is&#151;or will it be at a very large spread, as we
have seen recently? The cost of capital loaning to the banks is
something like 10 or 12 per cent., which seems extraordinarily high,
given the Government&#146;s cost of
capital.</div><a name="08103034000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000208"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> It would be an individual policy decision in a
certain circumstance. Each situation might be different. The proposal
is a much simpler thing. It gives cover for lending the money and puts
it on a proper footing. In other words, because of the 1932 PAC
concordat, where it looks as though money might need to be provided on
more than one occasion, specific legislative approval is needed for
that kind of process, rather than just using contingency funds. That is
all the clause does. It does not talk about what the cost of capital
would be. It would be wrong to think about putting any cost of capital
in primary legislation, for obvious reasons.</div>
<a name="08103034000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
simply regularises, in accordance with the 1932 PAC concordat, as
Parliament expects that if such expenditure could occur in the future,
there should be specific legislative mention of it. This kind of clause
appears in all sorts of bits of legislation. It is not unusual. It
merely enables the potential use of money in that way to be regularised
by statute. It does not go into any kind of detail about circumstances
or what the cost of capital would be if such an issue were to
occur.</div><a name="08103034000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08103034000209"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): May I ask the Minister about
subsection (3)? She referred to the limitations that have been
identified through events at Icelandic banks. Would the
Government&#146;s action be outside the scope of the existing law if
subsection (3) were not
included?</div><a name="08103034000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000210"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> My understanding is that that is not the case, and
that there is existing cover using estimates, but contemplating such
expenditure to rescue banks in trouble has not previously occurred in
this way. So far, it has been covered by using the contingency funds
voted by parliamentary
estimates.</div><a name="08103034000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
combination of clauses 214 and 215 shifts the way in which we propose
to cover the situation in future. First, clause 214 regularises the
situation in terms of the PAC concordat by providing a particular
statutory undertaking rather than relying on contingency funding.
Secondly, clause 215 says that the best place from which to provide the
money is the national loans fund rather than the Contingencies Fund,
for reasons that we can go into when we discuss that clause. The
amendments widen the capacity for using that process to non-UK
deposit-taking banks, following the issue with the Icelandic banks.
That is all the clauses do. They do not go into great detail about
other
circumstances.</div><a name="08103034000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a common law power, which means that everything that has been done
to date is lawful, but because of the 1932 PAC concordat, the idea is
not to rely on common law powers for ever into the future if an issue
comes up that may result in such expenditure reoccurring. The PAC
concordat is that if something that had not existed or been
appreciated, but might require forward expenditure&#151;the present
situation is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>an example&#151;the Government will take a specific power for those
circumstances, rather than simply relying on common law powers. That is
a bit of a techie point, but that is all it
is.</div>
<a name="08103034000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000211"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> I have another question, but if I am off base,
perhaps the Minister will let me know.</div>
<a name="08103034000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
there are EU financial assistance rules, and I wonder how the new
legislation ties in with them, or whether it is even relevant to them.
Were they taken into account when drafting the
Bill?</div><a name="08103034000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000212"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Obviously, a range of structures, national, EU and
international, come into play when unexpected global events occur that
affect entities with a global presence or with branches or part of the
entity elsewhere&#151;for example, Landsbanki in the
UK&#151;although they are regulated elsewhere. If the hon. Gentleman
is referring to state aid, he is right: the clause is compatible with
state aid. If he is referring to other EU rules, he will have to be
more
specific.</div><a name="08103034000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not believe that the clauses do anything to put us into conflict
with EU rules. The point is technical and narrow, and ensures that our
expenditure is properly and specifically accounted for, rather than
being subject to common law, which is what the then Government arranged
with the PAC in 1932.</div>
<a name="08103034000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 214 is
not unique. Its provisions appear in other legislation where a possible
circumstance has been identified in which expenditure might have to be
made. In such a case, the usual rule is to make proper legislative
provision for it, which is what the clause does. It is nothing more or
less than
that.</div><a name="08103034000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have introduced the amendment and we have talked a bit about the clause
as well, but I am happy to answer any further questions that hon.
Members may
have.</div><a name="08103034000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000213"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I make a plea to the Minister? As hon. Members
will recollect from our proceedings on the Finance Bill, when
Government amendments were tabled, they were occasionally accompanied
by explanatory notes, which assisted Members from all parties who were
perhaps not privy to the thinking of Treasury officials. The Minister
has acknowledged the technical and, indeed, techie nature of the
measure, so is it possible to provide such notes for some of the
Government amendments?</div>
<a name="08103034000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to
the amendments and new clause 3. The original drafting made explicit
the group of institutions to which financial assistance could be
provided: UK authorised institutions and institutions that were deposit
takers. I understand the point the Minister made about non-UK
institutions, but I do not know the precise legal status of ING, to
which the retail deposits of, I think, Kaupthing and Heritable were
transferred. I had assumed that if ING Direct was an incorporated
limited company in the UK, it would have already have been picked up
under subsection (2)(b). However, if it was a branch of the Dutch
parent would it, on that basis, fall outside subsection (2)(b)? I would
be grateful for clarification about the contrast in status between
branches and UK subsidiaries of overseas
entities.</div><a name="08103034000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
could understand the position if the amendments were limited to
deleting &#147;UK&#148;; the Minister&#146;s explanation would
stack up quite well and I would be happy to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>move on. However, I am concerned that the way in which the amendments
have been drafted means that they go beyond banks. Amendment No. 28
refers to</div>
<a name="08103034000164"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;bank or other
financial
institution&#146;.</div><a name="08103034000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
that basis, it could be an investment bank, which may not be a deposit
taker in the strict definition of subsection (2)(b) or it could be an
insurance company, an investment manager, an insurance broker or even
an independent financial adviser. I am not sure how widely
drawn</div>
<a name="08103034000165"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;bank or other
financial
institution&#148;</div><a name="08103034000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
or why the Government believe it is necessary to have such a broad
definition in the Bill. The breadth of clause 214 is extended by new
clause 3, which gives the Treasury the power by order to</div>
<a name="08103034000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide that a
specified institution, or an institution of a specified class, is or is
not to be treated as a financial institution for the purposes of
section 214 or
215.&#148;</div><a name="08103034000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that would work on a case by case basis, so I am not sure
why the Government might want to decide, or have the power to decide,
to exclude a specific category of institutions from the definition
of</div>
<a name="08103034000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;bank or other
financial
institution&#148;.</div><a name="08103034000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful if the Minister could clarify that point because I am
not entirely sure whether the measure gives the Government much wider
powers to give assistance to financial institutions that are beyond the
scope of the Bill&#151;for example, to an insurance
company.</div>
<a name="08103034000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reports in
the papers during recent weeks have suggested that there is some
concern about the solvency of insurance companies. I do know whether
the powers are sufficiently broad to enable Government financial
assistance to be given to insurance companies, not withstanding the
narrow scope of the Bill. Will the Minister explain why the terms have
been drafted so widely and what the relevance of the power in new
clause 3 is? Will she confirm that the financial assistance will not be
used for any purpose beyond the limits set out in the
Bill?</div><a name="08103034000178"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div>
<a name="08103034000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000214"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about
explanatory notes for amendments, we are happy to try to provide them
if the Committee feels that they are of assistance. We will get on with
that for future aspects of the Bill, so I hope that is
helpful.</div>
<a name="08103034000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked why there was such a broad definition in the Bill, and
why the original drafting had been expanded by the amendments. It is
partially because events have demonstrated that our original drafting
was too narrow for us to achieve the aim, for systemic reasons, of
stabilisation of particular institutions, which is what the Bill is
about. Simply, the Landsbanki events demonstrated that the provisions
as originally drafted were too narrow.</div>
<a name="08103034000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked where the bank ING was incorporated. He was
right&#151;it is incorporated in the Netherlands, so, but for the
amendments, it would fall outside the provisions of subsection (2). The
original drafting of the Bill would have made it harder for
us to handle the situation that occurred. To be clear, however,
we do not have any plans to provide financial assistance to
ING&#151;just in case anyone gets the wrong idea about
that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000215"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I take on board the Minister&#146;s comment about
ING, but we could have dealt with that issue by just
removing&#151;well, not just removing; that makes it sound far too
simple&#151;the provision that relates to UK authorised financial
institutions and using a broader definition of authorised financial
institutions. The measure before us, however, would go further than
even deposit takers.</div>
<a name="08103034000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000216"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Yes, the definition of financial institutions is
broad; it could include banks, building societies, holding companies,
investment firms and investment banks; but, given the complex nature of
relationships in particular examples, flexibility is needed so that
powers exist to react appropriately if a circumstance involves
different forms of arrangements that fall outside the original, narrow
drafting of the Bill. That is why we have tabled the amendments. We
have to be flexible. If, for reasons of stabilisation, there were a
need to direct assistance, the amendments would mean that we had the
power to direct it where it was needed.</div>
<a name="08103034000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000217"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Am I right, therefore, in assuming that if it was
decided, for whatever reasons, that Standard Life, which has a banking
subsidiary and is owned by an insurance company, were to acquire the
deposits of another licensed deposit taker, the amendments would enable
assistance to be given to the parent company; whereas, under the
previous rules, we would not have been able to assist the parent
company but could have assisted the banking
subsidiary?</div>
<a name="08103034000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000218"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I do not want to get into using particular examples
or names, for rather obvious reasons. We are not talking about existing
institutions that are in difficulty, so I do not want to use the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s phraseology with respect to particular institutions.
However, he is right in essence: the provision is about the flexibility
to deal with a circumstance that may present itself in a particular
instance where there are different arrangements. We do not want to
predict them in advance, but we want to have the power to direct
assistance and not allow too narrow a definition of &#147;financial
institution&#148;. It would defeat the overall object of the Bill,
which is, in certain difficult instances, that assistance be directed
where it solves the problem&#151;that, I suppose, is the simplest way
of putting it&#151;and the amendments would do so. The power could
not be used to bring things that are clearly not financial institutions
within the scope of the clause, so we will not be rescuing plumbing
companies. The difficulty, however, is that there is no clarity about
what a financial institution is, and of course what one is may change
or evolve. For example, we have recently seen the emergence of those
who issue e-money. Such evolution of financial arrangements will
continue.</div><a name="08103034000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment will give us the scope to direct financial assistance where
it is needed to solve a problem. We are not specifying particular
problems. Systemic problems may emerge that have not been anticipated
and do not fall within the narrower wording in the clause. The
amendment will give us the flexibility to direct assistance where it is
most needed. Otherwise, we may suddenly find that the arrangements that
have evolved do not fit the
powers.</div><a name="08103034000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000219"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
explanation. I am beginning to understand the proposals. She mentioned
people providing e-money. I guess that is the type of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div>institution referred to in new clause 3, which will give the Government
powers to specify a group of institutions as financial institutions.
The obvious definition would be &#147;financial businesses that are
not regulated by the Financial Services Authority&#148;, which could
fall within the scope of new clause
3.</div><a name="08103034000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000220"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The idea is to have a broad power that is
future-proof in its scope of financial institutions, not to spread the
powers beyond that. However, the measures must cope with the innovation
that we see happening all the time, which is often technology-assisted.
That underpins the amendments. I give the assurance that this is not a
power to go off into other areas of the economy or to deal with
different types of companies. It is trying to capture where this issue
may focus if there is a rearrangement or evolution of financial
systems. That is often accompanied by technological innovation, which
introduces things like e-money. That would not have been picked up by
the original drafting of the Bill, but it may need to be if we are
talking about systemic risk and the ability to move in and protect
depositors.</div><a name="08103034000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000221"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister is tempting me down a route by talking
about e-money&#151;I quite regret having mentioned it. Are e-money
systems such as PayPal covered by the banking industry&#146;s
responsibilities for payment systems under part 5? I am not sure where
such systems fit within the regulatory
framework.</div><a name="08103034000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000222"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I think the answer is that e-money is regulated by
the FSA regulatory framework. That may change in the future; the idea
of regulatory frameworks is that they can evolve if the things that
they are regulating evolve. Part of the difficulty is that we are
trying to pass legislation that is to some extent future-proofed to
deal with a fast-moving and innovative part of the global economy. That
is why the proposals will broaden the scope of &#147;financial
institution&#148;. I do not want to give examples because such things
may not exist yet. The structure of companies that may have to be dealt
with in a future credit shock may not yet exist, but we want to give
enough scope under these powers for the Treasury and the authorities to
deal appropriately with a future systemic
problem.</div><a name="08103034000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific question, I shall have
to write to him with details because he has been so innovative that we
do not quite know the answer, but I am happy to let him have an answer
in writing, if he is
concerned.</div><a name="08103034000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000223"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Can the Minister confirm for the sake of clarity
that, notwithstanding the broadening of the scope in respect of
institutions that can receive financial assistance, they can only
receive it under the Bill in connection with parts 1 to 3 and that it
will not go wider than the terms of the
Bill?</div><a name="08103034000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000224"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> That is a reasonable question. Under the powers in
the Bill, assistance can be provided other than in connection with a
special resolution regime for reasons of economic and systemic
stability. One of the most obvious examples of that is the guarantee
the Chancellor gave to depositors with Landsbanki, which is not in the
special resolution regime. However, some of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>those powers are required in future to ensure that Landsbanki depositors
can be covered, so it is not only about matters within the scope of
parts 1 to
3.</div><a name="08103034000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000225"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am now pleased that I asked the question, because
the Minister&#146;s answer goes further than the clause suggests.
Clause 214(1)(a)
says</div><a name="08103034000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for
any purpose in connection with Parts 1 to 3 of this
Act&#148;.</div><a name="08103034000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parts
1 to 3 deal with the special resolution regime, stabilisation powers,
bank administration and bank insolvency, but I do not think that the
guarantee given to depositors with Landsbanki and the other Icelandic
banks is covered by subsection
(1)(a).</div><a name="08103034000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000226"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> That is true, but clause 214(1)(b) goes beyond the
special resolution regime, as the hon. Gentleman will see if he looks
at it. It refers
to</div><a name="08103034000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
UK authorised institution (other than in respect of loans made in
accordance with section
215)&#148;.</div><a name="08103034000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(1)(b) takes the powers slightly wider than the hon. Gentleman
suggested. However, that is for the general good, for protecting
depositors and thereby for safeguarding financial stability&#151;that
is the connection&#151;but not only, necessarily, within the
insolvency situation of particular
banks.</div><a name="08103034000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000227"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for drawing my
attention to subsection (1)(b). I am not trying to be difficult, but
paragraph (b) would be fine if the definition was related to licensed
or authorised deposit takers. However, the change in the definition of
&#147;a UK authorised institution&#148; to include a bank or other
financial institution gives the Government powers to give any financial
institution money, not necessarily in connection with parts 1 to 3.
That makes the scope wider than I had anticipated, given the nature of
the Bill. I am not sure what safeguards there are to prevent a
Government from using the provision to give financial assistance to any
financial institution. There is no natural or obvious limit in the
clause, given the breadth of definition that we are now introducing in
the
Bill.</div><a name="08103034000179"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="08103034000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000228"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is trying to
be difficult. He is right to probe the issues. He asks why the
definition is wider than the scope of parts 1 to 3 of the Bill. I ask
him to bear in mind what we are trying to do with the Bill, which is to
have a system that can be preventive&#151;that allows earlier
intervention to prevent more of a systemic breakdown, if that is
appropriate&#151;rather than having to wait until a bank has entered
the special resolution regime, for example. It may not always be
appropriate to wait until something has collapsed to provide financial
assistance; it may be appropriate to offer assistance at an earlier
stage of the process to ensure that we prevent damage that might happen
if we are prevented by law from intervening earlier.</div>
<a name="08103034000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">For instance,
it might be appropriate to offer assistance to prevent a company from
entering the special resolution regime, or to support a bank to
stabilise it. The guarantee offered to depositors in certain
institutions and the recapitalisation scheme itself are recent examples
of action that stabilises before a collapse can happen. Therefore, we
think that it would be wrong to wait until 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>the bank entered the special resolution regime to be
able to provide assistance to it, and that is for preventive
reasons.</div>
<a name="08103034000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that any Government would want to go around injecting capital
into banks for charitable purposes. It is done to prevent a systemic
collapse and there are safeguards against the improper giving of money
to financial institutions.</div>
<a name="08103034000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
is an enabling power. It does not mean that it will be appropriate to
give assistance to financial institutions willy-nilly, or just because
we wake up one morning and decide that it might be a good idea. It has
to be for the reasons that we have all discussed during our debates on
the Bill and indeed during the passage of the Banking (Special
Provisions) Act 2008.</div>
<a name="08103034000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also have
to put it on the record that we need to ensure that we get value for
money for the money that we give, so the clause is about ensuring that
regular parliamentary powers apply to money that is given, rather than
using common law, and the powers go wider than perhaps the hon.
Gentleman had thought and also perhaps wider than our original
drafting, simply because of the fact that lessons have been learned
recently. The clause is about acting in a timely fashion to prevent a
worse situation happening, which can sometimes mean acting proactively
before a crisis erupts in its full form.</div>
<a name="08103034000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having given
those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be happy with
the amendments.</div>
<a name="08103034000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000229"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Actually, I think I can help the Minister. I
appreciate the point that she is making about wanting to ensure that we
can give financial support before the special resolution regime is
invoked or before insolvency or administration. That is entirely
reasonable.</div><a name="08103034000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
just wondered whether in subsection (1)(b) the financial assistance
could be restricted to deposit-taking institutions, so that the
paragraph would read, &#147;in respect of, or in connection with
giving, financial assistance to or in respect of a bank or other
deposit-taking institution&#148;. I want to get round the issue about
when it is a UK branch or a UK-incorporated company. So, effectively
one can give financial assistance in respect of a deposit-taker in the
UK, but that financial assistance can be provided to a bank or other
financial institution. So we are trying to restrict the circumstances
in which the money can be given but broaden the people who the money
can be given to.</div>
<a name="08103034000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000230"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Why would the hon. Gentleman want to limit
assistance in that way when doing so would mean that the powers of
intervention might not be able to cope with a particular instance? We
obviously cannot anticipate when assistance will need to be given to
protect UK depositors&#151;Landsbanki is an obvious
example.</div>
<a name="08103034000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08103034000231"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): I appreciate my hon.
Friend&#146;s willingness to take examples and apply them. If a major
insurance institution that provides important support to deposit takers
found itself in difficulty&#151;we can recognise straight away one
such institution across the pond that was the focus of Government
intervention&#151;would not some flexibility to respond to another
financial institution that is not a deposit taker but is intimately
connected with the support of deposit taking be an important
requirement in the Bill?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div><a name="08103034000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000232"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> My hon. Friend, as he often does, has got straight
to the point. I apologise if I have been waffling around it. The hon.
Member for Fareham asked whether we should limit those powers to
deposit-taking institutions, but recent experience shows that other
types of institution can also get into difficulties. My hon. Friend is
right in the sense that AIG, the largest insurer in the world, had to
be bailed out&#151;we can use that example because the Fed did it. It
is especially appropriately in the current climate that we take powers
that enable us to provide assistance to other institutions.</div>
<a name="08103034000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to reassure the hon. Gentleman that we have no immediate plans to
provide money to insurers or investment companies, but we think it
prudent in the current circumstances to take powers that are wide
enough to cope with any systemic situation that might occur, rather
than narrowing them. I emphasise that that is in the context not only
of the Bill, but of the need for proper value for money through
appropriate Government expenditure. No Government want to have to put
money into a private sector company, but some are so important to the
economy and the world financial system that, if needs be, they must be
supported. The hon. Gentleman is trying to narrow those powers and
limit their potential use, even though we hope that they will not have
to be used often, if ever again. He is wrong to think that narrowing
them in the current circumstances, considering the interconnectedness
of the financial systems, is the right thing to do at this
time.</div><a name="08103034000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000233"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I appreciate the Minister&#146;s comments.
Importantly, the debate has established that the Government are looking
for powers to give financial assistance to any class of financial
institution that could pose a threat to financial stability. I might
not quite have understood the Minister&#146;s opening remarks, but
that is quite an important power, and that needs to be acknowledged
when looking at the matter.</div>
<a name="08103034000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">In essence,
that power will give the Government the opportunity to provide
financial assistance to any financial institution, regardless
of whether it is an authorised deposit taker or is helping to stabilise
an authorised deposit taker. It could be used to provide financial
assistance to a company such as AIG, if we had such a company in the
UK. It could be used to provide financial support to an AIG-type
institution, even if it is not a deposit taker. It is just now that I
have got to that point. The breadth of the power that the Government
are seeking goes way beyond the original wording of the
Bill.</div><a name="08103034000072"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000234"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Obviously, there has to be a systemic risk. The
hon. Gentleman is right about insurers that are bound up in systems
that may, in the end, lead to deposit-taking institutions after
following a trail of instability back to a particular place. It may be
the case that in certain circumstances a power to stabilise such an
organisation is
appropriate.</div><a name="08103034000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000235"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> To try to be helpful, perhaps the focus therefore
should not be on defining more closely the institutions that one might
assist but the purpose that one would follow in assisting. We may come
to this when we discuss financial stability in broader terms shortly,
but perhaps a sharper definition of the purpose 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>for intervening in the marketplace in this way might
be of more assistance than querying the institutions that might be
assisted.</div><a name="08103034000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000236"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Yes, but given that we have the Banking (Special
Provisions) Act 2008 and are now seeking to replace those powers with a
more permanent statute&#151;that is what this Committee is doing this
morning&#151;the context is clear. I re-emphasise that there are
limits on the power to spend value-for-money state aid and propriety
limits. In the context of the Bill, we are discussing systemic risk,
where the consequences of allowing something to fail are much greater
because of its systemic importance than the consequences of intervening
to save
it.</div><a name="08103034000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000237"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Member for South Derbyshire made a valid
point about purpose. I am not sure that the purpose is as clear as it
could and should be. In her responses to interventions, the Minister
clarified the breadth of the power, but this is a Banking Bill, not a
financial stability Bill. If there were some way of linking the use to
which funds under clauses 214 and 215 could be used for the purpose of
the financial stability objective, which is the context for the Bill,
it would be helpful in giving people a clear view as to the purpose for
which and circumstances in which the money could be
used.</div><a name="08103034000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment</i>

section 2A to the Bank of England Act 1998. This is an important area
of the Bill because it deals with some of the changes to the
institutional architecture in the tripartite arrangements, and in
particular it deals with the scope of the Bank of England and how it
carries out its duties.</div>
<a name="08103034000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bank has
two functions under clause 216. First, it has a statutory objective of
committing to protecting and enhancing financial stability, which is
set out in proposed new section 2A. Secondly, proposed
new section 2B establishes the financial stability committee,
which will be a sub-committee of the court of the Bank of England,
chaired by the Governor. I have tabled two groups of amendments to the
clause. One group&#151;amendments Nos. 56, 58, 59, 60, 61 and
62&#151;would make the financial stability committee a wholly
executive body within the Bank of England. The second
group&#151;amendments Nos. 68, 69, 70 and 71&#151;would make it a
wholly non-executive body. I have done that to stimulate debate within
the Committee about the role of the financial stability committee,
where it sits within the Bank, and what its powers and authorities
are.</div>
<a name="08103034000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Treasury
Committee report on banking reform
said:</div><a name="08103034000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
House of Commons should not be invited to consider and approve
arrangements for the Financial Stability Committee as they
stand&#151;with proposals of uncertain origin and with the purpose
and composition of the Committee yet to be determined. This is because
the committee is in danger of failing in both its executive and
scrutinising functions as it is as drafted, a hybrid
body&#148;.</div><a name="08103034000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the concern that we have. I want to use this debate to tease out the
hybrid nature of the committee.</div>
<a name="08103034000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to those amendments that would make the financial stability committee
an executive body, the model that I have used is the Monetary Policy
Committee. For the financial stability committee to be as effective as
the MPC, there would need to be two fundamental changes to the
proposals set out in the Bill; one relates to the composition of the
committee and the other to its function.</div>
<a name="08103034000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The strength
of the MPC is that it brings together a group of experts, some from
within the Bank and some from external appointments, with a wide range
of views. One only has to listen to the views of David Blanchflower
today to understand the breadth of opinion in the MPC. That provides
the creative tension that any committee needs to get to the right
answer, using a breadth of views. Bringing in outsiders gives a broader
perspective, and the MPC is credible because of the calibre of the
appointments and the mix of internal and external
appointments.</div>
<a name="08103034000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
importance of financial stability decisions, if we are to have a
committee with the responsibility to promote financial stability, it is
important that there is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>clear decision-making process, and that such
decisions are made by a wider range of individuals than is currently
the case. That is why there should be external members who can give a
wider perspective. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for South
Derbyshire suggests the type of person who might become a member of the
committee.</div>
<a name="08103034000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
only the Treasury Select Committee that suggested there should be
expertise; the Chancellor of the Exchequer, speaking in the House of
Commons on 5 June,
said:</div><a name="08103034000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
should learn from the example of the Monetary Policy Committee, and
take a similar approach to financial stability, bringing in outside

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000241"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> The hon. Gentleman says &#147;outside,&#148; and
one of the critical definitions of that implies outside of both
executive and non-executive functions within the fabric. No MPC members
currently serve on the court of the Bank, and neither should they. One
of the important issues in defining what an outside individual
is&#151;something that perhaps the Chancellor muddied slightly in
that comment&#151;is that a person should be entirely outside any
structure within the Bank. Does the hon. Gentleman
agree?</div>
<a name="08103034000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000242"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> That is what the debate is trying to tease out. If
the financial stability committee is to have decision-making powers, it
would be right for outside appointees to be genuinely external rather
than non-executive. I will elaborate on that, but as I see it, the role
of a non-executive director&#151;in any organisation&#151;is one of
scrutiny. They are not there to make executive decisions but to hold
the executives to account. That is why audit committees of plcs are
staffed almost entirely&#151;if not entirely&#151;by non-executive
directors. It is the same with remuneration committees. If we ask a
non-executive director to perform a role, generally that is in a
scrutiny rather than an executive position.</div>
<a name="08103034000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is right to make a distinction about the external appointees.
If it is meant to be an executive committee, those people should not be
non-executive directors of the court of the Bank of England, in the
same way that they cannot be for the MPC. If it is a scrutiny role,
they should be non-executive directors, and if it is not a scrutiny
role, they should not be, because it muddies the water as to what
non-executives should do.</div>
<a name="08103034000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
return to the parallel with the MPC. The Treasury Committee&#146;s
report tried to identify the strength of the MPC. It said that it
has</div> <a name="08103034000172"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
distinct status and authority as the body responsible for the
formulation of monetary policy within the Bank of
England&#148;</div>
<a name="08103034000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">It noted that there was
a clear separation from the court and said that the MPC had
&#147;clarity of function.&#148; That goes back to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point that there is no blur between oversight and
executive powers.</div>
<a name="08103034000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the
Chancellor&#146;s statement in June, there has been a lack of
clarity. The model now emerging is not akin to that of the MPC or to
the scrutiny role that non-executive directors would introduce into the
procedure.</div>
<a name="08103034000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir John
Parker is a senior non-executive director of the court of the Bank of
England. To his mind, the financial stability committee would make
executive decisions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>relating to individual actions. That contrasts with
the existing financial stability board within the Bank, which is open
to non-executives and does not make executive decisions. In his
comments, the Governor said that there should be an executive element
to the financial stability committee, and that the holder of his post
should chair it; otherwise, the committee will not get to grips with
the policy issues faced by the Bank.</div>
<a name="08103034000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08103034000243"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): In setting out
his views, can the hon. Gentleman tell us what he believes that the
scope of the executive decisions should be? That is the critical
difference between the MPC and the financial stability
committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000244"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> If the hon. Lady will bear with me, I will come to
that. I have tabled amendments that redraw the scope of proposed new
section 2B(2), to try to distinguish between the executive and
non-executive functions that the two formulations could set
out.</div>
<a name="08103034000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I was
saying, the Government are clearly of the view that the financial
stability committee should have executive decision-making powers, and
that the chairman should chair it in the same way as he chairs the MPC.
That would not be an unreasonable view to take if the committee were to
be an executive body. There has been some comment on this matter by the
industry. In its response to the January consultation, the Association
of British Insurers said that its preferred option would be a separate
expert committee, along the lines of the MPC, with responsibility for
financial stability. That would allow the court to deal with its more
administrative role. However, if the committee is to be an executive
body and carry that authority, I am not sure that it can be a
sub-committee of the court. That is why we would reconstitute the
committee, under amendments Nos. 56 and 58 to 62, to consist of the
Governor, the deputy governor, two members appointed by the Governor
and four members appointed by the Chancellor. It would then broadly
mirror the composition of the
MPC.</div><a name="08103034000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Treasury Committee has suggested that the committee&#146;s functions
should include liquidity operations outside the ordinary course of
business, such as schemes comparable to the special liquidity scheme;
the functionality of payment systems; formulating policy positions with
respect to prudential regulation; directing the Bank&#146;s
analytical work on financial stability, including horizon-scanning for
potential risks; and decision making in relation to the special
resolution regime. That is a reasonable set of functions for an
executive body to have.</div>
<a name="08103034000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
62 would tweak proposed new section 2B(2) to make it clear that the
financial stability committee would decide upon the Bank&#146;s
financial stability report, and that it is there to make not
recommendations but decisions. Amendment No. 60 would require the
committee to decide whether the Bank should exercise its stability
powers rather than simply give advice. Amendment No. 63 would carve out
from the court&#146;s remit responsibility for the financial
stability objective in the same way that the MPC&#146;s objective is
carved out of the remit of the court in the 1998 Act.</div>
<a name="08103034000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendments
set out how the committee could be given a purely executive function,
and would ensure that the composition of the committee reflected its
executive role, putting it on a par with the MPC in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div>terms of functionality and membership. That is a
clear model of how the committee could work, with collective decision
making. The amendments would ensure that a range of voices were heard
when the committee made decisions about financial stability, and would
broaden engagement in decision making beyond the confines of the Bank
to include people with relevant external expertise, such as those with
recent banking, legal or accountancy experience. However, the external
appointees would have to have the credibility to make those decisions
in the way that external appointees on the MPC have sufficient
credibility to ensure that its decisions are seen as credible in the
outside
world.</div><a name="08103034000181"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="08103034000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
to the second batch of amendments, the Governor might decide, in
relation to the tripartite authorities, that we do not want an
executive body to make decisions, and that we want them to be made as
they have been made in the past few years. What we actually want from
the financial stability committee is not a hybrid of executive and
non-executive roles, but someone who will hold the executive within the
Bank to account. I have sought under amendments Nos. 68 to 71 to bring
that
about.</div><a name="08103034000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Significant
arguments can be made for a non-executive body, and I am agnostic about
which route we take. There are merits on both sides. I am not intending
to press the amendments to a Division, but this is an opportunity to
gain clarity from the Government about their
thinking.</div><a name="08103034000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000245"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman explain why he thinks that
the interest rate decision made by the Monetary Policy Committee is
akin or similar to decisions that would have to be made in respect of
contributing to financial stability? One is a lever to be pulled, and
is connected to something; it is about the price of money. The other is
much more diffuse and cannot be dealt with in the same way as the
Monetary Policy Committee deals with interest rate decisions. Will he
share with the Committee his thoughts on why the institutional
arrangements for making the Monetary Policy Committee decision are akin
to those that he thinks the financial stability committee should be
making if it is doing its job?</div>
<a name="08103034000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000246"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> We need a clear structure for the decision-making
process. There are two models that we could follow: one is to vest the
power to make the decisions with the executives of the Bank of England,
as happens at the moment, and the other is to give it to a separate
committee, the financial stability committee, which could make the
executive decisions on behalf of the
Bank.</div><a name="08103034000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister is right to point out that the MPC meets only two days a month
to make the decisions&#151;I accept that I am grossly
over-simplifying its role. The committee members undertake a lot of
analytical work between meetings. I am not sure to what extent they see
their role on the MPC as being full-time; I suspect that many external
appointees do see it as pretty much a full-time
role.</div><a name="08103034000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000247"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> An important function of the MPC that could be
paralleled in such a way is communication and debate about the credible
subject with which it is engaged. Typically, the MPC members visit a
substantial number 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div>of bodies throughout the country, write articles and contribute speeches
to bring home some of the critical monetary policy issues. One of the
things that we have learnt about financial stability is that perhaps
the debate has not been vigorous enough and that some of the messages
have not been heard loudly
enough.</div><a name="08103034000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000248"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Indeed. The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful
argument for the financial stability committee to be constituted in the
same way as the MPC. I shall come back to that point in a
minute.</div><a name="08103034000163"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The
strength of the MPC in decision making is that the breadth of its
appointments provokes and simulates a debate, the point made by the
hon. Member for South Derbyshire and, as David Blanchflower
demonstrated by his remarks today, there is every breadth of view about
some of the decisions. There is positive strength from engaging the
wider financial community in a debate about how to gain financial
stability. To go back to the Minister&#146;s point, the executive
committee can meet on a more regular basis than two days a month to
make such decisions. If my recollection is right&#151;I think that it
is&#151;the court of the Bank of England was convened in the evening
after support was given to Northern Rock to advise on the committee. It
is not impossible to get a committee together to make decisions so that
a continual debate is in progress rather than one that would be seen as
discrete and held only on a monthly
basis.</div><a name="08103034000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000249"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> What the hon. Gentleman has not mentioned, which I
asked him about, is the fact that the MPC has a clear target on the
inflation figures and, in interest rates, it has a clear lever, which
is very focused. It debates wider matters, but its purpose and function
is crystal clear and tightly defined in a policy framework set by
Government, and it has mechanisms to deal with that. That is different
from what he is saying about the FSC, which is an executive committee.
He needs to talk about the purpose, functions and mechanisms at its
disposal.</div><a name="08103034000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000250"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Lady makes an important point. In the
second half of my remarks, I will expand on the financial stability
objective. Clearly, the FSC is there to contribute to achieving that
objective. She is right that it is difficult to measure whether that
objective is achieved. One knows when one does not have financial
stability, but it is not easy to say when there is financial stability.
In his remarks to the Treasury Committee, the Governor said that during
the period of tranquillity the seeds of the current crisis were being
sown. That suggests that it is difficult to determine when there is
financial stability. Whether the committee is executive or
non-executive, there is a problem of how to measure and monitor its
performance.</div><a name="08103034000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
could talk about more qualitative measure&#151;in evidence to the
Treasury Committee, Sir John Parker spoke about a qualitative financial
stability objective. That suggests that when there is such a degree of
subjectivity, having more voices involved in the debate may be better
than having fewer, because that makes it harder to be as precise about
whether an objective has been achieved. On more subjective areas of
debate, more voices are needed to give different perspectives, rather
than there being a house view on how financial stability should be
achieved.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div><a name="08103034000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will return to the amendments, because we will discuss the other points
in a few minutes. One criticism of having an executive committee
centres on whether it can make decisions quickly and whether the
decision-making process is sufficiently streamlined. That relates to
the point underlying the Minister&#146;s intervention. I think that
that criticism is legitimate. As I said earlier, I am agnostic on which
model should be used, but I do think that there must be clarity,
whichever is chosen. As its remit is constituted, the FSC might not be
able to make the quick decisions that the Government and others will
expect it to make in the context of securing financial
stability.</div><a name="08103034000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
that basis, perhaps the right model is one of scrutiny, whereby the
committee will examine decisions once they have been made rather than
have an undefined role in making the decisions. That would send the
financial stability function of that committee down a sub-committee of
the court route rather than a hybrid route. It would clearly be there
to deal with issues of financial stability; it is a sub-committee of
the court. The financial stability board already exists within a court
structure. The deputy governor for financial stability is the chairman
of that board. Non-executive directors attend and attendance is open to
all members of the court. The Governor also sits on that committee. It
is not clear how the FSC as constituted in the Bill differs from the
financial stability board. That is the board that will hold the
Government to account.</div>
<a name="08103034000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the FSC is
to be a purely non-executive body, it must have a non-executive
majority. It should not be party to executive decision making; its role
should be confined to a forum for taking soundings prior to decisions
being taken elsewhere by executives. It should be chaired by a
non-executive in the same way that audit committees or remuneration
committees are chaired in listed
companies.</div><a name="08103034000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is always important that we listen to the views of the non-executive
directors of the court, who, in their memo to the Treasury Committee in
June, outlined their strategic lead role, saying that they could,
through the regular reviews that they
conduct,</div><a name="08103034000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;endorse
the Bank&#146;s strategic objectives and work programme in relation
to financial stability; to review the linkages between the Bank, FSA
and HMT, as well as the Bank&#146;s own capabilities, to ensure that
the Bank is equipped to discharge its financial stability
responsibilities; and to review the effectiveness of the Bank&#146;s
work on financial stability issues, including the internal organisation
of that
work&#148;.</div><a name="08103034000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a good remit for a non-executive committee. It is not clear whether
those processes that they already undertake would be incorporated
within the FSC. If those are to be incorporated, that does not sit well
with having an executive
chairman.</div><a name="08103034000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000251"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is another
area of inconsistency in the Bill? Care is taken to define voting
rights and others matters of that sort that might be related more
clearly to an executive function, but is there an area of discrepancy
in respect of the non-executive roles that he has highlighted? I am not
sure that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments change all those; as
with my amendments, I do not think that he went through with a
fine-toothed comb to produce entirely consistent positions. Is there a
discrepancy in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>focusing on exactly how people vote and when they
are entitled to do so and having perhaps slightly less material about
setting out in law a non-executive
function?</div><a name="08103034000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000252"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about voting
rights. If the body is expected to be a decision-making body, there
must be absolute clarity about who votes and where that power rests.
With a non-executive body, the process does not need to be as precise.
I freely admit that if I were a parliamentary draftsman, I would
produce a better, more coherent set of amendments to create the
distinction between the two, but these are a peg for debate. The
questions about the hybridity of the committee have not been properly
addressed. This is our opportunity to do so and the Minister, too, will
have the chance to do so in her
reply.</div><a name="08103034000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000253"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right: it is a recognisable
option to table two incompatible groups of amendments for debate.
However, which amendments does he favour? He has not told us
yet.</div><a name="08103034000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000254"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister must have been preparing her speech
for later on and not listening to my remarks. I have said on two
occasions that I am agnostic about this matter because I can see merits
in both outcomes. I am not comfortable with the hybrid nature of the
measure in the Bill. These are probing amendments, not ones that I
would press to a vote, but I am keen to use them to get the Government
to express why they believe that a hybrid model is preferable to either
a purely executive or a purely non-executive model. That is the purpose
of this debate. I freely admit to having a strong belief in some areas
and being agnostic in others. There are not many things in life that I
am agnostic on, but this happens to be one of them. I will return to
the areas where I am less agnostic in later
debates.</div><a name="08103034000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments offer two choices. One is to make the financial stability
committee a proper executive body, reflecting the strengths of the MPC
in terms of its composition and remit and using that as the model of
how an executive committee can function. The type of decisions that a
financial committee will make must be thought about carefully. There
are two choices: are those decisions best made by an executive body
constituted in line with the MPC, or are they are better made within
the Bank&#146;s existing decision-making processes, but with stronger
scrutiny by the court of
directors?</div><a name="08103034000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hybrid model confuses membership, accountability and responsibility.
Given the importance of the financial stability objective, it is not
helpful for that to be the case. There are other issues connected with
the financial stability objective which also make it harder to hold the
Bank, whichever model is used, to
account.</div><a name="08103034000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northampton, North looks as though she wants to

on.</div><a name="08103034000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103034000260"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I will continue to plough my furrow, under your
guidance Mr. Hood, no matter how lonely it
is.</div><a name="08103034000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
financial stability objective forms the basis of one of the more
difficult parts of the Bill. It clearly generated quite a lot
discussion in the Treasury Committee and in our evidence session a week
last Tuesday. We believe it is important that the Bank be given the
objective of financial stability as part of its remit. Part of the
challenge of the past 12 months or so has been to decide who has this
responsibility and how the Bank should play its
role.</div><a name="08103034000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are part way through a period of instability and there must therefore
be some lessons that we can learn that will enable us to prepare for
the future. As I indicated earlier, it is easier to know when we are in
a period of instability than when we are in a period of stability. In
trying to understand what the objective of financial stability actually
is, one needs to consider three questions. First, what does it mean in
practice? Secondly, how does one measure it? The hon. Member for
Northampton, North made that point well. Finally, what tools does the
Bank have to deliver financial stability?</div>
<a name="08103034000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me start
with the definitional problem first. I accept that it is a problem. The
hon. Member for South Derbyshire and I had a debate last week about
financial stability and how one defines it. The present Economic
Secretary, in his evidence to the Committee, described 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>the concept of financial stability as a high-level one. There has been a
debate about the objective. The former Economic Secretary, the hon.
Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher), when giving evidence to the Treasury
Committee in July, held out the prospect of a bit more definition than
we have in the Bill when she
said:</div><a name="08103034000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
think we will be setting that out legally in the legislation, so the
technical answer to that question will come in October...We will
define it clearly, I presume, in the
legislation.&#148;</div><a name="08103034000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly
things have changed since she gave the evidence. Not only is she no
longer the Economic Secretary, but we have gone from that tantalising
promise that was held out to us of a definition to what we have in the
Bill, which is:</div>
<a name="08103034000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
objective of the Bank shall be to contribute to protecting and
enhancing the stability of the financial systems of the United
Kingdom&#148;.</div><a name="08103034000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure that that is as full a definition as the hon. Lady hoped it
would be, but that is the definition that we
have.</div><a name="08103034000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Treasury Committee concluded&#151;having read the report and the
evidence quite carefully I understand why it did so&#151;that there
is no consensus about what financial stability means. The report is
clear. It sets out the range of definitions of financial stability that
could be used. The Governor defined a period of financial stability
as</div> <a name="08103034000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
period during which the payment system worked normally and the ability
of households to mediate their savings into real investment in the
economy at home or abroad operated
normally.&#148;</div><a name="08103034000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nigel
Jenkinson, who is the executive director&#151;I see that the Whip
wishes to intervene. I shall not finish this speech this morning. I
will have to continue after the lunch break. I am happy if the usual
channels want us to adjourn at this
point.</div><a name="08103034000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further
consideration adjourned<i class="I">.&#151;[Mr.
Blizzard.]</i></div><a name="08103034000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Adjourned
accordingly at twenty minutes past Ten o&#146;clock till
this day at One
o&#146;clock.</i></div></div>
