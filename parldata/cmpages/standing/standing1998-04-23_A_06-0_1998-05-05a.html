<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 37, in page 18, line 4, leave out from "potential" to "and" in line 8. [Mr. Spring.]
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 26, in clause 24, page 22, leave out lines 12 and 13.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): As I was saying when lunchtime interrupted us, one of the problems with the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts under the clause, which we seek to improve through the amendment, is that it will provide quasi-venture capital funds for scientific, technological or artistic endeavours. That idea brings back bad memories of the National Enterprise Board, which had a wider remit than NESTA's. Some of the bad ideas from which both the Conservative and Labour parties have moved on seem to be smuggling their way back in the unlikely guise of the Bill.
<P>
The Minister for Sport will no doubt remember that the Greater London council was the last great bastion of the idea of public sector investment. I think that the Greater London Enterprise Board outlasted the National Enterprise Board by some years. I dare say that in one of his incarnations he had some responsibility for it.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Sport (Mr. Tony Banks):</B> I did.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I hope that Ministers can assure us that, if and when the Minister for Sport moves on to another job, nothing like that board will ever be seen again in the land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> May I assist the hon. Gentleman? I was hoping that he would say something about the National Enterprise Board, because I put much time and effort into its formulation, in conjunction with the young Margaret Jackson, as she then was now the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am fascinated to learn about the Minister's history, and I hope that the President of the Board of Trade, at least, has learnt her lesson in the intervening decades and will not try to return us to those ideas but I am not sure how confident I am about that. It is widely agreed that that experiment did not work on the broader scale, and therefore that it is unlikely to work in the relatively narrowly defined sphere in which that part of NESTA's activity will operate.
<P>
During this morning's sitting, the Minister for Arts identified another of the points that I want to raise. He said that 1 per cent. went into venture capital for seedcorn or start-up funding, although, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Mr. Prior) said, it was not clear what that was a percentage of. Nevertheless, if we accept that greater resources need to be used in that way, a fund of œ200 million divided into three different areas of activity will not make that much of a difference.
<P>
We do not yet know it would be interesting if he would tell the Committee in his response how the Minister envisages the division between the various parts of NESTA's activities. Does he have in mind percentage allocations between the various forms of activity? If not, who will determine the percentage divisions? Will it be done on a bid basis, or by soliciting and direction, as in other clauses? It would be interesting to know how NESTA proposes to operate.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Arts (Mr. Mark Fisher):</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not labouring under the misapprehension that NESTA will distribute œ200 million a year. If he reads the Bill he will find that that sum is the endowment, and that all that will be distributed is the investment income from it, which will be a small sum. Even at 7 per cent., it works out at œ14 million a year, so we are not talking about huge sums of money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Precisely so; that makes stronger my point that a trickle, at best, will be provided. That makes it all the more implausible for the Minister implicitly to claim, as he did earlier, that there is a big problem of under-provision of venture capital funds for such activities, and that NESTA will come riding to the rescue.
<P>
We shall come later to amendments that deal with the Secretary of State's ability to raid other parts of the lottery to increase NESTA's endowment but, as the Minister says, only a small percentage of that endowment will be distributed. Even if the percentage is small, my question about how it will be divided between the various parts of the NESTA empire still applies.
<P>
The degree of uncertainty about the matter was illustrated in the debate in another place. Lord Redesdale made the point that the problem often lies with development and production, and asked whether NESTA would consider supporting secondary manufacture of design goods. Baroness Ramsay replied, "Why not?" I can think of many reasons why not; the Minister's face suggests that he has just thought of some as well. The Committee would welcome some reassurance that the answer given by the noble Baroness does not represent Government policy.
<P>
To conclude, the problem is that NESTA is basically a good idea but that something that belongs to other Departments has been spatchcocked on to it. If the Government proceed with NESTA in the form set out in the Bill, the good work that it may do in other fields will be overshadowed by the difficulties caused by the endeavours that the amendment is intended to prevent it from undertaking. I therefore urge the Government to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Prior </B>(North Norfolk): I shall be brief, because my hon. Friends have covered most of the important points. I shall pick up two aspects of the matter. First, the fund has a broad remit covering the fields of science, technology and the arts, and it is improbable that any single group could possibly evaluate such a broad spectrum of activity.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) conjured up the "La Boh\geme" image that may be lurking in the minds of some members of the Committee the image of a struggling artist up in some old garret. In fact, I suspect that some of the struggling artists are living happily in Islington and, who knows, may even be supplying materials for the Lord Chancellor's refurbishment and eating foie gras with the Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend so early in his speech, but it occurs to me that perhaps I was thinking of the wrong end of the musical spectrum, and that at one time the lead singer with the Longpigs may have been among the struggling artists who needed Government support on welfare to establish their creativity before they became the stars that they are now. I am sure that the Minister would be especially sympathetic to that thought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> That is a good point, because it is almost impossible to spot winners at any stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Very easy, in the case mentioned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Possibly, but usually it is easy to pick winners only with the benefit of hindsight. Leaving artistic matters aside, it will be impossible for a group to try to spot winning commercial ideas which, as the Bill says, can be exploited, and the rights to which can be adequately protected by which I assume is meant patent rights, copyright, and so on. Looking back in history at artists whose talent was not spotted in their lifetimes be it Picasso, Van Gogh or whoever are we really being asked to believe that NESTA will be able to identify such people? I think that that is highly unlikely. Putting art in the category of commercial exploitation is a difficult concept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Connarty </B>(Falkirk, East): Does the hon. Gentleman disagree with the Department for Education and Employment, which has just announced that the new deal will now be applicable to people who are endeavouring to make a career in the arts? The Department is also allowing skillseeker's allowance to be given to people in the arts and music.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We shall not pursue the new deal on this occasion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> The second point that I wish to make is about science and technology. I share the doubts of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford; the Bill appears to be setting up a venture capital fund, which will have to compete with the expertise of private-sector capital funds. If it is to compete on a fair basis, people must look for a rate of return similar to that obtained by private-sector companies. The danger is that NESTA will be seen by some as a milch cow, from which people can obtain capital without having to pay the same rate of return that would have to be paid to a private-sector provider. Unfair competition with existing venture capital providers is a severe risk.
<P>
Finally, I reiterate a point that I made in an earlier intervention, which is that there is no shortage of venture capital or development capital in Britain. A report in The Economist at the weekend estimated that œ50 billion of venture and development capital has already been raised to be invested in Europe and the United Kingdom. There is no shortage of capital; the problem is putting entrepreneurs in touch with those who have the money. That is why the amendment seeks to remove not the whole of clause 16 but only subsection (2)(b). We support subsections (2)(a) and (2)(c), which are worth while. We oppose only paragraph (b).
<P>
<B>Mr. Connarty:</B> I have to make a speech, because my intervention was ruled out of order, and I have a salient point to make. I call into question the basis of the amendment. It would appear that the Opposition are going in the opposite direction from the Government agencies. It is recognised that artists and musicians go through periods of gestation, and that if they are not supported by agencies that support people who seek long-term, profitable employment either by setting up businesses or by selling their labour to others those talents will wither on the vine. That was recognised by the Department for Education and Employment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Spring (West Suffolk):</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Connarty:</B> I shall let the hon. Gentleman intervene in a moment. The Government recognised that fact in connection with the skillseeker's allowance. Such help should be available to people at the start of their creative lives, when they cannot gather or exhibit enough of those skills to win sufficient money to make a good living, to be creative and to make products to sell for the British economy. That was recognised with the skillseeker's allowance, and it is recognised in the Bill. That is why lottery money should be used through the fund during that gestation period. That underpins all of those subsections, particularly subsection (2)(b).
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> As I understand it, the Government are reluctant to see the continued payment of jobseeker's allowance to actors who are resting. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have already ruled that such issues are out of order. We are debating a specific amendment relating to NESTA, not the jobseekers allowance or the new deal interesting though they may be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Connarty:</B> The matter will rage on, so perhaps it can be discussed outside the Room. Given that I have a black belt in karate, the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) may not come out of such a challenge with a smile on his face.
<P>
I am willing to focus my remarks on the Bill. The narrowness of the amendment is what makes it so silly. If the Opposition opposed the setting up of NESTA in general, they would have advanced some credible arguments saying that it was wrong. They support the first part of the clause, the objects of which are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to support and promote talent"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and to help talented individuals in the fields of science. However, it is so narrow to say, under subsection (2)(b), that NESTA should be denied to those, who turn
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"inventions or ideas in the fields of science, technology and the arts" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the more ephemeral part of the productive efforts of artists 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"into products or services".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Conservative Members argue that such people should go to venture capitalists, who will be driven by a different motivation, and shareholders who wish to see a return on the capital invested, and not to think about long-term benefits and the possible economic returns to society.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I wonder whether the distinction between us is that we believe that national lottery money should be spent on philanthropic, not commercial, ends. Moreover, we do not believe that the lottery should make a profit from setting up a play school or a bowls green, for example, through property development or some other exploitation. We do not want the lottery, through NESTA, to be involved directly in commercial exploitation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Connarty:</B> The hon. Gentleman's logic is flawed. The Opposition are saying that NESTA can be used to encourage and promote people, but that, when those people are on the threshold of developing a product or an idea, they should return to starving in a garret. We want to bridge the gap. I accept that difficulties may arise in the exploitation process when an idea or a business is growing. I have talked often and at length to members of the British Venture Capital Association, who do a great job in such matters.
<P>
The Bill is different and the fact that the Opposition want to pull the short ladder offered by NESTA away from people who work in science, technology and the arts shows how mean-minded they are. That is wrong thinking and they should be condemned not only for the paucity of their arguments, but for their malice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> That is nonsense. We support the principle of setting up a national foundation for such purposes. As the Minister said, a trickle of income will arise from the œ200 million. It is important to be able to secure additional funding. Because of the way in which NESTA is set up, with mutually exclusive objectives, it will not be attractive for outside individuals and bodies to add to the whole NESTA pot. The hon. Gentleman fails to understand the point of our argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Connarty:</B> Obviously, I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. It will be as attractive to someone to add to that pot if NESTA includes the objectives set out in subsection (2)(b). How can they detract from the attractiveness of outside contributions to NESTA?
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford referred to the National Enterprise Board. I know more about the Scottish Development Agency now Scottish Enterprise. The fact that it is funded publicly does not deny venture capitalists having an interest. Indeed, it encourages them. It is a success model that, I believe, has been taken on board by the Welsh Development Agency and it is very much a model for the regional development agencies.
<P>
It is not like the old national enterprise board, which may have been flawed because it was far too dominated by the idea that the public sector could do it all. That was about creating a new dynamic. NESTA will also create a new dynamic, but Conservative Members do not want that. If clause 16(2)(b) is removed, a vacuum will be created between promotion, encouragement and product development in a flourishing business enterprise that will be attractive to venture capitalists and other capital-supplying organisations.
<P>
The amendment is cheap, mean-minded and flawed in its logic. If subsection (2)(b) is removed from the Bill, a problem will be created for NESTA because it will be less attractive for private sector capital to join it. That would damage the Bill, which is perhaps the reason behind the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> We have had an interesting debate. As my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) said, the Opposition are slightly confused in their attitude to NESTA. The hon. Member for West Suffolk, who leads for the Opposition, recognises that there is a problem and suggests that although we are a creative nation, we do not always develop our ideas, so we have to question whether the proposal helps. Unfortunately, his hon. Friends are not with him on that. The hon. Member for Ashford says that there is no problem at all and that the private sector does admirably, while the hon. Member for North Norfolk said that there is absolutely no shortage of venture capital for such projects. The Opposition seem a little divided on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I do not know whether the Minister was a lawyer in a previous incarnation, but it certainly sounds like it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Certainly not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Both my hon. Friends said that the amount of venture capital activity, especially in the past two or three years, has grown exponentially from a low base. If the Minister is asking whether that is enough and whether there is potential to do more, the answer is yes, of course. There is no disagreement between us on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am delighted to hear that. But when we come to next question, of proportion, the hon. Member for Ashford disagreed with himself. On the one hand, he said that at best, there would be a trickle, but on the other hand, he tried to raise the spectre of competing with the private sector. The hon. Gentleman is probably too young to remember the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation, but he seems to be confused about whether NESTA will sweep aside the private sector or will be completely irrelevant to it. The Opposition certainly seem confused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Does the Minister believe that the antecedents of the IRC and the national enterprise boards bode well for the Government's proposal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> No. We learnt a lot from those organisations, but we are not trying to reinvent them. As my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East said, there are models, some of which have developed in the past few years, such as Scottish Enterprise, which are more flexible and interesting. They also have a proven track record. It is difficult for the public and private sectors to work together, but we have learnt a lot in the past 20 years. I hope that we shall be learning more from this fairly modest, but helpful proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Minister accuses me of confusion, when I was saying that NESTA will be ineffectual or damaging, or both.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Or irrelevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Will the Minister say whether it is more likely to be ineffectual or damaging?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I think that it will be both constructive and helpful, which may be tautological. Clearly, we believe that it is a good idea. It is a modest, but helpful proposal. Given that there is confusion, I refer to the remarks of the hon. Member for West Suffolk, who leads for the Opposition. He agreed that there is real talent in this country. We have inventive and creative people and there are plenty of examples of developing new products, services and ideas. That process is accelerating we are good designers and problem solvers.
<P>
I should have thought that the hon. Member for West Suffolk, knowing the commercial sector well, would recognise that we have a genuine problem. For a variety of structural reasons, such as short-termism and the culture in the City, our venture capital is more cautious about taking risks than some of the other countries to which the hon. Gentleman referred. Investment culture in the United States is rather different. Both he and his hon. Friend, the Member for North Norfolk who have some experience of Massachussetts Institute of Technology or it may have been the Harvard business school would acknowledge with regard to the United States private sector that the matter is not solely one of legislation. The United States has a different risk-taking culture. The British financial sector benefits from our culture to msome extent, because it gives great solidity and reliablity but we also pay the price.
<P>
The proposal is intended to be small and targeted, and to make a bridge between innovations and ideas that are not a proven product that entrepreneurs and venture capitalists can take on, and the capital that such ideas need, which could be very beneficial.
<P>
The proposal will not address all of the sector's needs, but as Opposition Members said, many products and services require a totally different form of nurturing, involving long-term projects, big research teams and huge capital investment. Research councils and the private sector address many of those needs. The Government are targeting a specific, small, crucial and symbolic problem with a constructive initiative.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Suffolk is shaking his head, but he has agreed that a problem exists, and that it would be irresponsible not to address it.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I was shaking my head only because it was not clear to me what a symbolic problem was.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> A problem that is symbolic of other problems behind it.
<P>
The Government pray in aid for the proposal three texts that Opposition Members would do well to ponder. A CBI report was published in 1997, entitled "Breaking the Growth Barriers for Technology-Based Small and Medium Sized Enterprises" the CBI has an eye for commercial titles for its publications. That report highlighted the need for early stage finance and seedcorn investment.
<P>
The 1997 House of Lords Science and Technology Committee published a report last year entitled "The Innovation-Exploitation Barrier", which highlighted the need for management of innovation. It suggested that the British are good with ideas, but that our managers and entrepreneurs are perhaps not so good at taking them on. It also called for recognition of the importance of intellectual property, which is a vital matter that one of the amendments seeks to knock out of the Bill. It is surprising that the Committee has not debated that matter more.
<P>
The third text that we pray in aid is a 1996 Bank of England report called "The Financing of Technology-Based Small Firms". It called precisely for partnership between the public and private sectors. NESTA will address that need and will attempt to create the partnership called for by the report. If the hon. Member for West Suffolk believes that the Bank of England is misguided in calling for such a partnership, he is wrong, and he would do well to look at the report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I want to ask the Minister about his comments on intellectual property. Does he envisage NESTA employing people who will assess a new invention or idea with a view to obtaining patent protection? NESTA would have to employ many highly skilled and well qualified engineers to do so. How will NESTA in practice draw up an application and assess whether an invention is applicable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Obviously, NESTA will take professional advice about the technicalities of any product. It will be a very small organisation, with few employees. Opposition Members also asked whether NESTA would be staffed by civil servants. The answer is no. The Government are setting it up as a non-departmental public body without civil servants. It will recruit from the private sector, and will be truly independent of the Government. There is no track record of civil servants with the type of experience needed for such work, even in the Department of Trade and Industry. The skills are out there in the private sector, but they need to be focused on this specific problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ronnie Fearn </B>(Southport): The Minister has touched on the complement of NESTA. How and when will those persons be chosen? Will there be a balance between men and women, for instance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> As for the second question, that is undoubtedly a factor in all our pubic appointments. We were a little surprised to find, on coming into Government, that although the Department is responsible for more than 60 public bodies, there was little methodology of approach beyond the good sense and advice of departmental officials.
<P>
We are considering ensuring that all skills, including those of people in the regions and of men and women, are represented on bodies. We want the best quality and the most relevant skills represented on all our non-departmental bodies, and that will be true of NESTA, too. There will not be quotas, but we will be looking for a small number of men and women with the relevant skills from the private sector. The recruitment of that small board will take place this summer and the appointment of the chair will proceed in the next few weeks.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fearn:</B> Following on from that, when the chair and the board have been appointed, what happens if someone falls out?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The debate is much wider than the amendments. I am prepared to tolerate that, provided that the Committee appreciates that there will be no stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am afraid that I have forgotten what the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn) asked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fearn:</B> Who will appoint if there is a vacancy? Will the decision come back to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The board of NESTA and the chair will be appointed by the Secretary of State, but it will be up to the trustees to recruit members of staff. There will be only a small staff; it is necessarily a small, light-footed organisation.
<P>
The Opposition in the other place generally welcomed NESTA, and I think that I detected, through Opposition Members' slight caveats, a cautious welcome, at least for the idea behind it. If that is the case I am looking for some indication of assent from the hon. Member for West Suffolk Opposition Members should examine their amendments carefully. I presume that they are probing, but if they are serious, they are far more radical than the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends seem to realise. They would knock out the content of NESTA; amendment No. 37 would remove all products and services. What else will NESTA back apart from products and services?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> People.
 <P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> If we accepted amendment No. 37, we would destroy NESTA's whole content. Likewise, amendment No. 24, which neither the hon. Gentleman or his hon. Friends spoke to, would knock out intellectual property as part of NESTA's consideration; in fact, there would be very little left of NESTA. The hon. Gentleman's support in principle for NESTA would be totally confounded and destroyed if we accepted the amendments.
<P>
It is interesting to note that the Opposition have plaintively appealed for support from outside bodies in helping to draft amendments and provide briefing notes. One can see why, when they table such self-defeating amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Minister clearly ignores what would be left, which would be what I suspect most people think NESTA is for supporting talented individuals. That is how NESTA is being sold out there, rather than as a small-scale, irrelevant or damaging, badly run venture capital fund, which is what the amendment would rule out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Yes, but we would be helping talented individuals as long as they were not involved with products, services or intellectual property. One wonders how those individuals could express their talents if such matters were excused. Nevertheless, we take it that the amendment is a probing amendment to explore certain areas and, as such, it has led to an interesting debate.
<P>
As the hon. Member for West Suffolk called NESTA a national trust for talent, I detect that he supports it. He asked why it should not have independent charitable status and I hope that he accepted the reply that I gave him. We took advice from the Charities Commission. We did not want NESTA to be a wholly charitable organisation, but it may want its status to be reconsidered. It is perfectly within its rights to apply to the Charities Commission for charitable status if the trustees consider that to be appropriate. We have tried to build into clause 23 some of the advantages of charitable status, such as tax exemptions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Under clause 17, NESTA can take a corporate interest in a joint venture. Presumably, that will lead to it receiving dividends, capital gains and so on. How can it be right for NESTA to be able to compete with private venture capital funds and receive such benefits?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to NESTA setting up in competition with the private sector. It will certainly be in partnership with it, but it will focus more on the space between individual, under-financed entrepreneurs, inventors and creative people. It will be helping them to bridge the gap and get their ideas into a form appropriate for venture capital and commercial entrepreneurs. There is not much competition in that area. Few people are undertaking such practices because it is not a commercial sector. However, it could be a small, but valuable, sector.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Suffolk asked whether NESTA would be independent of the Government. Given that such arguments have not so far been deployed in the debate, I hope that he accepts that it will be set up differently from the other bodies. It will not be subject to directions from the Government. When set up, it will be accountable to the Secretary of State for its financial matters. Otherwise, it will be wholly independent.
<P>
I was asked whether NESTA would be picking winners. Obviously, we hope that the people who are appointed to the board and their staff will consider ideas that have legs and can prosper. In that sense, within its small and specialised pool, NESTA will be looking for winners. It will be identifying projects that other people have ignored not just good ideas, but those with commercial potential. It will not be picking winners and working against the private sector, but will target itself at the gap in between.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Suffolk said that the matter would be much better left to the private sector and he made a point about the United States. Tax incentives and the private sector work in such areas. There is certain development of ideas for products and services that only the private sector can carry out because of scale and integration with other products and services in which a big corporation may be involved. That will continue. NESTA will not be in competition. There is a role for tax incentives to develop new ideas and a role for the private sector, which we want to encourage and foster. NESTA will target itself at a smaller, but specific, problem. I was asked whether the people involved will be civil servants they will not.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford was worried that NESTA would replace charitable investment. When he considers the scale of enterprise of œ14 million a year, I do not think that he will see a problem. I was not sure what point the hon. Gentleman was making, but NESTA will be a small enterprise and it will not replace anything, it will try to address an area that no one is addressing. The hon. Gentleman pointed out that big companies already fund research well. As I acknowledged, the sort of innovation and development that requires long-term capital investment, with large teams of medical or other engineers, will continue. NESTA will work at a different problem, so the hon. Gentleman's fears that it will replace the private sector are misconceived.
<P>
He is also misconceived with his "La Boh\geme" image of the artist in his garret and the lone inventor in his garage. That is a surprisingly old-fashioned and out-of-date image for both such people. Those are tired clich\aes. Not many inventors work in garages the hon. Gentleman has been watching "Back to the Future" too often. The idea of artists starving in garrets is also rather old-fashioned.

<P>

<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser </B>(Mid-Dorset and North Poole): I would like to point out that that is precisely where such people work. I cite the example of Mr. Dyson, who has just made millions from his new vacuum cleaner. He worked in his garage in precisely the way that my hon. Friend described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> A wonderful man and an extremely good vacuum cleaner, an example of which I am pleased to own. There are exceptions to everything and there are always brilliant people. If we consider the trouble that Mr. Dyson had getting his product off the ground and marketed well and the difficulties that he has had marketing it in the United States, we will understand some of the real problems that exist even for a brilliant idea and a determined, resourceful and inventive person. As Mr. Dyson is an exception that proves a rule, the hon. Gentleman makes a good point, but not one that in any way undermines our intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> The point is that the marketing problem to which the Minister refers will not be solved by NESTA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> No, nor should it be. NESTA is not intended to do so. It will carry embryonic ideas to a further stage. It will be a hatchery [Hon. Members: "A hatchet job."] A hatchery is a good and nurturing image.
<P>
The other point on which the hon. Gentleman was slightly out of date concerns the sort of artistic ideas that may benefit from NESTA. We have perhaps concentrated on industrial products and high technology. The borderline between cultural, design and high technology projects is constantly blurring, and artists are increasingly working at the interface with technology in broadcasting and in the digitalisation of images. The distinction between the visual artist, for example, and new technologies and scientific innovation is increasingly blurred. Again, NESTA will be working in that area.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's distinction between starving artists and scientists inventing in their garages is too clear and rather old-fashioned. That explains why we will not be asking the board to divide the percentage between sciences, technology and the arts, because the boundaries between those areas are often confused and crossed by inventions, products and services. It will be left to NESTA's trustees to decide how to divide the earned income from the œ200 million endowment between their various responsibilities. The Secretary of State will not be instructing them how to do that.
<P>
Finally, the hon. Gentleman asked me to what I was referring when I mentioned 1 per cent. I was referring to a report issued by the European Venture Capital Association that stated that in 1995, total equity investments in seed and early stage businesses had fallen to œ23 million in the UK that is, 1 per cent. of total venture capital activity. The report was both the source and the context.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Norfolk described NESTA as a milch cow. The hon. Gentleman should realise that, at œ40 million, those are tiny teats. There will not be a lot of milch from that particular cow; it is a lean and hungry cow.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Will the Minister explain how the cow will perform in the hatchery?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> That is an interesting piece of genetic research, which has yet to be fully developed.
<P>
We finally come to the purpose of the clause because, through your kindness, Mr. Gale, we are having our clause stand part debate now. Is there a problem? Is there something that we can do? Members on both sides of the Committee agree that there is, but we obviously differ on whether the NESTA initiative will help. All the research and consultation that we have engaged in reinforces our belief that NESTA will be constructive and helpful.
<P>
Although the Opposition have questioned our belief, they have not been able to cite a single source in their favour. If the City and industry were as sceptical as the Opposition believe they should be, one would expect Conservative Members to have been inundated by letters from merchant banks, venture capital banks and the private sector saying what a rubbishy idea NESTA was. They have not been, because, unlike the Opposition, most people recognise the problem and believe that NESTA will help.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Now that the Minister has explained it, I am more certain than ever that NESTA will be ineffectual rather than damaging. Secondly, because it knows that it can beat the public sector at picking winners, the venture capital industry will now know that a lot of bad projects are likely to be funded further than they would be by the private sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems, perversely, not to understand the relationship. It will be a partnership between the private and public sectors, but the private sector will be the beneficiary of the winners and will carry them on and develop them. When it comes to marketing and going into new territories, the private sector will be essential. The idea that there is a competition between the public and the private sector is wholly misconceived. I hope that the hon. Gentleman can understand that, even if he does not accept it.
<P>
We see NESTA as a bridge between creative talent and the marketplace. It is not the answer, but it will be a facilitator. As such, it is a useful and constructive proposal, which I commend to the Committee. Because the amendments would knock NESTA into the ground, I hope that they will be rejected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Rarely have I heard so much not very warm goo from a Minister. At one point I thought that the Minister was attempting to filibuster his own Bill, because he went round and round the mulberry bush.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I was answering the hon. Gentleman's questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> If the Minister thought that, I fear that he was mistaken.
<P>
We have no difficulty with the principle of a national endowment for talent in this country; we fully accept it. Indeed, as I said earlier, in the run-up to the general election, the whole thrust of what was planned was outlined in policy documents, and the Prime Minister has further clarified it. Since then, the caravan has moved on. Things have changed in such a way that I fear that NESTA will not work as it was originally designed to do, the principle of which we applauded.
<P>
With all due respect, the difficulty for Labour Members is that when they talk about the dynamics of the private sector and the free enterprise system, they are talking about something of which they have no real experience. They are talking about it in an abstract way. For example, the Minister spoke of partnership between the Government and the private sector. I shall give an example of what I think is an excellent partnership. The Department of Trade and Industry runs an excellent scheme in which private sector export promoters work alongside civil servants, helping to give exporters information on overseas markets and opportunities. Out of that excellent partnership, in which the private sector works with the Government, have come the one-stop shops and regional offices devoted to helping. The difference is that NESTA's objectives, which have emerged during debate, are mutually exclusive.
<P>
The Minister was correct to say that the Charity Commission would not define NESTA as a charity. We believe that a mistake is being made, because the public are much more likely to have confidence in NESTA, and individuals and organisations will be more likely to add to what is a relatively small sum, if the Government are not involved. That was the original intention. The Government have said that the individuals whom NESTA helps to be successful will be expected to plough something back into NESTA. However, if they are not successful, what will happen? What market risks will attach to that?
<P>
There is a dichotomy; on the one hand it would be desirable for NESTA to be a national endowment for talent we all approve of that, and it could help in many areas of our national life but on the other hand NESTA jumps into venture capitalism, in which the Government are not competent to make judgments.
<P>
The former Chancellor, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), handled such matters correctly; he created tax incentives and a tax structure that sought to address the problem that the Minister said was highlighted in the 1995 report. I accept that there was a problem, but the policy had begun to work. We should leave it to the private sector to provide seedcorn capital, while offering incentives to individuals and bodies to become involved in such matters. We should not have this type of hybrid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> But as the hon. Gentleman has admitted, that policy is not working completely satisfactorily. Opportunities are being missed and the policy needs to be augmented. NESTA does not replace existing tax incentives. There will be a role for tax incentives, especially in writing off high-risk investment. NESTA will augment that role, so we will have the best of both worlds: we will have the advantage of helping innovation through the tax system, the conventional means, but where that has proved deficient Conservative and Labour Members know that it has not dealt with everything NESTA will act as a safety net for some projects, and nurture them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I am afraid that I must disagree with the Minister. NESTA will not have that effect because the construct is flawed; it will not be successful from a charitable or a venture-capitalist point of view. If NESTA had been set up as originally decided upon, and apparently agreed by the Prime Minister before the election, we should have felt much more comfortable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): If NESTA is so flawed, why did the hon. Gentleman's former colleague, William Waldegrave, as we were reminded this morning, describe it as welcome, imaginative and wise?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The hon. Gentleman is repeating what one of his hon. Friends said earlier about what William Waldegrave said. There is no disagreement across the party political divide about the advantage of setting up such a national foundation, but, as I have said, the devil is in the detail. The organisation that has emerged from what I believe was embryonically a good thing will not be satisfactory to the elements for which it is meant to cater. That is the essential difficulty.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman concludes his remarks, will he clarify the fact that the distinction between us is that the Opposition want a grant-giving charitable body? The right hon. Member for South-[Mr. Fisher]
West Surrey (Mrs. Bottomley), the previous Secretary of State for National Heritage, initiated some bursaries. It is strange that the Opposition want to return to the old-fashioned world of charitable giving and of dishing out money in dribs and drabs and bursaries, while the Government are addressing the real issues, which are that inventions and creativity will lead to benefits, profits and jobs for this country.
<P>
The Opposition have not understood how important the intellectual assets inherent in new invention are, which is why they have not realised that their amendment would knock out intellectual property from the provisions of NESTA. We want creativity that will engage with the real world, have a pay-back and feed back into copyright, intellectual property and benefits, and further employment and profits. An extraordinary mirror image has appeared in the debate. The Opposition seem to be confused and stuck in the world of hand-outs from the Government rather than investment in the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The Minister not only filibustered at the end of his own speech, he seemed to be filibustering me too. I cited two clear examples of organisations that had a respected independent national status: the National Trust and the Prince's Trust.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> They do not invest in industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> That is exactly the point. The Prince's Trust successfully helps seedcorn projects. The way in which those have been set up and organised gives far more comfort than the Bill does. NESTA will not be static; there will be additional sums of money. It will be a hybrid organisation. The point about intellectual property was covered brilliantly by Lord Skidelsky in another place. His argument was convincing and compelling.
<P>
We regret that what could have been a foundation for exploiting talent in this country has now merged into a mongrel that will satisfy no one. It will delve into venture capitalism, in which Governments have a notoriously poor record. That will deprive the organisation of charitable status and diminish the whole point of the exercise. I listened carefully to the Minister, but we want to put down a clear marker and press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall speak to amendment No. 25, the purpose of which is to keep the Secretary of State's hands out of the till. During our debates, we have pointed out consistently the degree of centralisation and control that the Bill gives him. For clause after clause, Ministers have said that we are being unnecessarily cynical and that no Secretary of State would behave like that. However, it must now be dawning on Ministers that the fact that we have tabled a series of amendments to almost every clause in an attempt to remove the excessive degree of central control gives the lie to their argument that there is no hidden agenda in the Government's proposals.
<P>
The proposal in clause 18, which the amendment would reverse, is especially pernicious. The amendment is designed to prevent the Government from returning to the national lottery distribution fund to provide a second allocation of money to NESTA beyond the initial endowment of œ200 million, which the Minister envisages. We have chosen a date roughly in line with the expiry of the current operating licence. It is an arbitrary point to some extent, but it seems sensible that until then at least, the current operators of the good causes can be confident that they will continue to receive large sums of money. Apart from the principle of trying to reduce the degree of ministerial control over lottery distribution, the amendment would reassure the existing good causes, which will see their share decline anyway. The amendment is essentially concerned with the timing of future ministerial raids on the fund for NESTA and with the allocation of the proceeds for the lottery during the term of the existing licence.
<P>
The Bill will allow the Secretary of State to return to the lottery distribution body only a year after the Bill is enacted to demand more money to make a further endowment to NESTA. We want reassurance from the Minister that that will not happen and hope that such reassurance will be in a rather more concrete form than the "There are no plans at the moment" formulation, which I dare say he has ready in his brief now, and which he has used in previous clauses. The additional sum for which the Secretary of State might come back would go beyond the initial endowment of œ200 million that should be paid out from money set aside for the New Opportunities Fund. The Minister has already sought, but failed, to give assurances about the amount of money that will go to the original good causes because of the Bill. More importantly, the Government have determinedly resisted amendments that would limit the amount of money that can be diverted to the NOF.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will forgive me if during our debates in Committee, I have become not less cynical about the Government's intentions, but rather more so. I regret that that attitude will be shared not least by the existing distribution bodies, which have not received concrete reassurances. Those bodies will be more worried than they were at the start of our deliberations about their likely fate. We heard the Minister echo the rather meaningless assertion of a Minister in another place that distribution bodies spend money, not percentages. The money that they spend is a percentage, so when that percentage is reduced, the amount of money that they had expected to spend will also be reduced. They have seen a reduction in their projected revenue; our amendment would prevent any further unexpected reductions. It is no longer good enough for the Minister to say, "Well, they had œ9 billion and we divided that up. It will now be œ10 billion plus, so as there is an extra pot, it doesn't matter to the good causes." As Camelot has become as successful as it is, the good causes themselves have expected extra money to spend and beyond that, the bodies and individuals bidding to them for help have increased. It is not simply a case of good causes wanting an extra budget for the sake of it. People want and need the money to do good things. Therefore, it is not good enough for the Minister to say that we can stick to the original œ9 billion and that anything else should be regarded as icing on the cake.
<P>
The Government have not given assurances that the good causes' percentage share will not be further eroded if the proceeds exceed œ10 billion or said what will happen if the figure falls below that sum. None of the Minister's reassurances stand up to investigation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I am glad that my hon. Friend has pointed that out because it is worth reminding ourselves that the national lottery has been an extraordinary success way above expectations. However, lottery fatigue, which has happened in other parts of the world, could arise if assurances are not given, which would have an impact on the good causes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. Clearly, there needs to be constant vigilance against the possibility of lottery fatigue. One of the contributory factors to such fatigue could be a degree of cynicism among those who play the lottery. They might feel that they had somehow at least in part become a political slush fund. That, in itself, would lower the attraction of the lottery to many people, so that not only would the guilty the Government suffer, but the innocent the good causes too.
<P>
The amendment would prevent the Government from coming back to the original good causes in the event of the lottery proceeds exceeding œ10 billion, and would further reduce their share by diverting a further tranche of money to NESTA. Equally importantly, it would prevent the Government from coming back for more money if the proceeds did not exceed œ10 billion, but the Government decided that they wished to increase the money available to NESTA beyond its endowment.
<P>
We have already discussed reasons why that might happen. The Minister said that NESTA would have the investment income from the proceeds of the original investment to distribute. That investment is likely to be uncertain. Presumably, some of it would be invested in equity and bond markets, which have had an unprecedently good run in the past few years. It would be foolish for anyone to assume that that will continue. One thing that could happen to NESTA is that, in the first rush of enthusiasm and with a projected cash flow, it could commit itself to projects that, if there were a catastrophic stock market crash, it would then find difficult to fund. It would be a great temptation for a Minister who did not want undoubtedly worthy projects to be underfunded or cut off half way through, to say that the easiest thing would be to divert more money to them. It might be a great temptation, but it should be resisted. Like all good parents, we are trying to remove temptation before it arises. Our amendment would make it impossible for Ministers even to think of doing that.
<P>
Assurances were given in another place by Lord McIntosh of Haringey when rejecting similar amendments tabled there. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Government have no current plans to use the power. We consider that an endowment of œ200 million provides NESTA with a fair and affordable endowment from the lottery. Circumstances would have to change significantly before we could consider making a further endowment." [Official Report, House of Lords, 29 January 1998; Vol. 585, c. CWH 122.]<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> What wise words.

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I can feel the weasel words growing.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Circumstances would have to change significantly" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
they can change significantly during the course of a day or two, let alone in two or three years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> Is that not exactly why it was written into the original legislation that the proportions given to all of the good causes could be varied from time to time? While I am on my feet, what objections to the establishment of NESTA have been raised with the hon. Gentleman by the distribution bodies? He appeared to suggest earlier that such objections had been raised, but he has not referred to them since.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> On the second point, I am not aware that anyone objects to the setting up of NESTA. Conservative members of the Committee certainly do not object to it. If the hon. Gentleman had listened to our previous debate, he would have heard all of us, including my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk, saying that we welcomed the idea of NESTA. We are simply trying to improve its performance by eliminating some of the dangers contained in the Bill. I am sure that[Mr. Green]
that is the attitude taken by the distribution bodies as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I apologise to my hon. Friend, but I have forgotten the first point raised by the hon. Member for High Peak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> It was about the fact that the original legislation provided the facility to change the proportions given to the good causes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed it did and that was clearly prudent when setting up a new project setting out on a journey into the unknown. The fact is that having set the 20 per cent. limits, the previous Government stuck to them, so that a degree of confidence was built up. Within a few months of arriving in office, this Government have decided to muck about with the percentages, destroying the confidence of the distributing bodies that had been built during the previous four years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I must reinforce what my hon. Friend is saying about the comments of the hon. Members for High Peak. We are seeking to return NESTA to what was promised by the Labour party when in opposition. The Government have corrupted the principle of NESTA, hence the controversy and difficulty surrounding its future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. The various points that have been raised demonstrate the need for a statutory constraint that will prevent the Government coming back for more. Confidence has been eroded because of the terms of the Bill and we seek by the amendment to prevent a further erosion of confidence.
<P>
Several questions arise, which I hope the Minister will address when he replies to the debate. First, the Government say that they have no plans to use the power. For how long do they have no plans to do so? If they have no plans to do so, why is the power in the Bill in the first place?
<P>
Can the Minister define what significant change in circumstances might persuade the Government to increase the size of NESTA's endowment? I have already given the example of a catastrophic crash in the stock market that might damage the investment income. Would that constitute a significant change in circumstances? What magnitude of event would constitute a significant change in circumstances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Some of the Minister's comments during the debate on the previous clause give us the greatest concern. He said that he recognised that the money was a tiny drop in the ocean and that a much larger injection of capital was required. Does that not imply that the Government are considering providing much more money?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend is right. When the Minister was pinned down about whether NESTA was to be a significant, large-scale body or not, he came down on the side that it was not. He said that it would be rather small scale and that we should not worry too much about it because relatively small sums of money were involved. That is disappointing, because I am sure that millions of people think that NESTA will make a significant difference to many. As it stands, it may not.
<P>
I shall move on. When he answers the debate, I hope that the Minister will tell us whether one of the significant changes of circumstance that might persuade the Government to increase the NESTA endowment would be a shortfall in the amount of money that it could attract from other sources, such as gifts in kind. That is another fuzzy area.
<P>
The Committee would be glad to hear the Minister explain what proportion of NESTA's total endowment the œ200 million will be. Will NESTA have an investment target, is it supposed to match the funds, and will there be a lower limit of extra funds that it should attract? That will clearly affect how effective it will be and how wide an operation it will be, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk pointed out.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Government choose to accept the amendment I hope that they do they will accept that the œ200 million committed to NESTA will be all that it requires during the lifetime of the current lottery licence. That is important, because the power conferred on the Secretary of State by clause 18 is at variance with the Government's pre-election commitment on NESTA. The same is true of other clauses.
<P>
The Labour party's original pledge, made when it was in Opposition, was that limited contributions would be set aside from the new lottery fund to give NESTA an initial boost. If the original pledge was for an initial contribution, why leave open the possibility of further contributions? It was stated clearly in the policy document, revoltingly called "The People's Money", that it was an initial contribution and a one-off seedcorn investment. We now find that that is not the case, but that more money may be provided.
<P>
One of the knock-on effects of the Government not accepting the amendment is its second-order effect on NESTA; it will have much less incentive to go out and aggressively look for more money if it knows that it can always go back to the Government. I accept that that is normally how such bodies behave.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Look at your next amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The next amendment is tabled on the assumption that the Government will vote against amendment No. 25. The Government cannot have it both ways. They either want NESTA to be aggressive or they want it to have a choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> If the hon. Gentleman looks at the next clause, he will see that we have put a duty on NESTA to go out and raise further money. If the hon. Gentleman understood his amendment, he would realise that he was making it voluntary. We want to give NESTA a huge incentive to go out and raise money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman must resist the temptation to debate the next clause. We must first dispose of clause 18.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall, of course, follow your guidance, Mr. Gale. However, with the permission perhaps given with horror of my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk, I offer the Minister a deal. If he accepts amendment No. 25, we might withdraw the following amendment. If he does not accept that, he will have to listen to a further debate.
<P>
The Minister clearly believes that NESTA should have a duty placed on it to raise more money, but he should provide some incentive. To say that Government money will always be available is a backstop. Although NESTA will have a duty to go out and look for more money, it is likely to be rather less aggressive if it knows that it can always fall back on public money. That is particularly so if it accepts that, as a quango, it is essentially an arm of Government and that the Government will continue to provide it with money to do whatever they wish it to do.
<P>
That second-order effect will influence not only the behaviour of NESTA but of those who might wish to donate money directly, through copyright or in other ways. People who want to donate to NESTA to make it successful must choose how to give money to good causes. If there is a possibility indeed, a likelihood that NESTA can return to the general lottery fund for more support, those people will be less likely to give money to NESTA, than to other good causes.
<P>
We know that NESTA will be able to spend its endowment but, as the Minister said, the income generated from that endowment will be relatively small scale and, therefore, I dare say the bids will outweigh the offers. There is little to prevent NESTA from becoming simply another revenue-funded, grant-distributing arm of Government, under the Secretary of State's relatively close control. That would betray the ideal of those, such as the Opposition, who genuinely want a national trust for talent.
<P>
The Government's eagerness to give their own ideas a fairer wind and possibly a playing field balanced in their favour will, in the long term, damage the institutions that the Government want to set up. The debate should be viewed in the context of the objective, that the Government are determined NESTA will maintain that it should pursue commercial objectives, such as those in clause 17.
<P>
It is worth asking why the Government need to reserve the power to provide more money for NESTA at the expense of the original good causes. It seems clear that the New Opportunities Fund will not provide the money if the Government need to find a pot from which to fund NESTA. When launching the policy, the Prime Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We propose to give a Lottery-aided launch"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to NESTA. That is fair enough, but if NESTA is to be a commercial success and a magnet for philanthropic donations, why do the Government need to reserve the power to divert more money to it? I am sure that the good causes would welcome the postponement of the threat of further raids on their money at least until the current licence has expired. They would welcome the three years' breathing space that that would give them. That would enable them to plan better, without the vague spectre of another raid on their funds. That is what the amendment would do.
<P>
If the Minister proceeds as the Government and, indeed, the Prime Minister have promised, the amendment would not affect the operation of NESTA; it would simply remove a cloud over the existing good causes and give legal force to an undertaking that the Government have given in another place. In that light, I am sure that the Government will be happy to support the amendment.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I say that, given the length and breadth of the debate, I am likely to be minded not to allow a stand part debate on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I support the amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Ashford has covered nearly all the arguments. The only substantive point that I shall make is this: for the lottery to survive and prosper, the public must have confidence in it. Listening to today's debates, I am increasingly worried that there is a danger that the puiblic will cease to have confidence in the lottery.
<P>
There is a general view that the existing good causes have captured the public imagination, but there is a danger that NESTA, as it is structured, might erode that. I can imagine headlines, in a year or two's time, about investments that have gone wrong and entrepreneurs who have misused the funds. It is a shame that the Government are going down that road. They will only erode the existing good causes, which have received much public affection and support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The Government ask the Committee to reject the amendments. They would deny the flexibility that we undoubtedly need, which would be circumscribed. To operate such a provision, the Secretary of State would have to return to Parliament and seek an affirmative order. When the hon. Member for Ashford asked about our plans, he anticipated my answer, which is that we have no plans at present. There is no question of damaging the other good causes; such arguments were rehearsed when we discussed the New Opportunities Fund. Any changes would take place only after consultation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford asked for how long we would not have any plans. We have no current plans. I do not want to look into the future but, as he said, circumstances can change significantly. As my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) rightly said, it is precisely because circumstances can change that the Government were sensible as the previous Government were with their 1993 Act to build an element of flexibility into the provisions. We cannot predict what will happen.
<P>
What was interesting about the arguments of the hon. Member for Ashford was that they were so depressing. Given the experience of the Opposition during the past year, it is not surprising that they take such a gloomy and depressing view of the world. They seem to be suffering collective clinical depression. The only circumstances that the hon. Gentleman could envisage changing were those for the worst. He asked what might[Mr. Fisher]
lead the Government to want to vary the amounts. A huge success for NESTA, which I hope for, might well argue the case for backing a winner and investing a larger endowment or a huge excess for the lottery over and above the sum of œ10 billion that is curently anticipated. If we went above that amount, which might happen, all the good causes would probably justify greater investment. Those positive and optimistic areas of flexibility and change are every bit as likely as the eel-like, depressed view of the hon. Gentleman that the only change would be for the worst.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked what would happen if there were a shortfall in other funds. NESTA will have to work within its budget and what else it can raise. He seemed to argue that he did not want it to have incentives to look for money. A later clause requires it to do so. Incentives are not enough. A duty must be placed on it to look for money. If there were a shortfall in other funds, NESTA would have to manage and work within the budgets that had been set. We have no plans, but we cannot anticipate what will happen in the future. The Government want to reserve to themselves the flexibility that runs through the 1993 Act and the Bill. For that reason, we hope that the Committee will reject the amendments, which are not constructive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I spoke earlier on amendment No. 35, but I wish now to speak briefly on amendments Nos. 38 and 39. Will that be possible, Mr. Gale?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Certainly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 would require the Secretary of State to allocate additional money for NESTA from the New Opportunities Fund as will happen in the initial endowment. There are two straightforward reasons for that. First, it is wrong that the initial good causes should be raided again. That is a great mistake. Secondly, the Government would be provided with an incentive to make it clear to the board of NESTA that there would not necessarily be a second endowment.
<P>
Before the election, the Labour party stated in the lottery policy document that its policy was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"To give NESTA an initial boost, limited contributions will be set aside from the new Lottery fund to add to this endowment".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Labour party said that NESTA would have to make the best of what was an initial boost it was not to rely on an ongoing feeding of Government money.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Five questions arise from the amendments. First, does the Minister agree that the best way to make NESTA fully independent is to send out a clear signal that it is not intended that it should rely upon the state? Secondly, if the Government plan to top up the NESTA endowment on an on-going basis, why did they pledge before the election to set up an independent trust with only an initial endowment? Thirdly, how will the Government decide which of the distributing bodies should lose out, or do they plan that they should all lose out by the same proportion, as they have done with the New Opportunities Fund?
<P>
Fourthly, is the Minister now prepared to give any indication of the likely size of any subsequent gift to the endowment? Finally, why have the Government not sought to introduce a system of incentives for NESTA to find alternative sources of money? A system of matching funds, whereby lottery money would be provided to match funds raised by NESTA, would at least ensure that the lottery money went further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has spoken to amendments Nos. 38 and 39. It is right that we should scrutinise the subject. However, he seems to be making the same mistake as the hon. Member for Ashford by seeing flexibility only in terms of disaster and raiding. If he had his way, he would prevent us from increasing NESTA in response to its huge success, or the success of the lottery.
<P>
The idea of raiding other funds is unnecessary. I hope that the future chairman and trustees of NESTA will read my words rather more carefully than the hon. Gentleman heard them, because I said specifically that we had no plans to increase the œ200 million. NESTA will have to live within its means and we shall not increase that sum. It is an initial boost, and we have no current plans to increase it.
<P>
The chairman and trustees of NESTA will know exactly where they stand. They will have the invested income from the œ200 million and they will make the best of it. If we make the right choice of chairman and trustees, they will make a good job of it. There is a great deal of good that can be done with the œ14 million investment that can be raised in other ways; we shall certainly impose a duty to do so. We have no plans to top up that money or to visit it again. We are setting up the fund with œ200 million and we shall expect the trustees to get on and do a good job with it.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman hears these words. Rather more important than whether he hears them or accepts them, is whether the chairman and trustees of NESTA hear and understand the limits under which they will work. I believe that the sort of people whom we hope to appoint will be enthusiastic about the real opportunities that lie ahead, that they will take a more optimistic view than the Opposition do, that they will see the opportunity to do some good with the money and that they will not be looking for an increased investment. They should be making a profit from their investments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I am sorry that the Minister should feel that what I thought was an outstanding contribution by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford was so gloomy.
<P>
We are fully entitled to be cautious, because we are seeing a raid on the lottery and the removal of œ1 billion from good causes, but we see no protection for the future in terms of percentages. It is therefore appropriate that we should extend that sense of caution, to NESTA, especially as we have seen the flouting of the arm's-length and additionality principles in the Bill.
<P>
As I said, we are dealing with a hybrid animal. Our great concern is that despite the Minister's assurances that the sum of œ200 million will be fixed, there will be a further raid on the good causes in future to top up NESTA when it has been unable to attract moneys from elsewhere because of the inherent contradiction in the way that it has been set up.
<P>
I do not want to delay the Committee further on the amendment, but I want to put down a clear marker by pressing it to a Division. We want to have set down our concerns clearly, in case the situation that we have described comes to pass.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 40, in page 19, line 31, leave out "shall be under a duty to" and insert "may"
<P>
Clause 18(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"NESTA shall be under a duty to seek gifts of assistance, money, land and other property, but in seeking or accepting any such gifts NESTA shall comply with any directions given to them by the Secretary of State."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is twofold. I shall not detain the Committee for too long, because we have already had a comprehensive discussion on NESTA.
<P>
First, the amendment is intended to re-establish the arm's-length principle, which is under attack throughout the Bill. Labour's pre-election commitment was to set up an independent trust to fund creative talent we certainly agree with that but we find that the proposed body is different from that proposal, and that the role of the Secretary of State is different from what we envisaged. Secondly, the amendment would remove from NESTA a duty which is unlikely to be carried out in its current form.
<P>
As we have already argued, it is highly unlikely that NESTA will be able to meet its objectives as set out in the Bill, because of its inherent contradictions. My noble Friend Baroness Rawlings rightly described it as a mongrel. There is a contradiction between NESTA's charitable nature and its objective of seeking venture capital. That objective is incompatible with the independent trust promised by the Government.
<P>
The Government are in danger of setting up a body that will fail because it has been saddled with mutually exclusive objectives that make it impossible for it to carry out what it has been set up to do. NESTA will be a commercial body with charitable aims. Of course, it will be expected to attract money from the private sector, although it appears to be the Government's intention to continue funding it from the lottery.
<P>
NESTA is supposed to be an independent commercial organisation, yet responsibility for investment and for its endowment will be delegated to the National Debt Commissioners. In the language of the Government's pledge, NESTA will be an independent national trust for talent, yet the Bill provides it with the characteristics of a quango.
<P>
To speak specifically to the amendment, it is a moot point whether the Government will impose a duty on NESTA to seek outside contributions or whether it will simply be allowed to do so. Frankly, I doubt whether NESTA will be successful in attracting outside funds either way. That is the nub of our objection.
<P>
We accept that NESTA should be allowed to seek money from sources other than Government doing so would at least give it a limited additional measure of independence. The amendment would allow it to do so, rather than giving the Secretary of State the power to interfere and require it to do so. That is the distinction that we seek to make.
<P>
We have discussed the contradiction in the way that NESTA has been set up, but does the Minister envisage that NESTA's role and structure will be changed in future? He has mentioned his commitment that nothing will be added to the œ200 million endowment. Although he has given that assurance, we are still concerned.
<P>
If, as we fear, NESTA cannot attract additional funds because of the inherent contradiction, what does the Minister envisage will happen to restore its credibility? For example, would it be given an opportunity to adopt the more independent status that we have in mind which would enhance its credibility and make it easier for it to attract donations? In moving the amendment, we ask the Government to consider strengthening NESTA's independence without undermining its ability to carry out its mission. I seek assurances from the Minister that he will consider that important principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> This is a strange amendment for the Opposition to move. It would loosen NESTA's responsibility and duty to go into the marketplace and try to fend for itself. We would send a strange signal if we were to say that it had not duty, only permission, to do so. We are using lottery money to set it up, so it is important that it fends for itself, that it has a duty to seek intellectual property rights, bequests and donations, and shares of patents and copyrights, and that it shares in the income from successful investments. That is surely the sensible, prudent way for the Government to proceed. It is not enough to tell NESTA, "Do that if you want to." It should have a duty to do that, and the public would expect us to try to maximise its income.
[Mr. Fisher]
<P>
The hon. Member for West Suffolk makes no case that I can understand for removing that obligation. He believes that doing so would somehow enhance NESTA's credibility, but I do not understand how. There is no evidence to suggest that NESTA will not be credible. It must fend for itself, and it will do so much more readily if it is required to raise and attract other income. We hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Maclennan </B>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross): I support the amendment. I strongly believe that the Bill should contain a permissive provision that allows NESTA to attract and receive funds to enhance its spending capacity. I am sympathetic to NESTA's general purpose, but we should recognise that that if it is required to go out and seek funds, it will be doing so in heavily occupied waters. It will doubtless be going to existing charities that may be funding other charities and to companies that have their own charitable priorities.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Government signal that that body should be favoured over others, I fear that pressure will be brought to bear upon donors and potential donors to conform with the received wisdom of the Government and, of NESTA, because, despite the provisions for its independence, it is the Government's baby. That could be a way of winning golden opinions from the Government of the day. It may not be quite the same as soliciting money for a political party, but it comes too close to it for comfort.
<P>
My second worry is not only that funds may be diverted from other deserving causes, but that such a duty would be difficult to justify if it was challenged in court for instance, if it was claimed that it had not been exercised or if it was argued that NESTA was not properly attracting funds or, if it had failed to attract funds, that it had not made appropriate efforts so to do. Will the Minister not reconsider that provision? It is not strictly necessary to impose a duty to ensure private funding for the organisation. A power would be sufficient. It would be an improvement if the Government undertook to reconsider the matter and accede to the Opposition's proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The right hon. Gentleman always makes interesting points. He seems to be asking whether the provision will affect other charitable giving. There is no evidence for that; indeed, the seeking of charitable bequests and donations is only one small expression of the fulfilment of the duty to go out to attract money. The much more interesting theory is that the organisations that NESTA helps will feed patterns, copyrights, intellectual property and so on back to NESTA, which will feed the next generation of creative talents.
<P>
I take the right hon. Gentleman's point. If there were any sense in which it could be a favoured Government charity as we have already explained, it is not a charity, but a favoured Government recipient I would entirely sympathise with him, but there is absolutely no question of that. We have explored the matter in some detail. NESTA is not gearing its activity to the charitable sector. Its function is to develop innovation and new ideas in a more commercial manner. The right hon. Gentleman's point is well made, but he is unnecessarily worried.
<P>
I failed to respond to an earlier point raised by the hon. Member for West Suffolk, when he asked what would happen if NESTA failed to raise money. Indeed, the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) made a similar, related point. Clause 19 imposes a duty only to seek money. It does not list targets or ways of assessing success. The duty is to search for money, rather than to achieve a percentage fund. That is why there is nothing about matching funding. Funding is a difficult area and it is important that NESTA's attitude should be to look for partners and additional means of funding, but it should not be under an obligation to achieve any particular target, which is rather different from the way some of the other good causes operate in their spheres. The duty is to search for funding, rather than to achieve it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I had not intended to press the amendment to a Division, if we had received further reassurances from the Minister. He should not show such inflexibility in this area and I ask him once again to consider the points that have been so eloquently made by the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, and indeed, by me [Laughter.] There was a comma after the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, I can assure the Committee; I was being suitably modest.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will reflect further on the matter. If he assures us that he will and that he may return to the matter on Report, we will not press the amendment to a Division. I reiterate that the whole tone of the Bill is inordinately dirigiste. There is an opportunity here to put some distance an arm's length between the Secretary of State and the functioning of NESTA. The Bill allows an unwarranted accretion of power to the Secretary of State. The independent status of NESTA is important if it is to succeed and needs to be demonstrated clearly. This is one place where it can be shown in the Bill.
<P>
I give the Minister one further opportunity to say that he will consider the matter; failing that, I will seek to divide the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The usual definition of the arm's length principle refers to an organisation that is dependent on Government. The whole purpose of the duty is to encourage an attitude of mind in NESTA that it is not dependent on Government. It will receive the initial pump priming of the income from the œ200 million, but we are encouraging it not to be dependent on Government but to raise additional sums. Indeed, we are giving it a duty to do so.
<P>
That is wholly sensible and completely the opposite from the sort of nanny attitude that the hon. Gentleman is taking that NESTA ought in some way to be dependent on Government. We believe that NESTA must cope for itself, so it is right and sensible that it should have a duty to do the best that it can to attract additional money. For that reason, we reject the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> First, may I admit that I do not believe that the hon. Member for West Suffolk's comment about my eloquence was at all justified? None the less, concern motivated my intervention and the Minister has not removed my concern by his response to the debate.
<P>
As a matter of good legislative policy, one should not import into Bills duties that are impossible or difficult to enforce, to send signals that can clearly be sent in other ways. We are talking about imposing a requirement, which presumably means that it will be possible to take the issue to court if it were felt that action had not been taken to seek gifts of assistance and so on.
<P>
The Minister's argument about creating a climate of encouragement is at odds with the language of the Bill. I hope that he will seriously reconsider the provisions, because it could lead to rather nasty wrangles and could open up possibilities for unnecessary legal disputes. The Minister's objectives can be achieved by other means.
<P>
I turn to the Minister's utterance we have to watch such things with great care nowadays, because what Ministers say about the meaning of ambiguous clauses is very important that it is not the Government's intention to go in pursuit of charitable giving.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I did not say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> In that case, we are widening the area of uncertainty. I believe that that would be the natural construction of the language of the clause. If NESTA has
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a duty to seek gifts of assistance",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the first places that it will go to are large foundations, such as Gary Weston, and the sort of bodies that have been set up for the precise purpose of funding such activity. Such bodies spend millions of pounds a year on existing good causes. NESTA will be shopping around, taking money away from other meritorious and charitable objects. I am not saying that NESTA should not have some of their money, but it should not be required or given a duty to lever it out of them.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will not push us to a vote without any further consideration of the issue. It is a relatively modest point, but it would nice if the Minister were to give us a little longer to think and consult. Although the subject has been around from the beginning, it is not one on which much light has been focused. I am not sure that those who run NESTA would think it necessary or desirable to have such a duty imposed on them, although I understand that they would want the power to go cap in hand in the manner that we expect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes his points so seductively in a siren voice, tempting the Government to go along with him, but he is mistaken in this instance. He had led us interestingly into the classic diet of Committee work wrangles about the difference between the words "may" and "shall" and, indeed, the invocation of the problems posed by Pepper v. Hart, which are the staple diet of Committee debates. The hon. Member for West Suffolk asked whether I was a lawyer. Far from it, but anyone who has been involved in Committee work for 15 years becomes used to such distinctions, and it is nice to hear them aired before we complete our consideration of this Bill.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman is mistaken. The record will show that I did not say that NESTA would not be seeking investment from other charitable bodies. I said that the more interesting pools in which NESTA should fish and look for ways to fulfil the duty would be in areas such as patents, copyright and percentage shares of projects. They are sources of money that would grow and benefit NESTA in a way that one-off donations and bequests do not.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman's fears are misconceived. The sorts of charitable foundations to which he referred have their own remits. They have areas of work that they always cover, and the good ones do it extremely well. It is precisely because they do not have the remit of NESTA that we feel it necessary to set it up. We underline yet again the fact that it is not a charitable body and is therefore not in competition with them. It will make grants and investments, so it is in a comparable position, but we shall not be taking money from anyone, or relocating charitable investments from a large foundation to NESTA, because the foundation will have a different remit. If it had the same remit as NESTA, we might not have had to invent NESTA. The likelihood of subverting charitable funds is extremely small. We shall encourage NESTA to look for new sources of money and to make a real effort.
<P>
I take the point made by the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross that duties that are difficult to quantify have inherent problems, but we believe that it is important to send a clear signal to the chair and trustees of NESTA that they should not depend on top-up money from the Government. That is exactly the point that the Opposition have been making. NESTA must live by its own wits and good judgment. As well as backing good projects, it must go out and attract money from other sources, and must not look to Government to topup its œ200 million.
