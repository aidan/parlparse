arguments with you; they are simply going to take evidence from your
good selves. Speaking on behalf of the Committee, I very much hope that
our witnesses enjoy the session, which must finish by 1.15 pm at the

the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Campaign to Protect

                           </em> Good afternoon. My name is Simon Marsh. I am
head of planning and regional policy for the RSPB, and I also represent
Wildlife and Countryside Link. Our concerns are very much focused on
the planning aspects of the Bill—on part 5. We very much welcome
the Government’s intention to engage communities more closely in
the planning system, but we feel that localism, if it becomes
parochialism, carries risks both for the environment and for the wider
community, especially when seen in the context of the challenge of
climate change and biodiversity decline. So we are asking how the Bill
and planning reform in general help to mitigate those risks, help us to
deliver a low-carbon economy and help the natural environment. We think
that, in its present state, the Bill fails to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000007">&#160;</a>

Spiers:</strong>
                           </em> Hello, I am Shaun Spiers from the Campaign to
Protect Rural England. The CPRE, through its 43 county branches, 200
district groups and 2,000 parish council members, is the largest
third-party participant in the planning system. We have been calling
for a decentralisation of the planning system for some time and for a
system that will really involve local people in developing and
protecting their areas, so we welcome the main thrust of the Bill. We
very much hope that it will result in a comprehensible and credible
local and neighbourhood planning system in which people will really
want to get involved, so there are some questions about the simplicity
of the system that is being developed. As members of the Wildlife and
Countryside Link, we are also concerned about the connection between
local means and national aims, including environmental aims and the
protection of landscape and biodiversity.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000008">&#160;</a>

Worsley:</strong>
                           </em> I am William Worsley, and I am president of
the Country Land and Business Association. The CLA represents the
businesses that form the bedrock of the rural economy. We support the
pro-growth thinking behind the Bill, which has the potential to develop
much-needed economic growth in the countryside. We also support the
concept of giving local people more say over their neighbourhoods.
However, we are concerned that the Bill may impact on rural businesses.
We are also very disappointed that the presumption in favour of
sustainable development has not been included in the Bill. We would

concerned with neighbourhood planning. We now seek to ensure that it is
workable at local level and achieves the right balance between
empowering communities and maintaining the integrity of strategic local
planning policies. Two areas on which we seek potential changes are a
specific aspect of the use of referendums and an extension of the in
perpetuity rules on affordable housing to the community, either through
the community right to build or through neighbourhood

issue from the environmental perspective. Essentially, we feel that the
proposed duty to co-operate is a weak duty—it seems to be little
more than a duty to discuss with neighbouring authorities. It is also
very much focused on strategic infrastructure, but not necessarily on a
wider range of environmental issues that you would need to do
strategically. I think that the Bill and planning reform place a great
emphasis on the voluntary nature of strategic planning, and
there are many good examples of where that happens. Our 
concern is that, where there are contentious policy issues to resolve,
there is no clear mechanism for trying to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000012">&#160;</a>

given it a framework is the south-east regional plan. It is very
difficult to see, in the absence of a plan

concerned that the means of achieving larger than local planning
appears to be the local enterprise partnerships. The relationship
between the Bill and the LEPs will become very important, because LEPs
are business led, and the social, economic and environmental partners
are, by and large, excluded from them. The LEPs have an overwhelming
growth focus, so if they deliver sub-regional planning, there will be
environmental concerns. All environmental groups, including the CPRE,
are looking forward very much to the publication of the natural
environment White Paper—the first environmental White Paper for
20 years—but it is questionable how one protects the natural
environment and achieves landscape-scale conservation through LEPs that
are overwhelmingly business focused, so I share Simon’s concerns

are really important for the relationship between local authorities and
communities. We all recognise that strategic policies need to exist,
otherwise a bottom-up process cannot build into something meaningful.
But I would rather these things were done through a form of
co-operation than an adversarial relationship between communities and
local government. One of the successes of community-led planning has
been the development of protocols between local government and
communities to govern who does what and what it is allowable to put in
a plan. We regard neighbourhood planning as putting that on a more
statutory basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000016">&#160;</a>

development orders and the community right to build. There is the
potential for the system set out in the Bill to become rather confusing
and cumbersome and not to achieve what I know is the Bill’s, and
our, objective, which is to get local people involved in planning their
neighbourhoods and to ensure that they really think that the planning
system is something they can engage with, rather than something that is
imposed on them. We think, as the Government think, that if you involve
local people in planning their area, they will support appropriate
developments, but it is important that the system is comprehensible and
reasonably straightforward. There are some detailed concerns about the
relationship between the three elements, as we set out in our paper. I
could go into those, but we think they are not as clear as they might

communities, of course, we have a given set of democratic spatial
boundaries, as well as, in most areas, parish and town councils that
have a holistic responsibility for their wider areas. We are a member,
as well as the secretariat, of the Rural Coalition group of
organisations led by Lord Matthew Taylor. We, too, are concerned that
the mechanisms are not brought into disrepute in urban areas by the
failure to have clear-cut designations of areas, forums and democratic
responsibilities. That is a difficulty. In our view, it will probably
be rural communities that race ahead with this agenda, if it proves
appropriate for them to do so, while urban areas will still be working
out their mechanisms for the early stages for areas, boundaries and
forums.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000020">&#160;</a>

have just done a village plan in the village in which I live. It was
not difficult, and it has been tremendous in getting the community
working together. The knock-on effect of the work that has been done by
everybody has reinvigorated the village. We now have a village market
and all kinds of other things that have come off the back of this. The
benefit is very good, but it is very important that these village plans

key. The question is: what do you need to produce a high-quality plan
that has elements of sustainable development on economic, environmental
and social issues? It turns out to be community capacity building, and
challenging a community—saying “You cannot have
everything; you cannot support four facilities when we have enough
money in the community to support only one, and you need to prioritise
issues that will make this village more sustainable in the long
run.” That is not a technical planning matter; it is building
the capacity of the community to take hard decisions. That is what
community-led planning is about, but it is the non-statutory end. We
seek the transfer of that into the statutory planning system. We were
making headway on that some four or five years ago, until the
requirement for sustainability appraisals in local development
frameworks came about, which made it too technical to

planning system that is credible within neighbourhoods—one that
they think it is worth while engaging with—it is absolutely
necessary for the integrity of the system to have a very limited right
of appeal, where developments are approved outside the plan by the
local authority. At the moment there is a system in which, as we saw in
Sheringham in Norfolk, big developers can come in and lose umpteen
times but still bludgeon the local authority and exhaust it into
approving planning permission. I hope that we can work with the

parish councillor in a growth area, and having used the planning system
for more than 30 years, I resent being counted as a third party in any
appeal system. We have a difficult situation when local planning
authorities are held to ransom by big developers on the basis that they
cannot afford to fight an appeal. Perhaps the solution is to address
what is allowed to go to a planning inspector, rather than who has the
right to appeal. I understand that in other countries the
third party right of appeal is a very expensive
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000037">&#160;</a>

it. We believe that it infringes on people’s property rights.
There is a lack of clarity, and we would like much greater clarity on
this, but it potentially prevents owners from selling at a time of
their choosing, and to a person of their choosing. There may be tax
implications. There are no Government assurances on that, so we would
like some clarity. There is no definition of an asset of community
value. There is a right of review, but the grounds are not clear. There
is a provision for compensation, but again that is not clear, and there
is no entitlement as of right. We are really concerned that this will
potentially act as a disincentive for landowners to provide facilities
that local communities may need and want.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000040">&#160;</a>

an absolute example from my own experience. I live in a very pretty
village in north Yorkshire—we are very proud of it and we love
it dearly—and the local community was desperate to have a
playground. They

			Column number: 129<a class="bkMark" name="Column129">&#160;</a>
                           </div>approached me, as the person who owns most of the land around the
village, and asked if I could help. In fact, I was far more involved
than that; it was not just an approach. We work well together as a
community. I provided a little bit of land on the edge of the village.
It is actually a really important piece of land to me, and the one
thing I would not want to do is lose that piece of land. I gave it to
the community on a long lease at a peppercorn rent, and we have a very
nice playground, with which the community is very pleased.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000041">&#160;</a>

are lots of other examples of things that we have done in the village
that we live in, and of things that other landowners have done. I would
hate to see that sort of thing stopped, because people were frightened
of creating an asset that could then be removed from them. I think it
is a serious potential infringement of people’s property rights.
I know that there is a focus here on pubs and village shops, but there
is already an ability in the planning system to deal with those issues.

                           </em> I think that is very important. The issue
with most rural businesses, and we are talking not only about farming,
but all kinds of other businesses, is that they tend to be small. The
difficulty is having the time and resource—if you are running a
small business you may be employing two, three or four
people—really to engage with a potentially cumbersome structure
into which you have to enter, and business people do not really have
the time, the resource or the expertise to do that. If you are a big
business, you have that sort of resource, but small businesses find it
much more difficult.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000044">&#160;</a>

important that the Bill focuses on true sustainability, which is about
employment, housing and the environment in which we live and that we
enjoy. It is terribly important that these plans are not so complex as
to not engage with local businesses. They are the bedrock; if we are
looking at sustainability, actually having people living in, working in
and enjoying villages is really important. Villages should not be
allowed to become just dormitories for the local town. We think that is
really, really important. It is very important that this is taken into
account. I have some examples of where the Localism Bill is already
being used as a means of frustrating potential development. There is an
agricultural building in the east midlands that the local authority is
using this against. It is really important, because not all development
is something that everybody is going to like.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000045">&#160;</a>

definition of sustainable development—a strengthened duty for

in favour of sustainable development. It is not quite clear to us how

important. It seems to us that the real issues are

applied to the planning system and, in particular, that that should

reaffirmation in the Bill of the notion that sustainable development,
within environmental limits, is the aim of planning; that is what it is
about. Some organisations wanted a presumption in favour of sustainable
development almost as an incentive for local authorities to produce
plans, and, of course, there is a problem with many local authorities
not having produced plans. We certainly do not think, however, that
those areas should be punished by a simple presumption in favour of
development, which is what some of the development bodies have in mind
when they talk about sustainable development. I am not sure that they
are talking about sustainable development as we would understand

can act early, moving something forward. This question is particularly
for Mr Worsley. There is protection, if you like, for landowners in
clauses 74 and 76, and the compensation referred to in clause 82 is not
dissimilar to a compulsory purchase order. Bearing that in mind, what,
without affecting a community’s ability to have control of its
environment, which is what localism is really about, would give
landowners the certainty and security that they are looking for, so
that they still feel part of this, and not victimised in the way that

was a mix of landowners there, large and small, from all over the
country, with regional representatives. This has been debated at a
number of meetings in different parts of England, and there is real
concern about this aspect—more than about anything else. Where
there is a necessity, there already are compulsory purchase powers, so
we do not believe that this is necessary. If it was clearly defined as
relating to very small areas that are not very significant, that would
remove the fear. People look to what is happening north of the border
in Scotland and the right to buy there. There was an example of that
involving Lord Attenborough in the papers at the weekend. There is a
real fear about this. It is the fear of removing people’s

                           </em> You are trying to pit us against each other,
but I am sure that William’s concerns can be met. The purpose
here is, again, to give communities a stake in their areas. As I
understand the wording of the Bill, it should not give rise to those
fears, but it is entirely right that communities should be able to call
for a pause and consider whether they can take over a community
asset—or, indeed, a green space—if it is in danger of
being sold off. We look forward to having a definition of that. If this
is about giving communities a stake in their areas, this is one
important way of doing it, hopefully without giving rise to some of the
problems that you are concerned
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000061">&#160;</a>

this, because the asset’s value depends on what kind of asset it
is, and what part it plays in the community.

                           </div>At the moment, it is a clear one-size-fits-all approach, if it is an
asset of community value. We are particularly concerned about assets
that are being lost because it is considered uneconomic to keep them
going under their current use. Under those circumstances, those cases
should have some kind of higher priority, when it comes to being
retained, than others that are just part of a wish list within the
community. We are talking about losing the possibility of retaining
assets of community value because the shop is uneconomical, or because
the pub is going to be knocked down. But that is a key part of the
proposals, and it should not be watered down. The issue for us is that
the time taken by a community to mount a case is probably longer than
people’s estimate of what is reasonable from the owner’s
point of view. Assets of community value that are named in a
community-led or neighbourhood plan should have a higher level of
protection than something that is simply put on a
list.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000062">&#160;</a>

Our understanding—you may well have already had discussions with
officials and others on this—is that this will appear in the
national planning policy framework. It is very difficult for us to
legislate in a number of areas covered by the Bill without
understanding what that interpretation of sustainable development will
be. Do you share those concerns? In particular, Mr Spiers, can you tell
us again, absolutely clearly, what you would like to see in that code
for sustainable
development?<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000069">&#160;</a>

planning is to deliver sustainable development, which was well defined
in the previous Government’s sustainable development strategy. I
understand that that is still in place, and that planning policy
statement 1 has a certain amount of standing now in planning practice.

neighbourhood plans. That means that a neighbourhood plan can be a
single-issue item. From the point of view of sustainable development,
who knows what the long-term implications of a particular issue might
be? I think that is a big mistake. When we as a network support
community-led planning, it has to adhere to some sense of quality
standards or kitemarks. That requires a community to consider options
and the long-term impact. It might not be the same as a regulatory
framework, but I can tell you it works.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000073">&#160;</a>

neighbourhoods, which can have anything from 3,000 to 5,000 people. In

defined village, it is very clear what the neighbourhood is. The
problem areas are where you do not have a parish, although you might
have a village meeting, and that could be defined as a neighbourhood. I
think it could be extended to where you have areas of land in
ownership—for example, to an estate or something like that. That
could be part of creating a plan—working with the people who
live in that “neighbourhood”. It is difficult to define
it very clearly, but you are absolutely right: in your part of the
world, you are talking about very significant numbers of people,
whereas in rural areas, you can be talking about villages of 200 or
300 people, and that might be quite a large
village.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000075">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Good afternoon. I am Trudi Elliott, the
chief exec of the Royal Town Planning Institute.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We support
the principles behind the Localism Bill. We are very keen to work with
the Government and others to make the new system work, but there are
several areas where we think improvements could be made to ensure that
the objectives are met. We particularly support the concept of a
national planning policy framework, which is something for which we
have long argued, but we think it needs to be on the face of the Bill.
We have got views on the characteristics of that document, but clearly
we have not seen it yet and we will make recommendations about
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We welcome
the strengthening role for local development frameworks in the Bill. We
do, however, still have concerns about strategic
planning—planning above the local level. We think the solution
to that is to strengthen the provisions in the Bill on the duty to
co-operate. Again, we will be making recommendations on that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are very
supportive of the neighbourhood planning principle, but we think the
proposals in the Bill are over-complex. We have a number of suggestions
and ideas about how the system, as proposed, can be made less
complicated and easier to use. The objective has got to be to join up
the system from bottom to top and to make clear to everybody the
relationship between neighbourhood, local, greater-than-local and
national planning.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We clearly
were very disappointed about the ending of funding for Planning Aid,
but we are working very hard to secure the future of that service, and
we are happy to share with partners from that work what works in terms
of community and neighbourhood
planning.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000091">&#160;</a>

Warner:</strong>
                           </em> Good afternoon. My name is Andrew Warner. I
am the chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors
planning and environment policy panel. We are already liaising with
Ministers, so I am a so-called friendly face to some in this
room.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
RICS certainly accepts the idea of localism. It is an important sea
change in planning and one that is well overdue. The
over-centralisation of previous Governments did not achieve very much,
apart from the potential for revolution, ultimately. Careful attention
will clearly need to be paid to the detail of the national planning
policy framework, when it comes out, and that is going to be as
important as the Bill. As Bob Neill just said, if too much definition
is included in the Bill, that provides a strangle later, so you want to
be far more flexible. In the expanded document that I understand it
will be, the NPPF is going to be the major force for planning and will
set out the guidelines. A lot of queries will be answered when that is
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
think that there needs to be better concentration on the inclusion of
business and business rate payers in neighbourhood planning, because
very often the business is the core of the village. We believe, for
example, that neighbourhood plans could sometimes be for a business
park. It would have no residents involved at all, but permitted
development rights could be achieved by way of a neighbourhood plan,
which would allow the people within that park to redevelop or expand as
they wish without the control of bureaucracy.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000094">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
need to concentrate on the idea of land assembly. If neighbourhood
plans are going to put forward coherent development policies, there
will often 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 136<a class="bkMark" name="Column136">&#160;</a>
                           </div>be a need to assemble land, and that will require a compulsory purchase
order and the use by local authorities of those
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
problem at the moment with the Bill, and the whole agenda, is the lack
of explanation of what it means. I think a lot of council members
originally thought that the local authority that they worked for would
have no role to play in the system, and that the neighbourhood would,
as it were, supplant them. There is a need for better education and a
clearer explanation of exactly what is proposed. That would involve the
education of planning officers and, more importantly, members of local
authorities about what their new roles will be and how they should best
engage with the
locals.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
we have a slight concern about community assets, the idea of listing
and the moratorium, which could well delay development and could put
one’s ability to sell one’s own property at
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000097">&#160;</a>

Tapper:</strong>
                           </em> Good afternoon. I am Stephen Tapper,
president of the Planning Officers Society and assistant director at
the London borough of Enfield. Like the others, my society broadly
welcomes the Bill and the underlying objectives of connecting people
with planning. We have drifted apart, because planning has become a
very opaque process for the public. They do not understand how
decisions are made or the issues. We agree that if the public could be
more involved in plan making, they would have greater understanding and
more control. They would understand the development management planning
application process that much better. We believe that good plan making
makes better planning applications, and I think that most developers
would also take that
view.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000098">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
we do have reservations about the way the Bill is presented,
particularly around strategic planning. We understand the reasons why
the regional tier was taken away—the top-down approach, the lack
of democratic accountability and so on are serious issues. However, in
a world in which we are very concerned about putting adequate
infrastructure in place to support development and growth and to ensure
that development is truly sustainable, it is very important that
communities and councillors work together to create a strategy that is
meaningful at the local level. You will get good neighbourhood plans
and good master plans only if they have that solid strategic context,
so we urge you to look hard at how strategic planning will work in the
future. We suggest that there is a need to give greater teeth to the
duty to co-operate—we have some ideas about how that could be
done—and also perhaps to encourage, although not necessarily
insist upon, more formal joint arrangements between councils, which
work very well elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
neighbourhood development plans, we have ideas about how we might
create a better bond or a greater partnership between local planning
authorities and neighbourhoods. There is a relationship in the Bill,
but it tends to be one in which the local authority is, if you like,
accrediting processes. We think that there is a role for ward members
and councillors to get closer to communities and to help them with
their neighbourhood planning, to help them to strengthen the team that
does that work, and again, to help to get better ownership of the
process within communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000100">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My final
point at this stage is about the relationship with the existing local
development framework—neighbourhood planning sits alongside
that. If there is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 137<a class="bkMark" name="Column137">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to be a better public understanding of the whole system, we see a need
for further refinement to the LDF process to make it simpler and easier
to use, and to ensure that planning is a bit lighter on its feet in
addressing the issues of the day.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000101">&#160;</a>

Ellis:</strong>
                           </em> My name is Dr Hugh Ellis, and I am chief
planner for the Town and Country Planning Association. The TCPA has
spent 110 years campaigning for garden cities, for great homes for
ordinary people, for sustainable development and, more importantly, for
inclusion and fairness in planning processes, with people at the heart
of them.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our concerns
broadly fall into two categories. The great task for planning over the
past 30 years has been to make it legitimate and fair, and we have
applied a fairness and effectiveness test to the Localism Bill. On
effectiveness, we still struggle with the issue that colleagues have
raised in relation to strategic planning. It is a simple point: by
removing strategic planning, we do not remove the issues that play out
at a strategic scale, such as climate change, housing and retail
needs—all sorts of things. We have to find a really effective
way of making that work. We have moved beyond regional planning now,
but the issues still remain.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Neighbourhood
planning and fairness are probably where we think our greatest concerns
lie. We have to make local-level governance and planning work properly.
Our judgment is that the neighbourhood planning described in the Bill
is not in any way wrong. It is interesting, but it does about 10% of
the job that we need to do to reconnect communities with planning. That
is because the neighbourhood planning process in rural areas seems a
positive suggestion—although it is complicated—but in
urban areas, outside parished areas, neighbourhood planning raises a
whole series of questions that we are struggling hard to answer. That
said, we are trying to be as constructive as we can because,
ultimately, planning has to be about planning for people, which is our
key objective.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000104">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We have a good set of issues to start with.
Perhaps the witnesses can enlarge on some things they have said,
particularly the role of councils and councillors, which is
interesting, and about getting closer to communities. Dr Ellis says
that the Bill only does 10% of the job, that we have to make
neighbourhood planning work, and that there are questions about urban
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am sure
that, across the room, we share the desire to empower communities to
take on this role. However, the context for a lot of authorities, which
is that they are facing 27% of cuts over the next year, has not been
raised much this week. I wonder if you could perhaps comment on the
reality of where that resource will come from in councils for all these
new people who will get out there and empower communities. My local
council is struggling to find £47 million of cuts so, in
reality, where will that resource come from? If it is a new function
and there is a lot of work to be done, as Dr Ellis says, how
will that happen?<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000106">&#160;</a>

Ellis:</strong>
                           </em> Applying the test from our experience of
25 years in community planning, the problem is simply that
although the Government—I recognise their difficulty—want
a powerful outcome for community planning, if you have a legally
defined development plan outcome for community planning, it inevitably 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 138<a class="bkMark" name="Column138">&#160;</a>
                           </div>creates a process that is very complex and expensive. If I presented to
my community a bill of anything more than £50 to deliver a
community plan, people would raise their eyebrows and say, “We
might spend that money elsewhere.”<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My point is:
how can we create this framework? Where communities want to take this
route, fine, and where they can resource it, fine, but there is a whole
series of other non-statutory outcomes—community empowerment and
visioning in communities—that the planning system needs to
recognise. Where in the Localism Bill are those outputs recognised and
properly valued? In all my community planning experience, the output of
the process is usually two pages of A4—it is a vision. People
say, “We don’t want gated communities. We’d quite
like some public transport.” In the current framework, all that
vast and important material is nowhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I think that
that can be fixed, but the real test is resources. I cannot see how
these things will operate in an effective manner in the vast majority
of communities without direct resources being paid to them. I am not
talking about resources being paid to local government to deal with its
administrative tasks, or about general resources being given to
organisations to provide planning advice, but about direct resources to
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000109">&#160;</a>

Tapper:</strong>
                           </em> Just picking up that point, resources are a
significant issue. What we have proposed in our response is that there
should be some mechanism for councils, working with their communities,
to resolve priorities. In my borough in London, for example, we have
many very deprived wards, and we are already doing a lot of
master-planning work with communities. It is not quite in this form,
because the communities are not absolutely in control—I am not
sure a lot of them would want to be—but we do support them and
we do a lot of consultation, and these communities very much influence
the outcome of the
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those
are very expensive processes. They can take around 12 to 18 months. As
well as using staff in the council—perhaps the equivalent of two
full-time workers throughout the period—we have to employer
master planners, urban designers, traffic consultants and the like. You
are talking about £130,000 to £150,000 for a community of
about 10,000. Even then, that is not a very detailed set of proposals
for the whole place—one focuses on key issues. We have spent up
to £250,000, or something of that order. These are places that
need that master-planning work, not only because they are very deprived
communities, which need to see change and investment, but because they
are part of our growth area, so there is a wider benefit to creating
more homes and more jobs for more people.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000111">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">How does that
sit as a priority alongside the neighbourhood planning proposals, which
could come from other parts of the borough that we would not
necessarily regard as having the same need? We want to accommodate such
things, but within a programme that is properly funded. We have a
suggested that a device called a community planning statement is
produced each year, through which the council attempts to resolve these
conflicts and come up with a programme of work that is funded and that
takes all these needs into account. Indeed, it could replace certain
existing requirements in the local development framework to provide a
project-planned statement on community involvement. A number of things
could be rolled into that device.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000112">&#160;</a>

added complexity at a time of resource constraint, so one of our key
objectives is working together to simplify the proposals in the Bill
and existing provisions. We think it is very important that, at a time
of difficult choices, local authorities do not take too much resource
from other functions, particularly LDFs, because we have to get full
coverage of those plans across the country as that is one way to reduce
the resource that we will need to spend subsequently on neighbourhood
planning.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000113">&#160;</a>

to know that we have produced a good-practice guide on public
engagement in development schemes, based on our experience as a

Warner:</strong>
                           </em> I would like to think that, with the
reduction in conflict between locals and their local authorities, some
resources might well be freed up. If there is better and fuller
engagement of the local authority with neighbourhoods, things will be
more smoothly approved, rather than there being years and years of
local planning inquiries and so on. A huge amount of staff resource is
wasted on that sort of conflict, so hopefully the process will free up
some resources.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000115">&#160;</a>

also be—again, this is going to be good practice—the use
of developers actually to fund or pay for, or whatever, this sort of
neighbourhood plan, not on the basis of the developer deciding that
this is what he wants to do, but with the concept and culture change of
better engagement and working with communities. I certainly know that
clients of mine have accepted that there needs to be a shift and that
they will not just be going to the locals a week before they put the
planning application in as a sort of rote. They are physically saying,
“This is what we think you would like. We have eight different
examples. What do you think?” In a case that I am involved in,
all eight scenarios have been chucked out of the window. There is now a
ninth and a 10th. We suspect that, at the moment, we have 2,000 people
supporting what is, in fact, a fairly substantial

working very effectively together in sub-regions, and the one I usually
cite is the Tees Valley. However, the lesson there is that there was a
strong motivational factor behind it.
Councils—councillors—do not give up their powers easily
to joint committees and the like. At the time, there was a desire for
unitary status, so they had to show that they could work together on
strategic planning and transportation and they put in place the joint
arrangements. They have found that very beneficial. The arrangements
are still there. They deal with economic developments and regeneration.
They have a lot in common in that regard. It is finding those
commonalities that is really important, as well as some practical ways
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000124">&#160;</a>

climate change and renewable energy, and all sorts of forms of

a tough one, and I do not really like to represent it because it is
unpopular: will the sum total of 350 individual local authority
decisions on carbon deliver the effective action we need on climate
change—or on housing or on retail development? There must be a
mechanism that resolves those issues. I am worried about our default
position, if this does not work out on a voluntary basis. Therefore, it
is about trying to find a mechanism that strikes the right balance
between proper local considerations and those issues that we need to

reasons that they gave were that they felt confusion over the primacy
within the Bill of the different tiers of planning. They felt that the
transition period between the existing system and any potential new

plans to produce housing, I do not think that you will ever meet your
housing targets, but I do not think that is what is proposed. All you
are doing is adding another tier where the locals can be in control of
their own environment. There is not going to be a complete embargo on
local authority plans or, indeed, on developers promoting development.
I think that is where, maybe, the education or understanding is
lacking. It is not just neighbourhoods and nothing else. The whole
existing planning tier, apart from the strategic level, is still in
place and will keep
going.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000130">&#160;</a>

because they will set the parameters for housing growth and they have
to take into account the housing market assessment—the housing
needs within the area. That begs the issue of whether the area can
extend to a wider region or sub-region if councils can work together,
but as long as that requirement is in place, the core strategies will
set targets for housing. My understanding is that neighbourhood plans
will be required to respect that in the same way that the
councils’ own area action plans will deliver the numbers on the
ground.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000131">&#160;</a>

getting from A to B. We know that confusion and transition can slow
things down, so there is an onus on us all to get clarity early and, in
particular, to encourage local authorities to press on with their work

what has happened with the abolition—or the pending

have gone into complete hibernation with a “rabbit in the
headlights” approach. They are saying “Gosh, what do I do
now? No one is telling me what to do,” and they are doing
nothing—or a lot are. Once they understand that fact that the
local authority tier remains and still has a role to play, they will

years ago. The easy way to have a fight, if you want one, is to go into
any pub and try to get people to decide where one village finishes and
the next starts. Dr Ellis mentioned the issue of “easy in rural

Ellis:</strong>
                           </em> It is the greatest concern, because it is very
difficult to see how the neighbourhood forum in urban areas passes the
test of individuals being democratically accountable, or being placed
under any requirement to disclose particular interests that might be
driving their issues. That means that there is a particular danger that
the process is open to abuse. It means that in rural areas, at least,
there is a lower form of local government at work, and that seems like
a sensible unit. In urban areas, I really think that has to
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Planning
suffers from a lack of legitimacy. The nightmare scenario is three
people standing together as a neighbourhood forum in an urban area and
taking on considerable powers. Looking at the detail of the schedules,
I am conscious of two things: that local government, having once
approved them, cannot dissolve them; and that as non-public bodies,
none of the equalities duties would apply to them, the climate duty
would not apply to them, and the sustainable development duty would not
apply to them. All of that is applied retrospectively by checks that
local government carries out at the end of the process. I very much
hope that that is one of the key areas that we can work with Government
to improve. As it stands, it will cause very significant conflict and
not yield great results, in terms of legitimacy.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000150">&#160;</a>

                           </em> That is why I think it is essential to see
this process as a partnership between the planning authority and the
neighbourhood, and to ensure that they are mutually supportive. In
terms of the boundaries, we are looking at creating a neighbourhood
forum for planning purposes that is partly based on a hard-pressed
estate where there is a residents’ association and a real
commonality, in terms of what the issues are, combined with some
surrounding traditional streets where the church has a major part to
play. That narrows the focus to quite a small area where we know there
should be common interests, and I think that might work as a
neighbourhood planning
boundary.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000151">&#160;</a>

needs to be done, and that neighbourhood forums need to have duties to

last word on what an area is. What you do not want is the gated
community having its own neighbourhood forum, and the council block of
flats next door being excluded from it. The local authority is going to
have to say, “No, that is not a sensible planning unit. It
should encompass that area.” Similarly, we have worries about
the low level. Three people cannot be representative of the

                           </strong> Earlier, Dr Ellis referred to the two principles
historically at the heart of the planning system—the importance
of fairness and effectiveness. On effectiveness, you have made it clear
that we need to address in Committee the issue of the duty to
co-operate, with particular regard to strategic planning. That point is
well
taken.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000154">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the issue of fairness, however, it is important that any system works
not just for the powerful, but for the powerless. You have identified
significant issues of legitimacy and accountability. Indeed, Mr Tapper
and Mr Warner, you made the point about the importance of elected 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 144<a class="bkMark" name="Column144">&#160;</a>
                           </div>representatives being able to mediate between competing interests.
Moreover, a crucial point was made earlier in relation to
capacity—for example, there is Planning Aid and the build
environment support that has, historically, been very important. Do you
share the fear expressed by many that, unless those issues are
addressed properly, the outcome in five and 10 years’ time will
be a new system that institutionalises
inequality?<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000155">&#160;</a>

Ellis:</strong>
                           </em> I think that is a very significant risk. The
planning system is already open and can be dominated by loud voices. It
is a complicated system, and it is more than often dominated by those
with the greatest resources. The absolute task that we have had in
planning, which the planning community should have addressed—in
all honesty, it has not properly done so—is the legitimacy of
those voices not normally represented in it. I have seen, many times in
my planning career, the outcome of that process, which is bad
neighbourhood development focused in particular areas in which voices
are quieter.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
absolutely central—this is why I think there should be a purpose
to planning under the Bill—that we enable a system that is fair
and open to everyone. If we are interested in that, I think, as I hope
I have said clearly, that the neighbourhood planning system represents
a small part of that task. None of it is wrong, but we have to think
about how lots of other communities—multiple communities in
urban areas will want to have a voice in this system—can be
represented. That in no way derails the objective of the Localism
Bill—it actually, I think, meets that overarching
test—but as the Bill is drafted, the real risk is that those
communities with significant amounts of money to spend will develop
fine-grain environmental policy—and good for them; that is
great, but what will those other communities do? The ultimate test in
my area is who wants the incinerator and who wants the landfill site.
Ultimately, all those things have been focused—there are
statistics to back this up—in particular areas of poverty. That
is the task that we have to overcome in planning
reform.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000157">&#160;</a>

                           </em> What we have seen through Planning Aid is
that all sorts of communities can do this, and do it very well, but
they need support. We have a network of nearly 1,300
volunteers—qualified planners and lawyers—throughout the
country who are giving that advice. It is absolutely critical at the
introduction of a new system that that support and advice is there,
whoever provides it. We hope that we will be providing at least some of
it as we go forward. You cannot expect communities, no matter how
passionate they are about what they want for their place, to do it
without professional advice and support, and without capacity building
in a wider sense. Moreover, the duty is on us to make the system
simpler.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000158">&#160;</a>

to enforce, and I am not sure how one would do it. The Bill needs to be

assessment; councils would have to produce something between them that
identifies the key cross-boundary issues, on infrastructure
requirements, for example, which they would have to absorb into their
core strategies and planning processes—in other words, an output
that means they have to work together on policy, rather than simply
exchanging ideas and information without it going

resources and skills that we do not have at the moment. Community
development skills will be the biggest issue for planners, but we need
direct resources to help such communities disproportionately through

                           </em> My primary message today is that we very
much welcome the Bill, or certainly its principles. There are some
aspects of the mechanics that perhaps need a bit of fine tuning, but
our general approach is one of very serious support for the principles
behind it. It is fair to say that we have been banging on for years
about the importance of restoring community engagement. It seemed to
us, and to me in particular, that people locally very often feel a loss
of the sense of ownership of what is going on in their communities, so
we have been arguing for greater localism.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000183">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
pleased that in recent years, the principles of localism have been
agreed across all the parties. Everybody is in favour of localism. The
big society is a welcome initiative by the present Government, and the
Bill, of course, is the legislative process for it. We are delighted, I
have to say, with the key new powers for our member councils: the
general competence, particularly the powers on planning; the right to
bid; the right to build, and so on.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000184">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our councils
cover most of England, but 35% of the population. What we
hope—we are encouraged by the Government’s line on
this—is that as communities are empowered, more of our councils
will take place at local level. A final point is that our councils are,
of course, very accountable, because they are directly and entirely
funded by their communities. There is no Government support.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000185">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Like John, we
welcome the general thrust of the Bill. We think it is helpful; we do
not see it as a Bill just about transferring powers to local
government, we see it as also being about the community’s
engagement. That is our principal interest and focus.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
three or four areas where we have an interest and are very supportive.
The first relates to the right to challenge, which we think gives
voluntary and community organisations opportunities to engage local
government in a discussion about the best way of configuring services,
and to provide some of those services themselves as community
organisations. There are one or two areas of detail, which we may go
into later, where we need to think about issues in relation to the
right to challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We also
approve of asset transfer and think that it can be very useful. It
needs a bit of a kick-start; asset transfer has been around for a
while, but the Bill gives the opportunity to ensure that voluntary and
community groups can become involved in that. They obviously need the
skills and finances to do it—and, possibly, first refusal. We
like the idea of local referendums, with one or two caveats in relation
to the protection of minorities. The general power of competence is
also something of which we approve.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In general,
we approve of the main thrust of the Bill and its main components, as
far as voluntary organisations are concerned. Like John, we have some
points of detail that we would like clarified, particularly with regard
to
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000190">&#160;</a>

Stephen Bubb:</strong>
                           </em> I am head of the Association of Chief
Executives of Voluntary Organisations, which is the charity and social
enterprise leaders’ body. I think that the Bill could be
historic, if it really does mark a decentralisation of power to local
councils and, importantly, to local people, communities and third
sector organisations. If that happens, this is an incredibly important
Bill. That is why the right to challenge and the right to buy are so
important. We strongly support those rights, and we hope that Ministers
will resist the blandishments of local authorities that we should not
have terribly enforceable guidelines and trust them. Although we work
in partnership with local authorities, we also know that we will need
those rights entrenched if community organisations and charities are to
exercise their ability to deliver more cost-effective and
citizen-focused
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to see the guidelines drawn widely in terms of the services that
we could challenge. There is a really interesting opportunity for you
in those guidelines to look at partnership working between other parts
of the statutory sector, such as the health service and Jobcentre Plus,
which I know is something you are looking at. If it encourages national
organisations to work with local organisations and private sector
partnerships, that would be an excellent way
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000192">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With
commissioning, which will be covered by the guidelines, we need to
follow what I describe as the papal encyclical criteria on
subsidiarity: that something is done at the most appropriate level. If
you need to commission nationally or regionally, you should do so. Not
everything can be commissioned locally. That brings me to a point about
communities. People talk very lazily and romantically about
communities, and often in terms of place and neighbourhood, but they
forget that communities are also communities of interest, whether that
is the Somali community in London, for example, or communities around
the homeless, people with mental health problems or people with autism.
Those are people we represent. Neighbourhoods are not always friendly
places for them and there have to be clear protections. One of our
roles is to support, defend and promote that
cause.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have two final points, the first of which is about the asset lock. We
are very keen on the right to buy, but there has to be recognition that
much of the local authority role of running parks, libraries and other
facilities has come through charitable bequests, foundations and
donations, or that those facilities are actually owned by charitable
trusts and run by local authorities. I am afraid that there have been
some cases of local authorities, for example, flogging off pictures to
make money. In one particular case, a district council flogged off a
house that belonged to a charitable trust. There is a temptation, given
the significant cuts that they are all making, to look at libraries and
parks that are there because people donated money and made
philanthropic gifts. Having an asset lock so that they do not pass into
the private sector is incredibly important. I am making that point,
because some of our members are disturbed about what is happening with
the Forestry Commission, and I do not want to see that happening
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally—although
this is not a matter for the Bill—our concern around what is
happening on local authority expenditure means that we will have to
look at localism

and communications at the National Association for Voluntary and

community organisations, offering them support and development
services. Quite often, we are the arbiter of and mediator in the

                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the opportunities for the Bill is the development of the
relationship between local elected members and their communities. One
of the problems of the past has been councillors tending to get stuck
in the town hall. There have been various attempts to try and change
that, and this presents a real opportunity to elicit some real change
in that
relationship.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
of our concerns with the right to challenge, which we really do
welcome, is how it actually plays out. Stephen touched on the
commissioning issue, and we would agree that you need to find an
appropriate level at which a service needs to be delivered, which will
quite often be the local level. What concerns us is that whatever level
you choose, it should not be to the detriment of the local community,
and the local voluntary and community action that is already going on.
We would be very keen to explore ways in which, if we are looking at
national providers from any sector, they would be encouraged to work
with local communities and local community organisations for the
benefit of those local communities. Associated with that, we have to
think clearly about how we can ensure greater equality of access to the
discussion about how services might be reconfigured for the benefit of
local communities. There are a lot of articulate people out there who
know how to get in touch with their local council and how to make the
case for their particular community. One of our concerns, however, is
how we ensure that those who feel a little less confident about
challenging public officials also have access to that kind of
discussion.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000198">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
final point on the right to challenge is that it has to achieve both
value for money—we accept that, particularly in these hard
times—and a wider social benefit. In other words, what are we
doing to encourage preventive early intervention services that actually
have a much wider benefit to the community and also to the taxpayer, in
terms of reducing expenditure on acute
services?<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000199">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
final point is that we also strongly support the right to buy. We are
really interested in notions of transferring more community assets to
the local community. There are, however, some real challenges around
that, and particularly with the community’s capacity to take on
what we think is the scale of assets that many public bodies are trying
to get rid of at the moment, because of the financial constraints that
they
face.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000200">&#160;</a>

previous set of witnesses. There is an issue about community rights
needing to benefit local communities and not being

                           </div>used to their detriment. There is even discussion that the Bill must aim
to reduce inequality, which is not stated. There is a particular
concern about disadvantaged communities’ access to powers, which
we discussed on planning, but is also important in terms of community
empowerment. Could we touch on those things? You emphasised the
importance of access to advice and guidance, but the context is that
local authorities, which might be looked to for its provision, are
facing cuts of 27% over the next four years, so will they have the
resources? Where will it come from?<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000201">&#160;</a>

                           </em> On the point about engaging the most
vulnerable groups in the discussion about the right to challenge and
enabling them to influence services, local authorities certainly have
to work harder. I do not think that that necessarily costs more money,
but they have to work a lot harder with community organisations and to
encourage organisations such as our members to feel able to put forward
the concerns of the most vulnerable and under-represented groups in the
community. Local authorities must ensure that they question why they
are not hearing those voices. It is not necessarily a case of spending
lots of money. This goes back to local councillors, who have a role in
questioning why the voices of the most vulnerable members of the
community—older people, the young and excluded, and minority
communities—are not heard when decisions are being considered.
Councillors should know that those communities are out there, as they
will be in any particular local authority area. Councillors have the
role of questioning that situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000203">&#160;</a>

announced that they are shedding as much as a fifth of their staff. You
have great expertise in community development, so do you think that
when 20% of the work force has been shed, councils will necessarily
have the expertise in community development that your organisations
have? I doubt it. If you had to look at which jobs to keep, would you
protect that resource? It has to be there in planning and community
empowerment.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000204">&#160;</a>

would say there is an important partnership role between local councils
and a growing third sector, but I very much doubt whether the staff
have to be in local councils. Representing disadvantaged communities is
one of our sector’s historical roles. If local authorities are
thinking about how they support community organisations, it does not
mean that community development workers have to be sitting in a town
hall.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000205">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">How
some of the cuts are being implemented is disadvantageous to our
organisations but, overall, local authorities do not think enough about
how they use third sector organisations in the delivery of their
services. Third sector organisations can deliver services more
cost-effectively, and often in a way that is closer to citizens and
communities. Mental health charities and those working with the old and
the young are often far better at delivering services. If councils
thought about their strategic role, rather than that they have to
employ staff to perform tasks, we could make real progress.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000206">&#160;</a>

that in the formal public service of local government, you need
strategic functions and very local community functions. What is
happening at the moment across the board with this Bill and the other
measures around it will enable that to happen a lot more. What is
happening is the liberation of communities to deliver in the best
possible way locally. That might be through formal
structures—town and parish councils can provide statutory and
volunteering support—but there are also loads of people in the
community. It is about voluntary organisations, but it is also about
engaging people from within the community. There is a huge wealth of
talent in communities. If you are lucky enough to have an area where
people can come together, it can work very well. It needs a great deal
more liberation to bring those people out and to help to deliver such
functions, and that is the framework we need to be using when looking
at
this.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000207">&#160;</a>

call an interesting argument with the previous panel around a duty of
democracy for local authorities and how, effectively, that could be
eroded with where we are going. I was going to put this question to Mr
Findlay, but after what has just been said, the other witnesses might
wish to comment.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are two
points: first, from my experience as a councillor over 10 or 11 years,
“democracy” is an interesting word to use in the current
system. I remember that planning applications were approved although we
did not want to approve them—we had to, because we knew that
otherwise we would lose on appeal. Other decisions were made but then
lost on appeal, so democracy did not have too much of a say in terms of
community views. With the new ideas moving forward on local councils,
predetermination changes, neighbourhood plans, and community
involvement, would you say that democracy, in that sense, and community
involvement in it will be improved?<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000210">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">From that
comes my second question, which is to any member of the panel, about
community involvement: would you agree with some evidence we heard on
Tuesday that with the community being more involved and feeling more
part of the process, we might get more homes built—there has
been very poor housing build over the past 10 years—and better
planning results?<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000211">&#160;</a>

Findlay:</strong>
                           </em> Yes, absolutely. Planning is a huge issue in
every community for all sorts of reasons—good and bad—and
it really possesses people. Historically, and even today, if you talk
about a local planning decision to the man or woman on the street, or
in the local pub or shop, they feel strongly that they do not have any
control, and that the decision is taken by somebody else—it
might be at a district council level or, in the past, at a regional
level, or even at a national level. Often, the community has a strong
sense that somebody else makes the decisions. With the right checks and
balances to make sure that we do not have any crazy things going
on—and it looks to me that those checks

                           </div>and balances are in the Bill—I think that devolving the powers

housing estate or the new Tesco will be.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000212">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Particularly
on your second point, because that power has been devolved, it will
reinvigorate the institutions of that community, whether that is the
formal parish council or town council, civic society, or whatever it
may be. It will trigger people to get more involved because the power
is there, so we are very positive. If you give people power, they
become more active.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000213">&#160;</a>

Findlay:</strong>
                           </em> Yes. Housing development is a typical issue
to help to explain this. People hated it when they were told by an
anonymous body further up the system, as they saw it, that 5,000 houses
were suddenly going to be built in their bit of wherever. I have
strongly believed for a long time that if you actually say to
communities, “Look, you need a bit more housing for economic
regeneration,” or, “You need a bit more social housing
for people in the area who perhaps cannot afford it and so are moving
out, which is driving the local economy down,” people understand
that locally. You get a bit of nimbyism sometimes but, in my
experience, people understand. If they have control over that decision
and they can say, “Okay, we will build five or 10 houses in this
small village,” or if they have the same sort of operation in an
urban neighbourhood—especially if there is some reward for the
community—they will do it, and they will do it much more
happily, because it is their decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000215">&#160;</a>

Stuart Etherington:</strong>
                           </em> Just picking up on that, there is
clearly a relationship between what might be termed
“representative democracy” and “participant
democracy.” Our organisations tend to be on the participative
side. Plenty of evidence shows that public policy decision making is
enriched by the engagement of representatives such as yourselves,
elected councillors, or organisations that may be closer to the issues
and intimately involved in local communities. I think it improves that
relationship. How you engage in those discussions, including around
housing, is important, because some mechanisms can be quite crude. The
referendums are built into this. The referendum is a useful tool, but
it raises the issue that minority groups might be discriminated against
because of the outcome. Referendums have their place, but people have
been most successful in engaging with decision making where more
deliberative mechanisms have been developed. I am a great fan of
participative budgeting, in which community groups and local citizens
are involved in mechanisms that allow them to deliberate and understand
how priorities are made. It is important, as civil society
organisations and citizens’ groups are involved in this, that
they have the opportunity to deliberate with public policy makers. That
will be quite crucial in improving the quality of the decisions that
are made.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000216">&#160;</a>

say. We are, of course, very committed to the highest possible
standards in local government, including in our own councils. When the
code was first introduced, there was a lot of press coverage to say
that there was outrage in the parish councils about these absurd new
rules. That was not really quite true; there was some outrage, but it
was not as great as that. Most of our councils welcomed the idea that
they were subject to a code, but it was more on the basis that at least
it was the same that the principal authorities—the counties,
districts and boroughs—were treated to.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000218">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We are
actually having a debate at the moment, so I cannot give you a firm
position, but we have two alternatives. Given that the code is going
and Standards for England has gone, one alternative is to go down the
road of a voluntary national code, so we would in some way devise a
national code and make it available to our member councils to adopt if
they wish. The other alternative is to go for the radical approach by
saying that the principles can remain the same and our councillors must
abide by those principles—declarations of interest; and you must
not be corrupt and you will be reported to the police if you
are—and leave that to open discussion. We are having a debate
with our members at the moment over whether they want a national
voluntary code or whether we leave it so that there is no national
voluntary code.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000219">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The problem
here is that every council will make up its own mind. The choices that
are available here do not seem quite right to us, because the options
are: have no code at all; have some voluntary code that we have written
for them; keep the old code—the Standards Board code—or
write their very own local code. It is a bit of a mess, to be quite
honest, and it needs clearing up. I cannot give you a formal policy
position from NALC at this stage, because we are still discussing it,
but it needs to be resolved.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000220">&#160;</a>

much better with the power of general competence.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000222">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The classic
case is that the council, whether it is a town council or a small rural
community, wants to build a small business park. Perhaps a village
wants to build a four-unit business park. Under present arrangements,
it does not really have the power to do that. With the power of general
competence, it can set up the company to develop and deliver it. There

                           </div>other things, such as donations to schools and local meals on wheels. It
is crazy that communities cannot make those payments because they have
restricted powers at the moment. We are very pleased with the power of
general competence; we have been pressing for it for a long time. The
big issue, which may be addressed by regulation rather than being in
the Bill, is which councils have the power of general
competence.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000223">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">At the
moment, I think it is proposed that there will be a fairly simple
threshold about democratic accountability that a council would have to
meet to exercise the power of general competence. If the Government
want a threshold, we will run with that. Our view is that it would be
right and radical to give the power of general competence to all town
and parish councils. One of your leading colleagues said to me the
other day, “If they mess up, they mess up, and they will pay the
price, electorally or whatever.” It is important for our sector
to say that if there is to be a power of general competence, it should
be made generally available, as it is for all other local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000224">&#160;</a>

surprised by how definitive you have been. You said that this Bill
“will” liberate communities, that they
“will” engage, that the Bill “will” restore
a sense of ownership and that if you give people power, they
“will” do it. Is there not a risk that if you give people
power, they will not do it—in terms of frustrating initiative
for the vulnerable, which has already been referred to. Secondly, how
do you address the concerns expressed to us, in a substantial body of
evidence, that the Bill as it stands runs the risk of giving more power
to the powerful at the expense of the
powerless?<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000225">&#160;</a>

“will” with “we hope”. My judgment is that
if the Bill goes through Parliament and is implemented in the right
way—the devil is in the detail, I agree—through
regulation and direction from the Government, and the participation of
people at local level and principal authorities, it will deliver the
sort of changes we want to see. I am sure that everybody round this
table wants to see those changes. It is better to have the Bill
providing the framework within which that can happen than not have the
Bill. There is always a danger when you push things down to the local
level that particular groups in a community with a single issue can
drive local control. In my experience, with our councils, the more
active they have become, the greater the direct local control. Instead
of a decision being made somewhere else, the local community can
decide, and that seems very
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000228">&#160;</a>

inequality is involving communities and giving people more power.
Putting things down to local level creates more power. I appreciate the
point you are making, but I think those problems exist already. Within
our local government structures at present, there are very affluent
areas where it is not only the council that is better off; in
particular, the community is better off, too. They exert perhaps
greater power than other communities, and I do not see how resisting
the shift to localism is, in some way, increasing that
inequality.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000234">&#160;</a>

Stuart Etherington:</strong>
                           </em> The capacity-building issue is
important, and I will give you an example. This was not a challenge
issue; it was an asset issue. Earlier this month, I visited a project
in Redruth, which is in a very deprived area of west Cornwall with very
high levels of unemployment. There, you have a hub for community
organisations to come together. It was not transferred from local
government, but local government was heavily involved. There was a
fantastic voluntary sector leader, who had engaged with her local
community and identified the need for this resource. There were two
important things, however. One was that somebody had the capacity and
the skills to make it happen and to engage deprived communities, and
the second was that it was
funded.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the asset issue, it is important that we build the leadership of
community and voluntary organisations, which is why the work of
Stephen’s organisation is so desperately important, but the
project was ultimately funded because Cornwall is still an objective 1
area, and European regional development fund money was made available.
I commend that project to anybody on the Committee. Go and have a look
at what a local community can do when it has the skilled resource and
the finances available. There is some fantastic stuff going on. It
does, however, need a level of capacity building locally.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000236">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">More deprived
communities tend to have greater capacity-building needs, simply
because they do not have the intrinsic density of charities and
voluntary organisations that other communities have. I remember, way
back, when there were a lot of deprived mining communities after the
mines closed, and there was no capacity in those communities to draw in
resources from elsewhere, because British Coal had provided all the
services. The then National Lottery Charities Board spent quite a lot
of time building capacity in those areas, so that they could make
lottery bids. You need, therefore, to have something in place that
encourages people to engage. These powers are great, and we very
strongly approve of them, but alongside them, you have to have the
capacity in communities, particularly deprived communities, to make
adequate use of the powers that are being made
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000237">&#160;</a>

extent of the community work going on in their areas? The reason I ask
is that you cannot engage unless you know. In my former local
authority, where I was a councillor, we carried out an exercise and
discovered that the value of the local voluntary work in one town was
some £27 million a year, if I remember that correctly, at a time
when 1% on council tax was £700,000, and it is true to say that
everyone who was involved in that exercise was

an onus on us to do some of that. You are right; local authorities are
not as aware of the strength, role and extent of the centre. They often
relate to local organisations only, and forget the work of national
organisations and the wide range of national charities that could be
working locally. We need to do a bit of that, and I suspect that one of
the effects of the Bill, in the way that it is driving powers down,
will be that many organisations start thinking about how they engage
with local authorities. It is a two-way thing, and we have to accept

risk, but I never think that risk is wrong. The purpose of risk
analysis is to understand the risk, not necessarily to try to negate
it. Perhaps we have become too risk-averse in the United Kingdom and,
actually, we need to take a few more risks. I think—this is
important—it is incumbent on organisations, whether they are
community organisations or local authorities, to have a realistic
understanding of the risks that they face, so that they know what they
are facing, rather than saying, “We must try to drive out any
element of risk.” You have to take a few more

to a more localist agenda, it does not mean that you take all the
decisions on a separate, local, nimby-ish basis. We now have lots of
experience, especially in

                           </div>areas where district councils have disappeared, of situations where a
town council is surrounded by a number of parishes. For an awful lot of
service delivery—but also, I suspect, on these sorts of
planning-with-a-small-“p” issues—you could get
those communities coming together, albeit on a voluntary basis, to say,
“How will we address this problem? There is this housing
demand”, or whatever it is, “and we can’t deliver
it all in the town; we want some of it to be in the surrounding areas.
Let’s sit down together.” I really do feel that if you
give communities that power, they become more
responsible.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000249">&#160;</a>

always taken the view that you need a strategic overview to make such
decisions. You certainly do need a strategic overview at national level
and regional or county level, or something like that, but when it comes
down to specific housing provision within a town and its surrounding
area, an awful lot more can be done to allow the communities to work
out how best to do it. We have not tried it before, really—there
have been a couple of pilots—but it may prove to be a better
system than what we have at

example is the Alt valley community enterprise, which has been
supported through large investment. It is a very deprived community,

very different from this end of the table. We have learned a lot from
the evidence sessions, and it is clear that whatever we think of the
Bill, it will be historic. It will lead to lots of things being done
very differently from how they have been done in the past. My
view—you would expect me to say this—is that this is a
major constitutional change that not only shifts power to local
government, although it does that in spades, but puts a requirement on
local government to transfer some of their powers to communities. It is
a constitutional Bill. I congratulate Members on being on the Bill
Committee, because there was huge competition to be on it, on both
sides, I hope—almost more than there was to be selected as a
parliamentary candidate in some constituencies. They are the lucky

positive overall, because the Bill very much fits into their
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000267">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We have heard
concerns about the community empowerment measures and whether they will
mainly benefit people who are powerful enough. Many concerns have come
out about planning—not only in the planning sessions but in many
others—and particularly about the lack of links between this
very new system of neighbourhood planning and national planning, and
about the need for strategic planning. We have also heard concerns
about changes to social housing tenure. Those concerns remain very real
because of the impact that they could have in increasing homelessness
and reducing aspiration. We also understand that the head of the civil
service called for a review on the possible impact of the Bill on
democratic accountability. Some of our witnesses also talked about
democratic accountability, and questioned the notion that a
neighbourhood forum of three who were given powers and resources could
ever be considered representative.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000268">&#160;</a>

strong impression that this Bill was not ready. Parts of it have had
very little consultation. In fact, I think that the community
empowerment section has not had any scrutiny whatever; that was
admitted in the note from the Department. To start with, as we have to
spend our time on this for the next five weeks, I want to ask whether
the Bill was not ready, and whether perhaps there has been a rush to
get it out there. Is that why there are 126 order-making powers for the
Secretary of State? I think there is still very real alarm, which will
be expressed over the next few weeks, about all of that, because those
details could and should have been put in the Bill. Was it not ready,
or is it really the centralism Bill, as one of our witnesses called it
on

Barbara’s question. If I do not cover it all, she can follow it
up with further questions to my colleagues. I think there is a degree
of agreement, not only among the different witnesses we have seen but,
leaving party labels aside, among members of the Committee, that
aspects of the present system are not working.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000271">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To take
planning, we heard in the property section from Liz Peace and Adrian
Penfold the suggestion that the problem with the present system is that
there is not enough incentive for people to accept development and
there is not enough community involvement, so it needs change. We heard
from the witnesses we have just interviewed that when it comes to the
rights of community groups against councils that may not be as
progressive as others, this is not quite right. The system is broken
and there is a recognition that this is an historic opportunity to
change it.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000272">&#160;</a>

whenever you change anything, the very act of change will make some
people, especially those of a cautious disposition, concerned about how
they will re-educate themselves and change their practice. We have seen
a bit of that, and between now and the provisions taking effect it is
important for us all to 
<div class="columnNumber">

                        <p class="tabbed">In
terms of timing, it is a Bill—as you heard from some of the
witnesses we have just seen, especially the representative from NALC,
it would be wrong in some ways for us to claim the credit for
it—that has been campaigned for by community groups and by local
government, if you take the general power of competence, for many
years. Both as a Government and as a Committee we are the midwives of a
policy that has been battled for, argued for and campaigned for,
frankly, for more than a generation. It is absolutely right to put this
at the beginning of a new legislative Session. If it were later in the

we made—given that this was prominent in both parties’

optimistic view, which I can understand. However, in many of the
sessions we have had this week, very negative concerns have been
expressed about bringing chaos to the planning system, and getting to
situation where we are not building the homes that we want and causing
levels of homelessness. The difficult environment in communities and
local government means that there are not the resources to do the
necessary things. There are themes that have come across again and
again in all the sessions. I had the impression sometimes that they
were surprisingly negative and very strongly expressed by witnesses. We
have just had the most positive session this week, but I hope you have
heard some of the others. If there amendments from our side are not
accepted or are not introduced by yours, there are problems,
particularly with the planning and housing sections of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000277">&#160;</a>

were the exceptions—with municipalism riding again

reform and the fact that we need to empower people who are

is perfectly reasonable to discuss aspects, whether in guidance or by

First, a lot of the areas where people raise issues about uncertainty
relate to the planning policy. It

			Column number: 161<a class="bkMark" name="Column161">&#160;</a>
                           </div>is worth remembering, as we all do, that historically that has been the
case since 1948. A huge amount of planning policy in this country is
not in primary legislation, but in guidance or secondary legislation.
The coalition agreement made it clear that at the same time as we were
bringing in a Bill to deal with the primary legislation, we were going
to set forward reforms that we have been talking about in the context
of the national planning policy framework.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000280">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Therefore,
there has been a tendency for some witnesses to think that the primary
legislation is the whole picture—and, of course, it is not. You
will know from your experience, Barbara, that we have had previous
planning Bills—I served on the 2008 Bill Committee and was aware
of what happened in the local democracy Bill. There were lots of
Government amendments. My judgment is that this Bill is in a good state
of readiness.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000281">&#160;</a>

Barbara, in the Greater Manchester area, will know that the local
authorities there have a good record of co-operation. The LEPs are
another example of that. The duty to co-operate is very important and
it is absolutely right to recognise, as I think came out during the
evidence, that the Bill does not actually provide for what some people
perhaps thought it would, which is that neighbourhoods would have
unfettered, unchecked determination of everything to do with planning.
That is in the context of a planning system where the larger-than-local
is dealt with at a larger-than-local level—and that is true not
only of neighbourhoods to their local authority, but of local
authorities. It is very important to emphasise the importance of that
degree of co-operation, which is one of the Bill’s crucial
aspects.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000286">&#160;</a>

picture of housing output during the period leading up to the

addition to the dwelling stock over the period from 2000-01 to last
year. Do the figures indicate that, in the period from 2001-02,
up until the advent of the recession—in other words,
2007-08—there was a continuous increasing trend, with about a
10,000 to 15,000 increase each year in the net addition to the housing
stock? By 2007-08, which was the end of that trend, was the figure of
207,000 additions to the housing stock that year not the largest for
almost 20 years? How do you reconcile that with your claim that the
previous system was incapable of generating enough new

what has happened in house building during the past decade. If the
height of our ambition is to get back to the miserable levels of four
or five years ago, compared with the contribution that we need to make

significant, although you might regard that small uptick as
significant. Again, the Government’s ambition is beyond that: we
want to have a permanent increase in house building. Of course you need
to get used to change, but we are talking narrowly about the planning
changes. We have the reforms to the new homes bonus and to the
community infrastructure levy, and we have the new national planning
policy framework, all of which are about growth. The test for all of
those policies is their contribution to sustainable growth, which is
the filter through which they have been
chosen.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000300">&#160;</a>

that figure came at a time of an unsustainable house price bubble,
which was driving the market, and a macro-economic situation that was
just about to pop, too. The Bill is not capable of reversing those two
effects. That is part of the Government’s wider policy on
financial stability and reform. The Bill is about ensuring that where
development is possible we get the buy-in of local communities, so that
it matches the wishes and needs of local communities. That is the
crucial element of the Bill; the macro-economic issue is not being
tackled with this
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000301">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> One of the things that we have heard from a number
of witnesses both on Tuesday and today is an excited and positive
reaction to the decentralisation and the empowerment, whether it is for
local councils through the increase in determination, councils
themselves through the power of competence or communities on the
planning side. Is one of the benefits of the Bill that, not only will
there be more community involvement in housing, but communities and
people will feel more involved in the whole process, across all areas?
We might improve democracy by improving turnout at elections, because
councils are more empowered to do what people think they are elected to
do, and,

better equality, and we could improve equality through communities and

that if you want a strong input from people, you need to give them the
opportunities to believe that their vote matters. Every member of the
Committee has stood on doorsteps on which the voter, or at least the
elector, tells you it is not worth it, it does not make a difference
and so on. If it does make a difference, if you are voting on your
neighbourhood plan, which will affect your community for the next
generation, you will be much more engaged with what it says and what it
is about. I dare say again that most members of the Committee probably
got involved in politics when they were stirred up by an issue. That is
how you get into it. Bringing those decisions back locally and making
those votes matter at local level will be a powerful recruiting
sergeant for the political and democratic
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000303">&#160;</a>

capacity building, but it also does one other thing. Some of the
business representatives gave evidence about the importance of engaging
business. In a small way, we make a start on that with the revisions to
business rates, particularly the power to give a discount on business
rates. If you link that to our broader reforms of local government
resources and finance, we are creating an incentive once more for local
authorities to engage more systematically with their business
communities, and, in the long term, to have a stake in them, by
discounting the business rate to make themselves attractive when
drawing businesses to the area, for example. That is important for
getting the balance between the business community, the broader
community and the local
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000304">&#160;</a>

I want to return to house building, because as we know, the lack of
homes for people in this country is an issue. A lot of evidence that we
have heard, both here and in the Chamber, is that homelessness is going
to get worse through some of these changes. On Tuesday, when the house
builders said that it was going to be seven or eight years before we
returned to 2007 levels of building, they also all said that they were
very concerned about the transitional planning arrangements between the
system that we have now and the system moving forward. They thought
that the proposals would make house building slower, and that it would
take a year or two longer to get back to 2007 levels than if we
remained with the current system. What do the Ministers think about
that aspect of the transitional arrangements? Is there anything that
they are concerned about or anything that they can think of that might

extending rights to communities, it is absolutely crucial that people
take them up, and it is right that we recognise that. The first thing,
however, is that there is a danger that we patronise communities and
assume that they are not capable or not interested in taking up rights.
My experience, and that of some of the witnesses, is that there is a
degree of appetite and volition. It is important that communities
should not be cut out of the system; they should be able to exercise
that right. If you compare it with the present system, it was striking
that one of the earlier witnesses talked about the need to employ a
barrister. If you need to employ a barrister to engage with the
planning system, things are on the wrong level. We need to make these
things more open and more available.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000316">&#160;</a>

housing associations—certainly many of them—operate in
areas of deprivation and areas where there are social difficulties. If
we had taken this view all those years ago and said that we should not
create such mutual, not-for-profit, locally based organisations because
they were specialising in those areas and a more uniform national
approach was needed, we would never have achieved the success that is
there. The best housing associations, in my experience, are fantastic
at finding ways to empower their tenants to engage with their
communities. You are right, Jack, that we need to ensure that that
support is available, and I am determined that we should do so. Let us

to co-operate is incredibly powerful. I think it is more powerful in
terms of having genuine co-operation with neighbouring authorities who
have something in common, rather than the previous regime that
shoehorned them into a particular definition. In my area, for example,
if you take the Thames estuary, you had Essex in one government region;
you had Kent, in my county, in another; and Greater London was in
another. That made strategic planning very difficult. Through the duty
to co-operate you have more natural economic geography that can assert
itself. Plans will be tested against whether they have demonstrated the
degree of co-operation that is necessary, so you have a more relevant
and more live opportunity for

the moment is pro-growth and it would be pro-development. We need to
help communicate that and to be clear that this duty to co-operate is
very important and captures the need, which I think everyone
recognises, for a larger-than-local element. I do not want to
exaggerate the importance of this at all, because it is a seismic
change. The notion that strategic planning can be addressed by people
recognising, and being required to recognise, what they have in common,
rather than its being contracted out to an administrative process and a
standing administrative body, is a fundamental change. I think there
was some recognition of the desirability of that because no one was
suggesting that we retain the regional

should be ambitious for the process we are designing. We want a shift
from a planning system based on development control, in which every
application gets bogged down into an often acrimonious dispute, because
either the planning committee passes it or, if it is turned down, it
goes to appeal to the inspectorate in Bristol, and we all know how
unpopular it is when people from outside the community come in and
determine such things. That is the wrong approach, and it involves
barristers—with due respect to members of that profession,

am determined to get back to a plan-based system. That is more
empowering for communities—to go back to the points that Jack
made—as they get the chance to reflect their ambitions for their
community in a plan. The key things are that, first, they should be
able to do that, and secondly, the plan should prevail. It should not
be capable of being lightly set aside. The proposals allow that to
happen, and if we do it, it would be paradoxical to have a right of
appeal, because, in effect, the community designed the plan and had the
opportunity to express, and did express, everything they wanted in it.
If planning permission is granted on the basis of conformity with those
wishes, appealing against it would be appealing against the permission
that they themselves granted through the plan. There would be a case
for that if we were keeping the status quo, which is unsatisfactory for
community participation, but if we want to reboot the system to make
communities powerful from the outset, then it is
irrelevant.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000329">&#160;</a>

people and local communities, which is at the heart of the intention of
the Bill. What puzzles me is the centralising aspect of it. Why does
the Secretary of State take 142 powers to him or herself in the Bill?
Why does the Secretary of State say to 12 cities, “You must have
a referendum on an elected mayor”? Why are our communities not
allowed to have the same powers as an elected mayor for a different
form of governance? Why does the Secretary of State take the power to
impose and appoint shadow mayors in 12 of our cities? I think it is a
centralising power too far. It seems to interfere with the rights of
local communities and disempower them. I am very concerned about the
142 powers and the dictatorial aspects of the Bill. They
seem to go completely against its intention, which, like every witness,
I
welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000330">&#160;</a>

perhaps Andrew will address the mayoral point. It should be obvious to
everyone that I believe in localism. I would not want a secret way of
centralising power. That is not why I am in this job or in this
business. We should go through each of the 142 powers in Committee, and
if the Committee persuades me that they are irrelevant, we can come to
that view. Let me give some examples. There are four around the general
power of competence. One is to give power by order to the Secretary of
State, with the consent of Parliament, to amend, repeal, revoke or
disapply statutory provisions that limit the use of the general power.
So, on your list of draconian powers that the Secretary of State has is
a power to spot those aspects of other legislation impeding
councils’ ability to operate, by reference to Parliament. It is
not how it first appears.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000331">&#160;</a>

through each of them. There is another, for example, that says that if
the local authority is about to go bust and needs to increase its
council tax by a certain level beyond the threshold, the Secretary of
State, with Parliament’s consent, is able to set aside a
referendum. That seems sensible. We can go through them one by one, and
you have my word that I do not intend this to be centralising, other
than where that is a necessary condition to empower. Andrew can talk

their absolute effectiveness in giving the big cities around Europe and
across the world a higher profile, greater economic success and a real
focus for activity. I guess the example that is most often quoted is
Barcelona, but there are plenty of others. But we are not actually
imposing mayors on the 12 cities. We are saying that the electors in
the 12 cities should have the opportunity to take a formal decision
about whether they want to have a mayor, with the referendum ballot
coming in May next year, and if the electors in the city approve, a
formal election of a mayor in May 2013. So even in that case, we are
certainly not imposing that on
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11012765000333">&#160;</a>

Predetermination is important and it is worth setting in context why.
One reason that people feel alienated in some aspects from the
democratic process—planning is an obvious aspect but not the
only one; it applies to licensing as well—is a sense that their
elected representatives aren’t able to articulate their views
and concerns. The predetermination rule is a concept that has grown
under common law—judge-made law—over a period of time. It
has got to the stage where you can have a council

that ward, and because it involves a planning application, the council
candidates can’t give the electors their view on it.

recognising that you must ensure that abuse of a position is prevented,
