Edward Leigh</b> (Gainsborough) (Con): I beg to move amendment

No. 349, in clause 61, page 42, leave out line

29.</div><a name="06051023000010"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000484"></a>The

Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss

amendment No. 439, in clause 61, page 43, leave out lines 15 to

24.</div><a name="06051023000011"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000485"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> We now come to an important clause, which spells

out at some length&#151;it is significant that it does so&#151;what

the national curriculum in schools in England and Wales should

contain.</div> <a name="06051023000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">When Keith

Joseph was Secretary of State for Education, he opposed the

introduction of a national curriculum, and it was only when his

successor came into office that one was adopted. Later, speaking in the

House of Lords, he reluctantly accepted that a national curriculum

might be useful in certain core subjects, such as maths and English,

which would be taught anyway. However, he worried that such a

curriculum would become a maximum and exclude some useful subjects. I

have tabled an amendment about certain academic subjects, which we

shall reach later. Those who originally introduced the national

curriculum, however, could not have imagined that we would get into

such detail or that it would be necessary to impose such obligations on

schools.</div> <a name="06051023000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is well

known that I am opposed to the imposition of the national curriculum,

which has resulted in more and more initiative, authority and power

being taken from schools. Schools are perfectly capable of providing

subjects in a professional and proper way, and parents ultimately have

the choice of whether to send their children to particular schools.

However, we are not debating those issues in any detail, although the

groups of amendments before us could constitute a clause stand part

debate.</div> <a name="06051023000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,

the clause spells out what the national curriculum means for schools.

It sets out which subjects it will be compulsory for all pupils to take

and, therefore, for all schools to provide. Those are the so-called

foundation subjects, which we will have an opportunity to discuss. The

clause also sets out which 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column723" />Column number: 724</div>subjects pupils are entitled to expect to be provided and from which

they may choose&#151;the so-called entitlement subjects. Obviously,

there is a large number of amendments on all those issues, but I shall

start with amendment No. 349, which is in my name.</div>

<a name="06051023000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause says that the

national curriculum should include and therefore impose

&#147;work-related learning&#148;. The amendment is an attempt to

force the Government to tell us what that phrase means, although I am,

unfortunately, pretty confident that the amendment will not be

accepted. Under the clause, the national curriculum requires all pupils

of 14 to 16 years of age in state schools to study all the foundation

subjects, and if we are to have a national curriculum, there need be no

controversy about that. Those subjects include maths, English and

science&#151;there is little debate about those&#151;as well as IT,

physical education and citizenship, although the latter is perhaps

pushing the boundaries, and we can no doubt tease out from the

Under-Secretary what it means. There is a list of entitlement subjects,

from which pupils can chose, and work-related learning, which is what

the amendment is about.</div>

<a name="06051023000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will stand corrected if I am

wrong, and one purpose of the amendment is to find this out, but as I

understand it, work-related learning will not be optional, but

compulsory for all 14 to 16-year-old pupils once the Bill becomes an

Act of Parliament. That is nonsensical. I do not quite know what

work-related learning means, although I can guess, but I do not know

why such a non-academic subject should be compulsory for schools. I am

not saying that it should not be an option, or that it would not be the

right the course of action for many pupils for some or even all of the

time, but making it compulsory seems to be a step too

far.</div>

<a name="06051023000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051023000486"></a><b class="B">Anne

Snelgrove</b> (South Swindon) (Lab): Is the hon. Gentleman

aware that work-related learning was introduced to the education system

in this country in the 1980s by Sir Keith Joseph, when he modelled the

technical and vocational education initiative on the organisation of

rehabilitation and training in France and Germany? He was very taken

with that and thought that it would be good thing for UK schools. I

wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would agree with

him.</div><a name="06051023000018"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000487"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I always agree with Sir Keith Joseph on everything,

because he is one of my heroes, not least because he wrote a pamphlet

that said that the market was not enough. He was not the caricature of

a libertarian that he is made out to be. He was a caring and able man

who cared deeply about education. Without being privy to all the

debates that took place at that time, I am sure that he was convinced

that practical, work-related learning&#151;perhaps on the German

model, which I believe he much admired&#151;was a suitable course for

many pupils. I imagine that he would have felt that to force all pupils

into an academic straitjacket was not the right course of

action.</div><a name="06051023000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot

believe for a moment, however, that if Sir Keith were here

with us&#151;perhaps his spirit is still hovering in the

room&#151;he would impose compulsory work-related learning on all

pupils, particularly highly academic children. Even the modestly

academic child 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column724" />Column number: 725</div>will surely need all available school time to cover the hard subjects as

much as possible. Those are the difficult subjects that he has to go

through the academic grind of getting to grips with&#151;English,

maths, sciences, languages and so on.</div>

<a name="06051023000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such a pupil will have plenty

of opportunities later to get into the world of work; but school is the

one opportunity that he will have at a relatively young age to spend as

much school time as possible on those subjects. I am not suggesting

compulsion, but I do not want the opposite to happen, not least because

they are difficult and much harder to get to grips with later, but

because those subjects&#151;geography, history and other traditional

subjects&#151;give pupils a sense of time and place, some knowledge

of their history and culture. We all know that those subjects are

important and valuable, which is presumably why they are core

subjects.</div><a name="06051023000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The pupil

will presumably go on to A-levels and, I hope, to university. He might

do some work-related experience in the lower sixth, which is fair

enough by me&#151;it is an increasing trend, although I am a bit

dubious about it. I pester my friends to take on my children to do

work-related experience and they pester me for theirs to follow me. The

trouble with having people on work-related experience is that one is

supposed to be working all the time in front of them, not staring out

of the window or sitting in the Tea Room. That sort of thing can be a

bit of bind, and I do not know what my hon. Friend the Member for South

Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) would do, as he spends most of his

time in the Tea Room. What would somebody on work-related experience

gain from following him? Perhaps serving behind the counter in the Tea

Room would be the most useful thing to do.</div>

<a name="06051023000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051023000488"></a><b class="B">Mr.

John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): My hon.

Friend knows that I certainly do not limit my taking of tea to the

Commons Tea Room. I take tea in many places. I spend a great deal of

time in this Committee and the rest of my time guiding him on the path

of

righteousness.</div><a name="06051023000023"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000489"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I have made my point. I have no argument with

work-related experience as a useful thing. It is an increasingly

fashionable way of proceeding and I imagine that I shall take on

someone. I was stopped in my village last week by a constituent and

told, &#147;Please take on somebody to help you out&#148;. Of

course they can come&#151;they will follow me around after they have

taken their AS-levels. I can understand that: they have taken their

AS-levels and they want to have a week relaxing in the House of

Commons. Fair enough, I shall take them on. However, I am not quite

sure what it means to make work-related experience compulsory for those

preparing for their GCSEs and AS-levels or for even younger

children.</div><a name="06051023000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not

opposed to work-related teaching, which is very valuable to people who

perhaps are not of an academic bent and who want to go into a useful

trade as a plumber or a bricklayer; the country is short of people with

those skills. However, I am against imposing it on all academic

children. Work-related experience&#151;whatever that means&#151;or

work-related learning, to use the language of the Bill, should be an

option; it should not be compulsory for every

child.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column725" />Column number: 726</div><a name="06051023000025"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000490"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to say a word

about my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment and about the subject

generally. I have a passion for vocational education, which the

Ministers and other members of the Committee share, and I believe that

work experience for young people can play a vital part in their

education.</div> <a name="06051023000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Contrary

to my hon. Friend&#146;s scathing and unreasonable attack on me, I

have done many things in my time in Parliament, including

shepherding&#151;if that is the right word&#151;a number of young

people on work experience, one of whom is starting with me next week,

spending two weeks working in my constituency office and in my office

in Westminster. I invite my hon. Friend to share that kind of

experience, which is both valuable for the young person concerned and

good for us, too. We learn from it

ourselves.</div><a name="06051023000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

experience of work can play an important part in children&#146;s

education. I am supported in that view not just by members of the

Committee&#151;as though that were not enough&#151;but by others. A

survey for Edge&#151;the campaign for practical learning&#151;found

that approximately two-thirds of employers believe that schools do not

equip young people with vital practical skills; four out of five

employers believe that schools should place more emphasis on teaching

the literacy, numeracy and practical skills that young people will need

for work; and when recruiting a 16 or 17-year-old, GCSE grades are seen

as important by employers, but so are practical learning achievements

and experience such as job-based training and work

placements.</div><a name="06051023000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Employers

are saying clearly that it is important that people are equipped with

those core skills, which are vital for their role in employment and in

wider society. Some experience of the workplace is also useful in

providing young people with the rounded education that we all seek for

them. The amendment would inhibit that valuable process and I would not

want to be party to

that.</div><a name="06051023000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must broaden

our view of education. We live in a world where education is seen

principally as a literary matter, but in fact it is also about the work

that people do with their hands and other, &#147;soft&#148; skills

such as their ability to relate to others. In short, it is about making

the best of their many talents, which may extend beyond the literary. I

urge my hon. Friend not to close the door on that broader view of

education which can provide important chances for many young people who

might not thrive in a narrower, academic environment.</div>

<a name="06051023000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fundamentally disagree with

my hon. Friend on the matter. It is unusual for us to have a

fundamental disagreement as we are from the same mould politically, but

there are differences of nuance, which are perhaps explained by my

greater sensitivity to the needs of those who are most

vulnerable.</div> <a name="06051023000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.

Friend is a noble figure, a great parliamentarian and a learned man who

has made a great contribution to the House and to this Committee. I

invite him to draw on his Christian spirit and ask himself how the

people who benefit from the educational opportunities that I briefly

described would feel about his amendment. I suspect that they would

feel as I do.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000491"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> My hon. Friend is making an excellent speech. Were

I arguing that work-related experience had no place in schools, I would

accept his points. However, all that I am saying is that it should not

be compulsory for all pupils. Why should it not be an option for every

pupil?</div><a name="06051023000033"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000492"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The Under-Secretary will, no doubt, enlighten us as

to the Government&#146;s position on that. This is not my Bill. I

have some sympathy with certain aspects of it, as I have made clear

throughout the Committee, but it is certainly not for me to defend it;

that is the Under-Secretary&#146;s job and I should not want to

second-guess what he might say. In my judgment, we have a long way to

go before we reach saturation point in respect of those who might

benefit from the kind of experience that I have described.</div>

<a name="06051023000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know from employer surveys,

from our own study of schools, and from Ofsted and others that many

young people do not get opportunities for practical, on-the-job

training and work experience. I am not worried that there is too much

of it; if anything, I am worried that there is too little. Were we to

be subsumed by a sea of work experience&#151;to feel that

children&#146;s education was being interrupted by unnecessary

experiences of that kind&#151;my hon. Friend might have a point.

However, I think that we are at the beginning of a journey in that

respect and that we need to accelerate our progress on that journey

rather than stalling it as my hon. Friend would seek to do. I have no

doubt that he and I will agree on other amendments.</div>

<a name="06051023000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that we are also

considering amendment No. 439, to which my hon. Friend did not speak

with any great enthusiasm. That relates to the same subject, so I

cannot add anything useful and I understand why my hon. Friend did not

speak at length. We wait to hear what the Under-Secretary says, but we

are not inclined to grasp with relish my hon. Friend&#146;s

suggestions, although I know that he makes them in the spirit that has

imbued this Committee&#151;one of seeking to tease out, to probe and

to discover precisely what the Government&#146;s intentions

are.</div>

<a name="06051023000036"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000493"></a>The

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Phil

Hope):</b> As we begin to consider the important part of the

Bill, which concerns the future of the curriculum, let me quote the

wise words of Diogenes Laertius. I know that Committee members have

been wondering what he had to say, and it

was:</div><a name="06051023000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

foundation of every state is the education of its

youth.&#148;</div><a name="06051023000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would all

agree about that. The introduction of the new diplomas that we will

debate later is an opportunity for us to play our part in transforming

secondary education in this country.</div>

<a name="06051023000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to say that I do not

agree with the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). He was

described in an earlier sitting as an outrider, but I notice from a

publication that has recently been released, &#147;Set the schools

free&#148;, that some 37 members of his party, including his hon.

Friend on the Front Bench, the hon. Member for South Holland and The

Deepings, support his view

that</div><a name="06051023000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Conservatism

is about trickling down the privileges of the few to the

many.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column727" />Column number: 728</div><a name="06051023000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not the view

of hon. Members on this side of the Committee. Our view is that every

young person should have opportunities to improve his education and to

achieve his potential, and that is what the Bill is all

about.</div> <a name="06051023000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Work-related

learning was introduced into the key stage 4 national curriculum in

2004 as part of the Government&#146;s far-reaching agenda for change

in the curriculum for students aged 14 to 19. Work-related learning is

planned activity that uses the context of work to develop knowledge,

skills and understanding that are useful in work. It can take place

across the curriculum, with different subjects and courses providing

pupils with the opportunities and contexts in which to develop the

work-related skills and knowledge.</div>

<a name="06051023000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The statutory requirement

describes it in three parts. One is learning through work, about which

the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings was so eloquent. It

provides opportunities for students to learn from direct experience of

work, but it also includes learning about work by providing

opportunities for students to develop knowledge and understanding of

work and enterprise. It also includes learning for work by developing

skills for enterprise and for employability, with young people taking

part in enterprise projects and so on. There is a diversity of

provision in schools under the umbrella of work-related learning, which

is now a key part of the national curriculum.</div>

<a name="06051023000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is my view and the

Government&#146;s view that all young people need work-related

learning. It is an essential part of preparing for an adult life, as we

want all young people to contribute to the country&#146;s economic

well-being. The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings cited

Edge; he and I have had much contact with that organisation, which

supports our initiatives. Many employers have told me, as Minister for

skills, of the priority that they put on young people leaving full-time

education with work-related skills, so that they can enter the world of

work with confidence and with the wide range of employable skills that

employers are keen to have.</div>

<a name="06051023000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">By making it statutory, we will

ensure the clarity, coherence and quality of work-related provision.

Given the support for this on both sides of the House, and given the

support of the many bodies who wish to see the national curriculum

provide young people with such experiences and opportunities, I hope

that the hon. Member for Gainsborough will feel able to withdraw the

amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000494"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am faced with the eloquence not only of my hon.

Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings but of the

Under-Secretary&#151;and even of Diogenes, which I suspect was not

learned on work-related experience. I believe that we have had a useful

debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<a name="06051023000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

withdrawn.</i></div><a name="06051023000046"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000495"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 408, in clause 61, page

43, line 2, at end

insert</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;and</div>

<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(d) religious education, including a daily act of

worship as specified in the Education Reform Act

1988.'.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column728" />Column number: 729</div><a name="06051023000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Committee will

forgive me for moving another amendment so soon, but it is an important

subject and I would like a short debate to find out what is going on in

our schools. The amendment would add religious education and an act of

worship to the foundation subjects in the national

curriculum&#151;that is, they would become compulsory.</div>

<a name="06051023000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is interesting to note that

until the national curriculum was devised in the 1980s, the only

subject that had been compulsory in all maintained schools since 1944

was religious education, along with an act of worship. That was the

only compulsory subject between 1944 and the 1980s, but that

requirement has never been repealed. The Minister can correct me if I

am wrong and give me an insight into what is going on in schools, but I

believe that RE is still a compulsory subject in all schools, as is an

act of worship.</div>

<a name="06051023000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 61 is long and

prescriptive, and it will doubtless be taken as a new bible of what

should be taught in state schools. One would have thought that

religious education was a fairly important aspect in growing up. We

talked earlier about the broader cultural value of work-related

experience; I should have thought that some sort of introduction to

religious education, taught in a sensitive way, was a valuable part of

our education system. However, there is not one mention of it in clause

61. Why not?</div> <a name="06051023000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

believe that religious education should be inserted into clause 61 as a

foundation subject, otherwise pupils&#151;and, most importantly,

schools&#151;might consider that it was no longer a required subject.

They may know that it was required in 1944, but they are not

parliamentary lawyers or politicians and may not know that the

provision has not been repealed. They may look at the guidance given in

the latest Act of Parliament, not see the subject and therefore think

that it is not required. We all know the reality. I wonder whether the

Minister has figures to show what is happening in our 20,000 schools to

religious education and a daily act of worship. We know that the

provision is widely ignored, particularly the daily act of worship, but

I stand to be corrected.</div>

<a name="06051023000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Omitting the subject from the

clause, as the Government have done, would suggest&#151;the Minister

will correct me if this is an unfair statement&#151;that they are

surreptitiously dropping RE from the

curriculum.</div>

<a name="06051023000052"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000496"></a>Phil

<a name="06051023000053"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000497"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> The Under-Secretary shakes his head. Even the

shaking of a ministerial head is to be welcomed, although he is now

applying the brakes&#151;he will have an opportunity to speak

later.</div> <a name="06051023000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my

experience, the old-fashioned school assembly was an invaluable way to

get people together and have a break from the academic grind. It has

come increasingly out of fashion, but I would hope that once we have

had this short debate, the Under-Secretary will say that, far from the

Government doing anything surreptitiously to ease out that subject,

they think that it is valuable and that the provisions in the Education

Act 1944 still

stand.</div><a name="06051023000055"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000498"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Having disagreed with my hon. Friend about his

previous amendment, I have to say that I am 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column729" />Column number: 730</div>sympathetic to the views that he has expressed on the subject now before

us. I am sympathetic because I share his view that the clear commitment

to religious education made in the 1944 Act, supported by the Education

Reform Act 1988, needs to be reaffirmed

here.</div><a name="06051023000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">We live in an

age in which the spiritual is neglected and the material worshipped.

Surely it is inconceivable that we should devise an education system

that places insufficient emphasis on the spiritual. For that reason, I

have sympathy with my hon. Friend. Sections 26 to 28 of the 1944 Act,

which I have details of here, make it clear that religious education

should be included in the basic curriculum. Indeed, his amendment would

do much the same and add religious education to subjects at the core of

a school&#146;s

business.</div><a name="06051023000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 1988

Act, which I also have details of, reinforced that position and said

once again that religious education should be included in that

fundamental list of subjects that all children are expected to study. I

guess that the architects of both those important pieces of legislation

were inspired by Moses&#146; words in Deuteronomy with which he

commanded men, women and children to come together to hear the word of

the Lord. No doubt my hon. Friend was reading that just before he came

into Committee to move his amendment.</div>

<a name="06051023000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">To move from the biblical to

the modern, there is good evidence to suggest that religious education

can be used positively in the pursuit of tolerance and

non-discrimination. I call upon no less a body than the International

Association for Religious Freedom to support that assertion. In a paper

that I have before me, it makes it clear that it believes that

religious education can indeed do that. The international association,

founded in 1900 and drawing membership from adherents to a wide range

of world religions, is committed to upholding religious freedom as a

fundamental human right.</div>

<a name="06051023000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">In November 2001, on the 20th

anniversary of the UN declaration on the elimination of all forms of

intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief, that issue

was given prominence. A paper entitled, &#147;The Role of Religious

Education in the Pursuit of Tolerance and Non-Discrimination&#148;

was considered carefully. Perhaps it is worth quoting from that

study:</div><a name="06051023000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Religious

education should be conceived as a tool to transmit knowledge and

values pertaining to all religious trends, in an inclusive way, so that

individuals realize their being part of the same community and learn to

create their own identity in harmony with identities different from

their own. As such, religious education radically differs

from...theology, defined as the formal study of the nature of

God&#148;.</div><a name="06051023000445"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

pm</div><a name="06051023000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, the

Government, in a joint statement on the importance of religious

education issued in February by the Department and faith communities,

which the Minister, in the time that he has had to study these matters,

will no doubt have seen, emphasise that religious education can play a

vital role. According to the joint statement,

it</div><a name="06051023000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;offers opportunities

for personal reflection and spiritual

development&#148;.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column730" />Column number: 731</div><a name="06051023000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The statement continues to say that

it</div> <a name="06051023000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provokes challenging

questions about the ultimate meaning and purpose of life, beliefs about

God, the self, the nature of reality, issues of right and wrong and

what it means to be human...enhances pupils&#146; awareness of

religions and beliefs, teachings, practices and forms of expression, as

well as of the influence of religion on individuals, families,

communities and cultures...encourages pupils to learn from

different religions, beliefs, values and traditions, while exploring

their own beliefs and questions of

meaning&#148;</div><a name="06051023000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div>

<a name="06051023000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;challenges pupils to reflect on,

consider, analyse, interpret and evaluate issues of truth, belief,

faith and ethics and to communicate their

response.&#148;</div><a name="06051023000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

list continues, but you can understand, Mr. Cook, that the spirit of

the joint statement is that religious education is an important vehicle

for education in the broader way that I mentioned when I argued for

children to have experience beyond the boundaries of the school.

Religious education seems to me to be useful in those

ways.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000500"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the

Bill is consistent with current best practice. I suggest that our

purpose is to ensure that what we do supports all those efforts that

provide for good schools and education. My hon. Friend the Member for

Gainsborough, I think, in his brief words in support of the amendment

said that he thought it would make the Bill consistent with the 1944

and 1988 Acts and build on excellent arrangements of the kind that the

hon. Lady

mentioned.</div><a name="06051023000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we live

in an age where all the things that I have described need new

emphasis&#151;because we need to elevate our thinking about what

makes an educated person; because we need once again to discover

spirituality and its importance to human fulfilment&#151;I have much

sympathy with my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment. However, I shall of

course wait to hear the Under-Secretary respond in his usual elegant

and eloquent way before we decide what we will do if my hon. Friend

chooses to press his amendment to a vote.

</div><a name="06051023000067"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000501"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> I shall not linger on an apparent contradiction

between what the hon. Member for Gainsborough said in the introduction

to amendment No. 349, about wanting to abolish the national curriculum,

and his wanting by means of the current amendment to impose a topic on

that

curriculum.</div><a name="06051023000068"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000502"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> If one is forced to sup with the devil, one should

at least ensure that the soup is tasty.</div>

<a name="06051023000069"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000503"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> That is apposite, given the amendment before us. I

hope to be able to reassure the hon. Gentleman.</div>

<a name="06051023000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Religious education and

collective worship already have a secure place in the school

curriculum. All maintained schools must provide religious education and

collective worship. Religious education is part of

the basic curriculum. Schools must teach it either

according to locally agreed syllabuses or, in the case of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column731" />Column number: 732</div>voluntary aided schools with a religious character, according to the

trust deed of the schools. I remind the hon. Gentleman that parents are

allowed to withdraw their child from religious education and collective

worship if they wish.</div>

<a name="06051023000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have a clear

commitment to religious education throughout the curriculum, whereas

clause 61 refers only to key stage 4. As the hon. Member for South

Holland and The Deepings said, the 1998 Act affirms that. I shall not

go through the draft joint statement. It shows the kind of education

that we expect young people to receive through religious education and

has been agreed with the faith communities.</div>

<a name="06051023000072"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000504"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> We know that the subject is compulsory because we

have had the benefit of listening to my hon. Friend the Member for

South Holland and The Deepings, who read out the relevant passages in

the 1944 and 1988 Acts. Is there religious education in every school?

Can the Minister give that commitment? Is there some sort of collective

act of worship? I doubt whether he can give that

commitment.</div><a name="06051023000073"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000505"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> If religious education is not being taught in a

school through the key stages, it is not acting lawfully. That subject

is a core part of the basic curriculum and has to be taught. The same

is true of collective acts of worship. Responsibility for ensuring that

collective acts of worship take place rests with head teachers and

school governors. We expect all schools to comply with the

law.</div><a name="06051023000074"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000506"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I am extremely impressed with the

Under-Secretary&#146;s comments. Will he consider any representations

from my hon. Friend if he is concerned that the law is not being

followed properly in some

cases?</div><a name="06051023000075"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000507"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> As a Minister in a Government who are always open to

listening to the representations and views of Members on both sides of

the House, I will happily take representations regarding concerns about

the delivery of any aspect of the national curriculum.</div>

<a name="06051023000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Making religious education and

collective worship a core subject at key stage 4, as the amendment

would do, would not be useful or helpful at this point. We would need

to develop national programmes of study and attainment targets, which

would allow less scope for faith communities to contribute to the

development of religious education provision in schools and for

teaching in those schools to reflect local circumstances and

traditions.</div><a name="06051023000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Government have developed a non-statutory framework for religious

education to provide local authorities, standing advisory councils for

religious education&#151;SACREs, as they are known&#151;teachers,

parents and the wider community with a clear, shared understanding of

the knowledge and skills that young people should gain at school in

religious education. The framework allows schools to meet the

individual learning needs of pupils and to develop a distinctive

character and ethos for their religious education teaching which is

rooted in their local communities. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman

would fully support that.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column732" />Column number: 733</div><a name="06051023000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I emphasise

the importance of allowing parents to withdraw their children from RE

and the act of collective worship. They would not be able to opt out if

the subject was in the national curriculum, so the amendment would

cause difficulties in that regard. On the basis of those arguments and

the assurances that I have given, I hope that the amendment will be

withdrawn.</div><a name="06051023000079"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000508"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> As always, the Under-Secretary has done his best to

reassure me. In a sense, I am pleased that he said on the record, in

Committee, that he expects every school to have not only religious

education but a collective act of worship, which we know does not

happen in all schools. At least we got that on the record, so anyone

who follows these debates will be aware of it.</div>

<a name="06051023000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an amendment such as mine

were accepted, I am sure that we could have some sort of opt-out

procedure, but we could deal with that on Report. I agree that parents

should be allowed to opt out of their children receiving religious

education, but that would be perfectly possible. The amendment would

build on existing legislation and would not interfere with

that.</div> <a name="06051023000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think

that the Minister was being entirely honest, if I may say so, when he

suggested that if the legislation were restated in the way in which it

was stated in 1944 and 1988, it would somehow be unduly prescriptive

and would mean telling Catholic, Anglican or Muslim schools how to

teach education. We all know that if this were a core subject it would

be perfectly possible, within the Department&#146;s guidance, to give

schools the freedom to teach education in the way in which they want.

The guidance could be framed in such a way. I do not think that anybody

is seriously suggesting that we can lay down from the centre, any more

now than we have in the past 60 years, what the exact nature of

religious education should be.</div>

<a name="06051023000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I withdraw the vicious attack I

made earlier on my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The

Deepings. He was very eloquent when he spoke about the value of

religious education. We live in an increasingly consumerist,

materialist age, and so there is an enormous value in it. When every

other subject is dealt with in such detail, mentioned, pushed forward

and insisted upon, I do not see why such an important part of our

cultural heritage should be left out of the Bill. I therefore want to

press the amendment to a

vote.</div><a name="06051023000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000534"></a>Mr.

Clappison:</b> The purpose of the amendment is to add modern

foreign languages to the list of foundation subjects in clause 61. At

present, they are part of the entitlement subjects in proposed new

section 85A. I hope that I will not get into trouble with my hon.

Friend the Member for Gainsborough for being too prescriptive. I draw

to his attention the fact that I am shifting the modern foreign

languages from one part of the group to another. There is an important

point behind this and I would like to explore the position of modern

foreign languages in our schools, particularly our secondary

schools.</div> <a name="06051023000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2003,

modern foreign languages were removed from the foundation part of the

curriculum and put into the entitlement area. While it is a little bit

early to explore the consequences of that change, there are some

alarming developments in the study of modern foreign languages in our

schools. That is often debated. Some argue that it is not so important

for people in this country to learn a modern foreign language because

English is so widely spoken in the world. I happen to believe that it

is important and something that our children should do to enrich

themselves culturally. It is perhaps an indication of the wider issues

relating to academic rigour and standards in our schools. Taking GCSE

entries as a measurement of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column734" />Column number: 735</div>how modern foreign languages are faring in our schools&#151;I say this

with a word of caution because, as I know to my personal cost, entering

a GCSE is no measure of any achievement at the end of the

process&#151;the number of children learning a language at key stage

4 is extremely worrying. The number of children entering for GCSEs in

modern foreign languages has been in free-fall in the past five

years.</div><a name="06051023000446"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

pm</div><a name="06051023000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although there

has been a modest increase in the number of entries for Spanish, the

numbers have gone down significantly for French and German, and also

for other languages. It is no exaggeration to say that the number of

people entering examinations are in free-fall. In 2000, 321,000

children entered for GCSE French, which is by far and away the most

popular language at that level. By 2004-05, the figure had gone down to

244,000, and the same applies to German. That is a worrying picture,

and it is reflected in the number of children studying languages at

A-level. Indeed, the numbers at A-level are perhaps even more striking

and they have gone down for all languages, which is

worrying.</div>

<a name="06051023000118"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000535"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> My hon. Friend is making a characteristically

measured and thoughtful contribution. Is he familiar with the work of

the National Centre for Languages, which is a Government-funded

organisation? It reveals that we are 28th out of 28 countries in Europe

in terms of our language competence. I challenged the Under-Secretary

on that when we last had Education questions on the Floor of the House.

That problem must relate to the number of students studying

languages.</div>

<a name="06051023000119"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000536"></a>Mr.

Clappison:</b> Perhaps I should be more familiar with that

body&#146;s work, but I am not entirely surprised by the rather

alarming conclusion that my hon. Friend has drawn to the

Committee&#146;s attention. I have been talking about GCSE entries,

because they are relevant in this context, but I would hazard a guess

that our linguistic competence at GCSE level is rather modest compared

with other countries&#146; achievements at the same level. I suspect

that that is true of their achievements not only in English, but in

other languages, and it is common for children in France and Germany to

master several other languages besides English.</div>

<a name="06051023000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The picture at A-level is also

worrying, and although I do not have an explanation, I wonder whether

it has something to do with the fact that modern languages are

perceived as hard subjects. The same might be true of science A-levels,

because there seems to be a disjunction between the number of children

who do GCSE science and science A-level. Although that situation is

equally worrying, I shall stick with modern foreign languages. I simply

ask the Under-Secretary to recognise the problem that exists in

schools, accept that examination entries are in free-fall, acknowledge

the concern that exists and give some indication of what is being done

to tackle the problem.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column735" />Column number: 736</div><a name="06051023000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have a strategy

for introducing children to languages earlier at primary school.

However, there seemed to be some contradiction between that approach

and the downgrading of modern foreign languages later on, when they

were taken from the foundation part of the syllabus and put in the

entitlement part. I served on the Standing Committee on Delegated

Legislation that dealt with the relevant legislation and I asked the

Under-Secretary&#146;s predecessor&#151;he has just become the

Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and I

congratulate him on that&#151;whether more children would come

through to learn modern foreign languages at GCSE level as a result of

the changes. He told

me:</div><a name="06051023000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I

confidently expect the strategy to be successful&#151;more young

people will come through key stage 3 and into GCSE wanting to learn

languages and, as their grades go up, Opposition Members will denounce

that as being a result of falling standards. I look forward to that

debate in the years ahead.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Second

Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation,</i> 10 November 2003, c.

ahead, but it is two years ahead, and although it is a little early to

it is, the primary programme seems to be rather patchy. I have also

pleasure to follow my hon. Friend. He makes a compelling case for

including a modern 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column736" />Column number: 737</div>foreign language in the core subjects of the national curriculum.

Amendment No. 238 would make it one of the foundation subjects of the

curriculum, making it compulsory at the fourth key stage. It is

important that pupils learn a modern foreign language, and this

country&#146;s failure to ensure that could have serious economic

implications.</div> <a name="06051023000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.

Friend explained well the serious fall in the numbers taking language

GCSEs, and I will not repeat his arguments. The Government&#146;s

argument for removing the compulsion for secondary school students to

study a modern foreign language beyond the age of 14 was that it is

better to have students who want to study a language and are motivated

to do so than to force children who are not motivated to pursue one

until the age of 16. The same argument could be applied to every area

of the curriculum, whether it is maths, English, science or

citizenship. It is the wrong approach to take. We must take a view

about which subjects our children ought to master by the age of 16 in

the state-funded education system. Modern foreign languages are as

important a subject to study until the age of 16 as maths, English and

science.</div><a name="06051023000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Barcelona

European Council in 2002 recommended that at least two foreign

languages be learnt from a very early age, yet the UK performs very

poorly compared with other European countries. That is shown in a

report made by the European Commission in 2005, which showed that most

countries insist on a modern foreign language being taught until the

age of 18 and, in most cases, begin teaching a language between the

ages of eight and 10. It also showed that only the UK, Ireland and

Italy failed to offer an entitlement to all pupils to study two modern

foreign languages. England has the highest proportion of lower

secondary pupils who do not study a foreign language&#151;19.9 per

cent.</div> <a name="06051023000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">A survey this

February, also by the European Commission, found that two in three

adults in Britain were unable to speak a language other than English,

compared with 44 per cent. across the EU. The implications that that

will have for our country were investigated in a report by the British

Council, entitled &#147;English Next&#148;. It suggested that in

the future, monoglot native English speakers will lose out to qualified

multilingual young people from other countries in the global jobs

market that has emerged. Such concerns were also noted in the

Qualifications and Curriculum Authority&#146;s annual report for

2004-05. It

said:</div><a name="06051023000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Much

more worrying is the fact that large numbers of more average students

are possibly reducing their future prospects of job mobility and choice

by giving up language learning at the age of

14.&#148;</div><a name="06051023000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 257 would require the programme of study for foreign languages to

include the study of formal grammar and morphology&#151;the system of

forms in a language&#151;and translation from English into the

foreign language. Those are both skills that are necessary for further

study in a foreign language. Formal grammar refers to the laws and

rules by which the language is structured. Too little emphasis is given

to that aspect of language study, which is having an impact on

universities and later study. Although the national curriculum states

that students</div><a name="06051023000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;should be

taught the grammar of the target language and how to apply

it&#148;,</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column737" />Column number: 738</div><a name="06051023000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">many universities find that students

arrive unaware of basic grammatical concepts. That is seen not only in

foreign languages but, I am afraid to say, English as well. As a

result, many universities find themselves teaching remedial grammar

lessons to their undergraduates. Given the important role that modern

languages play in allowing young people to understand their own

language, it is important that the explicit teaching of grammar should

be made a requirement in the

curriculum.</div><a name="06051023000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 504 also applies the study of foreign languages to vocational

subjects, while amendment No. 240 would ensure that the languages

prescribed under regulations included Mandarin Chinese, Arabic and

Spanish. Mandarin is the most widely spoken language in the world,

being spoken by more than 1 billion people&#151;more than 13 per

cent. of the world&#146;s population, according to the CIA, if we can

believe it. Arabic is spoken across the middle east and north Africa by

206 million people. Modern standard Arabic is the dialect of Arabic

most commonly used for official purposes and in schools, and Spanish is

the most widely spoken European language after English. In contrast,

French, which is the most commonly taught language in English schools,

is declining as an international lingua franca.</div>

<a name="06051023000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The teaching of Arabic,

Mandarin and Spanish was one of the recommendations of David Graddol,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000544"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I, too, wish to speak in favour of the amendment.

My hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings made some

wounding personal remarks about my ability to speak on the Bill. I

freely admitted that I know nothing at all about education

theory&#151;I simply come here with my experience as a father. As my

hon. Friend said, I have so many children that my experience ranges

over the entire English educational system. Indeed, next year I shall

have six children in six different educational establishments in this

country, in five different parts of the country.</div>

<a name="06051023000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Foreign language education is

extremely important. I sent all my children to the French

lyc(c)e&#151;indeed, I went there myself&#151;which has been

an extraordinarily 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column738" />Column number: 739</div>valuable experience. All of them have remained at the lyc(c)e,

where pupils get total immersion in a foreign language. Total immersion

in a foreign language is quite common in other countries. I have

visited a school in Finland that has total immersion in English. The

equivalent would be unheard of here, but it works. It is extraordinary

to visit schools in other parts of Europe and find extraordinary

ability and an understanding of the need to learn foreign languages,

particularly English. I have Dutch relations. It is impossible to find

any Dutch person over the age of 15 who does not speak English

fluently, albeit with a strong

accent.</div>

<a name="06051023000447"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5

pm</div><a name="06051023000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dutch people

start to learn English relatively late in their educational

experience&#151;not at age 4 or 5&#151;but they become fluent very

quickly. Because Holland is a small, commercial country, its people

have to learn English. It is extraordinary&#151;we can produce as

many statistics as we like, but we all know the truth&#151;how we

have sunk to the bottom of the European league in learning foreign

languages. It can be said from a business point of view that, because

English is now the business language of the world, other languages are

not necessary, but we know that that cannot be true. Once one has a

grounding in one foreign language&#151;French, Spanish or anything

else&#151;it is far easier to learn other languages, and so to be

more confident abroad, to deal with foreigners, and to engage in

business in an increasingly competitive world. Given that languages are

so important, I cannot understand why we are falling so far behind. On

that basis, I hope that the Minister will be able to respond positively

to the amendment.</div>

<a name="06051023000143"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000545"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> Before addressing the specific points that hon.

Members have made, I should like to explain to the Committee that the

aim of clause 61 is to provide entitlements in sciences and to

diplomas. Both of those are direct consequences of changes to the

curriculum that are already in train. The diploma entitlement is to

secure the provision of the new diplomas and the science entitlement is

directly linked to changes to the compulsory elements of the key stage

4 science curriculum that will come into effect in September. The

inclusion in the Bill of the science and diploma entitlements has been

prompted by specific circumstances in science and vocational study.

There have been no similar developments in respect of modern foreign

languages that could be considered adequate to give rise to a need to

change the national curriculum to make the subject compulsory for all

pupils.</div> <a name="06051023000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate

that hon. Members who have spoken&#151;and others outside this place

with an interest in modern foreign languages&#151;would like to see

the subject&#146;s profile raised, as, presumably, those who are

enthusiastic about other subjects that we will debate later would like

to see the profiles of those subjects raised. However, the national

curriculum has been developed carefully over the years, and its current

form represents a balance derived from extensive consultations with all

subject communities.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column739" />Column number: 740</div><a name="06051023000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a clear need for the

new science diploma entitlement, because of the changes.

However&#151;although I shall respond to points made by hon. Members

today&#151; a strong case has not been made through extensive debate

and consultation for altering the status of modern foreign languages in

the national curriculum. As the hon. Member for Hertsmere

(Mr. Clappison) said, the key stage 4 national curriculum was last

changed in 2004, and that was following an extensive

consultation.</div> <a name="06051023000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prior

to 2004, there had been a large number of compulsory subjects. There

was general agreement that that left too little flexibility for other

subjects and little time for other study, such as the work-related or

vocational learning that we debated earlier. We also knew&#151;this

is the reason for the 2004 changes&#151;that many pupils were simply

bored. They saw little relevance in the mainly academic curriculum and,

as a result, left learning at 16 with few or no qualifications. We have

debated elsewhere in this House the importance of increasing the

numbers who stay on in education after 16.</div>

<a name="06051023000147"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000546"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The Minister is right. We are in agreement about

those principles. He will know that I broadly welcome the diplomas.

Perhaps, therefore, he will explain how much account was taken of

modern foreign languages in the design of those

diplomas.</div>

<a name="06051023000148"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000547"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I am going to

address it when I address later amendments.</div>

<a name="06051023000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2004, the

national curriculum was changed to become more flexible and more

responsive to students&#146; individual needs and, crucially, to

motivate them to stay on in learning. As a result, subjects are now

compulsory only if they provide an essential basis for progression or

if they are essential for personal development. At that time, modern

foreign languages were changed from being a compulsory subject to being

an entitlement, so schools have to provide access to a foreign language

course to all pupils who wish to continue their language studies. So

the question of motivation&#151;which the hon. Member for

Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) mentioned&#151;is

being addressed by the introduction of language learning at

key stage 2. Our goal in introducing it at key stage 2 is to motivate

more young people to continue studying languages rather than forcing

them to do so at key stage 4. Our commitment is that all

pupils should be given an opportunity to study a language at

key stage 2.</div>

<a name="06051023000150"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000548"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> The Minister makes a compelling point, except that

only a small proportion of primary schools in the country today provide

modern foreign language teaching in class in the day time. Would it not

have been better to remove the compulsion at 14 once the primary school

sector had reached critical mass in teaching a modern foreign language

at key stage

2?</div><a name="06051023000151"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000549"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, but our

analysis of the number of young people who were feeling bored and

demotivated and not achieving success in their courses, and who were

therefore leaving education at 16, led us to make those 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column740" />Column number: 741</div>changes to the national curriculum as a whole. Currently, 56 per cent.

of all primary schools deliver language programmes at key stage 2, and

it is our intention that they should all do so by 2010. I have

visited&#151;as I am sure we all have in our

constituencies&#151;primary schools that are taking innovative and

exciting approaches to introducing a modern foreign language into the

primary sector.</div> <a name="06051023000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

addition, we are providing greater choice and flexibility to overcome

the problems for young people so that they can follow programmes that

meet their aspirations and match their abilities. We have a newly

introduced national recognition scheme, the languages ladder, which

hon. Members have not mentioned. That provides an alternative and more

flexible accreditation route to traditional GCSEs.</div>

<a name="06051023000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the concerns of

the hon. Member for Hertsmere: we have seen the figures and he is right

to say that there has been a decline, although as he said there has

been an increase in the number of students taking up Spanish. It is

interesting that the pass rate has gone up as a result of more young

people who are taking those languages being motivated to do so. There

is probably a relationship between those two

facts.</div>

Nadine Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): I wonder whether

the Minister could clarify further the issue of meeting

children&#146;s aspirations. I was just thinking about my

children&#146;s aspirations, which are to get out of the school gates

as quickly as possible at 4 o&#146;clock. I am not sure

that courses designed to meet their aspirations would be appropriate to

their future needs.</div>

Hope:</b> The hon. Lady will forgive me for not commenting on

the extent to which she can make her own children stay on at school.

What I am saying is that the curriculum must provide opportunities for

young people to which they can respond. The flexibility that is

provided for teachers to find ways of working in the

classroom&#151;and, indeed, outside it, through our extended schools

strategy&#151;is a mechanism for capturing and engaging young people

in the joy of learning in all subjects, including modern foreign

languages. That is what we are endeavouring to do through the changes

to the national curriculum.</div>

<a name="06051023000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman was right to

raise his concerns. That is why the Department wrote to all secondary

schools last January, reminding them of their statutory obligation to

provide opportunities for those pupils who wish to study languages. At

the same time we placed an expectation on those schools to set their

own targets of between 50 to 90 per cent. of key stage 4 pupils

studying a language that leads to a recognised qualification. I know

that that is a challenging target for some schools to set, but I expect

that it will become less of an issue in the future as more children

enter secondary schools with language skills and an enthusiasm for

language that they have acquired through primary education. That is why

we have done things that way round.</div>

<a name="06051023000157"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000552"></a>Mr.

Clappison:</b> I wonder whether the Minister could go slightly

further on what he has helpfully told us and assure us that he will

revisit the subject with schools when he gets the results from that

letter.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column741" />Column number: 742</div><a name="06051023000158"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000553"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> Of course we monitor schools, their participation

rates and the extent to which they are setting and achieving the

targets that we are encouraging them to meet. We shall of course

monitor our progress, but I am confident that it will make a difference

as young people, particularly at key stage 2, find and develop their

enthusiasm and confidence in language.</div>

<a name="06051023000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to speak to the other

two amendments. Programmes of study set out the required teaching for

those subjects that are compulsory for all pupils at each key stage.

They provide a definition of what the subject entails in terms of the

statutory required teaching that all pupils should receive. As I said,

modern foreign languages are no longer compulsory for all pupils at key

stage 4, so there is no programme of study to which amendment No. 257

could be applied. Of course, they are an important area of learning:

the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has published

non-contributory guidelines for modern foreign languages at key stage

4.</div> <a name="06051023000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment

raises the question whether it is appropriate for Parliament to

prescribe in legislation the requirements for languages and the other

non-compulsory subjects that must be taught to those pupils. I consider

that the present situation, in which the statutory content is

prescribed for the compulsory subjects but not for optional subjects,

strikes the right

balance.</div><a name="06051023000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned grammar, morphology

and the ability to translate, which are intrinsic elements of the

specifications of GCSEs in modern foreign languages. Although the GCSE

specification does not specify explicitly the need to translate from

English to the foreign language, the process is implicit. It is

inconceivable that students would not go through a translation process

from English into the foreign language before expressing themselves in

speech or in writing. I hope the hon. Gentleman understands that what

he is asking for is, first, not appropriate, because it is not a

compulsory subject and, secondly, unnecessary, because the process is

implicit in the way the subjects are

taught.</div><a name="06051023000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

504 would include the teaching of modern foreign languages in the

courses of study for all the diploma entitlement areas&#151;a matter

that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings raised in an

intervention. The diplomas are being introduced to provide a curriculum

choice for young people; they are valuable qualifications enabling

young people to progress to further learning or employment. Key to the

development of the new specialised diplomas is the involvement of

employers in designing the content of those courses of study. Diploma

development partnerships are being led by sector skills councils

designed to help to do the job. I am pleased to be able to be able to

tell the hon. Gentleman that they will include modern foreign language

provision in the course of study when it is appropriate to the line of

learning in that diploma.</div>

<a name="06051023000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The National Centre for

Languages, which the hon. Gentleman quoted earlier, is working directly

with the diploma development partnerships to encourage the

provision of modern foreign languages in the diplomas. My hon. Friend

the Member for Sheffield, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column742" />Column number: 743</div>Hillsborough (Ms Smith) asked why not include languages in other areas,

too. I am happy to inform hon. Members that all five of the phase-one

diploma development partnerships have expressed an interest in

including languages in their diplomas as part of additional learning.

We can see real progress being made in the way my hon. Friend

suggested.</div> <a name="06051023000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

amendment No. 240, the modern foreign language entitlement currently

covers the official working languages of the European Union. I hope

that that does not prompt Opposition Members to get to their feet. I am

always slightly nervous about saying &#147;European Union&#148; in

the House as I know how it excites Opposition Members. The languages

are Danish, Dutch, French, German, modern Greek, Italian, Polish,

Portuguese, Swedish and Spanish. Amendment No. 240 would add Mandarin

and modern standard Arabic to the list; as I said, it already includes

Spanish.</div> <a name="06051023000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schools are

only required to provide one language course to those pupils who elect

to take up the entitlement, and it is for schools to decide which

language it is. We want to encourage more pupils to take languages, and

to do that the entitlement has been framed in terms of the languages

that will appeal to the most pupils.</div>

<a name="06051023000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to tread into

difficult territory, but the European Union is of great importance to

British life and business. European languages are by far the most

popular in our schools and we want pupils to be entitled to learn them.

The amendment would water that down as a school might choose to fulfil

its entitlement obligations by providing only Mandarin or Arabic. I

agree with hon. Members that they are important languages but they are

probably not appealing to the majority of pupils. If the amendment were

accepted, the entitlement would no longer provide such an attractive

opportunity to most pupils and it would be less effective in helping to

encourage more pupils to take

languages.</div><a name="06051023000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was very

impressed by the description by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney,

South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) of a language academy in her

constituency. I expect we could all cite examples of such

excellence.</div><a name="06051023000448"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

pm</div><a name="06051023000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are

promoting specialist language colleges. A number offer Arabic and

Chinese programmes in addition to the working languages of the European

Union. The Specialist Schools and Academies Trust co-ordinates a

Chinese network, providing information for teachers on Chinese

resources and methodology, and a virtual staffroom online networking

facility; a similar network is planned for Arabic.</div>

<a name="06051023000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of activities are in

place to promote the languages that the hon. Member for Hertsmere

rightly identified as being important. For the reasons that I have

given, however, we believe that it would be inappropriate to support

the amendment, and I hope that he will feel able to withdraw

it.</div>

<a name="06051023000170"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000554"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> This has been an interesting and well argued debate.

There is a clear correlation and a causal 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column743" />Column number: 744</div>link between the dramatic fall in the numbers taking

GCSEs in French and German and the decision to remove compulsion at key

stage 4. The pass rate has risen slightly, but the same would happen if

we removed compulsion from science and maths, and I believe that we

would see a similar dramatic tumbling in the numbers taking those

subjects. It is odd that a modern foreign language is no longer

compulsory at the age of 16 but citizenship is. The suspicion is that

removing compulsion from a subject that is generally regarded as hard

is part of a general dumbing down in education that has been happening

gradually over the past 20 or 30 years.</div>

<a name="06051023000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister cited a figure of

56 per cent. of primary schools offering modern languages, but that

includes after-school clubs. It does not mean that 56 per

cent. of primary schools are providing French or German or any other

modern foreign language in school time, as part of their curriculum.

The proportion doing that is tiny. If that had been the

Government&#146;s policy, it would have been better to remove

compulsion at the age of 14 once a significant number of primary

schools had started providing lessons during class time and not in

after-school clubs.

</div><a name="06051023000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis, when

the time comes I would like to press amendment No. 238B to a

Division.</div>

<a name="06051023000173"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000555"></a>Mr.

Clappison:</b> We have had the opportunity for a reasonable

debate on an important subject. I moved amendment No. 518, but I shall

not seek to divide the Committee on it, but I hope that I have

impressed upon the Minister that we should take the matter seriously.

My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned

including modern foreign languages in the curriculum for the purposes

of business, but they are also important to our cultural enrichment and

to the way in which we see the peoples of other countries. We will

doubtless return to the subject.</div>

<a name="06051023000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sciences were mentioned during

the debate. My hon. Friend the made some important points about rigour

and standards. The falling number of children entering for GCSEs in

languages and of children entering for the sciences at A-level during

the past five years might tell us something wider about rigour and

standards. The falling number of children entering for physics at

A-level, as well as for other science subjects, is equally worrying, if

not more so. We talk about aspirations, but the decline may have

something to do with the fact that many teachers are not expert or

qualified specialists in those subjects. Our education system is

failing to motivate sufficient children to take up languages and

sciences at the higher levels, and particularly at A-level.</div>

<a name="06051023000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I beg to ask leave to withdraw

the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000558"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> The Minister may be tempted to make a debating

point by asking why, if someone is opposed to the national curriculum,

they would want to have subjects listed in it. Well, if one is walking

down a busy road, particularly a new Labour road, it is wise to look in

both directions at

once.</div><a name="06051023000189"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000559"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> You could get run

over.</div><a name="06051023000190"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000560"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> Well, you could but if you do not look in both

directions you certainly would.</div>

<a name="06051023000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a serious point to

make. I want to force a debate on the value of traditional subjects

such as geography, history and music. Amendment No. 409 would make

geography, history, physical education, art and design and music

compulsory, although as each subject would be allotted at least one

period per week, I am not over-egging the pudding. I am simply saying

that there is a great value to a country in a shared cultural identity

and the education that promotes it in ensuring that some sort of

geography, history, music, art and design is taught at least once a

week. I believe that it is desirable that all pupils aged 14 to 16

study those subjects.</div>

<a name="06051023000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I may be criticised for leaving

out IT as a compulsory subject although I have put it down in a later

amendment as an optional subject. The Minister might say that IT is now

essential in the modern world, and I fully accept that. The Prime

Minister and I share a lack of skill in it, but it is essential for

young people, although I challenge the Minister or any parent in this

Committee to name a 14-year-old who is not adept at using computers.

Obviously it is an essential skill, but I am not sure why it needs to

be a compulsory subject when take-up is virtually universal, certainly

compared with foreign languages or any other subject one could think

of.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column745" />Column number: 746</div><a name="06051023000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the pressure on

timetabling, something has to give. If separate sciences and languages

are to be studied, my list of subjects, though optional in

clause 61, ought to be given a higher profile. I offer that list to

create a debate in Committee. I cannot believe that this is a

controversial statement, but I believe that most pupils ought to study

for at least one period a week, geography, history, physical education,

art and design and music. That is what amendment No. 409 would

achieve.</div><a name="06051023000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 410 and 411 would remove art and design and music from the

optional subjects. I emphasise that far from wanting to remove those

subjects from the national curriculum, I want all pupils to have to

study them. Without amendment No. 409, amendments Nos. 410 and 411

would fall. Amendment No. 412 adds IT to the optional subjects. That

amendment, too, is consequential on amendment No. 409. I am

sure that I will be criticised for shifting IT from compulsory to

optional subjects but I think that it is a worthwhile point to make in

the debate. Amendment No. 413 is also consequential on amendment No.

409. It shifts geography, history and so on from optional to compulsory

subjects. I hope that the Minister can reassure me that these

traditional core subjects will still be taught in all

schools.</div><a name="06051023000195"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000561"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Many of the amendments in this group go to the heart

of the debate on the purpose of education and reflect something of the

debate that has taken place in the education world, but that has not

had public involvement. For instance, to what extent is education meant

to prepare people for the world of work? Is it about teaching and

passing on knowledge? Or is it about teaching them how to learn, in

which case the actual knowledge that they acquire while at school is

irrelevant and can be kept to a minimum?</div>

<a name="06051023000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">My view is that people learn

how to learn by actually learning. The greater the quantity of

knowledge and concepts that children are able to acquire at school, the

better able they are, and the greater their appetite, to acquire new

knowledge in later life. All sections of society need to have had as

full an education as possible. In this global information age, an

increasing proportion of the jobs of the future will have an

intellectual content. Education enables people to get the most out of

life, whatever their background or IQ. The better educated a person,

the more they can get out of life and the more enjoyable it

becomes. Robert M. Hutchins was the chancellor of the

university of Chicago in the 1950s and was chairman of the board of

editors of the &#147;Encyclopaedia Britannica&#148; in its heyday.

He also wrote the introduction to the &#147;Great Books of the

Western World&#148;. He

said:</div><a name="06051023000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The aim

of liberal education is human excellence, both private and

public...Its object is the excellence of man as man and man as a

citizen. It regards man as an end, not as a means; and it regards the

ends of life, and not the means to

it.&#148;</div><a name="06051023000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 238A would therefore include history as one of the foundation

subjects at key stage 4 along with information and communication

technology, physical education and citizenship. Foundation subjects are

additional to the core subjects of maths, science and English. In our

original amendment No. 238, which has been split between this 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column746" />Column number: 747</div>group and the previous one, we included a modern foreign language as a

foundation subject.</div><a name="06051023000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

is important that young people understand the history of their country

and the civilisation of which it is a part. It is important also that

we understand the seminal moments in the history of other countries,

particularly those countries that impact on our own, such as the United

States, Europe and the middle east. Currently, too few children can

remember or have even been taught key dates, facts or historical

figures that are fundamental to the development of this country. Robert

M. Hutchins also

wrote:</div><a name="06051023000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

tradition of the West is embodied in the Great Conversation that began

in the dawn of history and that continues to the present

day.&#148;</div><a name="06051023000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 355 replaces the phrase, &#147;information and communication

technology&#148;, with the more modern phrase, &#147;computer

science&#148;. It was inspired by a report of the 2020 Science group

established by Microsoft Research Cambridge. The report examines the

likely impact of computing and computer science on science towards

2020. It found that science is undergoing a profound change. Whereas

computers were previously used to support scientists in their research,

the concepts, tools and theorems of computer science are now

increasingly integrated into science itself, especially in biology and

chemistry. Indeed, the report suggests

that,</div><a name="06051023000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;computer science

is poised to become as fundamental to biology as mathematics has become

to physics&#148;.</div><a name="06051023000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">That has

important implications for the education of future scientists. The

report

continues:</div><a name="06051023000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Scientists

will need to be completely computationally and mathematically literate,

and by 2020 it will simply not be possible to do science without such

literacy. This therefore has important implications for education right

now. The output of computer scientists today barely meets the needs of

the public and industrial computing sectors, let alone those required

for future science

sectors.&#148;</div><a name="06051023000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The report

recommends that education policy makers&#151;us&#151;urgently

reconsider what needs to be done to produce the kinds of scientists

that will be needed in the next decade. It

continues:</div><a name="06051023000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

education of today's children &#151;tomorrow's scientists &#151; is

something of such importance that no government can afford to get it

wrong, for failure to produce first-rate intellectual capital in a

highly competitive emerging era of 'science-based innovation' will

almost certainly carry with it serious economic

consequences&#148;.</div><a name="06051023000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specifically,

the report calls for</div>

<a name="06051023000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;bolder measures to interest

children in science and then retain their interest in it and in its

importance for

society&#148;,</div><a name="06051023000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">to</div><a name="06051023000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;urgently

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000562"></a>Mr.

Clappison:</b> Does my hon. Friend share my interest in the

number of sixth-form physics and chemistry teachers who have a degree

in their subject? Is he aware of the alarming suggestions that the

number is not as great as it should be? Would he welcome further

statistics on that from the

Minister?</div><a name="06051023000208"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000563"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I certainly would. My hon. Friend makes an important

point. I believe that we will debate a group of amendments on science

in a moment. That is why we welcome the extra 3,000 science teachers

that the Chancellor promised in his Budget. We need dramatic measures

to remedy the crisis in science teachers in this country.</div>

<a name="06051023000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause introduces to the

Education Act 2002 a new section 85, which lists the core subjects of

the national curriculum as maths, English and science, and sets out the

foundation subjects ICT, PE and citizenship. It also introduces a new

section 85A, which lists the entitlement areas&#151;subjects that

students are entitled to study. The clause says that a pupil is

entitled</div><a name="06051023000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to follow a

course of study in a subject within each of such one or more of the

four entitlement areas...as he may

choose&#148;</div><a name="06051023000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">from those listed

in subsection (2). The way in which subsection (2) is ordered means

that while a student will have an entitlement to study geography or

history, he will not have an entitlement to study both. We think that

he or she should. Amendment No. 239 would entitle a student to study

all the subjects listed in subsection

(2).</div><a name="06051023000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 84

is consequential to amendment No. 83, which would ensure that there is

an entitlement to study English literature to a level that enables the

student to take a GCSE in English literature. There is already an

entitlement to study literature, but that is included in the English

GCSE, which comprises both language and literature. The amendment would

give an entitlement to the full English literature

GCSE.</div><a name="06051023000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

372, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough,

would add Latin and Greek to the entitlement areas. He is right to say

that students who want to study those subjects should be able to do so.

It seems a little unfair that only those who can afford private

education should have that opportunity. In a previous sitting, the hon.

Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough

said:</div><a name="06051023000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In

Sheffield, we have a school that offers Latin as part of its language

specialism. I believe strongly...that it is important to offer

Latin as part of the modern language curriculum. It can be made

available to all Sheffield schoolchildren because that school offers

it. It is a result of our system&#146;s

diversity.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee

E,</i> 28 March 2006; c.

93.]</div><a name="06051023000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady is

right. It is a great pity that Latin has disappeared from the

curriculum in the majority of state schools. It is a useful discipline

that helps to explain many of the idiosyncrasies of our language and

provides a useful building block for the study of modern foreign

languages. I have never really understood why it disappeared. Perhaps

there is an official DFES line on that.</div>

<a name="06051023000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The situation is very different

in Europe. In Italy, Latin is compulsory in schools specialising in

science and language. In France, students in the literature stream have

the option of studying both Latin and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column748" />Column number: 749</div>Greek. In Germany, Latin is the third most popular foreign language,

with 650,000 students studying it in 2003. In this country, the number

of students taking Latin at GCSE has fallen from 26,000 in 1980 to just

9,500 in 2000. The number of those studying it at A-level has fallen

from 2,500 in 1980 to just over 1,000 in the year

2000.</div><a name="06051023000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those few

remarks, I wait to hear the Minister&#146;s

response.</div><a name="06051023000216"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000564"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> With your indulgence, Mr. Cook, may I briefly speak

again? I realise that I omitted to speak to amendment No. 372. My hon.

Friend has mentioned it, but I will speak to it briefly so that we can

get a response from the

Minister.</div><a name="06051023000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.

Friend said, the amendment seeks to add Latin and Greek to the list of

optional subjects that should be available for pupils. Earlier, I

mentioned Sir Keith Joseph and his views on the introduction of the

national curriculum in the 1980s. He feared that, far from setting a

minimum requirement for what should be taught, the national curriculum

could become a maximum requirement and that if something was not in the

national curriculum it need not be taught. That appears to have

happened to Latin and

Greek.</div><a name="06051023000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the House of

Lords, Lord Joseph, as he became, conceded that if we were to have a

national curriculum, it was reasonable to specify English, maths and

science, but that it should go no further. We have gone, of course,

much further. We are in a completely different world now&#151;and

certainly clause 61 takes us much further. Information technology is

now a core subject. That is perhaps fair enough. I must query what is

taught under the heading of citizenship.</div>

<a name="06051023000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fear is that if a subject

is not mentioned in the national curriculum, it need not be taught.

Nowhere does clause 61 mention the classics, nowhere does it mention

Latin and Greek. Fortunately, as my hon. Friend said, most independent

schools still offer Latin, and some still offer Greek, but the

classical languages have virtually died out in maintained schools. They

really have become dead languages, unavailable and untaught. The

foundation of so much of our language, which is so useful for the

learning of other languages&#151;particularly French, Italian and

Spanish&#151;has virtually died out. My amendment adds classical

Latin and Greek to what is on offer.</div>

<a name="06051023000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Elsewhere there is an exemption

for a school that cannot afford to offer all the options, but if enough

pupils wanted Latin or Greek I believe that a teacher or teachers would

be made available. Of course I share Sir Keith&#146;s

opinion&#151;setting a small group of subjects in stone initially was

probably a mistake, but we are where we are, and it is now incumbent on

the Minister to explain the disastrous decline in the teaching of Latin

and Greek in the maintained

sector.</div><a name="06051023000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051023000565"></a><b class="B">Sarah

Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): When listening to the hon.

Member for Gainsborough I am reminded of my own attempts to learn

classical Greek. I am sure that it was helpful in the long term, but

the only word that I can remember is <img src="greek.gif">, which means

&#147;oh dear&#148;. I remember nothing else.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column749" />Column number: 750</div><a name="06051023000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that it is useful to

have Latin and Greek on offer, but of course it is essential that

schools should be able to collaborate to do that. That is one of the

points that we tried to make a theme of our comments on the Bill. It is

not feasible for all schools to be required to offer those subjects,

but if proper collaboration goes on across an area, the young people

who want to learn them will be able to.</div>

<a name="06051023000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall comment briefly on

Conservative amendments, and I hope to catch your eye later on stand

part, Mr. Cook.</div> <a name="06051023000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

sympathetic to the notion that the theoretical approach to computer

sciences is very important to modern science, but the idea that such an

approach should be compulsory for all, as amendment No. 355 would make

it, may well be barking mad. What is essential is to familiarise young

people with the use of a computer. They should know how to use a

computer for word processing, spreadsheets and many other things that

will help them to do their jobs later in life&#151;not so that they

can understand the finer aspects of programming.</div>

<a name="06051023000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the risk of speaking

personally again, I shall never forget my panic on arriving at

Cambridge at my first compulsory IT course, for my natural sciences

degree, when I realised as I sat in front of a computer that I had no

idea how to turn the wretched thing on&#151;not the faintest clue. It

was years before I recovered enough from the combination of rising

panic, and the horror on my patient boyfriend&#146;s face as he

realised how utterly incompetent I was, to approach a computer again

and use it. Thankfully time and necessity have got me through. The

essential thing is that all young people, regardless of the subjects

that they are to study or where they will work, should know how to use

a computer. That is the basic requirement, and that is what should be

in the national curriculum.</div>

<a name="06051023000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

sympathetic to amendments Nos. 239 and 84. It seems odd that the

entitlements in the Bill require students to choose one course from

each of the different sub-groups, whereas young people are

much more likely to want to mix dance with drama or music with dance,

for example. If they have an aptitude for or interest in such subjects

and want to pursue them later such flexibility makes much more sense. I

remain very concerned and disappointed by the restrictive elements of

the diplomas on offer. It would have been far better if the Government

had used this marvellous opportunity to implement the Tomlinson

recommendations in full.</div>

Hope:</b> Implementing the amendments would constitute a

substantial change to the national curriculum&#151;indeed, it could

be described as a wholesale rewriting of the curriculum. As I

explained, clause 61 provides entitlements in science and diplomas

because of changes elsewhere. However, there are no similar

developments in other subjects to create an adequate need to make the

changes proposed.</div> <a name="06051023000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

national curriculum is a careful balance of subjects, which has

developed over the years. Indeed, key stage 4 was fully debated only

recently, and there was extensive consultation and change in 2004 to

provide more flexibility and responsiveness to individual student needs

and ensure that students were motivated by their

learning.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column750" />Column number: 751</div><a name="06051023000229"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000567"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> The words that the Minister is uttering sound

awfully complacent given the huge concern about the quality of

education in our schools. There is a reason why the Prime Minister made

education a key issue in 1997 and said that his three priorities would

be education, education, education. That concern about quality remains.

I am surprised by the Minister&#146;s complacency. He says that a

carefully developed balance of subjects has been developed over the

years, but there is a crisis in science, a rapid decline in modern

languages and a general concern about the quality of teaching in our

schools and education. I am afraid that I am disappointed by the

Minister&#146;s complacency.</div>

<a name="06051023000230"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000568"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> I am disappointed by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

efforts to run down the excellent achievements by students of all ages

in our schools that we have seen in the past nine years. He runs down

the teachers who give young people an excellent opportunity to improve

their learning and the best possible start in life. He runs down the

governors and local education authorities that work in partnership to

ensure that young people get a decent education. He talked earlier

about a lack of rigour, but his attack is typical of the Conservatives,

who left us the mess that they did in 1997. We have done a huge amount

to clear it up, and young people are registering record achievements at

the ages of 11, 14, 16 and 18. Such levels of achievement have never

been seen in this country, and they are the result of investment and

reforms of the secondary and primary education system. The hon.

Gentleman talks about complacency, but he should take great care before

talking up a crisis that does not exist and running down the

performance of students, teachers, parents and governors in schools up

and down the country.</div>

<a name="06051023000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I particularly challenge the

hon. Gentleman on what he says about the changes that we have made to

the national curriculum. In 2004, we recognised the needs of students

at key stage 4 of the national curriculum. Our curriculum must respond

to changes to our society and economy and to the global, competitive

world around us. We are modernising the curriculum&#151;science is a

good example at key stage 4&#151;to ensure that it continues to be

effective, exciting and relevant to our young people. I emphasise that

none of those changes will lower standards&#151;quite the reverse. If

we want to build on our success so that young people can progress in

their learning and to do better, as they have already, we must ensure

that the curriculum motivates and engages them and allows them to enjoy

and celebrate learning, not only while they are at school, but after

they have left and into adult life.</div>

<a name="06051023000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased to say that

standards are rising, but I also appreciate that hon. Members, both

here and outside, who have an interest in art and design, music,

history, geography, English literature, Latin or classical Greek would

like the profiles of those subjects to be raised. The Government

understand that, but those with an enthusiasm for ICT and citizenship

would not be so happy if their subjects were downgraded as a result of

the amendments. Let me talk, therefore, about some of the topics that

we have heard so much about from Opposition Members.</div>

<a name="06051023000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me talk first about

citizenship. I declare an interest, in that in the early 1980s, in a

former life, I 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column751" />Column number: 752</div>wrote curriculum packs for use in schools. One was entitled

&#147;Local government&#151;making it work for you&#148; and the

other was entitled &#147;Education for citizenship&#148;. Sadly

they are out of print, so I cannot be accused of trying to feather my

nest by mentioning those contributions to the educational development

of young

people.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000569"></a>The

Minister for Schools (Jim Knight):</b> Can they be placed in

the

Library?</div><a name="06051023000235"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000570"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> Unfortunately no copies can be put there, because I

do not think that any still exist. That is a great regret, although I

leave members of the Committee the challenge of digging one up on the

internet.</div> <a name="06051023000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is

about the importance of education for citizenship, which is essential

for young people&#146;s personal development into confident,

productive members of society who are able to deal with life&#146;s

challenges, while taking advantages of its opportunities. Citizenship

equips young people to become informed, responsible and active

citizens. That is crucial to the health of society and of our

democracy.</div><a name="06051023000237"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000571"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> I do not doubt the Minister&#146;s commitment

to citizenship, but if the Government&#146;s commitment is so great,

why is not greater investment put into the training of teachers to

teach citizenship? As we know, less than 1 per cent. of children are

taught citizenship, because there is a shortage of teachers who have

been trained to teach it.</div>

<a name="06051023000238"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000572"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Lady&#146;s support for

citizenship, for providing more training for teachers and for ensuring

that more of them have the necessary knowledge, skills, experience and

skills to teach a subject that can be challenging to get right in the

classroom. However, I am not sure that I accept the figure that she

quoted. We have a growing network of teachers trained in initial

training, during in-service training and through continuous

professional development who are able to deliver the citizenship

curriculum that is now a compulsory part of the national curriculum.

That is important, because citizenship is a subject with a big role to

play in bridging the gap in the democratic engagement of the younger

generation.</div>

<a name="06051023000239"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000573"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> Does the Minister agree that citizenship could be

taught through the ethos of the school and through subjects such as

history, rather than as a subject on its own? History is dominated by

European dictators and so could be used to teach citizenship in a much

wider

context.</div><a name="06051023000240"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000574"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> No, I do not agree. Citizenship needs to be a

subject in its own right. It can be taught through other parts of the

national curriculum, as I described in the &#147;Education for

citizenship&#148; pack that I wrote in the 1980s, which unfortunately

is no longer available for the Committee to see. Citizenship is

important and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column752" />Column number: 753</div>the Government support its being part of the national curriculum in the

way that it is, to ensure that all young people have access to

it.</div><a name="06051023000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">To refer to some

other points that hon. Members made, the statutory place of information

and communication technology in the national curriculum is crucial,

because it is a vital skill for all. The hon. Member for Brent, East

(Sarah Teather) was absolutely right to say that ICT provides a

powerful tool to support pupils in becoming successful learners, so

that they do not have the same experience that she described for us so

graphically. It is important that we should retain the current

requirements, so that all young people have the opportunity to develop

those skills. We have invested &#163;3.5 billion since 1998 to ensure

that all schools have the infrastructure to support ICT education. That

money would not have been invested by the Opposition, had they been in

government.</div><a name="06051023000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

pleased to say that art and design continues to be a popular subject at

GCSE. The development of the creative and media diploma from 2008 will

provide further opportunities for young people who might have interests

or talents in that area. Much is happening in music education, with our

music manifesto leading the way, in collaboration with formal and

informal educators, to provide rich and varied experiences for all

children. I am pleased to say that the uptake of music at key stage 4

is on the

increase.</div><a name="06051023000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">History is

already a popular subject at GCSE and beyond. From September 2006, the

QCA and Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations will pilot a new GCSE to

widen its appeal still further at key stage 4. Geography&#151;a

subject that I took at A-level&#151;remains a popular option at GCSE.

It has developed in the many years since I sat my

A-levels&#151;thankfully I passed. The subject has just received a

major boost from the action plan for geography, launched in March.

Almost &#163;2 million will go to support the subject over the next

two years, which we hope will encourage even more pupils to maintain

their studies beyond the age of

14.</div><a name="06051023000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">English

literature, which has been mentioned, is already a compulsory element

of key stage 4 of the national curriculum. Because we visit schools up

and down the country, we know that pupils are required to study a range

of plays, novels, short stories and poetry, including fiction and

non-fiction, from a variety of times and cultures. Some 83 per cent. of

pupils took the English literature GCSE in

2004-05.</div><a name="06051023000245"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000575"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The Minister will know that some people are worried

that some of the English classics have been dropped from the curriculum

to make way for a range of works from other parts of the world. Is he

concerned about

that?</div><a name="06051023000246"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000576"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> I am not concerned about it. Those who are charged

with the task of delivering English literature teaching in our schools

do so on a very well informed basis. They understand the variety and

diversity available to them when choosing the syllabuses&#151;the

plays, novels and stories that they choose to encourage young people to

study in a way that motivates them. Therein lies the critical point of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column753" />Column number: 754</div>everything that we have discussed today: not just raising standards but

engaging, motivating and encouraging young people to enjoy their

learning. When a student aged 16 says, &#147;Thank God that&#146;s

over&#148; and leaves school, we have a problem and we know that we

have failed. Young people should instead be saying, &#147;I am

looking forward to my next opportunity to learn, to develop and to

progress in my

life.&#148;</div><a name="06051023000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish

to mention Latin and classical Greek, because others have done so. We

believe the classics to be rigorous, challenging subjects and well

worth&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="06051023000248"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000577"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. I have been trying to remain silent on

this issue. Some of you may have noticed that the dreaded hearing aids

have arrived and are in place. They are remarkably effective, but they

seem to bring to my attention an extraordinarily disconcerting level of

sibilant chuntering from both sides of the Committee and occasionally

even from the back of the room. I need to be able to concentrate and

keep you people in order. Please, let us have less of it. Thank

you.</div><a name="06051023000249"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000578"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> I am grateful, Mr. Cook, because the

&#147;sibilant chuntering,&#148; as you put it, is not helping us

to pursue our task.</div><a name="06051023000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

believe that the classics are worth studying on their own merit, but

education exists to prepare young people for the challenges of the

world in which they live. There are only so many school hours in the

day, and all pupils in England already study aspects of ancient Greek

civilisation and its influence on the modern world as part of their

history study. It is for individual schools and their governing bodies

to decide whether to offer classics as part of the curriculum, based on

demand for the subject, whether they have a specialist classics teacher

available and how well it will meet pupils&#146; needs. It is not

only private schools that offer such subjects; I know of secondary

schools in my constituency that are taking up the

opportunity.</div><a name="06051023000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 84 would change the wording of the clause to accommodate previous

amendments. Assuming that we do not accept the other amendments, we

need not accept amendment No. 84. If those amendments are not accepted,

it should not be

pressed.</div><a name="06051023000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment

No. 239, pupils are currently entitled to follow one course in each of

the entitlement areas. The amendment would allow pupils to follow as

many courses in each area as they wished. I emphasise to the hon.

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that geography, history, PE,

art and design and music are all compulsory subjects at key stage 3. It

is at key stage 4 that we have introduced entitlements to provide more

choice and flexibility. Obliging schools to provide on demand numerous

courses in every entitlement area would place an impossible burden on

them. We expect all schools to make as broad a range of provision as

possible, but it is not appropriate to create an unreasonable

requirement, which it would be beyond the capacity of many schools to

deliver. Smaller secondary schools would find that particularly

impractical, so we need to strike a balance between the choices that

are made available to pupils through their 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column754" />Column number: 755</div>entitlements and the capacity of schools to deliver those entitlements.

I hope that, having heard why we resist the amendments, hon. Members

will feel able not to press them.</div>

<a name="06051023000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to finish with

amendment No. 355, which seeks to replace the teaching of ICT at key

stage 4 with the teaching of computer science. I would not go as far as

the hon. Member for Brent, East, but the terms computing and computer

science are usually taken to refer to the more technical aspects of

computing programming, computer architecture, computer systems and so

on, whereas ICT aims to develop the more generic skills that young

people need in order to create, store, develop and share information in

all its forms and to solve problems. To rename the national curriculum

programme of studies &#147;computer science&#148; would not reflect

either the aims or the content of the ICT curriculum. That is designed

to provide all pupils with the important skill of being able to make

effective use of ICT tools. Such skills are increasingly essential for

life and for work.</div>

<a name="06051023000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, we are going to debate

science under a later set of amendments. However, a number of points

have been made that I should like to correct. We are concerned about

the decline in A-level science entries, which the hon. Member for

Hertsmere mentioned. However, I want to assure the Committee that we

have recently set targets so that by 2014 the number of A-level entries

will have increased to 35,000 in physics, 37,000 in chemistry and

56,000 in mathematics. To achieve that, we will step up the

recruitment, retraining and retention of physics, chemistry and maths

specialist teachers to ensure that they are available.</div>

<a name="06051023000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased to say that there

was a 30 per cent. increase in science teacher recruitment between

1997-98 and 2004-05, and we shall further increase the number of

science teachers through recruitment incentives, training programmes

and other activities. We fully support the comments that have been made

about the importance of science, and we are taking action to deal with

the issue. I hope that, having heard my remarks in response to a wide

range of amendments, hon. Members will feel able to withdraw those

amendments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000579"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> There is concern about the curriculum content.

Perhaps it has not yet filtered through to the DFES, but in the next

few months the Opposition will hold a series of seminars on the

curriculum, reflecting real concerns among teachers and the public. The

issues need to be debated widely and in public. Too often, debates on

curriculum content have taken place inside education circles, so the

issues have not been aired in public. That is why I greatly welcome the

debate that we have had today. It has been the start of our bringing

the issues into the open so that the public can decide what is

incorporated into the curriculum that is taught to the next generation

of children, and so that decisions about such matters are not made

behind closed doors in the absence of policy makers and elected Members

of Parliament.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column755" />Column number: 756</div><a name="06051023000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been a good debate. We

will not press most of the amendments, but I should like to press

amendment 239, which would entitle a student at a secondary school to

take both history and geography, not to have an entitlement to just one

or the other. It was important to raise the issue of computer science,

which is a matter of concern to an important research body, Microsoft

Research, in Cambridge. I hope that the DFES will consider its concerns

about the long-term future scientific training of our young people, so

that computer science begins to be taught as an academic subject. I do

not say that it should be compulsory for all children in a school, but

there is a case for bringing it into the curriculum if we want to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000605"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> I should like to say a little about what I

understand by personal, social and health education and then explain

the purpose of the amendments. I see personal, social and health

education as a very important part of promoting the emotional and

social development of children and young people. We touched on the

issue early in our discussions when we talked about the importance of

emotional literacy and I praised the Government&#146;s

SEAL&#151;social and emotional aspects of

learning&#151;programme.</div><a name="06051023000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">As

far as the curriculum is concerned, I believe that personal, social and

health education should include the acquisition of information on a

range of health issues that are relevant to age, maturity and

understanding, including emotional and health well-being, sex and

relationships&#151;relationships are the most important aspect of

that&#151;diet and exercise, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, careers and

safety. It should certainly include the development of emotional and

social skills, including skills for learning, achieving, managing

change and looking after health, and the exploration and clarification

of values and beliefs, including respect, morality and an understanding

of cultural

diversity.</div><a name="06051023000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

interesting that some elements of what people perhaps talk about most

in relation to PSHE are included in the science curriculum. That

curriculum, focusing on the provision of information, needs to be well

supported in respect of the development of skills, emotional literacy

and relationship education. Everyone will be aware that there is an

enormous range of offerings of PSHE in different schools and learning

institutions. Some schools have excellent provision, whereas others

provide very little such education or provide education of poor

quality. Sometimes schools have few resources and do not invest in

their staff&#146;s professional

development.</div><a name="06051023000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment would not be effective without a commitment in respect of the

training and qualifications of the teachers involved. We often read in

the tabloids about teachers claiming that they have been made to teach

certain subjects and that they are not qualified. That is the

bottom-line, worst aspect of what I am talking about, and is

serious.</div> <a name="06051023000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that

the DFES has been running a pilot programme promoting social, emotional

and behavioural skills. The evidence so far is that those skills are

central to personal and professional success in life and are

fundamental to school improvement through contribution to environments

that support 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column757" />Column number: 758</div>effective learning and teaching, and collaborative approaches to raising

achievement, positive behaviour, full attendance, and staff and pupil

emotional health and well-being. That area underpins more or less

everything else that we are talking about and has a wide impact on

learning.</div> <a name="06051023000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendments go beyond key stage 4 and talk about key stages 1 to 3,

because we are talking about a holistic programme. Whatever the jibes,

it is vital that it starts at key stage 1. Much is made in literature

about sex education for seven-year-olds, but I shall explain why that

one small part of PSHE is vital for seven-year-olds. Like me, some

Members present served on the Committee that considered the Sexual

Offences Bill. During our deliberations, I learned a great deal about

things that I did not realise happened. For example, a child living in

an abnormal family does not know that they are living in abnormal

circumstances because they do not have a yardstick by which to measure

normality. How does a child of seven know that child abuse is not

normal if they are not receiving appropriate education at that age?

That is why it ought to be compulsory, because the very children who

need that education could be withdrawn.

</div><a name="06051023000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the amendment

picks up on various cultural differences, as hon. Members would expect.

I feel passionately about this issue. The whole core syllabus worked

through from key stage 1 has an important part to play in the future of

so many children&#146;s lives. Key stage 4 is critical in supporting

more mature learning and making sure that we are considering all the

health aspects and diet, which might concern obesity or anorexia. I

sincerely believe that it should be

compulsory.</div><a name="06051023000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have

the dubious honour of having one of the highest rates of teenage

pregnancy in Europe. I was pleased to read that the Government&#146;s

&#147;teens and tots&#148; pilot scheme is to be rolled out

further. The scheme, which fits into the framework, is offered to

youngsters who are at particular risk. It is horses for courses in what

is offered to children and young people. It has to be right and it has

to be done well with well-qualified teachers. Whether the amendment is

worded quite rightly or not, I hope that the Government will consider

having a compulsion element to this

subject.</div><a name="06051023000299"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000606"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> Those with an enthusiasm for or interest in PSHE

cannot help but be impressed by the passion with which the hon. Lady

spoke. She may not know that I share her enthusiasm. I was a member of

the national advisory group on PSHE established by the Department in

1998, in the Labour Government&#146;s first term. Without wishing to

list my literary achievements, I tell the Committee that I am the

author of &#147;Education for Parenthood&#148;&#151;a curriculum

pack for schools on that aspect of education. <i class="I">[Interruption.]

</i>Yes, a bestseller. I think that it has sold out&#151;I could not

find any more copies once I had visited the tip. I am the author also

of publications on leaving home and homelessness among young people.

Another theme that affects young people&#146;s lives is the difficult

transition from childhood to

adulthood.</div><a name="06051023000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Lady was right to stress the importance of PSHE. I can assure her that

it is taught already at all key stages from five to 16 through a

non-statutory framework introduced in 2000. Indeed, many aspects 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column758" />Column number: 759</div>of PSHE are already statutory elements of the national curriculum, such

as sex and relationships, drug education and careers guidance. All

those come under the PSHE umbrella.</div>

<a name="06051023000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry to disappoint the

hon. Lady, but we do not believe that we should make PSHE, as a whole,

a statutory subject because we do not think that making it a statutory

entitlement automatically would lead to improvements in the teaching

and learning of PSHE. She herself raised the point about training. The

clause deals with key stage 4, and introducing a new statutory subject

does not fit with the direction in which we wish to take 14-to-19

flexibilities.</div> <a name="06051023000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Lady was right, however, to highlight the importance of raising

the quality of the delivery of PSHE. It is essential that we get that

right. The example that she gave demonstrates how sensitive and

difficult it can be to teach PSHE in a classroom. Working on topics in

the way she described can lead to a number of issues that require

skilful handling such as incidents of disclosure and so on that

teachers must deal with in the classroom as lessons are being

taught.</div><a name="06051023000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our approach

would be to improve the effectiveness of what is taught in PSHE by

providing clear guidance, by supporting teachers&#146; continuous

professional development and by identifying and disseminating good

practice. We want to do that by ensuring that teachers have access to

high-quality professional development opportunities through our

investment in the PSHE certification programme, which the hon. Lady did

not mention, but which will make a real difference to standards and

quality.</div> <a name="06051023000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,

we want to continue to expand the national healthy schools programme

which requires schools to provide high-quality PSHE programmes. That

will cover a wide range of themes and topics of interest and relevance

to the issues that the hon. Lady described. We have provided schools

with additional guidance and support to help them to deliver better

PSHE including some recently published units of work from the

QCA&#151;before anyone asks, I had nothing to do with that&#151;and

have established a PSHE subject association to provide a support

network for teachers who can often feel quite isolated and

under-confident about taking on a difficult

topic.</div><a name="06051023000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, on the

requirement in the amendments for PSHE to take account of

people&#146;s cultural, religious, secular and health considerations,

we believe that the existing PSHE framework adequately addresses that

issue. Within that framework, all schools are asked to teach pupils at

key stage 4 about the diversity of different ethnic groups in order to

challenge prejudice and to work co-operatively with different people.

That is supported further by other DFES guidance on sex and drug

education, which also highlights diversity issues.</div>

<a name="06051023000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The PSHE certificate for

teachers, to which I referred earlier, asks them to demonstrate an

understanding of difference and diversity and its application to the

teaching of PSHE. On that basis and despite our shared enthusiasm for

the subject, I invite the hon. Lady to withdraw her

amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000610"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> Amendment No. 371 would restore to the governors of

a maintained school the choice of which examinations should be offered

to pupils instead of being limited to those approved by the

Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. Maintained schools may, of

course, follow only courses and examinations approved by the Secretary

of State, which in practice means the QCA. If I am wrong, I will be

corrected.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column760" />Column number: 761</div><a name="06051023000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pupils have been encouraged in

the past to pursue a general science course and qualification, and I

know from personal experience that pressure is often put on children to

do general science. I commend the Government for recognising at last

that for many scientifically gifted pupils it is better to study for an

examination in separate sciences, either all three&#151;chemistry,

physics and biology&#151;or one or two of them. That is now to be

allowed under the entitlements for students at the fourth key stage.

That is good as far as it goes.</div>

<a name="06051023000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I have been told that

the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has recast the syllabuses

this year and that examinations in those three sciences will start for

courses commencing in September this year. The new chemistry, physics

and biology courses and examinations are much simpler and of a more

general nature than heretofore, and the new GCSE in those subjects will

be much simpler and easier. Some people have accused the QCA of dumbing

them down to attract more pupils. The Under-Secretary is shaking his

head and no doubt he will let us know what is happening on the

ground.</div><a name="06051023000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is

happening, the disadvantage of the QCA&#146;s ploy is that the new

GCSE in those sciences will be a poor starting point for those wishing

to pursue one or more of those sciences to AS and A2 level. If that is

not happening, why are so many independent schools overcoming that

disadvantage by switching to the international GCSE for chemistry,

physics and biology&#151;and, by the way, for mathematics which they

say has also been hit by dumbing down&#151;which is approximately

equivalent to the old O-level, and thus a much better grounding for

pupils wanting to study sciences and mathematics to A2 level and on to

a

degree.</div><a name="06051023000320"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000611"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> I do not know whether my hon. Friend is aware

that evidence taken by the Education and Skills Committee showed that

the overwhelming number of students going to university to study core

sciences now come from the independent sector and not the maintained

sector.</div><a name="06051023000321"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000612"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> That is worrying. We discussed Latin and Greek when

debating the previous group of amendments. We are now discussing an

even more vital area for the country&#146;s future. It is just about

possible for the Under-Secretary to argue that Latin and Greek are not

vital for the country&#146;s future, but if my hon. Friend is

right&#151;she speaks with authority as a member of the Select

Committee, having listened to the evidence at first hand&#151;that

the science sector is dominated increasingly by the independent sector,

that is extremely worrying.</div>

<a name="06051023000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Under-Secretary must be

aware that there is a lively debate about dumbing down in chemistry,

physics and biology to attract more pupils, and he must be worried that

many independent schools are turning their backs on the QCA and

switching to the IGCSE. Maintained schools should, entirely at the

governors&#146; discretion&#151;I have tried to maintain that

requirement as consistently as possible in my amendments, given the

shape of the Bill&#151;have the same opportunities as independent

schools to adopt the IGCSE for those subjects.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column761" />Column number: 762</div><a name="06051023000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under my amendment, courses and

approved by the QCA, so that there is no chance, even at the

governors&#146; discretion, of going for something that is inferior

to the QCA. No one can argue with the fact that the IGCSE is better and

more demanding than the GCSE. The Under-Secretary may argue that

point&#151;although I have not heard it argued, at least as far as

chemistry, physics, biology and mathematics are concerned&#151;but I

see no harm in the Government agreeing to the amendments and giving

some of our most scientifically gifted pupils the chance to take an

internationally recognised

qualification.</div><a name="06051023000325"></a>

</div><a name="06051023000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments relate

to the study of science in our schools. Chemistry departments in some

of our key universities&#151;most notably and recently, the five-star

chemistry department at Sussex university&#151;are closing. It is

becoming increasingly clear that science education is in crisis in this

country. The principal reason given by the vice-chancellor of Sussex

university for the closure of the department was falling demand among

undergraduates for chemistry, and the principal reason for that is the

fall in the numbers studying chemistry at A-level.</div>

<a name="06051023000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 1985, there were 40,337

entries for A-level chemistry; by 2005, the number had fallen to

38,851. The figures for physics and maths are even worse: in 1985,

71,000 students entered for maths A-level; by 2005, the number had

fallen to 58,000. For physics A-level, the figures are 46,000 and just

28,000 respectively. Only biology has seen a rise&#151;from 40,000

A-level entries in 1985 to 54,000 by 2005.</div>

<a name="06051023000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why has there been such a

dramatic fall in the numbers taking chemistry and physics A-level in

the past 20 years? The answer lies in part with the double award

science GCSE, which arose as an unforeseen consequence of the last

Conservative Administration&#146;s making science compulsory at GCSE.

There was an attempt to include an element of all three sciences in

what people were required to study.</div>

<a name="06051023000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately, the double award

became almost universal in the state sector. In 2003-04, 479,000

students took the double award GCSE, compared with the 43,000 who took

the three separate sciences of biology, chemistry and physics. A large

number of those studying the three separate sciences are from the

private sector. According to a study by Professor Alan Smithers and Dr.

Pamela Robinson of the centre for education and employment research at

the university of Buckingham, only 35.9 per cent. of comprehensive

schools offer physics GCSE, compared with 78.4 per cent. of independent

schools.</div> <a name="06051023000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">That has

translated into A-level results, and the independent sector accounts

for 37.2 per cent. of the A grades at A-level physics, despite the fact

that it educates only 7 per cent. of children. That information came to

light as a result of a parliamentary question tabled by my hon. Friend

the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries). Those interested in the

state of science education in our schools will be interested in the

series of answers.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column762" />Column number: 763</div><a name="06051023000331"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000614"></a>Mr.

Clappison:</b> If it is right that independent schools are

switching to the IGCSE qualification, is it not likely that the

situation will get even worse in

future?</div><a name="06051023000332"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000615"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. I hope that we

can arrest the decline of science teaching in the state sector. They

amendments would help to do that. Also, we must make it possible for

the maintained sector to use the IGCSE, because at the moment, it is

not permitted to.</div>

<a name="06051023000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other issues are tied up with

the growth of the double award GCSE, such as the shortage of suitably

qualified physics and chemistry teachers.</div>

<a name="06051023000334"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051023000616"></a><b class="B">Dr.

Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): The hon.

Gentleman is clearly right to have concerns about science in schools

and the number of students taking science at university. However, we

know from this year&#146;s application figures that the number of

people wanting to study science at university is increasing, so it

looks as though the Government are starting to turn that

around.</div> <a name="06051023000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The picture

is much more complicated than the one described by the hon. Gentleman.

We know that students who might traditionally have gone to university

to study chemistry, for example, have been taking forensic science or

similar subjects during the past few years. The problem is not quite as

straightforward as he suggests. I do not think that he can simply blame

it on

GCSEs.</div><a name="06051023000336"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000617"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> The hon. Lady underestimates the seriousness of the

problem. The point about applications was put to the vice-chancellor of

the university of Sussex, and he pointed out that applications do not

translate into accepted places. He said that there is still a problem.

Despite the fact that applications to study chemistry at the university

are going up, their translation into places is declining. That is the

important point.</div><a name="06051023000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also,

it is not fair to say that people are going into other subjects such as

forensic science. I have not examined the university forensic science

curriculum in detail, but I suspect that it is more of a vocational

study having to do with court appearances and the like, and that it is

not as rigorous an academic subject as pure chemistry, which we need if

we are to compete in the innovative scientific world of the future. We

need people in our universities who are highly educated in the pure

sciences.</div><a name="06051023000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are

other reasons for the problem. One is teachers, but another is the

proportion of the timetable devoted to science. If a student studies

all three sciences, it takes up 30 per cent. of the timetable, whereas

studying for the double award science GCSE takes up just 20 per cent.

Science should take up 30 per cent. of the timetable regardless of

whether the pupil goes on to study science after age 16. My parents

insisted that I take all three science O-levels even though I intended

to study arts A-levels because I wanted to be a lawyer. It was the

right decision for me&#151;it gave me a more rounded and broader

education&#151;but that would not necessarily be the case for

everyone.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column763" />Column number: 764</div><a name="06051023000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give an example of how

education has been dumbed down. Prior to the takeover of the double

award science GCSE, a student wanting to study the three sciences at

A-level would almost certainly have studied them separately at O-level

or GCSE, and the three sciences would have represented about 30 per

cent. of the timetable. Today, assuming that such students are in the

state sector, they will almost certainly study the double award science

GCSE, which takes up about 20 per cent. of the timetable. Those

students will study a third less science than they would have done

prior to the advent of the double award, and will therefore be a third

less prepared for the three sciences at A-level.</div>

<a name="06051023000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 81 would

introduce an entitlement to study for separate qualifications in

biology, chemistry and physics. In other words, students would be

entitled to study the three separate sciences if they chose to do so.

The Bill entitles a pupil to study</div>

<a name="06051023000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a course of study in

science&#148;</div><a name="06051023000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">that the

provisions of the Bill and connected regulations, a pupil will be

entitled to study the three separate sciences only if the governing

body so chooses. We believe that all children should be entitled to

study the three sciences, and amendment No. 81 would allow them to do

that.</div><a name="06051023000348"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000618"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I have great sympathy with the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s remarks. Does he accept that if the Government

implemented the Tomlinson report and required all schools to

collaborate, that would provide students with an entitlement to study

the subjects that they chose? That would include the three

sciences.</div><a name="06051023000349"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000619"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I share the Government&#146;s view on the

Tomlinson proposals. They are absolutely right to reject them and to

incorporate only the report&#146;s vocational elements. How schools

deliver the entitlement would be up to them. They could do it by

collaborating with other schools in the

area.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column764" />Column number: 765</div><a name="06051023000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased to say, however,

that the Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning agrees

with us. At Education questions, he said:</div>

<a name="06051023000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we propose to establish

co-operation between schools, colleges and universities by 2008, so

that every child who wishes to choose triple science will be able to do

so.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 27 April 2006;

Vol. 445, c. 701.]</div><a name="06051023000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">That reflects

the hon. Lady&#146;s

comments.</div><a name="06051023000453"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30

pm</div><a name="06051023000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">Studying three

separate sciences at GCSE is important for pupils who want to study

science at A-level, as well as those who want to achieve a broad and

rounded education, regardless of their ultimate goals. Increasingly,

however, such options are available only in the private sector, as my

hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough said in respect of Latin. He

also said that many independent schools are opting for the

international GCSE, or IGCSE, in science, rather than the normal GCSE,

but that option is not available to the state sector. However, we shall

debate those points on amendments Nos. 241 to 243.</div>

<a name="06051023000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 431 would, from

2008, entitle all pupils who attain at least level 6 in national

curriculum tests at key stage 3 to study the three sciences. That is a

fall-back position, because we believe that all children should be

entitled to study all three sciences.</div>

<a name="06051023000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 432 would require

specialist schools to offer the three sciences to all pupils who

achieve level 6 at key stage 3. Again, that is a fall-back position,

because we believe that all children in all schools, regardless of

their specialism, should have that entitlement. However, that position

should have the support of the Government, and particularly of

Ministers who want to curry favour with the Labour party&#146;s

future leadership, because the amendment is based on the policies

announced in the Budget. According to the Budget report, the Government

have given a commitment to</div>

<a name="06051023000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;entitle, from 2008, all pupils

achieving at least level 6 at Key Stage 3 to study three separate

science GCSEs to increase progression to and attainment at A level

science&#148;.</div><a name="06051023000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">That commitment

was repeated on pages 39 and 48 of &#147;Science Innovation

Investment Framework 2004-2014: Next Steps&#148;, which

says that the Government will deliver on it by 2008. Those policies are

welcome and will receive our full support. The amendment would merely

include them in the Bill, so I hope that it will receive the

Government&#146;s full support.</div>

<a name="06051023000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, amendment No. 82 would

add the separate individual sciences&#151;physics, chemistry and

biology&#151;as an entitlement area under the Bill. Currently, the

entitlement is just science, but if the amendment were accepted, it

would allow pupils to take individual sciences in addition to

compulsory science under the core national curriculum. A pupil who is

not going to take the three separate sciences might prefer to study

just one or two of the individual sciences in more depth, rather than

take the double award GCSE or the single science GCSE.</div>

<a name="06051023000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is particularly important

given that the new so-called 21st-century programme of science study is

not an in-depth study of traditional science and not about the nuts and

bolts of physics, chemistry or biology, but more about current issues

in the debate 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column765" />Column number: 766</div>about science, such as the environment and food quality. For those who

worry about the teaching of creationism, the new OCR biology segment of

the science GCSE has a module about how</div>

<a name="06051023000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the fossil record has been

interpreted differently over time (e.g. creationist

interpretation).&#148;</div><a name="06051023000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">For

those who opt to study the single science GCSE, it would be a very poor

grounding in science. The Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong

Learning estimates that one in five will study fewer than two sciences

at GCSE. Without the additional science GCSE, that 20 per cent. will

not be properly equipped to flourish in our technically demanding

age.</div> <a name="06051023000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">Science is a

crucial subject in this new global information age. Over the past 20

years, we have seen an alarming decline in the quality and quantity of

science teaching at secondary school. The Government have promised

3,000 more science teachers, which is welcome, but we also need a more

demanding curriculum and greater opportunities to study science at a

proper level in our schools. The amendments would go some way towards

achieving that, and I hope that they will have the Committee&#146;s

support.</div>

<a name="06051023000360"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000620"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> On amendment No. 81, the British science base is

one of the things that have made this country so successful over the

past few years. That is particularly true of life science, such as

innovative drug research, and there is a large female contingent in

that specialty, which is why I am particularly interested in it.

Unfortunately, the major employers of life scientists in this country

have found it harder and harder to recruit from universities because of

the impact that not teaching pure science in the maintained sector has

had on the number of A-level and degree level

students.</div><a name="06051023000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whichever

branch of science one cares to mention, this country has been at the

cutting edge of research and development. In fact, some of us may be

reliant on drugs researched and developed in the UK by British

scientists. Zantac, which is used by those of us who suffer from

stomach ulcers, was developed not many miles from here at the Glaxo

Wellcome site in

Greenford.</div><a name="06051023000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

scientists who work on the development of drugs such as Zantac are the

best in the field. They possess scientific knowledge that has been

gathered over many years, beginning with study at GCSE level of pure

sciences, usually chemistry and biology, and then at A-level, through

to degree level and so on. Some of the UK&#146;s largest

employers&#151;Glaxo Wellcome, SmithKline Beecham and

Pfizer&#151;will not be able to continue to invest in research and

development to the extent that they do if the scientific knowledge base

in this country continues to dwindle. Those organisations are huge. I

believe that Pfizer&#146;s premises now take up almost the whole of

Sandwich and Reigate. They are almost like mini-cities, and the company

employs many thousands of people, many of them

scientists.</div><a name="06051023000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">A report

prepared by the university of Buckingham states that science subjects,

particularly physics, may die out altogether in schools. Part of the

problem, of course, is the lack of specialised science teachers. It is

almost a self-fulfilling prophecy that if pure science is not taught at

schools, students will not go on to study 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column766" />Column number: 767</div>it at university and then there will be no teachers to teach students.

The National Foundation for Educational Research has stated that

shortages of well qualified maths and science teachers are worst in

schools with low GCSE scores and in those serving the poorest

communities.</div><a name="06051023000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">What will

happen to the northern scientist, the brilliant chap who is probably

right now working on a bench in a lab at a Glaxo Wellcome or Pfizer

site? He is likely to have singed eyebrows and his shirt on inside out.

The northern scientist is a well-known phenomenon. As we speak, he is

probably developing drugs that will save lives and make the day-to-day

life of those suffering from chronic illness much more bearable. He

will have grown up in the north of England on a council estate and will

have been spotted by a teacher in a school that brought out the talent

in that young man, or woman, because it had the ability to teach

science at the level that was required for that person to go on to

contribute to those large

organisations.</div><a name="06051023000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">I well

remember a boy from my secondary school who went on to study science at

Cambridge. We had not even heard of Cambridge as a town, never mind as

a university&#151;to be frank, many of us had not even heard of

university. That boy is now one of the leading drug research scientists

in the UK, yet he came from an incredibly poor inner-city council

estate, as I did, and studied pure chemistry and biology in a secondary

modern school. Children in that school now would not have that

opportunity, as the school teaches only dual

sciences.</div><a name="06051023000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Major drug

companies traditionally do the milk round, visiting universities,

interviewing science students and competing with each other to secure

the best. The pool of emerging talent in the UK is becoming smaller and

smaller, and the drug companies are looking more to the States, Europe

and the BRIC countries&#151;Brazil, Russia, India and

China&#151;for talent. The closure of the science departments at

Essex and Sussex universities has to have an impact on the number of

students coming forward for those major organisations to

recruit.</div><a name="06051023000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not

that children do not want to study pure science at school. Figures from

the OCR exam board, which interviewed 950 children in England last year

aged between 13 and 16, revealed that 45 per cent. would take up

biology, 32 per cent. chemistry, 29 per cent. physics, and 19 per cent.

combined science, which is the only subject that will be on offer to

them. Unfortunately, combined science does not go into nearly enough

depth to enable students to study at A-level and achieve the grades

needed to go on to study to the level required by the UK&#146;s major

employers, particularly in the sciences in demand. Companies at the

leading edge of research need well qualified students who have had a

good grounding from GCSE level in the pure

sciences.</div><a name="06051023000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that

the Minister will consider our amendments. As somebody who was educated

at a secondary modern school, it grated on me to hear a witness tell

the Education and Skills Committee that an overwhelming proportion of

science students at university come from the independent sector. I take

on 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column767" />Column number: 768</div>board the point made by the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr.

Blackman-Woods) about sciences, including forensic sciences, getting

more complex. However, forensic science subjects are watered down:

there are courses in forensics with media or with other subjects, but

not in pure forensics as there used to be. It is almost as though

forensics courses are being designed to cater for the standard of

science in schools.</div><a name="06051023000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

finish with a quote from Lord Rees, the president of the Royal Society.

Talking about a report by the National Foundation for Educational

Research, he

said:</div><a name="06051023000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This

report reveals a disappointing number of teachers with a specialism in

the subjects that need it most.</div>

<a name="06051023000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">If we are to halt the worrying

decline of numbers of students studying maths and the sciences, physics

and chemistry in particular, at A-level and beyond, then we need

teachers who are both enthused and knowledgeable in the subjects that

they are required to

teach.&#148;</div><a name="06051023000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">I endorse the

view that we need teachers who are enthused and will inspire the

children in our poorer communities, who do not have the opportunity to

study science. We will not have such teachers if science continues to

be dumbed down in

schools.</div><a name="06051023000371"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000621"></a>Mr.

Clappison:</b> It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friends, and

I agree with every word they said. They raised a subject of great

importance to our country. I particularly praise my hon. Friend the

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton for his careful research into

the subject and my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs.

Dorries) for drawing on her personal experience. I am sure that the

Minister will want to respond to the important points made by her and

my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, who described the new

science courses being introduced by the Qualifications and Curriculum

Authority. The Minister will want to tell us that those courses will be

as rigorous as past courses.</div>

<a name="06051023000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">I share the concern about the

fate of sciences in the maintained sector, and I worry when I hear that

there is a shortage of children in the maintained sector studying

A-levels and going on to university. That is borne out by the overall

statistics for science, as described by my hon. Friend the Member for

Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, which are worrying. I have also seen

the statistics, and by my substandard maths it seems that the trend of

decline is accelerating. I do not know how much connection one can draw

between that and the closure of university science departments, but

common sense suggests that a decline in demand might have that

effect.</div><a name="06051023000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">There seems to

be something strange happening if, when our economy is crying out for a

good science base, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire

said, and we need more science graduates to teach, we are seeing the

closure of so many science departments in our universities. We must

consider that if we are to answer some of the questions raised in the

amendments.</div><a name="06051023000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second

Reading, I referred to the closure of science departments, particularly

in the field of chemistry. I said that chemistry departments had closed

at Sussex, Exeter, King&#146;s college, London, Queen Mary&#146;s

college, London, Dundee and Surrey. I can end on a slightly happier

note, because since then I 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column768" />Column number: 769</div>have received a letter from Surrey university telling me that I was

completely wrong, which is not entirely unusual, and that chemistry is

&#147;alive and well&#148; at Surrey. I am told by the

university:</div><a name="06051023000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our

Division of Chemical &amp; Analytical Sciences, based in the School of

Biomedical and Molecular Sciences, offers undergraduate programmes in

Chemistry, Chemistry with Forensic Investigation, Medicinal Chemistry,

and Computer-Aided Chemistry. We also offer a taught MSc and

Postdoctoral

programmes.&#148;</div><a name="06051023000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">The letter

continued:</div><a name="06051023000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It

would be good for chemistry, and the University of Surrey, if you were

able to draw the House's attention to the above during an appropriate

debate.&#148;</div><a name="06051023000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that

this is an appropriate moment to draw it to our attention. It sounds

excellent, and I commend the university of

Surrey.</div><a name="06051023000454"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000622"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> I shall first address amendment No. 371. The

Learning and Skills Act 2000 introduced the current process for

approving qualifications that are to be publicly funded and taught in

maintained schools because it was felt necessary to rationalise the

plethora of qualifications on offer and ensure that publicly funded

qualifications met certain standards. The approval process protects

learners, who know if they take an approved qualification that it is of

high quality and carefully regulated.</div>

<a name="06051023000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">The QCA is recognised in that

Act as the Government&#146;s adviser on qualifications issues. Only

when a qualification has been accredited by the QCA will it be

submitted to the Secretary of State for approval. That enables the QCA

to ensure that standards are maintained across all qualifications in

the national qualifications framework and that appropriate monitoring

and quality assurance procedures are in place. Allowing governors to

enter pupils for qualifications that have not been accredited by the

QCA or approved under the Act would be a retrograde step that would

undermine our ability to ensure that the qualifications available to

learners are high quality and rigorously

policed.</div><a name="06051023000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like

to address the IGCSE, which Opposition Members have mentioned and which

we may debate again later. I emphasise that neither Cambridge

International Examinations nor Edexcel International have ever

submitted their IGCSE qualifications to the QCA for accreditation.

However, we are aware of a growing interest in IGCSE in some quarters,

so we have asked the QCA to do some work and consider its relative

merits. Both Cambridge International Examinations and Edexcel have

agreed to take part in a QCA-commissioned comparability study of GCSE

and IGCSE, which will be completed in July on the basis of the need to

follow the correct approval procedure for qualifications, and for

maintaining the quality of

delivery.</div><a name="06051023000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that

explanation of where we are taking that debate, I hope the hon. Member

for Gainsborough will ask leave to withdraw his

amendment.</div><a name="06051023000381"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000623"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> This process will work through, so assuming that

the Bill becomes an Act and this amendment is not agreed to or pushed,

how do we get the IGCSE accepted?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column769" />Column number: 770</div><a name="06051023000382"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000624"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> The difficulty is that the awarding bodies have not

advanced their proposals through the QCA process, which, as I have just

described, is important to ensure quality. Because of the growing

interest, the comparability study, which will report in July, will

bring forward proposals to overcome those dilemmas. The qualification

will still have to go through the formal process, as we go forward. I

should like to reassure the hon. Gentleman that there is awareness of

the issue and an attempt to take steps to resolve

it.</div><a name="06051023000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to turn to

amendments Nos. 81, 82, 431 and 432. As a former science teacher,

regrettably without a book to my name on how to teach

science&#151;</div><a name="06051023000384"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051023000625"></a><b class="B">Jonathan

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000626"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> It is a catalogue of

books.</div><a name="06051023000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">I share the

aspiration to strengthen the opportunities available for pupils to

pursue science learning. Given that enthusiasm for science learning, I

consider that the clause as originally drafted, along with other

measures, would be more effective in achieving the aspiration that

Opposition Members have

articulated.</div><a name="06051023000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

science entitlement in clause 61 is designed to ensure that all key

stage 4 pupils are able to follow science courses that prepare them for

further study of physics, chemistry and biology at A-level and beyond,

through two routes: either by taking the three GCSEs in physics,

chemistry and biology or the two GCSEs in science and additional

science. At this stage, I should like clearly, on the record, to reject

the notion articulated by the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and

Littlehampton and for Mid-Bedfordshire that science GCSEs are being

dumbed down. I do not particularly like that phrase, either. I reject

any suggestion from Conservative Members or anyone else that the new

science GCSEs lower standards in any way. The new GCSEs maintain the

breadth, depth and challenge of the current GCSEs and will continue to

prepare pupils well for A-levels in physics, chemistry and biology.

That is not just the Government talking; I have a range of supportive

quotes. The chief executive of the Association for Science Education,

Derek Bell,

said</div><a name="06051023000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

introduction of the new range of GCSEs in science is the result of a

widely based consensus across the science and industrial communities.

These new courses will challenge students to think and engage in the

processes of science rather than simply &#145;learn by

rote&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="06051023000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">The vice

president of the Royal Society

said:</div><a name="06051023000442"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Many

scientists are extremely supportive of reforming the science curriculum

to make it more relevant to young people and more revealing about

science. We hope that the new suite of science GCSEs will give young

people a more accurate taste of the true dynamism of science and the

scientific method, as well as inspiring students about science and

encouraging more of them to choose science after the age of

16.&#148;</div><a name="06051023000389"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000627"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I guess that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

prickliness is evidence of guilt. We have heard that fewer students

from the maintained sector are studying sciences and that fewer

students from the maintained sector are studying languages. We know

that many English students are studying second-rate texts and that many

people who are studying history do not know much about the chronology

of history. There is a 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column770" />Column number: 771</div>crisis in respect of rigour and standards, and the hon. Gentleman should

wake up and do something about

it.</div><a name="06051023000390"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000628"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> The hon. Gentleman disappoints me. He has joined his

hon. Friend on the Front Bench once again to criticise children and

students who are working extremely

hard.</div><a name="06051023000391"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000629"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give

way?</div><a name="06051023000392"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000630"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> I shall not give way, because I, like my hon.

Friends, am becoming tired of the continual running down of the work of

our teachers, schools and governing bodies and the achievements of our

young people at every level in the school system today. It simply will

not do to use children for political point scoring and ammunition for

the Conservatives&#146; failed

ideology.</div><a name="06051023000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">I now wish

to slay two other dragons. Sussex university will not be making a final

decision about whether its chemistry department will close until later

this month. If it does close, other universities in the south-east will

provide extra chemistry places to compensate. The fact is that in the

current academic year we have seen a 12 per cent. increase in the

number of students applying to study chemistry. We shall see a further

5 per cent. increase next

year.</div><a name="06051023000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">In passing, the

hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to the OCR and

its inclusion of creationism. Let me clear about such matters. I want

to nail this one once and for all. Creationism is not part of the

national curriculum for science. It is a belief and, as such, does not

lie within scientific understanding. Of course, there is scope for

pupils to discuss creationism as part of religious education when

developing their knowledge and understanding of Christianity and other

religions. The OCR specification that the hon. Gentleman mentioned

specifically does not in any way show that creationism has scientific

validity. I hope I have put that matter to

bed.</div><a name="06051023000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 81

focuses student entitlements on the three separate subjects of physics,

chemistry and biology. However, the other route of studying the two

GCSEs in science and additional science is also an important route

towards studying sciences at A level. By adding sciences to the four

entitlement areas that exist currently for key stage 4 students,

amendment No. 82 would give them an entitlement to only one course out

of biology, chemistry or physics, although I appreciate that that was

probably not the intention behind the amendment. By providing an

entitlement to only one course out of the three, the amendment would

secure the provision that would only prepare students to study one of

those subjects at A level. As such, it would be a weaker entitlement

than that provided under clause 61, as

drafted.</div><a name="06051023000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe

that early specialisation is not suitable for most pupils. The majority

currently study two GCSEs&#146; worth of science rather than the

three separate sciences. That has enabled them not only to prepare for

further study of science at A level, but to broaden their education

with another GCSE in a different subject. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column771" />Column number: 772</div>We know that maths and ICT are also compulsory subjects at key stage 4.

Pupils who study physics, chemistry and biology GCSEs in addition to

ICT and maths GCSE obviously have less spare curriculum time to follow

a wider education, including arts, humanities and modern foreign

languages.</div><a name="06051023000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a

science entitlement does not also promote the GCSEs in science and

additional science, it will not provide an appealing offer for many

pupils. I want the statutory entitlement to encourage all pupils to

study enough science to progress to A levels, not only to focus

effectively on a narrow entitlement that might be of interest only to

young science

enthusiasts.</div><a name="06051023000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 431 would give a statutory entitlement to a pupil who has reached

level 6 or above at key stage 3 to a course of study at key stage 4,

leading to separate qualifications in the three sciences. Amendment No.

432 would mean that specialist science schools would have to offer from

2008 key stage 4 courses of study, leading to qualifications in the

individual sciences to pupils who had achieved at least level 6 at key

stage 3.</div><a name="06051023000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the

amendments were accepted and schools were forced to provide physics,

chemistry and biology GCSEs to some or all of their pupils, there would

be a real risk that schools might focus only on providing those three

subjects and may not offer the science and additional science GCSEs,

which, as I have already said, are the more appropriate to the majority

of pupils. Securing science for the science enthusiasts would be at the

cost of eroding science provision for the

majority.</div>

<a name="06051023000400"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000631"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I accept the technical points that the Minister

has made about the amendment, but does he accept that if schools work

in collaboration it should be possible to arrange the entitlement so

that young people could move to other schools to study individual

sciences? The Government should encourage

that.</div><a name="06051023000401"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051023000632"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> I am happy for schools to work collaboratively, but

there are amendments to which we shall come later that would prevent

that, because certain subjects would be barred from collaborative work.

That is nonsense, and the whole development of our 14-to-19 strategy,

with collaboration between schools and FE colleges, greatly widens

choice, opportunity and curricular entitlement for young people. My

point is that the Government&#146;s approach secures the opportunity

both to study three separate sciences and to study science and

additional science. The statutory science entitlement in clause 61 will

secure science learning suitable for all key stage 4 pupils, and other

measures will provide GCSEs in physics, chemistry and biology for those

pupils who wish to undertake a greater amount of science learning at

key stage 4.</div><a name="06051023000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton himself mentioned the

Government&#146;s document entitled &#147;Science and Innovation

Framework 2004-2014: Next Steps&#148;, which contains commitments to

ensure that our ablest young science students have access to

triple-science GCSEs. That includes pupils who achieve at least level 6

at key stage 3. The Government are also committed to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column772" />Column number: 773</div>ensuring that all specialist science schools will offer GCSEs for

physics, chemistry and biology at least to all pupils who achieve level

6 at the end of key stage 3. That will be achieved by the end of

September 2008. That is not an attempt to curry favour with any part of

the Labour party leadership; it is a sensible way to deliver better

science education.</div><a name="06051023000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of

course it is right to give our ablest young scientists the opportunity

to study more science, but it will also be appropriate for the majority

of pupils to continue to study physics, chemistry and biology as 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column773" />Column number: 774</div>part of two science GCSEs. Taken together, the Government&#146;s

commitments in the area form a more balanced package of measures than

the amendments. They will benefit all young people with an interest in

and an aptitude for science, and I believe that that approach provides

the most practical way to achieve the effect desired by hon. Members. I

therefore ask that the amendments be

withdrawn.</div><a name="06051023000455"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.57
