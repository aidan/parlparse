they so wish, can remove their jackets during the Committee meetings.

                        <p class="tabbed">As a general
rule, I and my fellow Chairs do not intend to call starred amendments
that have not been tabled with adequate notice. The required notice
period in Public Bill Committees is three working days. Therefore,
amendments should be tabled by the rise of the House on Monday for
consideration on Thursday and by the rise of the House on Thursday for
consideration on Tuesday.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000008">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Not everyone
is familiar with the process of taking oral evidence in Public Bill
Committees, so it might help if I briefly explain how we will proceed.
The Committee will first be asked to consider a programme motion on the
amendment paper, debate about which is limited to half an hour. We will
then proceed to a motion to report written evidence and then to a
motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in private in advance of
the oral evidence sessions, which I hope we can take
formally.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000009">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Assuming that
the second of those motions has been agreed to, the Committee will then
move into private session. Once the Committee has deliberated, the
witnesses and members of the public will be invited back into 
the room, and our oral evidence session will begin. If the Committee
agrees to the programme motion, the Committee will hear oral evidence
this afternoon.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000010">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On the
question of the programme motion, the amendments tabled in the name of
the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr Goodwill) are intended
to remove the names of organisations that are not able to send
representatives. Since the amendments were tabled, two further
witnesses have had to drop out because of the bad weather: Hampshire
Chamber of Commerce, which was due to replace Southampton Chamber of
Commerce in the original list; and the East London Small Business
Centre. That leaves Wenta alone in the second panel.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000011">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Therefore, in
order that amendment (b) on the amendment paper should reflect the
current situation, I suggest that the Whip moves it in amended
form—namely, leaving out Cambridgeshire Chamber of Commerce,
Southampton Chamber of Commerce, Portsmouth Chamber of Commerce, London
First and East London Small Business Centre.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000012">&#160;</a>

creation in new, young and small enterprises. It is obviously a very
good idea, and we supported it when it was announced by the
Conservative party before the general election. In a perfect world we
would have tweaked it and we would have probably gone a little further,
which you would probably expect us to say. For the time we are in, and
with the fiscal constraints that the Treasury is working under, we
think the Bill is very good. The principle of the idea is very

in a situation in which you are trying to engender a culture of
employment, you have to look at ideas that are, in essence, a little
experimental and perhaps more radical than normal. There are, as Priyen
said, issues surrounding the establishment of businesses, the age of
businesses the scheme applies to and also the geographical areas it
applies to. The fundamental principle of trying to encourage employment
among our businesses is a good one.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000036">&#160;</a>

                           </em> As I said, in a perfect world we would have
liked this policy to be applied to all of the UK, including the
south-west, the east of England and London, because there are pockets
within those regions that obviously have high unemployment, or could do
with a boost to the private sector. Secondly, we would have gone a
little bit further and seen what the capability and capacity was to
extend it to microbusinesses, businesses that are currently trading,
and may have experience of hiring and are in the marketplace at the
moment. But that is in a perfect world. At the moment is it detrimental
to those areas? I am not sure it is, but in a perfect world it would
obviously be very beneficial if it had been rolled out to those three
excluded
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000038">&#160;</a>

Hughes:</strong>
                           </em> The fiscal impact of the measure is the crux
of the problem. If you extend it to those regions, there is a fiscal
impact of around £650 million. The problem associated with any
area of policy is that we have to keep a tight rein on these things at
the moment. It is all very well saying £650 million here or
another policy area taking a fiscal impact of another few million
pounds there, but given the situation with the deficit and certainly
the approach adopted by the coalition Government, these are the regions
that can better absorb economic shocks, have greater economic activity
and greater capacity for private sector employment, so it seems natural
that if any areas were to be excluded  it would be
those.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000039">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Government have argued that this scheme is to
support areas where there are high levels of public sector employment
that will be hit by redundancies and job losses. Statistics show that
23 of the top 100 constituencies for public sector employment are in
London, the south-east and east. How do you think your members in those
areas will react when they are defined, according to the
Government’s own definition, as a high public sector area yet
they will not be able to apply to a scheme that will help with
deprivation and advance the Government’s stated objective. Do
you have any views on
that?<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000040">&#160;</a>

where there are higher levels of public sector employment and where the
scheme does not apply. In policy terms context is everything and if you
look at the regions outside the south-east, the eastern region and
London, those are the areas that are most dependent on public sector
money, first and foremost. It is not just about the narrow definition
of pure employment. The figures for the contribution to gross value
added in those areas of public sector employment to which the scheme
applies are much higher than in the three regions that are
exempted.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000041">&#160;</a>

Steve’s members too, do not define themselves as a business in a
certain area. They define themselves as businesses that are providing
goods to their marketplace, essentially. Their marketplace could be in
one area. It could be in one region. It could be in one constituency.
But for many businesses, their market footprint is actually quite large
and will cover perhaps two or three regions and numerous
constituencies.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000042">&#160;</a>

Hughes:</strong>
                           </em> I think there is a potential behavioural
effect. Ultimately the policy is in part experimental. When the
Treasury comes to analyse what happened with the policy and the jobs it
created and its behavioural effects, that is something that clearly
needs to be looked at. There are competition issues around that. We
fully recognise that there is a potential issue around whether
companies locate in a certain area rather than another because of the
holiday. But again it is about the not easy decision of cost versus
benefit. You may have to take as part of the policy cost potential
competition issues at a local, sub-regional level.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000044">&#160;</a>

                           </em> It will obviously have some behavioural impact
on people who are looking to start up a business and looking to employ
people almost from the first day. The other thing businesses will look
at when they are looking to start up a business is where they can start
up—where they should start up. That could be infrastructure or a
skills base. This obviously provides an incentive for them to start up
a business that will employ people very quickly, in a certain area or
not in a certain area.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000045">&#160;</a>

tend to employ people when there is added demand to the
company—when invoices are becoming greater in volume and when
they are looking to expand. That is obviously something that will
provide a fiscal incentive, but it is a fiscal incentive that is, as
Steve has mentioned, quite experimental. I do not know of any other
tax, or incentive in the form of tax, that is regionally based. Most
taxes cover most of the country. It is an interesting experiment, but I
think it will have some behavioural impact on
businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000046">&#160;</a>

Government have estimated between about £900 million and
£1 billion. The potential amendments that we have included could
increase the resource and divide it in different ways. If that resource

chambers of commerce generally, would you would think of using it in a
different way?<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000049">&#160;</a>

good amount to give. Looking at a policy such as this, we might have
looked at reducing the number from  10 to maybe five, and then
stipulating that for businesses that are already in
existence—maybe for just a number of years—the next three
employees or the first three employees they hire would also receive
this type of help. The principles are still the same; it is just a
little tweak to the policy. That is the only difference I would

I think you both said earlier? You recognised that to roll the scheme
out to the other three regions, which are currently proposed to be
exempted, would cost about £650 million out of a scheme that
will cost about £940 million in total. Are you saying that in
your view, taking into account the fact that we have to get the deficit
down and the needs of those three regions, it would not be a good idea
to spend that additional £650 million in that way?<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000053">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I would return to what I touched on earlier,
which was essentially that if you, as a representative group such as we
are, talk to civil servants and officials about policy implementation
that costs money the question now comes back—quite rightly
so—“How are you going to pay for it?” If we were
to use that £650 million for this scheme, it would not be
available for possible infrastructure spending, capital spending or
other elements of the business policy world that we see as vital and as
part of the package that will help economic recovery. Again, it goes
back to the point that, taking the behavioural effects of the
boundaries of the exemption into account and looking at household
spending statistics, birth and death rates and the business statistics
that were released yesterday, those three regions were historically,
and still are, the main drivers of UK growth. They will be able to
absorb economic shocks in a more robust manner than the other regions,
which are more dependent on public sector spending, and they will
continue to do so. They will drive recovery and drive out of the
recession or downturn quicker than those other regions. When there are
limited resources, it is better to focus them on the regions most in
need.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000054">&#160;</a>

Steve has said. As you can imagine, all businesses—small, medium
or large and wherever they are based—are competitive by nature.
Business people are like that. If a business is based in London or the
south-east and a policy like this is presented to them, the first two
questions they will ask are, “Why am I not eligible?”
and, “Why is my region not eligible?” As Steve said, GVA
records and historical factors show that private sector growth and
drivers in these areas are quite strong. The principle behind the Bill
is obviously to boost private sector economic activity in the other
regions.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000055">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The national insurance holiday is basically
permissive, in a sense, rather than prescriptive. In other words,
companies have to actively apply for it, rather than being given it
when they set up, which then brings into play this whole issue of how
it is advertised and marketed as a scheme. My concern, or one of the
concerns that I might have, is that we don’t get the message out
effectively, so I would very much value comments from both of you on
how you think we should ensure that new start-ups are very aware of
what is on offer here.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000056">&#160;</a>

                           </em> It is a very important point. I can point to
examples throughout the stimulus package where recession-specific
measures such as the enterprise finance guarantee and the trade credit
insurance scheme were potentially—certainly in their infancy as
a policy—not necessarily as successful as they could be, because
of the communication of their availability to the business
community.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000057">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
can give you other examples as well. We sent in freedom of information
requests about national minimum wage advertisements for the change in
its rate, and, in 2008-09, £874,000 was spent on advertising to
the business community the national minimum wage uprating. Last year,
it was £850,000. So far, there has been no resource allocated to
change for next year. In the fiscal environment, there is a question of
how much money is dedicated to ensuring that the business community is
aware of that. It is not just about resource from central Government;
representative bodies also have a responsibility to highlight these
changes, as do things like Business Link and the end of the regional
development agencies and the creation of the local enterprise
partnerships. It is through all those channels that it has to be
communicated.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000058">&#160;</a>

have seen Government policies where those channels haven’t
necessarily been utilised, but if the Government want to get the most
out of it, you properly use every available resource to ensure that the

about

promotion of this scheme is vital. I checked on the HMRC website this
morning, and there is a little box right down in the corner, which you
have to scroll all the way down to find, but it doesn’t actually
say what it is. You click on it, and then you have to go through a
whole process. It needs to be promoted, because it is good policy, and,
as Steve said, LEPs probably aren’t the place for this to be
looked at—local authorities, perhaps. It is up to the Treasury
to be creative and innovative in a tight fiscal environment, and to
ensure that small businesses, or new businesses, look at the scheme.
For example, 72% of our members use accountants. They start talking to
accountants almost from day one. Perhaps the Treasury should start
looking at accountancy, trade bodies, or the ongoing training that
accountants do to plug the scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000063">&#160;</a>

awareness of the scheme among potential new businesses. I would
normally ask whether any of your existing members had made inquiries
with you, but I assume not because new businesses would not yet be your
members. Would it be a good idea to require all communication,
literature, websites, mailings or whatever, that HMRC has with new
business start-ups to have a clearly marked section or a link to a
website to market and promote the scheme?<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000064">&#160;</a>

businesses, as Priyen said, quite a lot of the time it is between
accountants acting as agents of behalf of businesses, and HMRC. The
message should be getting to them anyway. I can give another example of
the way in which a recession-specific scheme has benefitted businesses.
The time to pay scheme was well advertised through HMRC. It was an
existing scheme, but it was beefed up in a time of tight credit and
many more businesses utilised it as a result. HMRC is the perfect
vehicle for that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000065">&#160;</a>

are HMRC-bound, whether that is through employment, through changes,
through CD-ROMs and all the rest. It is not about an increase in the
number of letters from HMRC, because those mailshots probably cost a
lot of money. It is about utilising the mailing and information that

not know whether enough has been put into that. Have you seen the
suggestion in the regulatory impact assessment that apparently 240 HMRC
staff are to be dedicated to the promotion and administration of the
scheme? Do you have a sense of whether that is sufficient or whether,
in your experience, getting through to HMRC and getting information for
your members has always been sweetness and light and straightforward?

assessment, as I understood, that was not  broken down into how
much will be in stakeholder engagement, as opposed to the general
administration of the scheme’s operation. Certainly, the
principal Government Departments that we work with, such as the
Government Equalities Office, the Department for Business, Innovation
and Skills, the Treasury and HMRC, have stakeholder engagement. They
have specialists and people whose job it is to engage with the business
community and get things out there. Some of those stakeholder
engagement functions are naturally more effective than others, and it
requires leadership from those Departments that sponsor them, such as
HMRC, to ensure that the message gets

The first, in one sense, relates to the 800,000 people in
the impact assessment to whom it would apply. Even the businesses that
take on those 800,000 people will have extra resource to allocate how
they wish as a start-up company, which could be for investing,
advertising, marketing or whatever they want. That is a fundamentally
good principle to follow for a start-up business, allowing it to have
the freedom to do that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000071">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Whether it
will create new jobs is a difficult question. I have no doubt that some
start-ups will be incentivised to take on people, and the national
insurance holiday will be one of a number of factors that a business
start-up uses in trying to take on staff. So, it is difficult to say
whether it will on its own, but it will certainly contribute to a
beneficial outcome for the employment market.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000072">&#160;</a>

Government were going to put national insurance up by 1%, we calculated
that that would cost 57,000 jobs. So, it has a negative impact. We also
asked before the election, “What trigger points would lead to an
extra employee?” We did not ask, “What would you like as
an everyday cut in a rate, or investment in something?” but
“What would actually trigger you to employ someone?” Some
60% said that a cut in employee costs would incentivise them to take on
employees. However, it is important to remember that businesses will
not employ someone for the sake of it; there has to be that demand,
extra invoices, and extra orders coming into the business for it to go
and get someone.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000073">&#160;</a>

not necessarily take on full-time staff straight away, but they might
lose out on some of the NI holiday relief, simply by virtue of having

scheme is designed to apply to new businesses mean that communicating
it—and, I think we all agree that communicating this is an
important part—would, in a sense, be easier? That is because
when a new business comes to interact with the tax system for the first
time, the scheme applies, which is rather unlike the minimum wage
legislation, where you have to talk to existing businesses that have
already been implementing the bureaucracy in a certain way. The first
time a business asks, “How do I have to comply with the tax
system?” is the point at which the Bill will have an impact on
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000077">&#160;</a>

entering the business world for the first time. People may have
preconceived ideas because of how they have set up previous businesses,
and they may try to apply them. There is a different make-up of the
base of the start-ups that exist in the UK, but I agree that there is
potential for the lines of communication to be easier if those
businesses are going to Business Link, for example, and that kind of
thing. Then again, that all depends on the quality of advice that is
given.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000078">&#160;</a>

of the problems with the enterprise finance guarantee was that the

with this, because targeting existing businesses is not easy, but it is
easier than targeting those businesses that have just started, or are
in the process of starting. Looking at current Government policy, one
of the new initiatives is the mentoring scheme. Have HMRC and BIS been
communicating about that? As Steve mentioned, banks are a port of call
when a business starts up. The business goes to a bank and it usually
gets the small and medium-sized enterprises start-up box. The question
is what communication has happened between HMRC and the banks within
that box, to ensure that that information covers the initiative as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000080">&#160;</a>

would have a behavioural impact on where it locates and what employment
intentions it has. It comes back to the point that this proposal could
be for £5,000 or £15,000, but the business will only
employ someone if there is demand. You can incentivise quite a lot, and
that will have an impact on employment intentions, but the biggest
driver to employment—or loss of employment—is business
activity and demand coming into the business. When demand drops off,

of a number of measures that need to be taken. If you take it in the
context of, say, things such as corporation tax reform, an essentially
pro-business message is being given out. Possibly, we need to go
further and to look at exemptions on elements of the regulatory
regime—planning, for example. We could look at new-generation
enterprise zones in areas that struggle to generate private sector
employment. That is why I go back to what I said before, which is that
when you talk about rebalancing, it has to be ever-more radical; there
is not necessarily an easy answer under existing policy

the Government as a whole becoming slightly more creative and slightly
more innovative in policy making. One thing that the Prime Minister
before the election said when he visited Northern Ireland was that we
could look at making it an enterprise zone. That would obviously imply
different criteria for regulation, planning, the tax regime and perhaps
capital investment, which would be slightly different from other
regions of the UK. This is a creative policy, and being a bit creative,
without being too creative, let us say, is welcomed, but because it is

for quite a while now, and something called post-implementation review
is not necessarily carried out as a matter of course by Government
Departments when it should be. There needs to be more robust
implementation of that approach of analysing policy, its suitability,
how it can be developed and how it can go forward. Without that, what
is the point really? The whole point of the impact assessment process
in the first place is to ascertain the cost and benefit of each policy.

unprecedented, so it obviously requires some analysis.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000102">&#160;</a>

million of cost across the companies that might be expected to take

potentially a highly administratively onerous scheme? Or is it at a low

relating to survival rates of small businesses. My constituency in
south-east London has a higher than average number of firms going out
of business within the first year or the first two to three years. What
information do you have about regional variations in survival rates and
how do you assess the exclusion of London, the south-east and the east
from the proposals? Do you see connections between this national
insurance holiday and survival
rates?<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000129">&#160;</a>

much of a relationship between the two. Ultimately, if a business sets
up in an excluded area and does not survive its first two years, the
maximum that it could claim over the first year would be
£50,000. Would that £50,000 really put it out of

couple of years. But I know how close to the breadline very small
businesses in parts of London can be when they are setting up. I also
recognised what the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses said
previously about many businesses in the south-east working below
capacity—which was what was driving my question—and the
calculations that businesses make about whether they can continue. I
just wondered whether the national insurance holiday would have some

other larger companies and, indeed, the public sector for their demand.
They are all going to be cut and, as of yesterday, I understand,
bankruptcies are up and consumption is down, and you will be much more
savagely affected by that than can be compensated for by marginal
changes in the tax regime. Is that a fair
assessment?<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000138">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The reduction in demand energies of the public
sector will obviously have an impact on businesses. There is no doubt
about that. Where this policy could come in is in helping a business
that already has an employment structure or plan to take somebody on
and maybe cushion a loss in demand for a short period of time. That is
quite a dangerous business plan to lead on, because you are taking
somebody on who may not be as productive, in terms of achieving demand
levels, as other employees would have been in the
past.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important that, where demand or invoices from all sorts of places
reduce, businesses look at where else they may go, what else can they
do and at diversification. That is the key thing for most of our
members, which are small and predominantly micro businesses. A lot of
our members don’t have regular contracts with big Government
Departments or big local public agencies—a lot of it is business
to business—but a proportion will be dealing in one-off
contracts with the local primary care trust, the local authority, fire
brigade or
whomever.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000140">&#160;</a>

was better targeted? Rather than on a simple regional basis, it could
be targeted, perhaps, on  a local authority basis, so that
somewhere like Luton could be more fairly treated, and a more
prosperous area of the south-east—the Surrey heartlands or
whatever—would not get the same cash

before, we can all point to areas within these regions that suffer from
higher rates of unemployment and that are more reliant on the public

Ultimately, all you do by trying to drill down into those areas
in  the exempted regions is increase the complexity of 
the scheme. I know it is not necessarily ideal, but the straightforward
nature of the scheme in the regions where it exists far outweighs the
complexity of implementing it at a very targeted sub-regional

general view is that, if you are going to apply a scheme such as this,
it should be fairly applied across the country. When you start to draw
lines and say that the scheme applies only to certain areas—I
stand by the paper—it is divisive and it is unfair for those
areas that are unable to gain the benefit, if any benefit comes from
the scheme. Just to draw a line and say that it is not going to be
applied across London, the south-east or the east is unfair. Kelvin
said just now that areas in Luton definitely needed help, and there are
always pockets that need such assistance. So when you just draw a line
arbitrarily and say that a scheme will apply to only one area of the
country, I cannot see any fairness in
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000151">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There will be a range of discussions on a number
of alternative models for the distribution of the scheme, as opposed to
the current model before the Committee. There will be, for example, the
model of a universal scheme across the whole United Kingdom. There will
be the model of a scheme that applies to specific local authorities.
There will be a model that applies across the country in areas of high
public  sector employment that might lose jobs. There is the

have read through the documentation and listened to your explanation

making a scheme that is very complicated to understand. For people who

Hertfordshire, in diverse areas, from Watford to areas in
Potters Bar. We cover areas that have very low unemployment, such as
Chorleywood but, on the other hand, you can go to a place such as
Borehamwood, which has very high unemployment. We work in Luton, and I
agree with what Kelvin was saying—there are areas with real
pockets of deprivation. We run the innovation centre in Hertfordshire.
It is based in Stevenage, which has a very high level of deprivation in
an area called Bedwell. We see areas of deprivation, and we have
delivered programmes that try to target such areas—frankly, it
is very difficult. For example, the SRB programme was very targeted,
but it is difficult to achieve long-lasting results where you try and
do it by postcode, or whatever. It does not
work.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000157">&#160;</a>

consistent and long-term programme, which is not changed by the whim of
whatever every year, or every two years. One of my criticisms about
Business Link, which was a good idea in its original concept, was that
its objectives were changed so frequently that it did not always meet
the criteria that it was set up to achieve. The problem is that we are
overburdened in our area by “initivative-itis”. You get
set up to run one programme, which runs for a short time and suddenly,
before you know it, it has gone and there is something else to be set
up. That sort of thing is disruptive, and unless there is a long-term
programme of support, I cannot see it having a massive impact or
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000163">&#160;</a>

believe there is an unfairness if you apply it only to certain areas
and not across the country. But as an overall statement, I think
employers’ national insurance is an unfair tax on employment. It
actually has a detrimental effect within the economy. An organisation
like ours, on our income and the moneys that we generate through our
operation, paid back to the Government last year about £110,000
in employers’ national insurance. As a not-for-profit company,
if we were not paying that we could do an awful lot of good with that
money and a lot of other organisations could do the same. That is what
I am saying in that

                           </strong> Chris, thank you very much for this paper.
Unfortunately, some of us received it quite late. Having just read
through it, I feel I should press you on what I fear is a major
inconsistency in it. I am not arguing for or against it, but half your
paper calls for the abolition of the employers’ contribution to
national insurance. We referred to it during the election as a job tax,
and I accept the basic premise of this. But the other half of your
paper refers to organisations in Watford, which I am familiar with, and
elsewhere that you sit on. The main complainants seem to be people who
rely on public funds to operate, CVS being a good example. I feel there
is an inconsistency there. That links with the holiday that the
Government have announced, because many people in Government—in
fact, many people on both sides of the House—would, in
principle, be in favour of reducing taxes as much as possible to
incentivise business.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000180">&#160;</a>

Government, as you know, were faced with the biggest debt in history,
and all of the other problems. There is already a big tax burden on
business, and it would seem to me that, although the holiday has
imperfections—regional imperfections being one of them, which we
are discussing today—fundamentally, in the short term, it was
all that could be done, because of our burden of debt. Do you agree
with that

country’s finances is dreadful. I wrote the paper to be
thought-provoking, if you like. I was saying that there are other ways
that you might want to think about in the longer term. It is not
possible to do it now, but I did not write it with the intention of
saying that it has to be done now. It is about getting people to think
that there are other ways of creating taxation. You have different
objectives, do you not? You have, as I said in my evidence, a problem
between the minimum wage and social benefits, and you have difficulties
with the levels of business taxation. I wrote it to be a little
provocative and suggest that we should consider such things. There
might be an inconsistency, but I accept that it is not a perfect
document—I had very little time to write
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000182">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> First, I found your paper really interesting. It
was one of the most interesting papers I have read for a long time. I
agreed with much of it, and, as you say, it was thought-provoking. The
point that you make is that shifting the burden of taxation from
employment to profits and to incomes would help generate employment.
Generating employment would reduce the level of benefits paid out and
increase the level of tax paid in, which would help reduce the deficit
and boost the economy in many ways. That is very helpful, and I must
say that I do not find much with which to disagree. Is your basic
argument that marginal tax incentives unfairly distributed across the
country will not help very
much?<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000185">&#160;</a>

across Hertfordshire, and we have nearly 300 businesses operating
between those centres, so we are in contact with small businesses all
the time. There is no question but that access to finance for those

start-ups and I have thought that for a long time. It does not matter
whether it is a start-up in Surrey or in Barrow-in-Furness, if it is a
new business it may need some help, and, if it is there, it should be
available for all. I have never thought it fair to be so selective
about where such schemes apply. My view is that you should apply them

communicating and marketing the new scheme. Obviously our preliminary
focus has been on making sure we have the legislation ready. But now
that we have the legislation and the guidance ready this is the range
of the kind of things that we have done: we have a new
employers’ helpline and anybody phoning that gets to hear a
recorded message telling them about the NICs holiday from the time that
it was announced. All new employers receive fliers together with the
material they need to set up a pay-as-you-earn scheme telling them
about the holiday. We have been in discussion with employer
representatives to ensure that they pass this information through their
trade bodies and other groups to people who might be in contact with
new employers. Other more specific activities have included the fact
that some HMRC offices run seminars for new businesses to tell them
about what their responsibilities are going to be. Since September,
those seminars have included details of the holiday. Occasionally,
Companies House runs events for newly incorporated companies and again,
since September, we have made sure that the holiday has been mentioned
to such companies.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000275">&#160;</a>

communicate with employers through a bulletin, which is sent out
regularly by HMRC and has included material on the NICs holiday. One of
the key groups of people with whom we would want to work with any new
tax initiative or with any new NICs initiative is agents, and a very
large proportion of new businesses are professionally represented. So,
in our regular newsletters to agents—and one in particular
called <em>Working Together</em>—there is material on the NICs
holiday. We have seen that the leading tax advisers and NICs advisers
tend to publish articles on new initiatives; the latest issue of
<em>Taxation</em> includes an article by Peter Arrowsmith, a leading
authority on national insurance, in which he describes the holiday and
draws attention to it for professional advisers.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000276">&#160;</a>

lot of hurdles have to be jumped. Are there echoes of such a scheme?
Are you confident that your 400,000 will be reached? Are you confident,
for instance, that by the end of this calendar year, you will have
reached a certain proportion? What will that figure be, and what
lessons do you think can be learnt from the scheme that ran in the
past?<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000278">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Obviously, when the new Government came in and
said that they wanted to introduce the NICs holiday, we looked very
closely at the past experience of running a holiday. The present NICs
holiday is quite different from the original scheme, which was confined
to people who had been unemployed. It included a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 30<a class="bkMark" name="Column30">&#160;</a>
                           </div>number of features which are obviously not replicated in the present
arrangements, because they had had an impact on people’s
individual national insurance liabilities. This scheme was designed
with a view to being operational very quickly, because as you know, it
was announced in the emergency Budget. We were able to have guidance on
the new scheme ready by 6 September, so that new employers were able to
take advantage of the scheme almost immediately.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000279">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The new
scheme does not require employers to do much more than make a number of
very simple decisions, for example: is it really a new business? Is it
located outside one of the excluded regions? And, has it actually taken
on an employee after the 22 June? So, in terms of simplicity, the new
scheme is a completely different kettle of fish from the scheme that
was operated in the mid-1980s, which, as I have said, had an unhappy
record.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000280">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On levels of
take-up, the scheme will effectively last for three years. Although we
can bring the scheme to the attention of new employers, there is very
little we can do, because it is a scheme that people have to apply for.
We cannot actually force them to apply for it. We know from experience
that new businesses have a pretty hard time keeping their head above
water, without having to worry about whether they are claiming
everything that they might be entitled to. We are fairly sure, however,
that the employer NICs holiday will be something that professional
advisers will be bringing to the attention of their clients, because it
is definitely something that will relieve them of additional liability.
It is also something that we are hopeful will influence them when it
comes to making decisions about whether, and, if so, when, they take on
employees, because they will know for a fact that the level of employer
NICs that will be payable when taking on a new employee will be
mitigated if they are in one of the targeted
regions.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000281">&#160;</a>

analysis of the behavioural impact, the value-added that is at the
heart of your question, is quite difficult to make an assessment of at
this point. That is the two per employer that we estimate at the
moment. On behavioural impact, we will see. A common-sense approach
would suggest that it will have an impact, but, of course, what we are
looking at here is bringing through a dynamic

                           </div>impact of a tax cut. There is always a degree of uncertainty about that,
so we have been relatively cautious. We are not making bold or
unsubstantiated claims as to what the behavioural impact will be, but
we will be keen to study this and see what the impact is. Common sense
would suggest that it must be helpful for a new business, at a time
when, perhaps, it will be vulnerable, to have greater confidence to
take on staff when they are not having to pay employer’s
national insurance contributions as well, which is a cost on labour and
one that is likely to deter them taking on
employees.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000285">&#160;</a>

tax breaks, of course, is that if you put taxes on employers up, they
might take on fewer people. The FSB mentioned their estimate that the
so-called jobs tax would have cost 57,000 jobs, and the Bill is part of
the process of trying to reverse that. Do you agree with that
assessment? If not, do you have a separate Treasury
assessment?<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000286">&#160;</a>

that was given to my predecessors as to what they anticipated that cost
in jobs would be. I have no reason to doubt that estimate of 57,000
jobs that would be the cost if we did not take some steps to reverse
the increase. Clearly, as you make the cost of labour more expensive,
fewer jobs will be created, and that is perfectly sensible. The
intention behind the second part of the Bill and the intention behind
the increase in the threshold in employer’s national insurance
contributions is to reduce the cost of labour compared with the
situation that we
inherited.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000287">&#160;</a>

the fact that there is a regional breakdown in the coverage of the NICs
holiday, and there were questions about whether it would be better to
be more targeted. The employers’ organisation said that that
would make it more complex. Have you made any assessment of how far
people travel in order to work? For instance, I know that lots of
people from my constituency travel to Cambridge, which is in a
different county. Have you made an assessment of how much the ability
to work somewhere different from where you live ameliorates the impact
on pockets of high public sector
employment?<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000288">&#160;</a>

Gauke:</strong>
                           </em> I think that is an important point, because
the fact is that labour markets tend to be larger than, for example,
just a local authority area. Depending on where you are, they can be
larger than a county. Were we to try to target this on pockets—I
understand that there will always be an argument over that, but we have
to balance simplicity with targeting and we have settled on a regional
approach—particularly if you look at London, the south-east of
England and the east of England, you often find that pockets of
relative poverty tend to be next to areas of relative affluence. Those
areas will certainly be within the range in which people would travel
to work. We have to bear in mind that trying to target something on a
particular local authority will mean that some of the beneficiaries
could well be people living in the suburban area next to it, which is
actually quite prosperous. I think we are getting the balance right in
that context.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000289">&#160;</a>

by HMRC and the Treasury. If we were to shorten the time period, we
would come back to some of the earlier evidence that sometimes it takes
businesses a little while before they start taking on employees. It may
take a little while for awareness of the scheme to spread and to start
to influence behaviour and encourage start-ups. We have to make a
judgment on that, but we think that three years is about the right

                           </em> I have already talked about why I think trying
to do smaller pockets might be ineffective, but the fact is that those
regions already have strong private sectors and are less reliant, by
and large, on the public sector as a whole. The creation of start-up
businesses tends to be faster in those regions and conversely slower in
other regions. As we accept the principle of regional policy, and we
also accept that resources are constrained, we have taken the view that
we should target the scheme at those regions excluding the three that I
have already
mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000301">&#160;</a>

constituencies for public sector employment are in London, the
south-east and the eastern regions, or if I said that, at 9% in
November 2010, London has the highest unemployment of any region in the
United Kingdom, is there a logic to excluding those regions? Part of
the logic for this measure is that public sector employment is
potentially one of the areas of loss; another part of the logic was
unemployment. We could go through the deprivation index or a number of
other measures that suggest that there are very severe pockets of
unemployment or deprivation in which people do not necessarily have the
ability to travel to other areas, or, indeed, are within the criteria
that you have set for other regions being
included.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000302">&#160;</a>

deprivation and poverty wherever they are. There is a question of
whether the NIC holiday is a particularly useful method for dealing
with pockets of deprivation in, for example, London. I fully accept
your point on unemployment in London, but London is also one of the
places of enormous job creation. Many people living in the south-east
of England and the east of England work in London. If we were to
include London within the scheme, it might help start-up businesses as
a whole, but I am not sure that that is the most effective way to deal
with such pockets of deprivation in London. I think that there may be
other ways of doing that, whether that be through the regional growth
fund or welfare reform, which are more likely to be effective in
tackling deprivation in
London.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000303">&#160;</a>

proceed with that because the cost would have been greater. We
considered the option of looking at this, as you are suggesting, at a
much more localised level, but that ends up being more difficult to
administer and it is more likely to be distorted—one side of a
road might get it, but the other side of the road might not. That is
always an issue if you have a boundary, but it becomes easier if you do
it on a regional basis. As I said in my answer to Mr Hancock’s
question, people travel beyond their local authority in order to work.
We felt that the balance was better if we did it on a regional
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000305">&#160;</a>

one of the local authorities in my constituency, and within that

quite deprived. If you were to try to do it on a local authority basis,
I think people could also say that it was a deprived ward. If you start

If we found after a long period—not just in the first few
months—that the take-up was not as high as we anticipated, one
could make the point that the policy was not being as effective as we
had hoped, although the costs would be lower, as you have suggested.
That would be an argument against extending it. Because there are
particular problems and issues that we want to overcome in areas where
the public sector takes a bigger part of the economy, I do not think we
would look to return to this. If, however, we found that this had a
substantial, dynamic effect on our economy, we would need to look at
this again because it would suggest that it was a very effective
method, but I do not want to make any promises to the Committee that we
would extend
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000308">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The application process is relatively simple
and straightforward. We have a system whereby new businesses that want
to take advantage of the holiday are invited to send in an online
application form unless they are in receipt of state aid, in which case
they need to fill in a manual application form. The application form
simply requires them to provide some basic information such as their
reference numbers, the name of the business, the date the business
started, the business address, the postcode and the region or country
in which the business is located, and to certify that they have read
the guidance on Business Link.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000316">&#160;</a>

significance of asking for this information is that it enables us to
tell very quickly whether the business qualifies. So, for example, if
the business started before 22 June—the date of the emergency
Budget—we could immediately notify them that they are not
eligible. The intention is then to operate what we call a
“process now, check later” system. We notify them as
quickly as possible that they are eligible for the holiday, and that
they can legitimately start withholding payment of NICs if they are
eligible. More fundamentally, it gives them an incentive straight away
in terms of their disbursements. One of the things that we took into
account in the design of the scheme was that the lifeline for small
businesses is cash flow.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000317">&#160;</a>

compliance checks that we undertake some time after the application.
The Minister was keen that whatever relief was available was notified
to people straight away. The whole application process was designed to
ensure that we got the information that we needed immediately to check
whether someone qualified. The key aspect is whether it is a new
business. You ask whether it is a new business and when it was set up.
We will use all the other information in the form if it becomes
necessary. We do not always check every application that we receive. We
run a risk-based system, and the kind of information that is contained
in the application form, and any other information that we get, is
among the criteria that are taken into account in deciding whether we
undertake any inquiries on a particular
case.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000327">&#160;</a>

Mitha:</strong>
                           </em> One of the things that we were very clear
about when we started to help the Minister to design the scheme was the
risk of avoidance. We needed to trade off the fact that we wanted the
scheme to operate flexibly and quickly for small businesses that
cannot, in the main, normally afford very expensive accountants,
against the risk that some bigger players might find an opportunity to
exploit the arrangements. The Minister took a decision to cap the
number of employees who qualify and set the maximum limit on the amount
of money per employee that would be eligible for relief. Given the fact
that there is a limited amount of money—there is a maximum
amount of relief that businesses can access—it reduces the
incentive for people to engage in that kind of avoidance.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000333">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The other
thing that the design of the scheme did was to make sure that people
who had been in business six months prior to the launch of the scheme,
or who claimed to have started a new business, were disqualified. So,
you could not have a situation where an existing business decided, for
example, that it would stop trading today and recommence trading
tomorrow, purporting to be a new business. Similarly, we were very
alert to the fact that it was possible for people to restructure
matters so that an existing business could claim to be a new
business.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000334">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
legislation includes very robust anti-avoidance provision, which says
that if there are any arrangements in place that are designed
effectively to fragment or restructure an existing business, they will
not be eligible for the relief payment. We are fairly confident that
the combination of the monetary limits on the maximum amount of relief
that a business can claim, which limits the incentive, the rules on
what is regarded as a new business—the bit I mentioned about the
bulk of the business being carried on by somebody else—and the
very robust anti-avoidance provisions in the legislation will reduce
the incentive for attempting avoidance.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000335">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On the national insurance thresholds, there has,
for some time, been a dislocation between the threshold levels kicking
in for national insurance and for income tax. So, from the point of
view of the employees, you have the anomaly that, over a range of
increasing income, you actually get diminishing marginal tax rates. Is
that an issue that you sought to address in any form in the changes? If
so, what impact do you think the Bill will have on that?<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000336">&#160;</a>

very substantial increase in the personal allowance. In an attempt to
try to counteract the increase in employees’ national insurance

allowance and the threshold in this particular area. Clearly, in terms

the Minister has spoken a lot about pockets of deprivation, and I
contend that there are significant swathes of London that are heavily
reliant upon the public sector. The boroughs of Lambeth, Southwark,
Lewisham and Croydon have 185,000 people employed in the public sector
between them—and that is a larger public sector work force than
in Tyne and Wear. You have talked about the distortive effect of
businesses potentially moving areas if the scheme worked on a finer
grain. For me, however, that would be a good thing in that part of
London, and I wonder what you would say about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000338">&#160;</a>

new start-ups that would not have been there before, as opposed to
trying to get a start-up that would have been on one side of the river
to open on the other side of the river. That is why having the fewest
number of boundaries is better. That is one of the arguments for taking
a regional

fully take on board the point about unemployment in London, and that
there are large areas of London that are relatively deprived, but it is
the nature of London that those areas are often next to relatively
prosperous areas. The challenges of London are probably not best met by
this particular policy. There are other things that can be done: some
of it is to do with infrastructure; some of it is to do with welfare
reform to ensure that work pays; and some of it may be to do with the
regional growth fund. Given that London creates an awful lot of
jobs—yes, it has a lot of unemployment, but it also creates a
lot of jobs—the impact of this scheme, which is designed to
create more jobs, would be relatively marginal in addressing the
concerns that you understandably have as a constituency

infrastructure that can be improved to help a part of London, the

London, but they are often not going to your constituents, so the
question is how we address that. It would be quite expensive to extend
the NICs holiday to London and it might or might not result in more
jobs being created, but it would not necessarily ensure that those new
jobs were going to your constituents. What is happening at the moment
is that there are quite a few jobs being created in London, but that is

it. The next question was whether we tried to do it on a regional basis

outlined, we took the view that doing it on a regional basis would be
more effective, less distortive and less complicated. If we started
doing it in London, one local authority might get it and another local
authority would not get it, and you would have a lot of discussions
about whether this bit of this local authority is more deprived than
that bit of the other local authority. We are trying to find a balance,

question, although I am sure that I would get interesting answers from
the HMRC representatives. We have a tax gap between the tax that should
be paid and the tax that is actually paid. Legitimate estimates put
that figure at some £120 billion a year, which is a vast sum of
money. A small dent in that would make this scheme easily affordable,
it could cover the whole country and the administrative costs, and pay
for much more besides. Could you not usefully target the tax
gap?<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000347">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I will try not to be too diverse, but, first
of all, I think that it is right that we try to tackle the tax gap. The
number that HMRC has produced is not the £120 billion figure,
which has some fairly fundamental flaws in its methodology, but the
£42 billion figure, which the Government accept, as the previous
Government did, as being as accurate as we can make it. Yes, we should
try to reduce it. In the comprehensive spending review we announced
£900 million to be spent over the spending review period on
measures to tackle criminal behaviour, to tackle tax evasion and to
reduce tax
avoidance.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000348">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">You
are perfectly right. Although I disagree with the number, I think that
it is right that we try to reduce the tax gap. There is always,
inevitably, a tax gap, but we hope to be able to get it down. HMRC
believes that the additional expenditure that we announced in the
spending review will get the tax gap down by the region of
£7 billion a year by the end of the spending review
period. My role as Minister is to do what I can to assist HMRC in
ensuring that it does
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000349">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> A proportion of the tax gap is not just
avoidance, evasion or criminal activity: it is simply that HMRC does
not have enough resource to collect the taxes. There is a fair chunk,
even of the

collect. I am told by tax officers, just as I was told many years ago
by tax officers, that every additional tax inspector collects many
times their own salary. Is there not a case for substantially
increasing the number of tax officers, and recruiting and training
them? They will all collect many times their own salary and solve a lot
of those
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000350">&#160;</a>

position a little. It could be pointed out that HMRC’s staff has
been reduced over the past five years and, actually, compliance yield
has gone up. It is not just a question of numbers, it is a question of
ensuring that HMRC has the right technology and that staff are deployed
in the right areas. It is right that we should find ways to make some
of the processing within HMRC more efficient and free up resources to
strengthen tax inspectors, who can play a vital role. We should ensure
that the deterrent works, that we have proper campaigns and that HMRC
is visible and effective in taking on those who, one way or another,
are not paying the right amount of tax. I do not think we want to
overstate this—to believe that we can solve all our problems in
our public finances simply by employing more tax inspectors—but
we need to do what we

past, and it constantly comes back with the argument “Oh, well,
we want to economise by reducing the head count of tax
officers.” It is utterly irrational when cutting tax inspectors
will result in less money being collected, rather than in money being
saved. I found this with VAT inspectors at local level  12
years ago when I wrote to Gordon Brown about it and I received the same
answer. More recently I have spoken to the senior representatives of
the senior tax officers in HMRC—not just the Public and
Commercial Services Union, which I am very close to as well—and
they did not disagree with my analysis that many of the staff were
overworked and underpaid; that there were not enough of them; and that
with many more staff they would do a fantastic job and really close
this tax gap very substantially. Not only would it solve this problem,
but it would start to reduce the deficit, which I am sure would be

is both; clearly it is as employees are taken on that the benefit
emerges. The first two or three years can be very difficult for a new
business, and it faces many challenges, but we want as far as possible
to reduce some of the challenges of the additional costs of labour that
result from national insurance contributions. It is a

major hurdle. We hear that a lot from the Federation of Small
Businesses. If the policy can assist that, and can enable and encourage

joined up is this with other start-up incentive schemes? I used to
advise businesses on the Enterprise Investment Scheme and the
Enterprise Management Incentive when I was in practice, and I endorse
what was said earlier; I am sure that accountancy firms up and down the
country will be writing to their clients at the moment and organising
breakfast seminars to get them through the door so that everyone
benefits from the scheme. All the current income tax and CGT incentive
schemes exempt other activities, particularly non-trading activities.
Yet, under subsection (6), a property business or an investment
business would qualify, which is a departure from existing incentive
schemes. Why is
that?<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000361">&#160;</a>

this was available to all small businesses. As he has said, a new
business carrying on a trade profession or vocation, whether it is a
sole trader, partnership or newly incorporated company, would qualify.
Similarly, there are a number of provisions under the Taxes Act, some
of which have been referred to, which make companies carrying on
property or investment businesses ineligible for the benefit, but in
this instance the Minister decided that, because the scheme was
intended to promote activity, they should be included within the scope
of the scheme. The effect is that it encourages new businesses of all
sorts, including those that are exempted specifically from other

the first quarter. So if we said roughly 1,500 a quarter, on that kind
of trajectory over the next three years, you are looking at about
18,000 businesses being part of the scheme. You are talking about a
target of 400,000. How are you expecting to get from 18,000 to 400,000?

on the assumption that we would not get very many applications to begin
with, because anybody setting up a new business is obviously going to
be focused on keeping their head above water and on their business.
There is a cycle to how new businesses approach HMRC. They need to
approach HMRC to set up their pay-as-you-earn schemes if they are
planning to take on employees.

majority of small businesses rely on their professional advisers for
information about what they need to do and when they need to do it. New

have to make remittances on the pay-as-you-earn that they have deducted

want to withhold part of the payment. Similarly, when they come to do
their annual accounts they will be told that they need to think about

or vocation. In the context of charities, for example, that would not
prevent employees of a bookshop, which was created by a hospice, from
benefiting from the scheme. You are right to say, however, that it
would not include charities that do not have a business

run into particular difficulties, where we felt that the scheme would
have acted inappropriately; for example, if a household took on a
cleaner or a nanny. It would not be carrying on a business, trade or
profession, but it could be seen as being a start-up business, and the
NICs holiday would apply in such circumstances. We wanted to narrow it
in those senses, and the test of a trade, business or vocation is well
established.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000427">&#160;</a>

Clearly, if we were not to increase the threshold for employers’

                           </div>for the charitable sector, because it would cover all employers.
However, the focus is to aid the wealth-creating private sector, so
that is where the scheme is focused. If we took out the trade, business
or vocation test, which is essentially the problem that charities have,
we would be left with problems such as a household taking on a nanny
and not having to pay national insurance
contributions.<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000433">&#160;</a>

the modelling, I want to be clear about your position, Mr Mitha. You
are saying, as I understand it, that the model is well researched and
that it is outlined in the impact assessment, so members of the
Committee can look at it there. It shows non-linear growth in the
take-up of the national insurance holiday, so we might expect a smaller
take-up at the beginning, accelerating as the scheme takes off. The
figure of 1,100, as the current level of take-up, is therefore not
inconsistent with the model you developed. Is that
correct?<a class="bkMark" name="10120252000436">&#160;</a>
