							<a name="08022652000331"></a>The
Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Good morning
to you, Mr. Amess, and to the Committee on this sunny day.
We discussed much about carbon capture and storage last week, but we
now have the opportunity to consider it in more detail. While clause 16
will prohibit the storage of carbon dioxide without a licence to ensure
that such storage is carried out in a safe and responsible manner,
clause 17 will give the Secretary of State, or an authority to which
the licensing function has been transferred under clause 33, the power
to license the carbon dioxide storage-related
activities.</div>
					<a name="08022652000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition to such a licence, a lease or an authorisation in respect of
the relevant offshore space to be licensed by the Secretary of State
must be granted by the Crown Estate, because it has ownership rights
within 12 nautical miles of the territorial sea and relevant
rights&#151;possibly up to 200 nautical miles&#151;will also be
vested in the Crown under clause 1. The Crown Estate will grant leases
or authorisations on commercial terms to operators for the storage of
carbon dioxide within those areas. Such leases or authorisations will
prescribe the geographical space in which the CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>can be
stored, as well as specifying the period during which the site can be
utilised.</div>
					<a name="08022652000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will ensure that the areas covered by the licence and the Crown lease
can be easily co-ordinated. In the absence of such co-ordination, there
would be a risk, for example, that the licence would continue to apply
when the lease had expired. In such circumstances, the operator would
have to discontinue its activities, as it would be on the Crown
Estate&#146;s land without the necessary authorisation from the Crown
Estate.</div>

							<b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): At an earlier sitting, the hon.
Member for Southampton, Test made some interesting points about the
Crown Estate and how much co-operation was guaranteed in the delivery
of policies such as the licensing regime from the Crown Estate. Has the
Minister had time to reflect on the issues raised by the hon.
Gentleman, as they seem directly relevant to the
clause?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000333"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I am still reflecting on such issues and have asked
for advice. I am minded to write to my hon. Friend the Member for
Southampton, Test with some detail, a copy of which I shall give to all
members of the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08022652000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08022652000334"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
Stephen Ladyman</b> (South Thanet) (Lab): Good morning,
Mr. Amess. I want to make a general point about the whole
chapter, and our discussions on the clause is probably the most
appropriate place to do so. I refer my hon. Friend the Minister to our
final evidence session and question 196, which was asked by my hon.
Friend the Member for Copeland. It received an answer from
Mr. Chris Mansfield, who
said:</div>
					<a name="08022652000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
principle, if you look at the provisions in the Bill and the proposals
put forward by the European Commission in a draft CCS directive in
January, the intent, which is very much supported by industry, is that
that is a liability that should be taken on&#151;at an appropriate
point in time&#151;by the state.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
Energy Public Bill Committee, </i>19 February 2008; c. 102,
Q196.]</div>
					<a name="08022652000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">He goes on to say that he
does not think that it is reasonable for businesses to have to assume
the liability for ever, that businesses do not last for ever, but that
the state goes on, so the liabilities must fall eventually on the
state.</div>
					<a name="08022652000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
consequence of that intent, the clause and the related clauses in the
chapter have been drafted in benignly. The business is regarded as
benign and one that we wish to encourage. We do not wish to put
barriers in its way, as we do not want to scare people away from it. I
contrast that point with the later chapter that deals with nuclear
energy and the liability that comes from the necessity to store nuclear
waste and to have a decommissioning proposal. That chapter is written
with an entirely different tone, along the lines of, &#147;This is a
very dangerous business. You&#146;re in it to make money, and
we&#146;re going to lock you down and make sure that you pay every
penny.&#148; It includes clause 60, which I call the
&#147;We&#146;re going to hunt you down to the ends of the Earth to
make sure that you pay up&#148; clause. It also includes clause 62,
which I call the &#147;Don&#146;t you think you&#146;re going to
get tricky with us, because we&#146;ll come after your neighbours and
your friends as well&#148; clause. Effectively, it is written in a
completely different tone to this package of clauses, including clause
17, which is written from the point of view that the matter is
benign.</div>
					<a name="08022652000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yes, this is
a benign business, but people will be in it to make money. It involves
the capture of a dangerous material that will have to be stored for a
very long time, for which people will have to be responsible for a long
time. Although I entirely accept the benign tone of the chapter, I
raise the point now because when we consider the chapter on nuclear
energy, the decommissioning of nuclear energy resources and long-term
storage, I will wish to talk to my hon. Friend the Minister about the
difference in tone in that chapter and ask whether we have got it
right, or whether it would be better to make amendments to encourage
investment in nuclear energy, in the same way as this chapter is
phrased to encourage investment in carbon capture and
storage.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000335"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> That was an interesting speech. When examining
aspects of climate change and energy policy, I often reflect that if
the well-known saying of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>Harold Wilson that &#147;a week is a long time in
politics&#148;&#151;we have had one or two of those weeks
recently&#151;is at one end of the continuum, looking at targets for
CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>reduction, the effects of carbon emissions on our planet
and the longer term issues about CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>storage and the storage
of nuclear waste is right at the other end. Here we are in 2008, trying
to do our best to make policy for decades and centuries
ahead&#151;perhaps millennia ahead as regards CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>storage
and a long time ahead for nuclear waste&#151;so my hon. Friend the
Member for South Thanet has raised an interesting point.</div>
					<a name="08022652000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nuclear energy is, or should
be, a profitable business. It is not unreasonable to ensure that the
companies in the business pay the full costs. We will have some debate
about the full costs, and how we calculate them is a perfectly
legitimate discussion to have. However, we have always recognised that
there comes a point, when the geological repository is sealed, when the
state takes over that responsibility for the long term&#151;no one
else can. No one can quite predict what the state will look like in
half a million
years.</div>

						</b> It is that kind of time sequence that we are
planning, yes.</div>
					<a name="08022652000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason why Governments such as our own have to find taxpayers&#146;
money for demonstration projects is that there is, as yet, no money to
be made out of CO<span class="Sub">2</span>. It is not yet a profitable business,
although it could well become a commercial business in the future, and
it will need to. Hence, perhaps, the benign tone that my hon. Friend
refers
to.</div>
					<a name="08022652000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000338"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:
						</b> If my hon. Friend is not in power in half a
million years, I at least expect there to be a large portrait of him on
the Committee wall, staring down at the people who follow us. He is
absolutely right that carbon capture and storage is not yet a
profitable business, but nobody is proposing that the Government
subsidise it for ever. It is intended that it will become a profitable
business. It is a good business, we want people to be in that business,
but nuclear energy has an equally important role in reducing carbon
dioxide and fighting climate change. However, just as people in that
industry need to be responsible for their liability, so do those
responsible for carbon capture and storage. I want to see an even
playing field for the two industries.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000339"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I take my hon. Friend&#146;s argument. Last week,
I implied that, in my judgment, the nuclear clauses of the Bill will
not go through on the nod&#151;that is my political
instinct&#151;and I am therefore sure that there will be an
opportunity to discuss those matters. To sum up from that interesting
intervention: there are things in common between CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>and
nuclear in that the commercial entity must take responsibility for
eventual decommissioning. Similarly, in the very long term, only the
state can take responsibility. However, there are also differences,
which we will no doubt return to.</div>

Wicks:
						</b> I am looking forward to hearing about new clause
18, but first, I will speak briefly by way of introduction to our
clause. The clause will enable the Secretary of State to make
regulations by the negative procedure that prescribe the circumstances
in which carbon dioxide storage licences may be granted. The Liberal
Democrats worry about the burdens placed on the hard-working Secretary
of State, but he has some support, so I do not want them to get too
anxious.</div>
					<a name="08022652000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
states that the regulations may prescribe who may apply for licences,
what information would have to be supplied by the applicant, the
financial security arrangements and other requirements. Having such
regulations in place will help to ensure that only appropriately
qualified and financially sound operators engage in CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>storage activities and that certain conditions are satisfied
before a licence to commence operations can be obtained. I now look
forward to hearing the arguments in favour of new clause
18.</div>
					<a name="08022652000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000342"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> I shall first address the stand part debate,
particularly in respect of clause 18(2)(e). The impact assessment
signed by the Minister raises an interesting question on page 19 about
carbon caption storage falling within the European Union emissions
trading scheme. Future leakages or losses of carbon dioxide from
geological or other storage facilities will attract financial
penalties, because permits are technically required for such carbon
emissions.</div>
					<a name="08022652000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister has pointed out, we are talking about very long-term
prospects. He almost issued the phrase, &#147;A millennium is a long
time in politics&#148;, and I wish that he had; as it would have been
a good one. I want to ask about the licensing regime and whether the
future obligation not to lose carbon dioxide from storage facilities
will be incorporated within the licensing regime. From the impact
assessment, it seems as though it should be, but it is obviously a
challenge to design that licensing regime to cope with the very long
time scales that might be involved.</div>
					<a name="08022652000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for South
Thanet was right to draw a comparison with the nuclear clauses,
although we would make the obvious distinction between one industry
that we would rather discourage and another that, in this case, we
would rather encourage. That legitimises a different approach. After
all, when instantly released, CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>does not start poisoning
anyone or making their hair fall out.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000343"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:
						</b> First, I take issue with that final statement. If
there was ever a massive release of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>from one of the
carbon storage places, it would be catastrophic. Secondly, the Liberal
Democrat position might be to discourage nuclear energy. If these two
chapters had been phrased in a distinct way, I could understand it. My
position and that of my hon. Friend the Minister is that we see nuclear
energy as having a positive and benign role in fighting climate change.
So, in those circumstances, the two chapters should be written on a
more even
keel.</div>

					<a name="08022652000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause addresses another
crucially important issue in terms of carbon capture and storage. For
many organisations and observers of our debates, there is a glaring
omission: for all the commitments to store CO<span class="Sub">2, </span>once it has

the house on carbon capture and storage and whether it would be the
cornerstone of future energy policy in tackling climate change and
without which the whole project might fail. To be honest, the answer
could be yes. We hope that energy efficiency and, in some cases,
nuclear power or at least renewable energy, will do something to close
the energy gap, but they will all struggle to do that within the time
scales we have in front of us. Carbon capture and storage is therefore
a vital component of the campaign to meet our emissions reductions in
the medium term.</div>
					<a name="08022652000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a
new generation of coal-fired power stations such as Kingsnorth is to go
ahead, that cannot be done without a regime in place that would at the
very least enforce carbon capture and storage as soon as it is
available. The sooner that regime is enabled, the better for industry
and for investors to plan for it.</div>
					<a name="08022652000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The risk is that we commission
new power stations and then later, once the technology is up and
running, we spring the regulatory regime on the industry. That is the
kind of thing that industry persistently tells us is bad for investment
and future planning. The clear direction of the Stern report is that
action now to incentivise and make clear the strategic direction of the
Government provides certainty for investors and reduces costs in the
long term. We need to lock ourselves into a regime that will make
carbon capture and storage an inevitable part of any new generation of
any fossil fuel powered
stations.</div>
					<a name="08022652000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
good precedent. California has introduced a greenhouse gas emissions
standard, including a facility-based element that targets particular
power stations. The standard sets a level of carbon dioxide emissions
per megawatt-hour. In new clause 18 we suggest a level of 400 kg of
carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour. That figure is not plucked out of the
blue; it is based on the current performance standard of the best
modern combined-cycle gas turbine power station. That should be the
baseline against which the Secretary of State will have the power, as
the technology comes on stream, to reduce and enforce lower emissions
of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel powered
stations.</div>

will the hon. Gentleman say more about that? At first sight, I thought
his new clause might be saying that no coal-fired power stations would
be allowed until they could be capture-ready. Is he saying this power
would come in only once CCS had been
proven?</div>

as to whether Kingsnorth goes ahead without carbon capture storage
technology in place right now. Many of us might be sympathetic to that
but it is outside the remit of the clause in front of us and perhaps
even the Bill. We are seeking to establish a clause that would give
enabling powers to the Secretary of State and would give him the
mechanisms with which to enforce carbon capture and storage, at the
very least as the technology becomes available. In other words, a clear
strategic direction and a clear direction of travel for industry and
investors would be set out. They would be very clear that if and when
the technology became available&#151;and we all hope it will become
available sooner rather than later&#151;the Secretary of State would
already have the powers in place to reduce acceptable amounts of carbon
dioxide per kilowatt-hour and to enforce an increasingly stricter
regime so that it became cripplingly expensive to run a fossil fuel
powered power station without carbon capture and
storage.</div>

clauses.</div>
					<a name="08022652000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The number
is based on the Californian model of taking the best emissions
performance of the best modern power stations. In this case, modern
combined-cycle gas turbine power stations emit 400 kg per
megawatt-hour, so that is where the standard has come from. The new
clause says we should do no worse than we do at the moment and would
give the Secretary of State the power, in due course, to reduce that
level on a progressive basis, as the technology allows. It sets out the
opportunity for the Minister to emulate Governor Schwarzenegger, to
become &#147;The Terminator&#148; of dirty coal-fired power and to
be the champion of clean coal and gas-fired power stations in the

					<a name="08022652000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think there
is mixed thinking in what we heard just now from the hon. Member for
Cheltenham. This approach has been taken in California and the
companies there know that they cannot build a power station unless they
are going to adhere to very strict standards of emissions. However,
they are part of a nationwide structure so they can always import
energy 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>from other parts of the US if coal-fired power stations do not get built
in California. I see the attraction of having an absolute limit; it
gets us away from the target culture, and as the Minister will have
heard me say before, I think the target culture is
fundamentally flawed because it just means that, in 15 years, somebody
else can come along and explain why the target was not met. An absolute
limit does not provide that wriggle room, but there is an inherent
contradiction in what the hon. Member for Cheltenham has been
saying.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman seems to be criticising the
Californian system, but the Californian level is established very
specifically at 1,100 lbs of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> per megawatt-hour, which is
about equivalent to 500 kg, and it is on a state-wide basis.
It does not depend on any national scheme, because there is not
actually a national emissions trading scheme in place in the US
yet.</div>

							<a name="08022652000351"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I am not criticising the Californian
system&#151;it has different sources of energy from those we have
available to us&#151;but I am not sure it is immediately applicable
to us. I am particularly intrigued by some of the language. The hon.
Gentleman said that Kingsnorth would be built, but on the condition
that carbon capture and storage would be implemented &#147;as soon as
it is enabled&#148;. That would mean asking those who are investing
in that power plant, E.ON, to build a power plant without knowing what
the costs would be and probably assuming that the technology would be
available, but certainly not knowing whether Government support would
be available to help them meet the costs. My expectation is that if
Kingsnorth were to have carbon capture and storage technology built in
from the outset, it would add an extra &#163;400 million or
&#163;500 million to its construction costs. The investors would have
to gamble that they might get some of that money back from somewhere.
They would not do that; they are part of a global company, so they
would go and invest in other forms of energy elsewhere in the world. We
would therefore find that the hard-line approach that the new clause
suggests would drive away investment in some areas.</div>
					<a name="08022652000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have great sympathy for the
concept that we want carbon capture storage to be applied to Kingsnorth
but I do not believe that the new clause will achieve that&#151;it is
far too prescriptive. The hon. Gentleman has also got to tell us how we
are going to fill the energy gap.</div>

						<a name="08022652000352"></a>

Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): The specific example of Kingsnorth
is very germane to this new clause. Could the hon. Gentleman verify his
own view on the criteria&#151;should it be a cap of the sort
envisaged here? If he were Secretary of State, would such a project go
ahead without any conditions? How would he try to achieve these
goals?</div>

							<a name="08022652000353"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I find the prospect of Kingsnorth without carbon
capture storage quite horrific. It is clearly a cleaner technology than
the old coal-fired power stations. The idea of building a massive new
fleet of power stations when we could be using other technologies or
when CCS could be involved would be profoundly disturbing. I therefore
wish very much that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>CCS is part of the Kingsnorth project and that will no doubt be part of
the bidding in the pilot scheme. We will have to see what the
Government decide in due course but if Kingsnorth does not get
financial support under the pilot scheme, the Government will have to
address the problem. Without such support at the outset, I doubt
whether the investment would go ahead.</div>
					<a name="08022652000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will need at some point to
discuss how we fill the looming energy gap. The Liberal Democrats are
not in favour of nuclear power; they are not in favour of some of the
new-build coal that is being suggested; they are not keen to have
imported gas; and Liberal Democrat councils are stopping wind
applications. Are we going to go backwards? We are going to have a
rather dark, cold future, presumably sitting in a hut, waiting for
somebody to rub some sticks together and invent some heat for
us.</div>

Kingsnorth is not very far away from my constituency in Kent and many
jobs are going to be dependent on it. Like the hon. Gentleman, I very
much hope that it will include carbon capture and storage. However, if
we did something that would discourage the development of the new
Kingsnorth, would that not mean that the existing plant&#151;which is
dirtier and produces far more CO<span class="Sub">2</span>&#151;is likely to be
further extended into the future? It is in the interest of the
environment that we give E.ON the support it needs to develop these new
technologies and, in addition to that, press it to include carbon
capture and storage at a later date.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000357"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> My understanding is that the current facility has
to close down because of EU requirements in any case and that the new
plant proposed by E.ON would be much cleaner than the old one. However
it still would not be acceptable unless CCS can be involved at some
stage. That is why the way in which the pilot project is going to go
ahead will be fundamental to deciding whether that happens; coal can
have a future, but only if carbon capture storage can be made to work.
My concerns about this new clause is that, by laying down at this stage
such a prescriptive approach, people will be asked to invest without
knowing what the costs are going to be and without knowing what
Government support might be available. In those circumstances they will
simply walk away.</div>

said that and nor do I remember any of my hon. Friends saying such a
thing. The import of natural gas may be not be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div>desirable, but we certainly would not be in favour of stopping it. In
terms of carbon capture and storage for fossil fuel powered power
stations, he seems to take a view that is supported by comments from
the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron). If the hon.

therefore be interested to know what he suggests in its

					<a name="08022652000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have said that it is clearly
desirable for carbon capture and storage to be part of the pilot
project at Kingsnorth. If it is not part of that project, the
Government have to find another way of supporting it. If the CCS plan
is not involved from the outset, the environmental costs of Kingsnorth
are almost too great to contemplate. However, new clause 18 is not the
right way to deal with that. Setting such a strict target&#151;or
such a prescribed limit&#151;at this stage would drive away
investment, rather than enabling the partnership approach to
develop.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000360"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> This has been a very worthwhile debate, and I just
want to add a couple of brief comments and questions. I am interested
in an issue that has arisen, which I would call double jeopardy: if
there is leakage from stored carbon, my understanding is that a permit
is needed under the emissions trading scheme&#151;so, effectively, it
must be paid for&#151;but can the Minister clarify whether a separate
penalty regime will apply? I have been looking through the clauses in
this series, and there are all sorts of penalties for not keeping the
books properly, but I am slightly confused about whether there is a
penalty for allowing CO<span class="Sub">2</span> to leak. The penalties do not seem
to include one for actually letting the stuff out. Is that because a
permit is needed under the ETS and there is the penalty, or is there a
penalty in the clause in respect of licenses? I am unclear about
that.</div>
					<a name="08022652000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">More generally,
on giving the go-ahead to new plants, our new clause includes a
specific figure as an upper boundary. If a figure were not put in the
new clause, it would simply say that the Minister could set any
ceiling. If the Minister set a very high ceiling, it would be a
non-binding constraint and have no impact. We did not think it sensible
to table a new clause that would have no impact if the Government just
decided that it would not have one. We are trying to beef up what the
Government do. That is why we have included a specific
figure.</div>
					<a name="08022652000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to
me that the right approach to new applications, whether at Kingsnorth
or elsewhere, is that we first need a public inquiry, as it will be the
first of many and this is of strategic national importance. I hope the
Minister will tell us whether or not we will get an inquiry. We should
not give the go-ahead in the hope that the technology is on stream,
although many of us have understandably expressed such hopes. We should
not give the go-ahead for an indeterminate future point at which the
stuff that is going to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>spewed out might be captured. We should not give the go-ahead with that
degree of uncertainty.</div>
					<a name="08022652000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Personally, my judgment would
be that the go-ahead should not be given to any new coal-fired power
station until there is a determinate period in which carbon capture can
be applied. Indeed, the requirement should be that, when the go-ahead
is given, the power station is CCS ready in a very specific
sense&#151;ready for a technology that we know will work in a
realistic time scale. That seems to be the right way forward.</div>
					<a name="08022652000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to the hon. Member
for Wealden, I suggest that the industry would then have certainty; it
would know the time scale over which it had to put CCS in place; it
would know the technology required to implement it; and it would have
some idea of cost, because the technology would be near market. That is
probably the right balance to strike. I hope the Minister can clarify
the Government&#146;s strategic approach, because our new clause is
all about the limits and conditions on a new generation of coal-fired
power stations, and it would be helpful to get a steer at this point
from the Minister on the Government&#146;s strategic
approach.</div>

							<a name="08022652000361"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> This has been a useful discussion. May I say from
the outset that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any live
application for a power station&#151;or indeed on the timing of any
decision by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State operates in
a semi-judicial world in that respect, and I am afraid that our hands
are tied. Obviously, for any application, the Secretary of State would
want carefully to consider all
representations.</div>
					<a name="08022652000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
licensing regime for CCS will be flexible enough to cover liabilities
for leaks, among other things. The European Union&#146;s ETS
liabilities will therefore also be covered for as long as the licence
is in place. After that&#151;as I think we were teasing out
earlier&#151;the liability in the long, long term will have to pass
to the state.</div>
					<a name="08022652000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
also asked whether, if there were a leakage&#151;of course, we hope
there will not be any&#151;there is a penalty regime in the Bill. I
am advised that clause 19 explains what can be contained in a licence,
although the list of terms and conditions is not exhaustive. We expect
requirements to remedy and to notify of a leak to be included in every
licence, as standard. Failure to notify of a leak will be a criminal
offence under clause 22. The operator will also be liable for damages
under the environmental liability
directive.</div>

						</b> Clause 19(3) contains a list of the things in the
licence, but the Minister appears to be saying that leakage is not yet

to be fundamental to a licence to store
carbon.</div>

						</b> I have said that the list is non-exhaustive, and we
expect such things to be included, but perhaps I can say more about
that in the debate on clause 19. Committee sittings may be exhausting,
but the list is non-exhaustive.</div>
					<a name="08022652000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have listened carefully to
the hon. Member for Cheltenham speak on the new clause, but I have also
listened to the hon. Member for Northavon, and I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>not sure whether there was consistency. I think of myself as a
conviction politician, but I have a weakness for searching for
consensus. The consensus is&#151;surely, this is a happy
situation&#151;that we all want carbon capture and storage to work,
because of its importance to contributing to CO<span class="Sub">2</span> reductions.
We are all frustrated that CCS is not on the shelf, ready to take off
and apply to fossil fuel power stations. The issues that confront us
are probably about timing, and of course, energy supply and security
are crucial.</div>
					<a name="08022652000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I see
myself as more of a spectator in the discussion between the two
Opposition spokesmen, and as the only Minister on the Committee, I
welcome that distraction from time to time. I enjoy it, and it is often
interesting. Nevertheless, supply is important. The climate change and
energy world is full of sometimes well-qualified people who say no to
things&#151;they are the Dr. Nos. They say no to nuclear and no to
fossil fuel power stations, and they say yes to other things in
principle. However, I am afraid that the hon. Member for Northavon is
right. I use the word &#147;afraid&#148; because the Liberal
Benches are often full of Liberal MPs who, in practice, say no to wind
farms in their constituencies. The simple truth is that, unless we are
going to jeopardise our security of supply and unless we become even
more reliant on gas imports than we will need to be anyway, we must
start to say yes to things.</div>
					<a name="08022652000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think therefore that
it is unreasonable if, either during debates in Committee or on the
Floor of the House, serious political parties say serious things about
where the stuff is going to come from. That is a perfectly legitimate
point that the hon. Gentleman raised. I was searching for consensus and
I have spoilt it, but there we are. The consensus is that we want
carbon capture and storage to work, but we have to confront a timing
problem. It is not unreasonable that we have different views about that
problem.</div>
					<a name="08022652000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can
understand the motivations behind the new clause. I shall explain why
we have not included provisions in the Bill similar to those
recommended by the hon. Members for Cheltenham and for Northavon and
why we believe that it will not be appropriate to do so. Section 36 of
the Electricity Act 1989 requires a development consent to be obtained
from the Secretary of State in England and Wales and from the Scottish
Executive in Scotland for all new power stations of 50 MW or
more.</div>
					<a name="08022652000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
suggests that no such consent should be granted unless the relevant
power station is capable of meeting a prescribed standard for the
emission of greenhouse gases. Although I am still confused about the
timing of when the new power will come into force, but perhaps that is
a detail. The Government do not believe that prescribing emission
limits in that way is the most effective route to low-carbon power
generation. Such an approach goes against the Government&#146;s
fundamental approach to energy policy, as set out in the 2007 White
Paper. In the UK&#146;s competitive market framework, the choice of
fuel and technology for a new power station is a matter for the energy
company. The Government&#146;s role is to set the right framework to
incentivise private sector investment, consistent with meeting our
energy goals of tackling climate change and providing energy
security.</div>

					<a name="08022652000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The EU ETS is
a market-based mechanism that sets an overall EU cap
on carbon dioxide emissions. It operates by setting an absolute cap on
the CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions that can be emitted by the installations
covered by the scheme&#151;for example, a cement factory or a power
station. The cap on emissions is distributed to installations via
allowances that are either given or auctioned off to individual
installations. The allocations of allowances specify how much carbon
dioxide may be emitted by each installation. Installations that emit
less carbon dioxide than their allowance and therefore have an excess
can sell it on the market, and those that emit above their individual
allocation must purchase the allowances from installations with a
surplus.</div>
					<a name="08022652000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the EU ETS is the best way to tackle this issue for two
reasons.</div>

							<a name="08022652000369"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Would the hon. Gentleman mind if I make some
progress? First, the in-built scarcity in allowances that results from
the imposition of the cap creates a price for carbon, thus encouraging
investments in generating technologies that emit less carbon dioxide,
which is the same objective as that in the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="08022652000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the EU ETS provides flexibility for the market to identify the most
cost-effective way to reduce emissions. The ETS allows companies to use
credits derived from the so-called Kyoto flexible mechanisms&#151;the
clean development mechanism and the joint implementation
mechanism&#151;to offset carbon emissions in the UK. Thus, where this
is cheaper than reducing emissions in the UK, project developers will
take action to set up emissions-reducing projects in the developing or
transition countries and will sell the emission reduction credits
derived from such projects to entities covered by the EU ETS.</div>
					<a name="08022652000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the flexibility in the EU
ETS, we can therefore reduce emissions at the lowest economic cost,
while facilitating technology transfer to developing countries. The new
clause would be to remove that flexibility. For example, in the short
term, an operator may build a coal power station in the UK and buy
allowances through the clean development mechanism. With the benefit of
a proven technology, such as CCS, the same operator may then choose to
retrofit CCS and benefit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div>from the emission reductions. Carbon emission reduction is a global
objective and we need to deliver it through the most cost-effective
means. That is a lower cost way of reducing emissions, and I believe
that it is right that developers should have that
option.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000370"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for indulging me
again by giving way. I want to question him before he sits down and
allows me to speak substantially on the issue. He is describing the
process by which carbon pricing is achieved through the emissions
trading scheme. That was quite specifically addressed by Sir Nicholas,
now Lord Stern in his report. He
said:</div>
					<a name="08022652000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Carbon
pricing alone will not be sufficient to reduce emissions on the scale
and pace required&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022652000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason for that is pretty clear, from the way in which the ETS is
operating in practice. The carbon price that it is generating is not
sufficient to drive investment into clean technologies. This is an
explicit problem with emerging emissions trading schemes and one with
which we are all familiar. Does the Minister now disagree with Sir
Nicholas Stern&#146;s assessment that something more than simply an
emissions trading scheme and carbon pricing is required to drive
forward such
technology?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000371"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I agree with Nick Stern&#146;s analysis, although
I want to say a little more about the ETS. It is part of the answer and
becomes a more significant part if the carbon price increases as we
become tougher in phase 3 of the ETS. I certainly concede that, as far
as we can tell at the moment and for the foreseeable future, it is not
the whole answer, just part of
it.</div>
					<a name="08022652000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have outlined
our commitment to consolidating the EU ETS in the
energy White Paper and we are currently working closely with the
Commission to ensure that the revised EU ETS directive continues to
play a key role in ensuring that the EU and the national emissions
reduction targets are reached. I hope that members of the Committee
agree with the Government&#146;s view of the ETS as a cost-effective
means of delivering our goals in achieving emissions reductions. It
does that while, at the same time, allowing progress towards achieving
all our energy policy goals, including maintaining reliable
supplies.</div>
					<a name="08022652000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Committee will be well aware, without new electricity capacity, the
United Kingdom potentially faces a growing gap in its generation
capacity. The hon. Member for Cheltenham has made that point. It is
significant that nine fossil fuel power plants, comprising 12 GW of
capacity, which is about 20 per cent. of peak demand this year, are
scheduled to close by the end of 2015. Six nuclear power plants with
the combined capacity of about 6.3 GW are also scheduled to close by
2016, with another 4 GW in later
years.</div>
					<a name="08022652000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
therefore in the position to rule out key elements of the UK&#146;s
energy mix, which is what the hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause would
effectively achieve by setting greenhouse gas emission standards at
approximately half of what is currently emitted by a new
super-critical, coal-powered station. Currently, coal accounts for
about one third of our electricity supply, but that proportion will
reduce during the next 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div>five to 10 years as stations close. Coal-fired electricity generation
plays an important part in reducing and managing the risks of growing
dependence on gas, such as in the winter of 2006 when gas supplies were
tight and prices were extremely high, and the market was able to reduce
gas emissions by generating electricity from coal. Indeed, during that
winter for several months some 50 per cent. of our electricity was
generated by coal in a difficult global gas
market.</div>
					<a name="08022652000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should not
prevent the market from providing such flexibility as we become more
dependent on gas. Although the Government are committed to meeting EU
renewable energy targets and have paved the way for new nuclear,
neither technology is currently well suited to providing large-scale,
flexible generating capacity on the time scale that can respond quickly
to changes in the supply-demand balance. Fossil fuel power stations are
presently the only means that we have of ensuring the flexible and
responsive back-up capacity that we
need.</div>
					<a name="08022652000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
instead of ruling out one type of energy supply, the approach favoured
by the Government is to maintain a diverse energy mix and to support
the EU ETS that sets absolute caps on carbon dioxide emissions, and
thus sends a clear carbon price signal to the market. That incentivises
the industry to bring forward cost-effective investments to drive
carbon dioxide emissions
reduction.</div>

							<a name="08022652000372"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I have listened to the Minister with great care.
He will be well aware that the price of carbon as set out under the EU
ETS has fluctuated enormously. It has been up to 30 a tonne; it
has been down to a few cents a tonne. Will he clarify the
Government&#146;s thinking on a floor price of carbon in the event
that they decided that the EU ETS was not doing enough to switch people
away from carbon because the price was too low? Will they consider a
floor
price?</div>
					<a name="08022652000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000373"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> The short answer is yes, as we have said in our
documentation. We are reluctant to have to get to that place. All our
efforts are in developing and making stronger the ETS, so that CCS can
be brought in, as can aviation and so on. We can have some confidence
that, as the phases progress&#151;phase 3, for example&#151;we will
see a stronger price for carbon. That is kept in reserve as a
possibility.</div>
					<a name="08022652000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">On my
understanding, the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham
asks for regulations on emissions standards and for carbon capture
readiness to be made within 12 months of the Bill&#146;s enactment.
The fact is that the technology will not be ready by then. It will not
have been tested in the UK or anywhere else. Again, that raises the
issue of what timing the Liberal Democrat Members have in mind. This is
not a debating point, it is a serious matter&#151;I am still slightly
hazy about whether they envisage a number of years when no fossil fuel
or coal power stations would ever be allowed because the technology
would not be ready. I am genuinely unclear about that.
</div>
					<a name="08022652000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue of carbon
capture and storage readiness is an important point referred to in new
clause 18(3)(a). I would like hon. Members to note that we are
currently considering whether we should require future fossil fuel 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>power stations to be built &#147;capture ready&#148;, and if so,
what the options would be for doing that. We will be launching a
consultation on carbon capture readiness later this spring. The
consultation will take into account the recent draft EU directive on
CCS that promotes mandatory carbon capture ready conditions. It will
consider the capture readiness requirements that may need to be
contained in future applications for consents and how practically we
might deal with the UK&#146;s consenting process. It would therefore
be premature to refer to carbon capture readiness in the Bill prior to
the outcome of the consultation.</div>

						<a name="08022652000374"></a>
							<b class="B">Paddy
Tipping</b> (Sherwood) (Lab): I accept that
that is a sensible approach, but there is currently one planning
application&#151;Kingsnorth in Kent&#151;and the Minister will have
to be careful how he talks about it. Presumably that application
precedes the consultation and will not be affected by the statement
that he has just made.</div>

indeed, I know that he was attending another Committee when I said at
the beginning that I would not comment on any one application for
reasons that he will understand. However, I have heard his
comment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000376"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> Can the Minister define what he means by carbon
capture ready? My understanding is that being carbon capture ready
could mean having better scrubbing facilities for sorting out the
SO<span class="Sub">x</span> and NO<span class="Sub">x</span>, because if they are not removed from
the system one cannot apply the carbon capture technology at a later
date. Also, it is about having additional space for building a carbon
capture facility adjacent to the power station. Is that also his
understanding or does he have something more fundamental in
mind?</div>
					<a name="08022652000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000377"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I invariably have more fundamental things in mind.
The answer is yes: we want to consult because this, like many other
questions, is not as simple as it sounds. We want to consider the
capture readiness requirements that may be contained in future
applications. In other words, we want to consider exactly what we mean
by capture readiness. We want to have a consultation so that we can
answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question properly and technically.
The issue deserves some technical work, hence our
consultation.</div>
					<a name="08022652000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, I hope that I have reassured the hon. Members for Northavon
and for Cheltenham that the provisions contained in the new clause are
not necessary. The EU emissions trading scheme offers the most
cost-effective means of ensuring that greenhouse gas emissions are
reduced. However, I have always been happy to concede that, in the
foreseeable future the ETS is unlikely to be the whole answer as it
will depend on the price of carbon. Therefore, the consultation is
important, as is the development of the CCS demonstration project as
soon as we can.</div>

							<a name="08022652000378"></a>Martin

announcement of a consultation on readiness of carbon capture and

welcome.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>
					<a name="08022652000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a moot point whether
locking in carbon capture and storage to the licensing regime in
respect of new power stations is premature, or whether it is premature
of the Bill to go ahead before that consultation has taken place. We
can leave that to one side.</div>
					<a name="08022652000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister is also right to
identify the major problem facing energy supply in the UK, which is
that tens of gigawatts of power are to go off stream by the middle of
the next decade. That is why carbon capture and storage is critical and
why it is essential that a regime that locks in carbon capture and
storage&#151;not just in terms of storing the carbon but of mandating
its capture&#151;is so important. With the best will in the world,
energy efficiency, renewables and nuclear&#151;whichever we
prefer&#151;are not going to be ready in time to meet our emissions
targets by the middle of the next decade when this large-scale
generating capacity is
lost.</div>

							<a name="08022652000379"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I seek clarity from the hon. Gentleman. I could
understand an argument that says that as soon as the technology is
ready it should be a requirement. I am not saying that that would be
the Government&#146;s position, but it seems a logical argument. Is
he saying that, or is he saying that until the technology is there a
Liberal Democrat Government would never approve a coal-powered or
fossil fuel powered station? What is the position on
timing?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000380"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s question
and the opportunity to clarify. We are seeking to lock in a process
whereby it will be clear to investors that absolute mandatory
conditions, of the kind that he just seemed to open the door to, will
be part of the regime and will be in the Bill to give the Secretary of
State powers to mandate reductions in specific carbon dioxide emissions
from power stations, including fossil fuel powered ones. It will be for
the Secretary of State to judge when the technology has reached the
point at which those powers can be exercised and the restrictions
introduced. The Minister suggested that the exact limit on emissions
set by the clause would stop the development of all new fossil fuel
powered stations, but in practice that could be a matter for debate. If
the level is wrong, we can have the same essential regime with a
different level, if that needs to be
negotiated.</div>
					<a name="08022652000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
the Minister questioned whether the technology was ready to put this
kind of regime in place. The point is not to prejudge the technological
developments. We are trying to avoid that. This is technology-neutral.
We are trying to send a clear signal to investors and the
industry&#151;as requested by Stern and in so many other
arenas&#151;that this will be the regime, the landscape, the policy
and the clear strategic direction. At the moment, there is nothing
about that area in the Bill. There is nothing in the Bill that reflects
the comments that the Minister has just made about being open to the
idea of setting limits on individual power stations. We are trying to
introduce that.</div>
					<a name="08022652000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s broad position at present, as I understand it, is
that measures outside the Bill, in particular the emissions trading
scheme, are a sufficient incentive to industry to bring forward the new

<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>technology. That is a respectable and logical position. It is one that I
hope, under some pressure, he might be persuaded to modify.</div>
					<a name="08022652000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I find the
Conservatives&#146; position less logical. They seem to support in
principle the idea that we need to lock in some process to mandate
carbon capture and storage, but to criticise the only practical and
positive suggestion on the table, which is the new clause. There is no
Conservative alternative. If Conservative Members are not going to
support the proposal in front of us, I have to concede that it is
unlikely to go
forward.</div>

intervention, which was well informed as ever. He raises a legitimate
concern, but we could debate the level at which the restrictions are
set and whether the Californian model on which the new clause is based
works well in practice. Such debates could all be had. At the moment,
the new clause is the only practical suggestion for locking in capture,
as opposed to storage, that is being suggested in the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08022652000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
I find the position of Conservative Members unsatisfactory because they
are not proposing any alternatives despite appearing to support the

certainly better informed.</div>
					<a name="08022652000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate has gone to the
heart of the energy challenge that we face. We know that, in 20 years,
there are going to be many new sources of energy. Marine and tidal
technology will have proved what they can achieve, and we will know
what other forms of renewable energy, such as photovoltaics, can
deliver. We have a massive energy shortfall coming down the line and we
have to make decisions on how we are going to address that at an
earlier stage. The challenge is that we do not know what technology can
deliver economically.</div>
					<a name="08022652000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">We probably all believe that
CCS is technically possible, but the challenge will be to ask industry
to invest in new coal technology and coal-fired power stations when it
does not know what the cost will be or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>who will pay for it. Industry will be aware that it will cost hundreds
of millions of pounds to add CCS to each power station. If the
Government were going to come forward with the money, by using some of
the credit from the EU ETS for example, that would make a completely
different investment environment from the one there is now. Although I
am sympathetic to and understand what Governor Schwarzenegger has
achieved in California, my concern about the new clause is that it
would introduce too many uncertainties into people&#146;s investment
decisions in this
area.</div>
					<a name="08022652000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to raise
with the Minister a number of general points about clause 18; there are
areas where greater clarification will be helpful. Is he seeking to
have international agreements and standards on these matters, rather
than the UK going it alone? It would be a matter of concern to us, if
we felt that the UK had different standards to other countries,
particularly if those countries were adjacent to us. I hope that he
will take a generally global view on that. The countries that may be
able to do most in this area are those such as Norway and the United
States, so we should not just be looking at an EU solution but to
genuinely international standards.</div>
					<a name="08022652000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who does the Minister think
will be able to apply for a licence under clause 18(2)(a)? What
restrictions does he have in mind? Are there categories of people who
will be likely to be barred from making applications? He has indicated
in the past that it was unnecessary to bar people from making future
applications, because if they did not adhere to the rules and
regulations, this is the area where they could be ruled out. Are there
other categories, particularly international ownership of
organisations, where that may be the case? Would that give him grounds
for anxiety? What will the fund, as set out in clause 18(2)(e), be used
for? Will it deal with problems during the facility&#146;s operation?
How will financial security be provided? Will it just be from funds
contributed, or will there also be a duty on parents and associated
companies? Does that also take account of any decommissioning
costs?</div>
					<a name="08022652000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The store
itself will clearly not be decommissioned&#151;the intention is that
the CO<span class="Sub">2</span> will be there for all time&#151;but a small amount
of apparatus will be necessary for injecting the CO<span class="Sub">2</span> into
that facility. Who will be responsible for the decommissioning of that
and will it be covered from this fund? Further, who will look after the
fund&#151;will it be ring-fenced? Will that be managed by the
Government, or will it be invested elsewhere? Could it be used, for
example, to offset levels of Government debt? Greater clarity as to how
the fund will be looked after would be helpful.</div>
					<a name="08022652000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I refer the Minister
back to the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton,
South, who sadly cannot be here this morning. He talked about the need
for a financial security test. At the time, the Minister said that that
related more specifically to CO<span class="Sub">2</span> than to gas storage
elements, so perhaps this would be an appropriate moment for him to
comment on that. My hon. Friend
said:</div>
					<a name="08022652000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
understand the need for a financial security test with regard to the
financial standing of certain licensees when that test suggests that
their ability to meet their obligation may be at risk. However, we need
to temper that with an understanding that this should not be an
automatic presumption to ensure that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>companies do not make unnecessary financial provision over a sizeable

think I indicated last week&#151;certainly there will be an
opportunity later this morning, or later today&#151;to say more about
the international framework that we are developing. However, he is
obviously right that there is no point in us just developing ideas
about CCS or any other proposals on carbon reductions here in the UK.
We have got to play our part. We are responsible for 2 per cent. of the
world&#146;s CO<span class="Sub">2</span> reductions but given that that
means&#151;if my arithmetic is right&#151;that 98 per cent. is the
responsibility of other countries, we need to work internationally.
Without going over territory that I can cover later, we are, for
example, working very hard with the Norwegians on carbon capture and
storage, including the reform of international conventions that have
prevented the dumping of waste at sea. They clearly need modernising
and we are making great progress on that. We are, of course, working
within the framework of the European Union but I will say more about
that in due course.</div>

We will be consulting on the nature of financial security. Our aim is
to provide protection for taxpayers at least cost to the operator; we
do not want to regulate for the  sake of it. The operator will
be responsible for decommissioning facilities and we will bear the
cost&#151;as is the case for other offshore facilities. Will the hon.
Gentleman be happy for me to write to him about the precise nature of
the fund? I understand the points that he is making and I can assure
him that this will of course not be used as a pot for our friends at
the Treasury. However, we need to have appropriate safeguards in terms

Main</b> (St. Albans) (Con): I should like some elaboration on
what is required for people decommissioning offshore facilities. Is
there enough clarity over what will be left when this is capped
off&#151;I cannot think of a better way of putting it? What
structures will remain, will there be ongoing observation of the state
of the site and what can people expect? These structures, as we know
with the North sea, often end up in some fjord as a crumbling wreck.
Exactly what do we imagine remaining in perpetuity for shipping,
wildlife and the marine environment as a
whole?</div>

						</b> We have much experience to draw on and will do in
the coming few years&#151;from the decommissioning of our oil and gas
rigs in the North sea and the wider UK continental shelf where we have
very clear procedures on what we mean by decommissioning. We discuss
that regularly with the industry. We were saying last week that the
company will have the prime responsibility, not the only
responsibility, for monitoring the operation while it is live and
before it is finally sealed off and capped, but we also said that our
own departmental inspectors, whose experience is in oil and gas, will
have a major responsibility, but with all the extra technical
assistance that will be required. When the carbon dioxide storage is
concluded&#151;when it is finally sealed or capped&#151;the state
will, in one way or another, have the ultimate responsibility for
long-term
monitoring.</div>

Lady will appreciate that the details will need to be finalised at the

kind of storage of CO<span class="Sub">2</span>, but we are able to draw on the
experience of the Norwegians in the Sleipner gas field, where CO<span class="Sub">2

Hendry:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 12, in
clause 19, page 10, line 27, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(i) provision
about obligations of a licence holder to advise the Secretary of State
of any accidents, near accidents or leakages relating to the
facility.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08022652000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
clause sets out the terms and conditions that can be attached to a
licence, and they are mostly sensible, nuts-and-bolts things. However
there is nothing here about the rules relating to an accident. The Bill
sets out an inspection regime, but an inspector will presumably make
visits either at a given time or unannounced, but that will not
necessarily coincide with something untoward happening at the facility.
This amendment puts the onus, indeed a legal requirement, on the
operator to advise if there have been accidents or near-accidents. We
recognise that there could be legal difficulty in defining a
near-accident, but it is right to be concerned about things that go
wrong even if they did not actually result in a formal accident. They
might indicate poor working practices that should be
investigated.</div>
					<a name="08022652000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all
recognise that we are entering uncharted waters with this technology
and will be on a learning curve for many years to come. We do not know
from whence the risks to the public or environmental safety might come,
so we do need to take adequate precautions. Safety, of course, comes
with experience and from learning from mistakes&#151;where things
have gone wrong, what steps have been put in place to make sure they do
not happen again? Lessons learned in this way are so fundamental that
they are, of course, the way we make sure that we make adequate
precaution for the future.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>
					<a name="08022652000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be naive to think we
could build in every conceivable safety element from the outset, so we
need a precautionary approach in which the onus is on the operator to
advise of accidents and near-accidents. Operators will be very
concerned about safety, but in the early years of such technology, they
will also be concerned about driving costs down, and cost reductions
must not be allowed to win over safety. Similarly with leaks, the
technology for identifying leaks is in its infancy. Mechanisms to
identify leaks can be put in place, but it should be the responsibility
of the operator to report any leaks that take place so that they can be
fully
investigated.</div>

							<a name="08022652000389"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment ties in with
my comment earlier this morning about the omission from clause 19 of
matters relating to leaks. I know that Government policy on leaks is
normally to have a review that never reports, but I think that we need
something better in this case. Therefore, the idea of a reporting
requirement, as far as it goes, is not one I have a problem
with.</div>
					<a name="08022652000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">This amendment,
however, highlights a more general set of omissions from the terms and
conditions set out in clause 19&#151;and indeed, this part of the
Bill&#151;which relate to the whole issue of monitoring the security
of the storage. We do not just want a report&#151;that there is a big
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> leak and the licensee reports it to the Secretary of
State. That is fine, but does not quite seem to go far
enough.</div>
					<a name="08022652000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">What other
models are the Government looking to? Are they considering existing
models that regulate, for example, mining, oil and gas, pollution
control and waste disposal? A number of parallel activities have their
own monitoring reporting regimes and which of them, if any, is being
looked at&#151;or is there a completely new approach being taken to
the regulation of CCS?</div>
					<a name="08022652000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no problem with the
amendment, although I do not feel that it goes far enough in simply
requiring reporting of accidents&#151;and if they are as catastrophic
as has been suggested, we will know anyway&#151;but we need to go a
lot further than it suggests.</div>
					<a name="08022652000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am puzzled, really, by the
absence of much more detail in the Bill about the liabilities of
operators and why the list of things a licence may include under clause
19(3)(a) to (h) has nothing about not only reporting requirements, but
about penalties and monitoring in the event of leakages. I hope that
the Minister can give us a fairly full response to the issues that have
been raised by this amendment and clause
19.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000390"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I will do my best. Certainly the issue around
accidents of different kinds is crucial, so I would like to thank the
hon. Members for Wealden and for Billericay for tabling the amendment.
I recognise that they raise an important point in relation to carbon
dioxide storage. Given the nature of likely CO<span class="Sub">2</span> storage in
our seas, I will not say more about the use of the term
&#147;uncharted waters&#148;&#151;I do not think that the hon.
Member for Wealden meant that technically but I know what he means. I
hope, however, that some of these waters are charted.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>
					<a name="08022652000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Existing legislation is not
suited to licensing the storage of carbon dioxide under the sea bed,
and chapter 3 of the Bill is intended to provide a comprehensive and
adaptable legal basis for regulating such storage in the offshore area.
I would like to explain why we have drafted the provisions in the way
we have, and set out why we think the amendment to include a provision
about notification of accidents, near-accidents or leakages relating to
a CO<span class="Sub">2</span> storage site is
unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="08022652000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause allows licences for CO<span class="Sub">2</span> storage and related
activities to be granted on such terms and conditions as the Secretary
of State, or an authority to which the licensing function is
transferred, sees fit. The power will allow the licensing authority to
include case-specific requirements in relation to each carbon dioxide
store. The clause provides a non-exhaustive list of examples of the
sorts of conditions licences may contain, including financial security
provisions; the right for the Secretary of State to modify the licence;
and provisions about closure of the storage site and termination of the
licence. In addition, we expect that all licences will include
provisions relating to monitoring and remediation, reporting,
record-keeping, notification obligations, and the requirement to have a
valid lease from the Crown Estate for the relevant
site.</div>
					<a name="08022652000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
therefore gives the Secretary of State, or another licensing authority,
unfettered discretion to grant licences on such terms and conditions as
it considers appropriate, subject to any regulations about the terms
and conditions of licences that may be issued under clause
20.</div>
					<a name="08022652000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="08022652000392"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I think it would help the hon. Gentleman&#151;and
I like to be helpful, from time to time, anyway&#151;if I made
progress.</div>
					<a name="08022652000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would not
be necessary to have express provisions in the Bill because subsection
(3) is a non-exhaustive list. Our approach in subsection (3) is to set
out examples of some of the less obvious provisions that may be
contained in licences. Notification obligations, on the other hand,
will be included in every licence as a matter of course, due to the
importance of keeping the regulatory authority informed of any leaks or
accidents or other significant developments in relation to the storage
site.</div>
					<a name="08022652000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, clause
22(1) specifies that that it will be an offence to fail to notify the
regulatory authority as required by licence, which necessarily implies
that notification requirements may be included in a licence. The
Committee may also wish to note that my Department will be consulting
on the licence arrangements
shortly.</div>
					<a name="08022652000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consequently,
I hope that I have provided some reassurance to the hon. Member for
Northavon that provisions concerning the notification of accidents or
leakages are sufficiently covered in this part of the Bill, without the
need to add to the non-exhaustive list under the clause. I must confess
that I can see why he raised the matter, but I am advised that it is a
list of unusual provisions to be contained in the licences and that, by
contrast with mediation and notification, will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>be included as standard. I apologise if that has led to confusion on his
part but, as my speech progressed, my own confusion started to
evaporate.</div>
					<a name="08022652000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000393"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> The Minister has brought forward an interesting
doctrine whereby the Bill contains things that people might not have
thought of, and omits the obvious, which is novel for Government
legislation. Will he clarify as a set the status of the eight things
under the clause? Is he really asking us to believe that they are in
the Bill simply because we might not have thought of them, such as that
the Secretary of State could review the licence, whereas reporting is
so blindingly obvious that it does not need to be mentioned? Is that
the Department&#146;s strategy for legislating these
days?</div>
					<a name="08022652000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000394"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> That statement does not quite summarise our
approach. I have conceded to the hon. Gentleman that I can understand
why he is confused. Our approach was such that some things were so
blindingly obvious&#151;for example, concern about accidents and
leakages&#151;that reference need not be made to them, but I hope
that he is now reassured. My experience with the Department working
with the oil and gas industry, which is an obvious comparator, through
our partnership with the industry known as PILOT, which I attend
regularly, has impressed on me the fact that the industry takes
accidents most seriously. We have only to go on an oil rig to
experience a 20-minute safety speech first. That takes place perfectly
properly, and we are not complacent about it. I am convinced that my
Department and many of the big players that are likely to be involved
in carbon dioxide storage have accidents as well as leakages uppermost
in their minds. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman to some
extent.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000395"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> The Minister has explained in general terms why
some things as obvious as the environmental consequences are not set
out in the Bill, although that might have been a good measure given
that, when discussing earlier clauses, he suggested that environmental
consequences would be paramount to the granting of licences under other
parts of the Bill&#146;s regime. He might therefore wish to comment
on how important they are to the licensing regime that we are
discussing.</div>
					<a name="08022652000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
specific question is about whether the granting of licences will
involve the calculation of the future cost of climate change. That is a
relevant consideration at the moment, because it was used in the
consultation on the third runway at Heathrow, when a strange new number
invented by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
called the shadow price of carbon was used to calculate the future cost
of climate change from carbon emissions on that project. That shadow
price of carbon was three times lower than the one recommended in the
Stern report for calculating the future cost of climate change. The
difference was based on the assumption as to whether the various
measures to tackle climate change would be successful. Stern was
pessimistic, but realistic, about the prospects of that happening. Will
the future cost of climate change be factored into the granting of
licences for the facilities? If so, will we be committed to using the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div>rather dubious number that was invented by DEFRA perhaps to fiddle the
outcome of the Heathrow consultation, which that would have changed, or
will there be the potential for DBERR to plan a more realistic path on
its own and use calculations based more closely on the Stern
report?</div>

Wicks:
						</b> If I did not know that the hon. Gentleman was one
of the most disciplined parliamentarians in the House, I might have
thought that he was trying to use my Bill as a little peg to make a
point about Heathrow and DEFRA. I am sure that that is not the case.
The importance of climate change is one of the reasons why issues about
carbon dioxide storage are in the Bill. Tackling climate change is one
of the major purposes of the Bill. If we are to stand any chance of
tackling climate change&#151;and we stand a good chance&#151;we
need to bring forward such technology. At this point, I think that I
will leave the hon. Gentleman on the
runway.</div>

Hendry:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I am afraid that the Minister&#146;s
response is not good enough, although we have great sympathy for him.
He was reading through his text and suddenly realised that he did not
understand what he was saying. We have all been there before. I find
that that can happen to me even when I have written my own speech
notes. Alongside Murphy&#146;s law and Parkinson&#146;s law, we now

					<a name="08022652000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">If

the amendment next, will the Minister assure us that included in the

they do not have that obligation, how will we know if one has taken

Wicks:
						</b> Clearly, as this debate shows, the licence is a key
means of ensuring that the environmental impacts of the carbon dioxide
stores are minimised. That, combined with the fact that this is an
emerging industry in which technical and regulatory experience is still
evolving, means that a degree of flexibility in prescribing and
modifying licence terms must be retained. For example, much of the
basis of the initial licensing of a store will be predictive modelling
of the behaviour of carbon dioxide in natural geological formations. If
those models prove to be inaccurate, the regulatory authority may need
to modify the licence. I mentioned that we know a little about the
behaviour of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> through the Sleipner project in Norway, but
it is early days scientifically.</div>
					<a name="08022652000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The draft EU directive on
carbon dioxide storage also requires the regulatory authority to have
the power to review and, where necessary, modify the licence. Existing
offshore licensing arrangements contain similar provisions, for
example, licences issued under part 2 of the Food and Environmental
Protection Act 1985 include the right of the regulatory authority to
attach additional conditions, where there is a risk of adverse
environmental impacts.</div>

holders are now entering the debate, does the Minister think it
advisable to have a licence for a permitted period, which he might
specify, rather than what seems to be a somewhat open-ended commitment
to a licence, but one that can therefore be modified without the
licensee&#146;s
permission?</div>

						</b> I would need to reflect on that. This is a
long-term business, is it not? I think I said earlier that we might be
talking about something of the order of 40 years for CO<span class="Sub">2</span>
storage. I keep repeating myself, but it is such early days, who knows
what the length of these projects will be? They will be long projects.
We have plenty of time to reflect, but I would need to reflect on what
the hon. Lady is saying. Is she saying that it would be sensible to
only grant a licence for 10 years, with clear details, as
opposed to granting one for 40 years that might need flexibility
later?</div>

						</b> I just wanted to tease out the Minister&#146;s
thoughts. There are so many vagaries, not because anybody intends to
make life vague, but because there are imponderables about the future.
It may be that there will be a rolling programme of renewing, so that
there is a guaranteed certainty unless the licences have been operated
in an unacceptable fashion. Perhaps the Minister should look at that
rather than putting into the Bill something which, depending on the
political climate of the time, allows him to alter the licence at will
or on a whim. With that vague possibility of future costs, the licensee
would be left uncertain or unwilling to
invest.</div>

						</b> As I say, there will be time to reflect on such
matters. No doubt when we reach that point&#151;and I hope that we
will reach it with our demonstration project, although that will be for
one rather special project&#151;we will consult with the relevant
company or consortium. In the longer term, there will be opportunities
for consulting with the new and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div>emerging industry. We certainly have flexibilities in the North sea with
regard to oil and gas, which we want to ensure are being properly
exploited. Where appropriate, we can take licences away and reallocate
them to newer, often smaller, companies. I am not certain whether that
is a useful comparison, but I understand the question. We are in very
early days and I understand that companies need as much certainty,
including financial certainty, as they can get. There will be great
opportunities to explore these issues and consult with the companies
concerned.</div>

about urban development on Mars when we have not even lit the fuse, or
whatever we do. I am not saying that the hon. Lady is being
unreasonable, but it is reasonable to say that these are early days and
there will be time to consider these issues. We should look at this as
a new industry that will emerge globally, with opportunities for
companies to prove themselves and show that they are technically and
financially on top of the job when seeking other contracts around the
world. I think that many companies will understand that we need
flexibilities. They will want to prove that they can be adaptable as we
learn more about science, technology and engineering, so that they can
win contracts in the future. Trying to look into the crystal ball, I
doubt that companies will object to flexibility for licences, because
they will want to prove themselves commercially adaptable to the
emergence of technology as the decades roll
past.</div>

Minister&#146;s rescue on this point as he seems pretty unclear at
the moment. The Minister referred to existing technologies and licences
in the North sea with respect to the oil and gas projects. He said that
the Secretary of State has the right to remove licences and reallocate
them. Does the Secretary of State have the right to modify North sea
oil licences, and can the Minister give any example of where such a
licence has been issued and can be modified? That is the crux of the
matter.</div>

						</b> I will have to come back to the hon. Gentleman on
the issue of modification, and I will do so. We do have some
experience. Earlier I referred to what some call the, &#147;Lose it
or use it&#148; approach to the North sea, which the industry as a
whole rather accepts. Some big companies have decided that their
priorities lie elsewhere in the world in terms of oil or gas
exploration, and we now make those potential fields available to what
are often smaller and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>enterprising companies. That is possibly a little off course, but I
repeat the point: there will be time to look at all those
matters.</div>
					<a name="08022652000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must, of course, be careful
to ensure that a company that takes on the
responsibility of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>storage recognises that it is in the
business for the long term. It is not a commercial activity for a year
or two, and indeed, the ultimate responsibility for decommissioning
lies with the company. If there were any transfer of a licence, we
would have to make sure that all the financial certainty was there in
agreeing to that. This is looking
ahead.</div>

					<a name="08022652000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The people
applying for these licences are going to be those companies looking to
operate a fossil fuel facility. If they are going to put in the many
millions in costs for the carbon capture and storage facility to be
adjacent to or an integral part of their power plant, and then
potentially hundreds of miles of pipeline to a storage facility, they
will want to know that the licence will apply for as long as they are
running that power plant. If there were a risk that after 25 years they
could lose the right to deposit the carbon they had captured in a
facility that may stop them going for it in the first place. They would
end up with a facility that they could not operate because by then the
rules might have changed or the price of carbon would be so high.
Surely they are looking above all for certainty rather than
flexibility.</div>

it is important that the Secretary of State has certain powers for
flexibility, not least as we learn more about this technology. I could
also envisage that a company might feel that after a number of years it
did not want to stay in this business, and that its commercial priority
had changed. Then, subject to lots of appropriate safeguards in terms
of another company taking over the contract&#151;all the financial
safeguards that we could think of in terms of the ultimate costs of
decommissioning and the financial arrangements that would be necessary
between one company and another&#151;I would not rule out the

allows the Secretary of State to make regulations prescribing the terms
and conditions that must be included in licences. It is necessary to
have this power to make regulations prescribing the contents of
licences for several reasons. For example, it will allow the Secretary
of State to specify the minimum provisions that must be included in
every licence, and whether they are to be issued by the Secretary of
State himself or herself or another authority to which the licensing
function has been transferred under clause 33, as we discussed
previously, thus ensuring that the key standards and conditions are
contained in all licences. Moreover, this power will allow specific
provisions prescribed by EU legislation or international guidance to be
incorporated in all
licences.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000420"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> I would like to address my remarks to new clause 7,
which is a very simple one. It says that where there is a competitive
process related to carbon capture, the Secretary of State&#146;s
approach should be technology-neutral. That is what we are driving at.
I anticipate that the Minister will accept our amendment because of
something he said earlier this morning. When he was talking about
alternative strategies for carbon reduction, he said that choice of
technology is a matter for companies to determine. I wrote it down as
quickly as I could and the record will bear me out, but perhaps the
Minister will correct me if am misquoting him. He said that in the
context of the energy mix and the best strategy for reducing CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>and I agree with him.</div>
					<a name="08022652000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is consistent with our new
clause, which says that there are three main approaches to carbon
capture and storage. The hon. Member for Bolton, South-East ran through
this so I will not go over it again at any length, but we have talked
quite a lot about  post-combustion technology and
pre-combustion technology, and rather less interestingly&#151;I would
be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s view on this&#151;about
oxyfuel combustion, in which the fuel is burnt in oxygen rather than
air.</div>
				
					<a name="08022652000309"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08022652000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to us
that there are three possible technologies that could have been a
source of competition and a range of approaches that the Government
could have taken. One is that they could have said, &#147;Our goal is
reducing CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions through some method of carbon
capture. We will therefore invite submissions from anybody who can do
this by any means. We will evaluate them against each other&#151;both
within technologies and between technologies&#151;and the one that
seems to give us the most bang for our buck is the one we will go
for&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08022652000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, there is a
one-competition approach. The Minister, in his gently mocking manner,
suggested that we were calling for four or five competitions. There is
a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div>one-competition answer to this, which is simply that, if public money is
to be spent and the Government feel that they do not have the money for
more than one technology, at the very least different technologies will
be allowed to compete against one another&#151;and may the best
carbon capturer win.</div>
					<a name="08022652000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would have been one way.
Another way, as we suggested at the previous sitting of the Committee,
would have been to have had separate competitions for the different
technologies. If the Minister&#146;s argument, as I understand it, is
that, like oranges and apples, they cannot be compared, then perhaps
there could have been separate competitions. We have suggested that
what Ofgem regards as the windfall profits of the energy companies
might have been a source of revenue to fund additional competitions. We
are not prescriptive about it but, given the importance of the matter,
it might have been a better way of doing things.
</div>
					<a name="08022652000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has said
that this is potentially one of 12 EU-wide demonstration projects. To
be fair to him, the Government deserve some credit for trying to take
the process forward. I hope that he will update the Committee on where
he thinks the other 11 are up to. The Minister shrugs his shoulders
worryingly.</div>

Are the Government confident, first, that those other schemes are going
to come forward at all, and secondly, that they will cover the diverse
range of technologies? With the Government having decided to be
technology-specific&#151;which we are not happy about&#151;the
purpose of our new clause is to make sure that the other technologies
are tested in the other demonstration projects.</div>
					<a name="08022652000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister is
doing more than just shrugging his shoulders. I hope that when he talks
in his fluent Polish, or whatever, to his European counterparts, he is
saying to them, &#147;How about getting on with your projects and how
about these other technologies being looked at?&#148; The Government
have locked the UK in for one demonstration project on one technology,
but are they using their influence, such as it is, with our EU
partners, to ensure that in the 12 we are at least trying to ameliorate
the problem we have created for ourselves by ensuring that other
demonstration projects test other
technologies?</div>

							<a name="08022652000423"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:
						</b> I am slightly worried that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s new clause will have the perverse effect, which I do
not think that he intends, whereby the Government will be required to
give equal weighting to different technologies. Therefore, even if the
UK becomes expert in one particular technology and other countries
become experts in a different technology, we would not be allowed to
favour those technologies that the UK has become expert
in.</div>

							<a name="08022652000424"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but
it is not true of the new clause, because  it refers to
competitive processes initiated by the Secretary of State&#151;now
and at the start of the process 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>when expertise is in short supply. If, at a later stage, we get very
good at a particular technology, nothing in the new clause would
prevent the UK Government from favouring it, because the
Government&#146;s approach to such technologies would not necessarily
involve a competitive process. The new clause relates to the
competitive process now being initiated in this
country.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000425"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:
						</b> Were the new clause to have the
interpretation that the hon. Gentleman has suggested, it would need
some sort of sunset clause whereby the Government would only have to be
even-handed about such matters up to a certain point. After that point,
the Government would not have to be even-handed. As it stands, they
would be required to be even-handed for
ever.</div>

							<a name="08022652000426"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> Were the Minister to say that he accepts the
principle, but it must end at some point, I could live with that. I am
not too worried about the principle applying for ever. The new clause
does not bind any non-competitive process&#151;it refers only to
competitions, and its title is &#147;Carbon capture
competitions&#148;. In my judgment, it does not cover the much wider
range of issues such as future Government incentives for carbon
capture, but if the only problem with the new clause is that it needs a
sunset clause, I am happy to accept that further
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08022652000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
worry is the impact that the Government&#146;s decision to favour one
technology has had on the technology that is out there. Time scales are
terribly important, as the Minister would accept. My understanding is
that the EU 12 projects have to be in place and with results by
2015&#151;I believe that that is the date that has been given. But
the DBERR website says that the competition that it has set up requires
something to be in place by 2014. I looked at the website this morning
and I think that that is right, but it would be helpful if the Minister
could clarify why that is the
case.</div>

to the expert evidence that we were given from the director of the
Carbon Capture and Storage Association at the start of our process. We

he is pretty knowledgeable about the subject. He referred to four

speeches about the dim and distant future&#151;but here and now we
have a by-product of pre-combustion technology that is a source of
hydrogen, which could help to fuel the hydrogen economy. If not through

have been perfectly happy to accept that on the record in the
past&#151;but he was happy to admit to the Committee that we are
talking about the expenditure of hundreds of millions of pounds of
taxpayers&#146; money. My question to him is, where is the
cost-benefit analysis of the different sorts of carbon capture
technology that has led the Government to pick one? They have made a
big decision, which will have implications for years to come, on the
technology used for carbon
capture.</div>

implies that the Government have&#151;and I hope that they
have&#151;weighed up the pros and cons of the different technologies.
Will he place in the Library a copy of the document in which they did
that? Have they looked at all three? Have they looked at how long it
might take? Have they tried to put some sort of value on the potential
for retrofitting Chinese coal-fired power stations, as against the
potential of a hydrogen economy if we have pre-combustion technology?
Surely, if the Government have taken a decision to favour one over
another, it has been based on a coherent, rational, structured
cost-benefit analysis, which the Minister will place in the Library at
our request. I certainly hope

						</b> The analysis that the Science and Technology
Committee were aware of and which the Government responded to on 27
April 2006 is the so-called MARKAL modelling analysis. As far as I am
aware, unless there is some more recent data or analysis, that is what
the Government based the choice of post versus pre-carbon capture
technology on. However, as the Government said in their answer to the
Science and Technology Committee&#146;s
report:</div>
					<a name="08022652000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subsequently
some generators have indicated that the cost balance between
refurbishment and new build is closer than implied by the MARKAL
analysis, which did not take account of lost revenue during the
refurbishment shutdown and space limitations at some
sites.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08022652000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means that
on some generator sites there is not room to build a pre-capture plant
or to fit retrospectively post-carbon capture technology. Space
limitation is one issue, but the other is that to fit retrospective
post-carbon capture technology, the plant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>has to be shut down for a considerable period. I ask the Minister, why
was that not included in the MARKAL analysis? It would probably have
altered the balance between pre and post-capture
technology.</div>

						</b> I am grateful for that well-informed intervention.
That is the kind of analysis that I hope that the Minister will place
in the Library: the analysis that the Department has done for all three
technologies, taking into account not just the range of costs and
benefits, which might be of a more commercial nature, as the hon.
Gentleman suggests, but wider matters. As an economist, I struggle to
think how one can put a cash value on the benefit of facilitating the
hydrogen economy, but that appears to be a potential benefit of one of
the technologies. Have the Government done that? My sense is that they
have not. They have had a think about it, they have looked at some of
the papers, which the hon. Gentleman gave, and they have taken a punt
on one technology. The Minister is shaking his head. It would be nice
to think that there is a comprehensive, rigorous and thorough analysis
of the costs and benefits of the three technologies and that he will
publish that analysis so that we can look at
it.</div>

Wicks:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Let me press the hon. Gentleman on this
point. This is an extremely complex field. I think that he was
conceding that although it is an interesting and intellectually
stimulating debating point to say, &#147;Here is a technology that
can produce a hydrogen economy. Here is another one. Let&#146;s do a
cost-benefit analysis, &#148; that could not, I suspect, be done in
great detail. In any case, one would want to factor into the analysis
that others are developing hydrogen technologies; there is a lot of
interest in that in the United States. With respect, he is dodging my
point about China. We know the rate at which the Chinese are building
coal-fired power stations to fuel their economy. I am advised that it
is post-combustion technology that could be retrofitted there. Given
the huge carbon emissions from China in the future, is he really
quarrelling with the advice that I have received that, as we had to
choose one technology, post-combustion was the
best?</div>
					<a name="08022652000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000432"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> I am querying the Minister&#146;s premise that we
had to choose one technology&#151;that we had to pre-select. That is
the fundamental point. It may be that a competitive process with a
proper evaluation of what the Minister calls the pros and cons would
have resulted, if there was to be a single project, in a
post-combustion project. That may have been the outcome, but
pre-empting the outcome in the way that the Minister has seems to be
the problem. He implies that the Government could not do a cost-benefit
analysis, so I am trying to work out what they did do. Has he weighed
up the costs from the go-slow on the four pre-combustion projects,
which he has undermined by picking a different technology? Surely, just
as I should take account of the potential benefits of retrofitting
Chinese coal-fired power stations, the Minister should take account of
the costs of undermining commercial projects to develop alternative
technology. That has been the impact of his decision.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div>
					<a name="08022652000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our argument
is that if we are to have one competition, the Government should not
pre-empt its outcome by picking a technology. The Minister was right
when he said to the Committee this morning that the technology was a
matter for the companies not for the Government; the Government should
set the framework, enable the competing technologies to compete and
show which is the best across the board. My concern is that by picking
a winner, as it were, the Government have undermined other valuable
technologies that could have been well worth looking
at.</div>

							<a name="08022652000433"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> This has been a very interesting and useful
exchange so far. I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s analysis of
the Government&#146;s pilot project and the fact that the Government
have made a mistake in the way that they have gone about it. However, I
do not believe that his new clause is the right solution, because to go
down the route of stopping the Minister deciding on the right type of
technology in future competitions is too
prescriptive.</div>
				
					<a name="08022652000310"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08022652000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for South Thanet put his finger on the key issue. The perverse
consequence of this new clause would actually make it more difficult
for us to encourage areas where the technologies might best be explored
further. If we make good progress with the post-combustion project that
the Government are supporting and then in a few years the Government
decide to launch another project to see whether they could bring
pre-combustion technology up to the same status, this new clause would
make that illegal. It would mean that they could not say &#147;We now
want to do a pre-combustion project&#148;, because this new clause
says that equal status should now be given to all carbon-capture
technologies. It would end up being counter-productive and we would
need a new Act of Parliament to allow the Government to put in place a
competition for one type of
technology.</div>
					<a name="08022652000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister asked last week if the Liberal Democrats wanted two, three,
four, five different projects to run at the same time. With respect, he
asked the wrong question&#151;that was always Ted Heath&#146;s
response on &#147;Newsnight&#148; when he was asked a question he
did not like. He would say &#147;With respect, Mr. Paxman,
you are asking me the wrong question&#148; and he would answer the
question he would have liked to have been asked. The Minister has asked
the wrong question because rather than going alone on this issue, this
should have been a genuinely international exercise. The UK should be
part of an international consortium trying to develop post-combustion
carbon capture and storage and also be part of an international
consortium trying to develop pre-combustion carbon capture and storage.
We would then find that there would be reduced costs for us as part of
that process and we could genuinely compare the benefits that could be
derived from different
technologies.</div>
					<a name="08022652000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes
back to what the chairman of Shell was saying about going for a
&#147;blueprint approach&#148; to this rather than a
&#147;scramble approach&#148;. It is a matter for concern that the
Minister does not actually know what the other 11 projects in Europe
are going to be about. He would not necessarily need
a detailed understanding 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>of all 11, but even if he knew what two or three of them were, it would
be helpful. We should be looking to co-operate on these issues, rather
than Britain trying to go it alone because we want to secure an
international lead in these
areas.</div>

Wicks:
						</b> The earlier shrug of my shoulders&#151;I do not
know how a shrug is recorded in <i class="I">Hansard</i>&#151;was because I
really wish there were 11 other projects I could detail to the
Committee. We are ahead on this and, at one level, I am proud of that
but, at another level, I am frustrated because we need to bring the
European target of 12 into the real world. It will be our endeavour in
the European Union to encourage that. I am unable, I fear, to detail
even three or four because, as far as I know, the details of three or
four are not actually there. We are, sadly, very far ahead, together
with our colleagues in Norway who, while being close partners, are not
actually members of the European Union. That is the
reality.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000435"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister, but I think this is
an issue, above almost any of the others we have discussed, where
international co-operation would have been sensible. We should have
been looking at the technologies being developed in different parts of
the world and we should have been co-operating on a post-combustion
project in one area and a pre-combustion project somewhere else so that
we could genuinely evaluate
them.</div>
					<a name="08022652000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
asked on two interventions about the situation in China. To go to China
and be able to say &#147;We have mastered pre-combustion technology
so please, in future, with your coal-fired power stations every week,
look at doing it on a pre-combustion basis rather than a
post-combustion basis&#148; would have been a fantastic opportunity.
So on both sides of this technology, there were major
international opportunities for Britain in terms of trade and there
were major opportunities for British science and British genius. We
have narrowed things down in a way that is regrettable. My concern
about the new clause is that, when we want to reconsider the issue and
to have a project whereby pre-combustion could be made to work more
effectively and be mastered, it would rule it
out.</div>
					<a name="08022652000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000436"></a>Paddy
Tipping:
						</b> The new clause has real relevance to my
constituents and those who work in the coal industry at Welbeck and
Thorsby collieries in Nottinghamshire. Those miners are the most
efficient in Europe and have reduced costs. Burning coal is important
economically as is getting the cost right to enter the market. It is
important to burn coal in an environmentally sensitive way, which is
what the new clause
covers.</div>
					<a name="08022652000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that generators in the United Kingdom wish to replace some coal-fired
power stations with new coal-fired power stations. When I last looked
at matters, there were about a dozen propositions for new coal-fired
power stations. To meet our environmental concerns and worries about
carbon, those new coal plants must be more efficient and effective than
they are at present. That is the substance of the new clause and our
debate about carbon capture and storage, and the technologies that we
need to introduce.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>
					<a name="08022652000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matter is important
nationally as well as internationally. As the Committee has recognised,
in terms of the environment, it does not matter where a tonne of carbon
is produced because it is still the same pollutant wherever it is. If
we can therefore influence new design and new build in China and India,
that will be important and significant.</div>
					<a name="08022652000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Northavon
made a number of points, such as that clean coal demonstration plant
post-combustion will clearly not be sufficient. The EU aspires to a
dozen such plants and it makes sense, as the hon. Member for Wealden
has just said, to have a real and meaningful discussion within the EU.
I accept that the Government are in the lead, but there needs to be a
realistic, rational discussion about using the 12 projects throughout
the EU to develop other forms of clean coal
technology&#151;pre-combustion or
post-combustion.</div>
					<a name="08022652000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">A lot
of discussion has taken place about China. The Minister will know more
about such matters than I do, but I remind the Committee that a new
coal power station is being built in China at the moment with financial
support from the EU. We are involved in the partnership to which the
hon. Member for Wealden referred, and we need to do more of that
because, if it is right that carbon capture and storage is a real new
technology for the future, we must demonstrate it and bring forward the
right sort of technology.</div>
					<a name="08022652000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sceptical about carbon
capture and storage; it has not been done yet. We can do it in the
laboratory and we can do small-scale plants, but building a plant and
making the science work is a big leap. I am not confident that we can
do that in the time frame that is talked about, so it is important that
we investigate as many technologies as
possible.</div>
					<a name="08022652000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Generators
know that they must replace plant and generators know of the
opportunities overseas. It is recognised that they are big
international companies, such as RWE, E.ON and EDF Energy. None of them
is British-based; they are European companies that operate
internationally. They are not scot-free in respect of such issues. They
recognise that coal has a place in the future, so they must invest,
too. There is a rose-glassed view from the generators that the
Government will take the total cost of clean coal technology, and
carbon capture and storage. If the generators have an eye to the
future, they should use their own profits, balance sheets and ability
to borrow to go forward and be active partners. I should like to see
the plea accepted that there be more than one demonstration plant in
the UK. However, let us be realistic&#151;that will not
happen.</div>
					<a name="08022652000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Companies such
as Centrica, which last week announced enormous profits, must know that
to invest in the future and to survive, they, too, have to invest in
the new technologies, such as carbon capture and storage and clean coal
technologies. It is not just a matter for the Government, but a
challenge for us all. We need to set up partnership arrangements in the
UK and internationally to ensure that that
happens.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000437"></a>Dr.
Iddon:
						</b> I will try to be brief. I do not envy the Minister
or his advisers in setting up competition in this area because of the
difficulties involved. First, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>there is pre-combustion or post-combustion capture of carbon dioxide.
Secondly, there are gas and coal-fired power stations and possibly also
oil, although that is unlikely. Thirdly, there is the difficulty of
transporting the carbon dioxide after its
capture.</div>
					<a name="08022652000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
transporting carbon dioxide to the Scottish coast from the east or west
midlands where some of the generators are will be far more costly than
what BP was proposing, which was to build a gas-fired plant at
Peterhead pretty much adjacent to the oil wells down which the carbon
dioxide would be pumped. I have mentioned that one difficulty with the
MARKAL analysis for post-combustion capture of carbon dioxide was that
it did not appear to take into account the downtime of the plant while
the retrofitting took place. I doubt that it has, but I wonder whether
the MARKAL analysis has taken into consideration the length of
transportation for the carbon dioxide from the point of capture to the
oil wells off the Scottish coast. That will complicate the cost
analysis extremely.</div>
					<a name="08022652000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wonder whether the transport of carbon dioxide is possible at the
moment without putting new infrastructure in place. When we did the
analysis, the assumption was that some of the gas lines that transport
gas from the sea would become available because of the running down of
gas provision from the North sea field and that those could be
converted to transport carbon dioxide up the country to the very wells
from which gas had been coming down the country to the
consumers&#151;whether they were generators or domestic
consumers.</div>
					<a name="08022652000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
terribly complex business and I do not envy the civil servants or their
advisers in reaching a conclusion. In conclusion, I ask the Minister
how many of those difficulties have been taken into account while he
has been led to the judgment between post-combustion and pre-combustion
carbon
capture.</div>
					<a name="08022652000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000438"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Again, this has been a very useful debate. I
listened with great interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton,
South-East and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood
for giving us a timely reality check on where we are in terms of this
technology. I mentioned on another occasion that although there is some
excitement about the bidding process and whether we should build two,
three or four and whether they should be pre-combustion or
post-combustion, those discussions are often not very financially
literate. My hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood has given us the
reality check that the whole chemistry set, as I think of it, has not
yet been tried. Our demonstration project will be one of the
first.</div>
					<a name="08022652000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will try to
deal with many of the points that have been raised but, first, I remind
the Committee that the Bill provides an enabling framework that will
allow the safe storage of carbon dioxide offshore, paving the way for
the wider deployment of carbon capture technologies. As such, it does
not make provision for Government competitions or for CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>storage demonstrations and it does not regulate the types of
technologies that may be deployed via such competitions or the activity
of carbon capture at all, as opposed to the activity of storage. In
other words, the provisions in the Bill are technology-neutral for
offshore carbon dioxide storage and for carbon dioxide 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div>capture. I hope that that gives comfort to those who are in favour of
one technology rather than another.</div>
					<a name="08022652000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I sometimes think that in a
parallel world there might be a Government who have chosen
pre-combustion storage, and I can now see the hon. Member for Northavon
in that parallel world arguing passionately about the importance of
post-combustion and how outrageous it is that the Government have
ignored the realities in China&#151;I jest, but only in
part.</div>
					<a name="08022652000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
already support a range of carbon capture technologies through a
variety of means, including a &#163;35 million fund to encourage
industry-led demonstrations of elements that contribute towards carbon
abatement technologies, including CCS; almost &#163;9 million for
various research projects supported by the Research Councils and the
Technology Strategy Board; and pushing for the EU ETS to take account
of CCS. The newly formed Energy Technologies Institute considers CCS as
one of its possible future technology themes. With a potential
&#163;1 billion budget over 10 years, it is bringing together
Government and some of the world&#146;s biggest companies, with a
view to accelerating the development of low-carbon energy technologies
towards commercial
deployment.</div>
					<a name="08022652000311"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08022652000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">All those
initiatives give equal status to all carbon capture technologies,
exactly as the hon. Member for Northavon and perhaps other hon. Members
have specified. I hope that he and the hon. Member for Cheltenham
accept that the Government see CCS as a priority and are showing global
leadership in facilitating its demonstration and
deployment.</div>
					<a name="08022652000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
area in which the Government have made a deliberate choice regarding a
capture technology relates to our competition for a demonstration
project, and there are powerful reasons for having done so. The
potential contribution that CCS technologies can make to tackling
global climate change is significant. The Stern review estimates that
CCS would contribute up to 28 per cent. of the global CO<span class="Sub">2</span>
reductions that are needed by 2050 if the aim of restricting
temperature increases to 2 C is to be achieved. We must remain
focused on CCS as a global solution to climate change. For CCS to be
deployed on such a scale, the technology first needs to be demonstrated
on a commercial scale. That is why the Government are supporting one of
the world&#146;s first projects demonstrating the full chain of CCS
technology in relation to a commercial-scale power
station.</div>
					<a name="08022652000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">We considered
carefully whether it was possible to run a competition that was open to
all technologies, but we concluded that to run a fair and transparent
competition, it was necessary to decide on the capture technology at
the outset. It would be difficult to develop evaluation criteria that
could fairly assess the different technologies against each
other&#151;each has different benefits. Our decision to focus on
post-combustion capture technology in relation to a coal-fired power
station will allow us to achieve the key objective of our demonstration
project, which is to demonstrate a technology that is relevant and
transferable to global markets. We need to ensure that actions taken in
the UK can also help other countries to take steps towards tackling
their emissions.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>
					<a name="08022652000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The arguments for examining CCS
in relation to a coal plant are clear. Coal will remain a significant
part of the world&#146;s energy mix over the next decades. The
recently published &#147;World Energy Outlook 2007&#148; projects
that demand for coal will increase by more than 70 per cent. over the
period from 2005 to 2030. China and India alone already account for
more than 45 per cent. of world coal use and are projected to drive
more than 80 per cent. of that increase in demand. In 2006, China built
one coal-fired 1 GW power station every four days, which is equivalent
to two new Drax 4 GW power stations every
month.</div>
					<a name="08022652000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new build
coal-fired power stations in China alone could emit about 260
megatonnes of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> each year, although that will depend on
the type of power station being built and the rate of build. That is
staggering when compared with total UK CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions in
2006, which were about 150 megatonnes. The ability for post-combustion
technology to be retrofitted to existing power stations enables us to
tackle such carbon dioxide emissions that would otherwise be locked in
right now through existing and planned new build power
stations.</div>
					<a name="08022652000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to recognise that pre-combustion technologies are used in
conjunction with integrated gasification combined cycle power
stations&#151;IGCC power stations. These are not yet widely deployed,
nor are they expected to be deployed for many years to come. For
example, the &#147;World Energy Outlook 2006&#148; report says that
between 2015 and 2030, IGCC will account for less than 20 per cent. of
new capacity to be added globally. That is why early demonstration of
post-combustion capture, which can be readily retrofitted, is so
important for tackling global carbon dioxide emissions. Although I do
not pretend to be an expert, I understand that it is far more difficult
to retrofit pre-combustion.</div>
					<a name="08022652000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am confident that we have
made the right decision in focusing the competition on post-combustion,
and stand wholeheartedly behind our decision. The focus on
post-combustion, however, is purely in the context of the competition.
We recognise that all CCS technologies have a potentially significant
role to play in helping to tackle climate change. That includes the use
of pre-combustion capture technologies, which, as the hon. Member for
Northavon said, could have an important role to play in producing
hydrogen for emission-free
transport.</div>
					<a name="08022652000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition
to the measures I outlined at the start, we are exploring a range of
options aimed at promoting widespread deployment of all CCS
technologies and hope, as I have said on a number of occasions, that UK
companies will show the same enthusiasm and leadership in this area as
has been shown by the Government to date. I noted the comments of my
hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood on that issue of corporate and
environmental
responsibility.</div>
					<a name="08022652000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have been criticised for supporting only one
commercial-scale demonstration project. Yet sponsoring one project
alone represents a significant investment of potentially several
hundreds of millions of pounds of public support, and a scale of
commitment that only two other countries in the world have made. To say
that the Government should be supporting two or three demonstrations is
simply not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div>realistic. We are doing more than just about any country in the world in
this area, and we should be proud of that, not
critical.</div>
					<a name="08022652000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
UK truly is a global leader in this technology, but one country cannot
tackle the challenges involved in making CCS commercially deployable.
That is why, as I mentioned in the last sitting, we are working closely
with other countries such as the US and Norway&#151;I was asked by
the hon. Member for Wealden about this&#151;and through multilateral
institutions to encourage others to make similar commitments. Indeed, I
was discussing this with my Norwegian opposite number only a couple of
weeks ago. It is only by doing so that we can help bring about
widespread deployment within the time scales required to tackle global
climate change.</div>
					<a name="08022652000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000439"></a>Dr.
Iddon:
						</b> I am now clear that this is coal only, and that it
will be on an existing power station, but I am still not clear about
what the competition will be based on. Will it be a cost analysis of
the different projects, and will it include or exclude the
transportation of the carbon
dioxide?</div>
					<a name="08022652000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08022652000440"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> It will include the whole project: the stripping
out, in layman&#146;s terms, of the CO<span class="Sub">2</span>
						<span class="Sub">, </span>the
transportation and the storage. It will have to include everything and,
indeed, frustrating though it is, we anticipate that it might take a
year or so for us to do the technical assessments required on the
different projects coming forward to us. We will be doing a full
appraisal.</div>
					<a name="08022652000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Faced with
those who say that the Government have made slow progress in our
approach to CCS, I would say that the case is quite the contrary: The
decision to launch a demonstration project was taken in May 2007. The
competition to select a project was launched in November 2007, as we
promised. We expect our demonstration to be operational by 2014. Only
two other countries&#151;Norway and the US&#151;are currently
committed to funding similar scale projects, both of which are likely
to be operational within the same time frame. Rather than dragging our
feet, we are actually sprinting ahead and leading the
way.</div>
					<a name="08022652000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our competition
for a post-combustion commercial scale demonstration project is already
under way in line with our commitment, and would not be affected by the
new clause. The new clause would have the perhaps unintended
consequence of precluding any future competition that could be focused
on pre-combustion technology, if it was determined to be necessary,
given that the Government would have already supported the
demonstration of post-combustion. Given what Opposition Members have
said about pre-combustion, that would surely not be the intention of
the hon. Member for Northavon.</div>

Webb:
						</b> The one specific thing that I do not understand
about the competition, which is important in the context that we are
discussing, is if one company wins and it learns everything that there
is to know or a great deal that is of commercial value to it, is there
any onus on it to share that with everybody else, or is it private
knowledge? How does that process work? A competition with one winner
does not, potentially, disseminate the technology. How do we ensure
that the winner plays fair with everybody
else?</div>

Wicks:
						</b> That is a good point, and I do not have a crisp
answer, except to say that we clearly need to balance concerns about
intellectual property rights against the more important concern of
knowledge transfer. Given all that I have said about China, knowledge
transfer is the crucial thing here.</div>
					<a name="08022652000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not be able to address
the comments of one or two colleagues now, but I may find another
opportunity of doing so. I understand hon. Members&#146; frustrations
about where we are, but let us remember that, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Sherwood said, this is brand new technology; not tried, not
tested. We are ahead of the game. The Bill provides a regulatory
framework that will enable the different technologies to come to
fruition, but I make no apology for the fact that, in the demonstration
project, for a number of different reasons, we felt that we should
choose one technology. That was fair to some of the different companies
that were coming forward, because developing proposals for competition
is itself quite expensive. With that, and looking at the clock, I urge
the Committee to support the clause.</div>

						</b> A lot of what the Minister had to say was explaining
the case for the winner of the competition being post-combustion
technology. My point was not that there was not a strong case for that,
but that it is wrong to pre-empt it, so I am not sure that he addressed
my point.</div>
					<a name="08022652000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I asked the
Minister to comment on the third technology, oxyfuel technology, which
he did not mention at all. I asked him to comment on the go-slow on
existing pre-combustion technologies, which he did not mention at all.
He said that it was difficult to assess the relative merits of
different technologies on a transparent basis, so the Government have
done it on a non-transparent basis, by simply picking one behind closed
doors. It seems that that must be inferior to inviting competing
technologies, but I take the general observation that the new clause,
without a sunset clause, might have undesirable effects. When the
relevant time comes, I will not press the new clause.</div>
