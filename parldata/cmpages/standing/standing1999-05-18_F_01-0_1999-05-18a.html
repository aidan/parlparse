<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Margaret Hodge): </b>
I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Disability Rights Commission Bill 
[Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock 
and half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at 
half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On behalf of the Committee, I welcome you,
Mrs. Dunwoody, to the Chair. I know that you will guide us 
ably through the Bill. I am delighted that, in taking my first 
Bill through its Committee stage, I shall be guided by your 
extensive wisdom, your experience, your sound common 
sense, your straightforwardness and your dry and wry sense 
of humour and, as we know from last night, your 
independent support.
<P>
I welcome all members of the Committee; they bring 
with them a wide variety of experience and knowledge
of disability issues. In particular, I welcome the hon. 
Members for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) and for Winchester 
(Mr. Oaten), who lead for the Opposition parties. I am 
pleased, to welcome my right hon. and hon. Friends; they 
have a long-standing commitment to disability rights and 
have campaigned tirelessly for a disability rights 
commission.
<P>
I welcome my right hon. Friend the Member for 
Coatbridge and Chryston (Mr. Clarke) and my hon. 
Friends the Members for North-East Derbyshire
(Mr. Barnes), for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) and for Aberdeen, 
South (Miss Begg), all of whom are well known for their 
commitment to disability issues. I also welcome my 
hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport 
(Mr. Jamieson); I know that he will guide me carefully 
through our debates on the Bill.
<P>
As I said on Second Reading, this is a historic moment. 
The Bill is central to the Government's commitment of 
achieving comprehensive and enforceable civil rights for 
all disabled people. It is intended to establish a commission, 
which will have a duty to work towards the elimination of 
discrimination against disabled people, and to promote the 
equalisation of opportunity, to encourage good practice and 
to work with others in the interests of disabled people.
<P>
The Bill is part of the Government's coherent and 
comprehensive agenda. For example, it will implement the 
remaining parts of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, 
and reduce the threshold for small employers to bring 
another 75,000 people within the scope of the Bill. I chair a 
disability rights task force which is considering the whole 
range of issues that impact on the lives of disabled people, 
with a view to seeing what other measures can be taken to 
implement civil rights for disabled people. The new deal for 
disabled people, which is extremely innovative, will 
provide important civil rights to ensure that disabled people 
have the opportunity to work, and action is being taken by 
all Departments to ensure equal opportunity for disabled 
people.
<P>
The Bill addresses what was recognised by many to be 
the most fundamental flaw in the 1995 Act the lack of an 
enforcement body to help disabled people secure their 
rights and to provide a central source of advice to 
employers and service providers. I am sure that many 
members of the Committee, particularly my hon. Friends, 
will be proud to be part of the process of enacting the 
commission.
<P>
The Bill will create a strong, independent and effective 
voice to achieve civil rights for disabled people. I have 
no doubt that hon. Members will want to discuss its 
provisions in considerable detail. There will be a great 
deal of agreement about its objectives; on Second 
Reading, hon. Members on both sides of the house 
warmly welcomed its fundamental principles. However, I 
recognise that hon. Members will table amendments to 
explore it in detail. I hope that our discussions will be 
good-humoured and constructive, and I look forward to 
them
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): It is a pleasure to 
welcome you the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. This is the first 
time that I have had the opportunity to serve in a 
Committee that you are chairing, and I concur with the 
Minister's statements in her opening remarks. I am sure 
that, with your independence of spirit, you will lead our 
proceedings wisely and fairly.
<P>
The Bill is important, and it is right to ensure that we 
consider it constructively and carefully and provide the 
right opportunities to debate its provisions in detail.
I recognise the background to which the Minister alluded. 
Considerable anxiety was expressed when the Disability 
Discrimination Act 1995 was passed that it did not include 
an enforcement mechanism. The Bill provides for such an 
enforcement mechanism. Given its background, it is 
especially important that we seriously examine 
amendments tabled to the Bill. It is our duty to try to get it 
right first time round. We have considerable experience 
with the Equal Opportunities Commission and the 
Commission for Racial Equality, on which we can draw in 
considering the Disability Rights Commission. In doing so, 
it is important to table amendments that will ensure that
the commission will work better, properly and well in the 
interests of disabled people.
<P>
The Minister started to describe a list of the 
Government's proposals in relation to disabled people. 
She is perhaps fortunate that proceedings in the Chamber 
last night and in the early hours of this morning did not 
continue to their conclusion. We wait to see when they 
will be concluded. She will be aware that, notwithstanding 
the issues that she described, the Government's approach 
to disability benefits raises genuine anxiety.
<P>
We have the opportunity to consider in detail the 
Disability Rights Commission to ensure that it will not 
only provide the essential support that disabled people 
need in enforcing their rights under the Disability 
Discrimination Act 1995, but encourage good practice and 
establish the right attitudes among employers and 
providers of goods and services. We do not want disabled 
people constantly to have to resort to litigation, albeit 
litigation that the commission supports. We want the 
commission to be active in ensuring that attitudes and 
practices change, before litigation is necessary.
<P>
I hope that that expectation and desire is shared 
throughout the Committee. It will lie behind our approach 
in considering the details of the Bill and amendments to 
it. As we have said, we support the establishment of the 
commission, but we shall constructively examine the Bill 
because it behoves us all to ensure that we get it right, 
and this is our chance to do so.
<P>
Disabled people have campaigned for some time for 
such a commission. We have the opportunity to ensure 
that we provide a commission that is right for them and 
that will support and help them as intended, not by 
constantly forcing them into litigation but by changing 
attitudes and practice in the interests not only of disabled 
people but of us all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Oaten </B>(Winchester): I also welcome you to 
the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. I look forward to lively and 
constructive debates in the sittings ahead, and I am sure 
that you will steer us in the right direction during them.
<P>
On behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I warmly welcome 
the Bill. Such legislation is long overdue, and many 
disabled groups will be proud to see that it is reaching its 
final stages. They have argued for a long time, as have 
many members of the Committee, for legislation to give 
disabled rights parity with other rights.
<P>
I praise the Government on grappling with the issue so 
well and so speedily within two years of coming into 
power. However, one has to point out the contradiction of 
a Government who have been excellent on disability 
rights, but less so on disability benefits, which may have 
been touched on late last night and will be again. The 
contradiction is disappointing, as the progress that the Bill 
will make on rights may be overcast by debates during 
the next week.
<P>
The Second Reading debate was positive, and I am sure 
that the Committee will continue in that tone. The Liberal 
Democrats' role will be merely to probe the Government 
on some additional matters, on which I hope that there 
will be some movement. I understand that the 
Government intend to consider accepting some 
Opposition amendments, and I am sure that they have 
considered the good points made in a lengthy debate in 
another place. Our intention is to be constructive. I think 
that we all want to work to create a commission that sets 
off in the right way so that, when it is reviewed in a 
couple of years' time as I hope it will be we simply 
need to tweak it and do not discover that it has not 
delivered on the high expectations of it that disabled 
groups and all parties have.
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth </B>(Belfast, South): I join hon. 
Members in welcoming you to the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. 
I am glad to serve on the Committee. Minority parties are 
sometimes asked to fill specific positions.
<P>
I regret that the legislation will not apply immediately 
to Northern Ireland. As I was involved for many years in 
the campaign for such a commission, I know that I speak 
on behalf of many disabled people in Northern Ireland 
when I say that I regret that they have to mark time again. 
I assure the Committee that I will do my best to be 
positive as we examine the legislation. I hope that before 
long even the Government have a change of mind, 
unless there is speculation that they want a single 
commission to cover everything they want to use 
Northern Ireland as an experimental ground. The sooner 
that we have a similar commission for Northern Ireland 
the better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Clarke </B>(Coatbridge and Chryston): I join the 
hon. Members from all parties who have extended a 
welcome to you as our Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. I ask for 
your forbearance and that of the Committee because this 
is my maiden speech, in the sense that I have not served 
on any Committee since the general election. I was 
appointed as a Minister with portfolios that did not focus 
on legislation, and I hope that that will be borne in mind 
when I make occasional contributions.
<P>
Things have changed since I was in Committee in 
opposition. I always brought in my own bottle of water 
and glass to ensure that I would not dry up, but under new 
Labour we all have our own bottle of water. That is great 
democratic socialism for us all.
<P>
You may recall a young, up-and-coming Minister,
Mrs. Dunwoody, who led for the Government on several 
Bills, including the one on direct payments; in the last 
sitting of that Bill, he rebuked me for paying you too 
many compliments how could I? I have to declare at the 
outset that I do not intend to change my behaviour in 
that regard.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I say proudly and seriously that this is one of the most 
important Committees that I have ever served on. When 
I said, as the shadow spokesperson on disability, that 
a Labour Government would deliver a Bill to introduce a 
Disability Rights Commission, many people, even at the 
Labour annual conference, did not take us seriously and 
said that we would not do it. To introduce a Bill in the 
first Parliament, in the second Queen's Speech, is 
remarkable and I am proud of how far we have got. As 
hon. Members have said, it would not have been achieved 
without the strong advocacy of organisations of and for 
disabled people. They welcome the legislation in many 
ways, but they are also watching us; I am sure that at the 
end of our deliberations we will deliver to the Chamber 
a Bill of which they will feel proud. If it has 
imperfections I have not yet seen a Bill that did not 
we will try to tackle them in Committee.
<P>
We tried in earlier Committees to include help, 
information and advice; there is a demand for us to do 
that in this Bill and the summary of the Bill's intentions 
in the explanatory notes includes the statement that it will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"assist disabled people by offering information, advice and support 
in taking cases forward"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that we can begin that process by making 
information available to people reporting or observing our 
Committee, if I am allowed to refer to them. People will 
attend our proceedings from the Royal National Institute 
for the Deaf and the Royal National Institute for the Blind 
and it would set a pattern of good practice if we made 
sure that the information available to members of the 
Committee was also made available to observers in a form 
that they were able to follow.
<P>
As someone who does not enjoy Committees, I look 
forward to our deliberations. When we send back our final 
conclusions to the House, I believe that we will be proud 
of what we have achieved and I am profoundly grateful 
to be included in that process.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): I, too, welcome you to 
the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. It is the first and only 
occasion on which I can say that the Committee is chaired 
by the hon. Member who represents the town in which
I was born so that brings me particular pleasure.
<P>
In my first 18 months in Parliament, I sat on one 
Committee; this is my third in the past five months. Four 
members of this Committee served on the Welfare 
Reform Bill and this Committee feels to some extent like 
a continuation of that. I should like to add two points to 
the consensus that its already emerging and which makes 
the Bill remarkable. The first is about the way in which it 
was born. After the Government were elected in May 
1997, we took the matter to disabled groups and disabled 
people and invited them to sit down with us and talk about 
what sort of commission they wanted. Last summer, the 
disability rights task force produced its report which was 
accepted by the Government and incorporated into the 
White Paper, "Promoting Disabled People's Rights"	, 
which then, in the next stage of gestation emerged as the 
Bill largely unchanged from that which the disability 
rights task force had advocated. The Bill is remarkable 
in terms of the consultation and consensus involved in 
its production.



<P>
Although we are familiar with the concept of 
commissions on people's rights, I hope that we shall not 
tie down the commission too much perhaps by accepting 
some of the amendments that have been tabled but allow 
it to make its own decisions about how it operates, to 
search for best practice and evaluate it, and to inform us 
about the lessons that it learns.
<P>
The Bill is a milestone. I hope that we shall look back 
on it in years to come as Americans do the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. There is most certainly a real job of 
work to be done. Disabled people suffer discrimination in 
the workplace and in access to goods, services, 
information and premises. All those of us who have 
worked with disabled people for many years know that 
we have a responsibility to address those matters in the 
forthcoming debates.
<P>
I regard the Bill as part of the big picture. The new deal 
for disabled people, access-to-work initiatives, helping 
disabled people back into work and helping them retain 
their jobs are the second leg of the stool. The changes to 
the benefits system are, as a package, complementary; 
they are the third leg and will produce a fairer system 
that addresses the needs of all disabled people. The stool 
requires all three legs. I look forward to contributing to 
the establishment of a major milestone during the next 
few days.
<P>
<B>Miss Anne Begg </B>(Aberdeen, South): I, too, welcome 
you to the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am sure that our 
proceedings on the Bill will be interesting. This is the first 
time that I have served on a Committee considering a 
large Bill. I am tempted to use hyperbole this is an 
historic occasion for someone such as myself. I share the 
views of my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge 
and Chryston, who has said that he is proud to serve on 
this Committee.
<P>
However, I feel a bit of a fraud. Although I have used 
rhetoric at conferences and meetings and announced 
proudly that the Labour Government will legislate for 
comprehensive, enforceable civil rights for disabled 
people, my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge 
and Chryston and my hon. Friend the Member for 
North-East Derbyshire and others have been fighting the 
good fight in the House, and driving forward the cause of 
civil rights for disabled people. We would not be here 
today but for the work that they have done in laying down 
the ground rules and changing attitudes in the House. 
Their work has allowed the Government to introduce the 
Bill.
<P>
I am proud to be here today. I have argued long and 
hard for such a Bill. Politicians are often accused of being 
interested only in themselves. I am proud to say that I am 
here because of self-interest. I may be different from other 
members of the Committee because the Bill will affect 
my life. I do not think that that is the wrong reason to be 
here because, in affecting my life, the Bill will affect the 
lives of at least 6 million other people.



<P>
I am wary of saying that I speak for disabled people. 
Disabled people are not a homogeneous mass. We are 
different; we are individuals. I speak as someone who 
happens to have a disability. I agree with other people 
with disabilities on some occasions, but disagree with 
them on others. On this occasion, I can go as far as to say 
that everyone in the United Kingdom with a disability will 
welcome the Bill because it underpins the human rights 
that all of us should be able to take for granted, but which 
we sometimes have to legislate for. I hope that the debate 
will be an interesting one I am sure that there will be 
some heated arguments. The underlying principle 
contained in the Bill is a noble and honourable one, and 
I am proud to be here today.
<P>
<B>Ms Helen Southworth </B>(Warrington, South): I add my 
welcome to you as Chairperson of the Committee,
Mrs. Dunwoody. I had the privilege of serving with you 
on the Finance Bill last year; it was an enjoyable and 
interesting experience, and I learned a great deal about 
procedure under your chairmanship some of it painfully, 
I have to add.
<P>
I welcome the Bill. I have heard with great pleasure 
what other hon. Members have said about it, but the most 
important thing is that it is here. It is about empowerment, 
and it is part of a plank of other Government legislation. 
It will enable disabled people to take action themselves to 
enforce their own rights, thereby making all citizens of 
the United Kingdom equal. That is an incredibly 
important issue.
<P>
I believe that the Government have done something 
radical and important in introducing this legislation so 
early. They are ensuring that other legislation will be 
scrutinised by people who will have the right to take 
action because of this Bill. I welcome the timetable and 
the fact that the Bill will be enacted quickly. It 
demonstrates the Government's confidence: they will not 
always get things right, but they are always prepared to 
work towards getting them right.
<P>
The measure is something that many of us have been 
working towards for years. We recognise that we must try 
to ensure equality for all people. That cannot be achieved 
overnight. We are showing, as a Government, that we are 
part of the process. We also have to be transparent, open 
to scrutiny and prepared to take the consequences when 
we do not achieve everything that we properly want to 
achieve. We must begin to put things right.
<P>
This is an important Bill and an important part of what 
we want to do as a Government. It will ensure that each 
citizen gets an equal opportunity we did not hear about 
that during 18 years of Tory government. I hope that we 
shall be hearing about it fairly consistently from this 
Government a Government who are prepared to put 
their legislation where their mouth is. We are very 
different from the previous Government.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Disability Rights Commission 
Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten 
o'clock and half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock 
and at half-past Two o'clock. [Ms Hodge.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following Order, namely, 
Clause 1; Schedule 1, Clause 2; Clauses 6 to 11; Clause 3; 
Schedule3; Schedule 2; Clauses 4 and 5; Schedule 3; Clauses 12 
to 15; Schedules 4 and 5; new Clauses and new Schedules. 
[Ms Hodge.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As a point of information, I should 
draw the attention of members of the Committee even 
those who have been up all night to the fact that we 
seem to have acquired two schedule 3s in the order of 
consideration. There is only one schedule 3.
<P>
A financial resolution relating to the Bill is available in 
the Committee Room.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Disability Rights Commission</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of 
the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> The clause establishes the Disability Rights 
Commission and abolishes the National Disability 
Council the only Government agency that has 
campaigned vigorously for its own abolition, which we 
welcome. The Disability Rights Commission is to be 
funded by the Secretary of State from moneys provided 
by Parliament and, as the explanatory notes state, the 
provisional budget was calculated on the best information 
available to us.
<P>
We have made it clear that the budget is not set in 
stone; that was a matter for debate on Second Reading, 
and I assure members of the Committee that we shall be 
reviewing the provisional funding of the commission in 
the light of its operation. Detailed provisions relating to 
the establishment of the commission are set out in 
Schedule 1. As was shown by our opening remarks, there 
is widespread support for its creation.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): May 
I say how pleased I am yet again to be serving on a 
Committee under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
Clause 1 requires clarification. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State shall pay to the Commission such sums 
as he thinks fit to enable it to meet its expenses."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our main concern with the provision hence the tabling 
of amendment No. 13 is that unless there is some 
guarantee to uplift funding at least in line with the rate of 
inflation, the commission will find it difficult to forward 
plan its budget for next year. As the commission's 
operations grow, we hope that it will obtain extra 
resources through its activities. Given the Secretary of 
State's statutory obligations under clause 1 to provide 
funding, the commission should know that in the next 
financial year it can at least provide the level of service 
that it provided in the previous year.
<P>
If all goes well, as we hope it will, the commission will 
grow of its own volition through the charges that it can 
recoup and initiate. It is important that those running the 
commission know that its services will grow in 
subsequent years and that its level of support to people 
with disability will not shrink. The Secretary of State 
should have a commitment under clause 1 to underpin 
the commission, which would be particularly helpful in 
the first two or three years of its operation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> I, too, wish to focus on funding under 
clause 1, which requires the Secretary of State to make 
payments to the commission. I am glad that the 
Under-Secretary acknowledged the concern that is felt 
about the level of funding; it was debated in another place 
and on Second Reading in this House. When the 
Government considered how much funding they should 
make available to the commission, concerns were 
expressed about the figure of £11 million, given that the 
Commission for Racial Equality has £15 million. Nothing 
was said until much later, when the Government suddenly 
found a reason for the £4 million difference; they said that 
it was moneys that the Commission for Racial Equality 
makes available to local authorities. I welcome the fact 
that the Minister has taken on board our concern about 
funding, but there is a real need for the Government to 
consider closely the extra cost to the commission of 
making information accessible to all disabled people, and 
ensuring that facilities are available to them.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton 
(Mrs. Browning) spoke about the need to ensure that the 
commission has at least the same amount of money as it 
had the year before, to allow it to continue its work. My 
worry is that, in later clauses, the Bill makes provisions 
for the commission to reclaim expenses from individuals 
whom they have helped to take legal action. We have 
already debated whether the commission should have that 
sort of charge over compensation payments. I do not want 
the commission to be encouraged to undertake litigation 
to recoup expenses because of the financial difficulties 
imposed on it by the Government and because its funding 
does not grow year by year in the natural course of events. 
I hope that the Minister will address that point in her 
reply.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I am aware of the concerns raised by 
Opposition Members. However, I am sure that they realise 
that it would be wrong to tie the hands of future 
Governments. The amendment is therefore inappropriate. 
Nevertheless, I assure the Committee that we shall honour 
our commitment to review the budget and finances of the 
Disability Rights Commission in the light of its 
operational experience.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maidenhead asked about the 
relative budgets for the Commission for Racial Equality 
and the Disability Rights Commission. I reiterate that, if 
one takes out of the CRE bill the moneys made available 
to support local community race relations councils, the two 
budgets are similar. The CRE was set up nearly 25 years 
ago, when a much greater immigrant population required 
local support.
<P>
The Disability Rights Commission will be better funded 
than the Equal Opportunities Commission. I know that
I shall hear noises and representations from the EOC I 
also have ministerial responsibility for that commission 
but I would ask hon. Members to remember that every 
commission has its particular and specific costs. Although 
catering effectively for people with disabilities will have 
specific costs for the Disability Rights Commission, one 
could argue that additional costs arise for the Commission 
for Racial Equality out of its need to translate material 
into minority ethnic languages. The Equal Opportunities 
Commission represents the interests of more than half the 
population, and it, too, could make a strong case for 
more funding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Collins </B>(Westmorland and Lonsdale): Will 
the Minister reassure the Committee that the Treasury has 
given her Department a new public expenditure survey 
line for the Disability Rights Commission, and that the 
commission's funding wil not be found from the resources 
that were previously allocated to the Department?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that we have 
specific funding.
<P>
Finally, I shall deal with the point raised by the hon. 
Member for Maidenhead. The commission will not be 
recouping money from compensation payments awarded 
to individuals whom it has helped in a litigation case. The 
commission will be able to recoup the expenses and costs 
awarded by the tribunal against the person, company or 
organisation against whom the action was taken. I hope 
that I have provided some comfort. We are determined 
to ensure that the commission is properly and effectively 
funded; and we shall review its funding to ensure that that 
remains the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): 
Mrs. Dunwoody, I also welcome you to the Chair.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This may be an appropriate 
moment to say that I am flattered that members of the 
Committee are pleased to see me. I am delighted to see 
them almost as delighted, no doubt, as their Whips. May 
we now proceed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody; I did not 
want to miss out on the love-in of the past half hour.
<P>
I respond to the Minister by saying that we do not wish 
to tie the hands of future Governments on funding. I am 
pleased by her assurance that specific funding is being 
made available that will not compete with other disability 
needs, because we need the legislation to work.
<P>
I have two specific questions for the Minister. I will 
serve on the Joint Committee which will consider the 
Financial Services and Markets Bill, which is currently in 
draft stage, on which the issue of income from fines has 
been raised; while the status of the Financial Services 
Authority as a private limited company is different from 
the status of the agency that we are talking about, can the 
Minister assure me that the Government have no intention 
of giving powers to the commission to recoup any fines 
that may be levied for illegal actions taken by companies? 
Such fines should not be looked to as a form of surrogate 
funding for the commission.
<P>
Secondly, I seek an assurance that charges that the DRC 
may make for services or advice offered to local 
authorities or outside bodies will also not be seen as a 
surrogate form of funding. Will the Minister confirm that, 
if the budget of the commission is stretched, the 
Government will not expect it to increase such charges 
disproportionately in order to fund its essential activities?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> The hon. Member for East Worthing and 
Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) is drawing an inappropriate 
analogy between the two bodies. Individuals will take 
cases, supported by the commission, and the individuals 
will receive compensation; I assure the Committee that 
the commission will not recoup that compensation. If a 
tribunal or a court determines that the costs incurred by 
the commission should be charged to the other side, the 
commission will, totally appropriately, recoup those costs.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> That is the Minister's second reference to 
that. Will the commission have the right to take first 
charge on costs or expenses that are awarded against the 
other party to the individual who has taken the case?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Yes, that is correct. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope that to be kind to those taking 
the record we will not have too many sedentary 
conversations.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> We certainly do not intend to do so.
<P>
It will of course be open to the commission to make 
charges, for example for conferences, and to use them as 
a source of income. As several Labour Members have 
said, we do not wish to tie too firmly the hands of the 
commission to raise income through such means as 
charges for conferences. Those are the sort of charges that 
we envisage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Is the Minister saying that the budgets 
that her Department will set for the commission each year 
will bear no relationship to the charges for services that 
the commission may raise and that the Government will 
not try to reduce or peg funding if the commission is 
successful in raising income from related services?



<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Cutting the income of organisations 
because it was presumed that they could raise charges was 
a trick in which the Conservatives frequently engaged 
when in government. We are not currently engaged in 
that. We shall provide funding that in our view ensures 
that the commission can operate effectively and strongly 
as an independent body.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) All Commissioners or employees in a managerial capacity

including developmental disorders such as cerebral palsy, Down's 
syndrome and autistic spectrum disorders.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mrs. May:</B> I shall speak to amendments Nos. 10 to 12, 
and my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton 
will speak to amendments No. 18.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 are probing amendments. 
Schedule 1 specifies the commission's constitution. The 
amendments refer to the definitions in paragraphs 2 and 
6 of the sort of person who may be appointed a 
commissioner or an office-holder such as a chairman or 
deputy chairman. The phrase used in the definitions is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"disabled persons or persons who have had a disability."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In relation to the appointment of commissioners, the 
schedule refers specifically to the number of people in 
the commission who should be disabled or should have 
had a disability. Paragraph 2(2), it is phrased in the 
negative: a person who is not disabled or has not had a 
disability may be appointed to the commission only if half 
its members are disabled or have had a disability.
<P>
The amendments would remove the references to 
having had a disability. I describe them as probing 
amendments because I am trying to tease out exactly what 
sort of person the definition is intended to cover. What 
sort of person has had a disability but no longer does and 
would therefore be covered by that categorisation?



<P>
Genuine anxiety has been expressed in the House and 
by many disability organisations that, as the appointment 
of the first chairman will be a sign of the Government's 
seriousness or earnest of good intent and should make 
the commission's intentions clear, the person appointed 
chairman should be disabled. I understand why the 
Government have said that they do not feel it appropriate 
to include that requirement in the Bill, but the definition 
in the Bill of the chairmanship and deputy chairmanship 
provide for the second category of person someone who 
is not disabled but has had a disability to be appointed.
<P>
It is important that the Government make it clear 
exactly whom they have in mind. The requirement could 
be met by appointing someone who is not disabled but 
who, the Government feel, falls in the category of having 
had a disability. I have spent some time trying to envisage 
circumstances in which that description might be 
appropriate, and have raised the matter because I am 
worried that it would be technically possible under the 
definitions in the Bill to avoid the numerical requirements 
by appointing people who are not disabled. I should like 
a clear statement from the Government, about their 
intention and a description of the sort of person who 
would be described as having had a disability.
<P>
I can envisage circumstances in which someone had an 
industrial injury that led to a disability, but in which a 
subsequent change in his circumstances means that he 
falls within the category of having had a disability.
<P>
Such definitions would ensure that sufficient members 
of the commission were disabled people and could bring 
their experience of disability to bear on its operation. It 
would be inappropriate to appoint people with no 
experience of disability to take such decisions. I am trying 
to ensure that the Government make it clear that half of 
the commissioners and at least one of those holding the 
chairmanship or deputy chairmanship will be disabled 
people. That is why I am concerned about the alternative 
description in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 12 also deals with the constitution of 
the commission. Under schedule 1, the tenure of office of 
those appointed by the Secretary of State can be as little 
as two years, but not more than five years. I am concerned 
about the constant changeover in members that would 
result if members were appointed for as little as two years. 
It is important to ensure continuity of experience in the 
commission, especially in its early days of operation.
<P>
Amendment No. 12 specifically deals with the 
chairman's term of office. It is an attempt to ensure a 
degree of independence for the chairman that might not 
otherwise exist, given that his or her minimum or 
maximum term of office is not specified in schedule 1.
I suggest that a period of between four and five years 
would ensure that the chairman remained during any 
change in Government. Therefore, the chairman would 
not be subject to the political interference that could occur 
if his or her term of office was dependent on the 
Government of the day.



<P>
It is important that the chairman should be independent, 
especially as the commission's activities could bring it 
into conflict with the Government. The chairman should 
have the comfort of knowing that he or she has a set term 
of office, which will be longer than the lifetime of this 
Parliament, given that the commission will be created next 
year. A set term of office would mean that the 
Government could not remove the chairman because he 
or she did or said something that brought the commission 
into conflict with the Government.
<P>
As I have said, it is important to get the commission 
right because it sends important messages about the 
support that we are giving disabled people in creating the 
Disability Rights Commission. It is extremely important 
to ensure that the chairman is free from political 
interference. The Minister may say that that is the 
Government's intention. If so, I suggest that they accept 
amendment No. 12 and reinforce that intention in the Bill 
by ensuring that the chairman is appointed for a set term, 
in which he or she can say and do whatever is necessary 
in the interests of the commission and disabled people.

<P>

<B>Rev. Martin Smyth:</B> At first, I wondered whether the 
amendment had any merit. I then began to look at it and 
other amendments in the group much more carefully.
I asked myself whether the hon. Member for Maidenhead 
believed that the Government were living in a world of 
miracles and imagined that a person with a disability 
might miraculously have been healed. On the other hand, 
I am aware that some diseases have lengthy periods of 
remission.
<P>
For example, I had a part-time women's worker who 
was unable to move from her bed for a year. She had 
multiple sclerosis, and when it went into remission she 
went into training for women's work in the Church. She 
was one of four out of 14 trainees who completed the 
course.
<P>
When the Church tried to allocate her a position,
I happened to be taking part in the Northern Ireland 
constitutional convention for a year, and someone was 
needed to relieve me of the pastoral work in the 
congregation. The assigning committee was not too sure 
where to send that lady, but it said, "Smyth will do all 
right."	 She was an outstanding worker in that 
congregation from 1975 until 1983. After I left, her 
husband said that it was my discipline that had kept her 
going, because she went back into severe MS. Someone 
of that nature might meet the bill, but I think that the 
probing amendment is important.



<P>
Likewise, I share the Committee's concern about the 
tenure of the chairperson. That person will not be chairing 
a board or trust and implementing Government decisions; 
he will be chairing a commission that represents people 
with disabilities. It is an important distinction. For 
instance, the chairman of the Eastern Health and Social 
Security Board felt that he could not implement the 
decisions of the Minister, and, as the Minister would not 
go, he had to go. That is all right if the chairman's job is 
to implement the Government's decisions. However, the 
chairman of the Disability Rights Commission should 
have at least some protection if there is a conflict of 
interest, because he or she will represent people who 
believe that, somewhere along the line, employers or other 
statutory bodies have not given them their rights. The 
amendment is therefore worthy of consideration.
<P>
Within the Church in which I am an ordained minister, 
the moderator has tenure for only one year. My senior 
minister, who became moderator, described that by 
saying, "One year you're it, the next year you're ex-it"	. 
If the commission is going to have any teeth, the people 
in the driving seat should not be shuffled around too 
speedily. In that sense, I support the amendment.
<P>
I have greater empathy with amendment No. 18. It 
would require senior management to have some 
awareness of disability. I am sure that that does not mean 
only book learning; people can learn from books but have 
experience of nothing. Again, I speak from experience. 
One of the finest directors of social services whom I ever 
knew helped me with a young woman, who was blind and 
had other multiple health problems. She had spoken to a 
colleague in the United States about doing some research 
into the health affairs of Northern Ireland and he asked 
me to look after her. I did so for a week, but we were 
away from home during the second week that she wanted 
to stay. We discovered that she was incontinent, among 
her other problems. Because of the compound nature of 
her disabilities, she was buying up every moment of life, 
driving herself far beyond the level that she should have 
done, which did not help her.
<P>
I approached the director of social services, who 
understood the position and graciously offered to look 
after the young woman for the second week. Afterwards, 
the director said that although she had been involved in 
social work among the disabled for years, that was the 
first time that she had experienced at first hand what it 
meant to have multiple disabilities.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In senior management, the question is not merely about 
whether one is an administrator or about Buggins' turn 
and getting promotion. Those involved in the commission 
ought at least to understand and have some practical 
experience of disabled people's needs. They should listen 
to people rather than directing them. I support the probing 
amendments, and shall wait for the Minister's response 
with interest.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> As the hon. Member for Belfast, 
South (Rev. Martin Smyth) said, the purpose of 
amendment No. 18 is to probe the Government on what 
procedures they believe will be appropriate for the 
commission and senior managerial staff to undertake to 
achieve a rounded understanding and appreciation of the 
full range of disabilities. In the amendment, we specify a 
group of developmental disorders that I mentioned on 
Second Reading. I singled that group out not because the 
need for a rounded understanding is exclusive to it, but 
because full and proper understanding will be essential in 
its case.
<P>
I expect the commission to deal with many cases 
concerned with developmental disorders, not least 
cases relating to employment. As I said on Second 
Reading, developmental disorders do not necessarily 
affect people of low intelligence, which is often believed 
to be the case. It is possible for someone with such a 
disorder to have an IQ of more than 70, which is the 
benchmark that many professionals use to determine 
whether someone has a learning disability. Many such 
people who have an IQ of more than 70 have a 
mainstream education, hold educational qualifications and 
therefore expect and seek integration into the workplace. 
I hope that the commission will want to deal with difficult 
cases of that nature and help people when trying to assert 
their right to equal opportunities.
<P>
The knowledge and understanding of the commission's 
staff will be key to how such people are helped. In setting 
up the commission, the Government must provide 
guidance on how it will be expected to train and help its 
members and senior staff to achieve well-rounded 
knowledge and understanding of a range of disabilities.
<P>
I declare an interest unremunerated, of course in 
that the amendment was prompted by my discussions with 
the chief executive of the National Autistic Society, of 
whose national council I am a member. We want to ensure 
that the commission has a thorough understanding of 
developmental disorders, which will help that group 
of people when complex and important cases are brought 
to the commission's attention.
<P>
<B>Miss Begg:</B> I urge the Committee to resist amendments 
Nos. 10 and 11, for the good reasons outlined by the hon. 
Member for Belfast, South. Although the majority of 
commissioners will have a disability, sufferers at the 
height of their disability may not be able to do the job of 
a commissioner. However, having gone through the worst 
of their illness, sufferers may come out of it at the other 
end.
<P>
A disability is not necessarily permanent. It is easy for 
people such as me with visible disabilities to persuade 
others of our problem and, as a result, we receive 
sympathy, which is sometimes misplaced. It may be 
harder for those with invisible disabilities to persuade 
people that they are discriminated against. People who are 
schizophrenic, for example, may not be well enough to 
fill the role of commissioner when they are experiencing 
an acute episode.
<P>
People who have been cured and or who have the 
condition under control would not be defined medically 
as having a disability, but would certainly have a strong 
understanding of mental health problems. People with 
mental health problems are very much the invisible 
disabled people in our society. They are ignored and 
often suffer far worse discrimination, particularly in 
employment, and are more likely to be prevented from 
leading a normal life than those with obvious physical 
difficulties.
<P>
Medical science is advancing at such an enormous rate 
that within five years a cure for cystic fibrosis will be on 
the cards. At present, that illness is debilitating and often 
leads to premature death. Like my condition, it is a single 
gene error, and clinical trials on humans with such 
illnesses are now in progress. People who have grown up 
with the trauma of cystic fibrosis and coughing up their 
lungs will have the experience that makes it worth while 
for them to be a commissioner, even though they no 
longer have the condition.
<P>
Whether myalgic encephalomyelitis is a disability is a 
controversial issue. The condition is often so debilitating 
that, while at its height, a person with ME cannot work, 
so could not necessarily be a commissioner. However, 
people with ME get better sometimes within two, five 
or 10 years, although in some cases, it could be longer. 
They would have a valuable insight into the problems 
faced by people with ME, which no one else would 
necessarily be able to provide.
<P>
There must be an awareness that people have invisible 
disabilities, and that not only those with obvious 
disabilities should become commissioners. We must 
consider the panoply of disabilities to ensure that 
everyone is properly represented. The wording
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"who has had a disability"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will ensure that commissioners have important relevant 
experience.
<P>
I have some disquiet about the wording of amendment 
No. 18, which requires commissioners to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"demonstrate a knowledge of disability".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One of the criteria should be that they have an 
understanding of what disability is all about, but the 
amendment would tie them down too much. If we are 
looking for someone to deal with the financial services of 
the commission, I would rather employ a good accountant 
than someone who has experience of disability. I should 
not want to rule anyone out because they do not have 
that experience.
<P>
A person's working life may have involved equal 
opportunities issues, whether gender or race, which does 
not necessarily give them an insight into disability, but 
may give them an understanding of the legal side of 
discrimination faced by many people. I am reluctant to 
include in the Bill specific disorders, such as cerebral 
palsy, Down's syndrome or autistic spectrum. They are 
all very important and I hope that employees of the 
commission will have knowledge of them, but to specify 
them in the Bill would be too restrictive. There are plenty 
of other areas, a knowledge of which should be 
demonstrated. I ask the Committee to resist the 
amendments.

<P>

<B>Ms Linda Perham </B>(Ilford, North): My hon. Friend the 
Member for Aberdeen, South has covered much of what 
I had to say on amendments Nos. 10 and 11. I echo her 
point about there being periods of remission in certain 
diseases certainly in MS and ME. There have been 
advances in medical science in dealing with blindness and 
deafness. I accept that Opposition Members have said that 
amendment No. 10 is a probing amendment, but I am 
reluctant to see the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and has not had a disability"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
removed. It is important to have people with experience 
of disability.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Opposition Members said that these were 
probing amendments, and I hope that when they have 
heard the arguments, they will see fit to withdraw them.
<P>
With regard to amendments Nos. 10 and 11, the Bill 
provides for a majority of the commissioners to be 
disabled persons, or persons who have had a disability 
and, as the hon. Member for Maidenhead said, specifies 
that either the chairman or deputy chairman should be a 
disabled person or a person who has had a disability.
<P>
All commissioners will be appointed in accordance 
with the guidance issued by the Office of the 
Commissioner for Public Appointments. The posts will be 
advertised one already has been and the whole process 
will be open, transparent and fair.
<P>
The reason for providing that commissioners should be 
people who have had a disability as well as people who 
have an existing disability is that we want to be consistent 
with the definition of disability, as set out in the Disability 
Discriminating Act 1995. Hon. Members who were 
involved in the consideration of that legislation will recall 
the debate on widening the definition of disability to 
include people who have had a disability. That was argued 
for during the passage of the 1995 Act, and was 
eventually conceded by the then Government. It was 
recognised that people who have recovered from a 
disability often continue to experience discrimination and 
should be protected by the legislation. They will not only 
bring their experience to bear on issues that will concern 
the commission but they will continue to experience 
discrimination.
<P>
That is true of a wide range of people who have a wide 
range of impairments. I draw attention to those who have 
recovered from a mental illness. I mentioned on Second 
Reading people who have had a mental illness and have 
to explain their period of absence from work. They prefer 
to say that they have been in prison than admit to having 
had a mental illness because there is still such prejudice 
among employers against people with mental illness. It is 
important to retain in the definition the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"persons who have had a disability."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be step backwards to exclude it.
<P>
My hon. Friend hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, 
South raised the issue of ME. If someone suffering from 
ME meets the definition of disability, as defined in the 
Disability Discrimination Act 1995, he or she will be 
covered. I draw the Committee's attention to the disability 
rights task force, which is currently examining the 
definition of disability to ensure that there is proper 
coverage for all those who suffer from discrimination and 
that we bring comprehensive civil rights to the broadest 
range of people who are subject to discrimination on the 
grounds of disability.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
We recognise the value that direct personal experience 
of disability will bring to the commission and by making 
specific provision for commissioners who have had 
disabilities, in addition to those who are disabled currently, 
we are seeking to include the experience of those who may 
experience a different range of discrimination. Also, we are 
seeking to avoid the situation that the amendment could 
cause. A commissioner could be forced to resign because, 
although disabled at the time of appointment, he is no 
longer disabled, because he has recovered, say, from a 
period of mental illness, or some other condition such as 
cystic fibrosis or cancer which advances in medical 
techniques can now treat successfully, as my hon. Friend 
the Member for Aberdeen, South said. I want to emphasise 
that we are talking here not about impairments of a 
temporary nature but about the conditions covered by the 
provisions of schedule 2 of the Disability Discrimination 
Act, which require them to have lasted for at least
12 months.
<P>
On that basis, I ask the hon. Member for Maidenhead 
to withdraw amendments Nos. 10 and 11. With regard to 
amendment No. 12, which was also tabled by the hon. 
Lady, I stress again that in determining the length of time 
for which the chair of the commission should be 
appointed, we had regard to advice from the Office for 
the Commissioner of Public Appointments. We have 
stipulated that the initial appointment should be for four 
years, with the possibility thereafter of an extension of 
three years.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> The Minister appears to be saying that she 
accepts that the term of office needs to be for a set period 
in order to achieve the independence to which I and other 
hon. Members have referred, but that she will not include 
that in the Bill. Must one trust the Government that that 
will always be the case?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> We can certainly trust this Government, 
but that is not my rationale for not accepting the 
amendment. It may help the Committee if I read an extract 
from the guidance given to me by the Office for the 
Commissioner of Public Appointments. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Commissioner recommends that appointments should be 
between three to five years within a maximum period of 10 years for 
consecutive appointments. Appointments or first re-appointments 
should not normally be less than three years though special situations 
may require this.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That guidance has informed us in drafting schedule 1.
<P>
Our intention is fully to comply with the guidance and 
to provide flexibility for all commissioner appointments. 
Therefore, the Bill requires that appointments must be 
made for between two and five years, and that 
commissioners may be reappointed. I assure the 
Committee that that is consistent with our determination 
to ensure that the commission is not only independent but 
operates flexibly.
<P>
We should not tie our hands unnecessarily by stating in 
the Bill that the chairman of the commission should be 
appointed for not less than four but not more than five 
years. That would diminish the effectiveness and 
independence of the Disability Rights Commission.
<P>
It is perfectly sensible to appoint the chairman for four 
to five years initially. Indeed, we have advertised the post 
for an initial term of four years. However, there is no 
reason to constrain the appointments process by making 
such provision a legal requirement; nor is there any reason 
to reduce the flexibility of reappoint. We would all 
endorse the reappointment of a capable person who fulfils 
the requirements of the post.
<P>
The chairman's personal circumstances might preclude 
his or her accepting a reappointment for four years, as 
would be required under amendment No. 12. The 
commission and its stakeholders would suffer if they were 
to lose the services of people in that way. I hope that the 
hon. Member for Maidenhead will not press that 
amendment to a Division.
<P>
I shall now deal with amendment No. 18. As I have 
said, the Bill includes a requirement for the majority of 
commissioners to be disabled people, or people who have 
had a disability. I stress the fact that that reflects the 
recommendations of the task force that produced 
proposals for the White Paper, which has informed the 
drafting of the Bill. We believe that that proposal strikes 
the right balance, which was the task force's view.



<P>
In appointing the commissioners, the Secretary of State 
will ensure that between them they have a breadth of 
experience in a range of disabilities, but we shall want the 
commission to take account of its stakeholders, including 
service providers, employers and others such as members 
of local government and trade unions.
<P>
Most members of the Committee would accept that it 
would be unrealistic to expect every commissioner or, 
indeed, all the commission's managers to have full 
knowledge of all the disabilities covered by the Disability 
Discrimination Act 1995. Indeed, it could be argued that, 
under amendment No. 18, only people with medical 
training could hold a post in the Disability Rights 
Commission because of the extent of knowledge required.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I have already stressed that 
amendment No. 18 is intended to probe the Government's 
thinking. Notwithstanding the expertise that those 
appointed to the commission and its senior managers will 
have initially, we want to know how they will achieve
a rounded understanding and appreciation of other 
disabilities after they have been appointed.
<P>
Clearly, they should have expertise across the range, 
but none the less, it should be stated for example, in the 
guidelines that they should acquire further knowledge 
because the understanding of such matters does not stand 
still. For example, the medical profession has to keep pace 
as science moves on. However much expertise the 
commission and its senior employees have to start with, 
it would be wrong for members of the Committee to think 
that that expertise will always serve them well in future.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am an indulgent Chairman 
and I do not normally have difficulty in recognising 
members of the Committee. That means that interventions 
must be brief.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
The Government do not consider it appropriate to 
specify in the Bill the sort of training and in-service 
development that we expect the commission to undertake 
for its staff, and perhaps commissioners, so that it keeps 
up to date with the necessary breadth of knowledge. The 
Government want an independent commission. If it is 
properly to represent the range of disabilities for which it 
will have responsibility, staff will need in-service training 
to keep abreast of the changes that inevitably occur, 
particularly as medical science progresses.
<P>
In appointing the commissioners, we will ensure that 
they all have an understanding of the issues confronting 
them. I take the point that was well made by my
hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South that in 
appointing their chief financial controller, the 
commissioners will be more concerned that he or she 
keeps the books in order than that he or she has the range 
of knowledge or understanding that may be required of 
other members of the organisation. However, we do not 
wish to specify the matter. If one thinks about the wide 
spectrum of disabilities, one cannot expect one person to 
know about the effects of HIV, cancer and spondylitis. 
How many wheelchair users could claim an in-depth 
understanding of sight or hearing impairments, let alone 
of other impairments covered by the Disability 
Discrimination Act?
<P>
The amendment would require too much of an 
individual, whether a commissioner or someone in one of 
the top managerial jobs, and it would be impractical to 
attempt to measure or enforce such a requirement. The 
commission will take account of the interests not only of 
all disabled people but of other key stakeholders such as 
employers and service providers. I hope that they will be 
able to draw on expertise from outside the commission; a 
later amendment tabled by Opposition Members deals 
with expert advice given to the commission. The 
Government recognise that if the commission is to work 
effectively, it must not only draw on that outside 
expertise, but work in partnership with the range of 
organisations that represent disability interests. We expect 
the commission to report to Parliament on how it is 
working with those organisations in its annual report. 
I therefore hope that, in the light of those explanations, 
Opposition Members will withdraw the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> I listened carefully to what was said by 
all Labour Members, but particularly by the Minister. In 
moving the amendments, I said that several were probing. 
On amendments Nos. 10 and 11, I accept what the 
Minister said about the definition of someone who has 
had a disability; I expected that reference would be made 
to the definitions in the Disability Discrimination Act. 
I hope that the Minister accepts I suspect that she does, 
although she did not specifically respond to the point 
that the first chairman of the commission should be a 
disabled person or someone who had a disability. That 
is important.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I reiterate what was said by my right hon. 
Friend the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work 
and Equal Opportunities. Although we do not want to tie 
ourselves by including in the Bill a requirement that the 
first chairman should be a disabled person, it is 
inconceivable that the first chairman will not be so.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. It is important 
that it should be put on record, given what has been said 
outside about the appointment of the first chairman. I am 
pleased with that further amplification. I beg to ask leave 
to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 19, in 
page 12, line 26, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) The Commission shall publish annually the individuals or 
bodies from whom it has sought professional advice in respect of 
specific disabilities.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment conveniently follows our debate on 
amendment No. 10, in which the Minister acknowledged 
that the commission should consult professionals in 
respect of specific disabilities. It is reasonable that the 
commission should publish annually the names of 
individuals and bodies from whom it seeks professional 
advice in respect of specific disabilities.
<P>
Some disabilities and medical conditions are extremely 
rare. I had one such case in my own constituency not long 
ago. I was helping a young lady of 20 to appeal against 
the withdrawal of her disability living allowance. She was 
one of only 26 people in the country with that condition. 
In the absence of help from her GP, who understood her 
symptoms but not the medical condition, I had to help her 
find credible medical support. The commission will need 
to call on such expertise in many cases.
<P>
A doctor or someone in the medical profession who is 
held in high esteem, or one of the disability groups that 
represents a particular disability, may have expertise that 
would be helpful to the commission. The reason for 
wanting those bodies or individuals to be listed in the 
annual report is that those who take an interest in the 
subject, both professional and non-professional, will want 
to know who is highly regarded in any field. There may be 
conflicting views between two sets of experts in medical 
science and research. Such cases are common. Many 
disabled people, with their supporters and carers, often 
fall through the net when trying to access their equal 
opportunities rights in employment, through support from 
social services or even by receiving the most appropriate 
medical treatment. So-called professionals argue, 
squabble and give conflicting advice and opinion. 
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the public can 
scrutinise those whom the commission has consulted on 
certain disabilities.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept that this is a 
sensible amendment, which would assist those who go to 
the commission for individual support, and would be of 
great interest to disability groups.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> Does the hon. Lady accept that there is a 
danger that some doctors who have been consulted may 
not want their named to be published, for whatever 
reason? Should there be an amendment to allow 
individuals to request that their names, addresses or 
telephone numbers are not published?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am not suggesting that personal 
addresses and phone numbers should be published, but if 
people have been called on to give professional advice, 
they should be identified. We are talking about people 
who are eminent in their field and are already in the public 
domain. By expertise I do not simply mean a general 
practitioner: I am referring to specialist advice about a 
specific disability. It is important to ensure that the 
commission has consulted the most appropriate body. 
There may be a challenge what or who is an appropriate 
authority on a certain subject.



<P>
I am not convinced by the suggestion made by the hon. 
Member for Winchester, as advice would not necessarily 
be for a specific person but for a specific disability. 
I make that distinction. I am not asking the commission 
to publish the name of the person whom it consulted about 
an individual, but to identify the body it consulted about 
a specific disability. That would give transparency to the 
scrutiny process.
<P>
I am sorry to harp on about this, and I crave your 
indulgence and that of the Committee, Mrs. Dunwoody, 
but for many years people have been denied a diagnosis 
of autism, simply because of who in the medical 
profession they consulted. We know who they are, and 
they are still out there. I would be horrified to think that 
the commission would consult certain bodies and people 
and not others.
<P>
If the commission is to help people again, I refer to 
specific disabilities, not individuals it is important that 
we know who the commission identifies as experts in their 
field, so that such decisions can be subject to 
representation if they are challenged by individuals or 
disability groups.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton (East Worthing and Shoreham):</B> I 
want to speak briefly in support of my hon. Friend the 
Member for Tiverton and Honiton. As she quite rightly 
said, the amendment is sensible. I hope that it will 
strengthen the Bill, and in so doing strengthen the 
credibility of the Disability Rights Commission. We need 
to instil into this new body two key principles 
accountability and transparency especially in its early 
days, so that it gets off to a good start and is taken 
seriously by a wide constituency throughout the country.
<P>
The commission needs to be seen to be consulting as 
widely as possible for two reasons. To show that it is 
doing its job properly, it needs to be seen to be speaking 
to other bodies and not merely following its own agenda. 
In the past, such criticism has been levelled with varying 
degrees of credibility at the Equal Opportunities 
Commission and the Commission for Racial Equality. 
Consulting a wide range of professional opinion and 
disability pressure groups would give the commission 
greater public credibility.
<P>
In addition, the commission needs to show itself to be 
taking account of both sides of the argument. Arguments 
over disability issues often involve two sides, if not more. 
For example, a great debate is raging on deafness. 
Whenever I make a statement on hearing disabilities, I am 
deluged with protesting letters about whether signing or 
lip reading is better. If the commission is to retain any 
credibility, it must be seen to have consulted both sides 
of the argument, the medical professionals responsible for 
dealing with deaf people and disability groups lobbying 
for legislation on their behalf. The same is true of autism, 
about which there are many different opinions. Ouestions 
remain unanswered, about what causes it, at what stage it 
develops and appropriate actions and diagnoses.



<P>
For many other public agencies, credibility is entirely 
linked to the extent of accountability and transparency. It 
is greater if they are seen to consult as widely as possible. 
It would not constitute an enormous cost or regulatory 
burden on the commission to require it to publish a full 
list of the people whose advice it has sought and whom it 
has consulted. That would show the public that it was 
taking account of both sides of the argument and, indeed, 
of the argument itself not in individual cases, or, as the 
hon. Member for Winchester implied, by publishing 
names and addresses and details of experts' children's 
schools and would show that the views of other bodies 
had been taken into account. The proposal is entirely 
reasonable and sensible, and would strengthen the 
commission's credibility, especially in its early days.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I reassure the hon. Member for Tiverton 
and Honiton that we are reasonable people who listen 
carefully to arguments advanced during Committee 
proceedings. Indeed, we have a record for doing so during 
consideration of this Bill in the other House. We have 
examined the amendment carefully, and I shall explain 
some of the issues that we believe it raises.
<P>
The routine duties of all members and officials of the 
commission will involve daily contact with a range of 
bodies and individuals with expertise. I imagine that those 
who work for the commission will be on the end of a 
telephone every day, asking for specific professional 
advice or general views on disability issues or other issues 
connected with the commission's performance.
<P>
The amendment would place a duty on the commission 
to publish details of all such contacts. It would be 
unworkable because everyone would be expected to keep 
a record of every contact and people would be required 
to determine whether a conversation or letter constituted 
something that was required to be on the public record. 
The amendment would place a huge administrative burden 
on the commission. We want it to operate with 
minimum bureaucracy.
<P>
The hon. Member for Winchester raised an important 
matter to which we shall also have regard. As for issues 
of accountability and transparency being littered 
throughout the Bill, I say to the hon. Member for 
Westmorland and Lonsdale that we shall require the 
commission to consult existing organisations in its annual 
report. I have listened to the arguments and I can see some 
merit in the commission publishing such data, albeit in a 
limited form. For example, when advice has been sought 
and paid for, that should be incorporated into the public 
record. I am willing to consider the amendment in more 
detail and to return to it on Report. In the mean time, I ask 
the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton to withdraw it.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> It is not my intention that every 
three-minute telephone call should be logged and 
published in the annual report. I am satisfied that the 
Minister has accepted the thrust of my request. She will 
understand how important it is that, when major 
information is being sought, one can study the annual 
report and track its genesis. If officials need to redraft the 
provision, we fully accept that and are grateful that an 
acknowledgement will be made. We accept the Minister's 
response that the amendment will be considered further 
on Report and that she will present us with a rewording 
of it so that we can achieve our main objective without 
making the process over-bureaucratic. I beg to ask leave 
to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 1 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>General functions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 
1, line 25, after `agency', insert `or other public authority'.
<P>
I reassure the Committee that the aim of the amendment 
is clarification. The Bill, as it was originally introduced 
in another place, enabled the commission for purposes 
connected with its functions to give advice on the 
practical application of any law. In another place, 
subsection (2)(b) was inserted to make that provision 
explicit in relation to a Government agency. However, 
that term could inadvertently suggest that some public 
authorities would be excluded from receiving such advice 
or guidance. For example, local authorities are not 
Government agencies.
<P>
The amendment would extend the provision to include 
public authorities, so that it was apparent beyond doubt 
that it covered all such authorities. I understand that that 
was intended when the amendment was tabled in another 
place, and I do not seek to go against that intention.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> We welcome the fact that the Government 
have maintained the intention of the amendment to insert 
the phrase "any Government agency"	 that was tabled by 
my noble Friend, Baroness Blatch, in another place, but I 
recognise the difficulties that might have occurred were 
the provision to remain as it is worded.
<P>
I also welcome the fact that the group of bodies to 
which the commission can give advice will be extended 
to include public authorities. Providing advice and making 
proposals to various bodies on how they can best fulfill 
the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 
1995 and other legislation that is pertinent to the purposes 
of the commission is an essential part of its work. I 
welcome the Government's willingness to widen the 
commission's power.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.




<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 2, 
line 10, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) The Commission shall have the power to set up regional 
offices as it deems necessary in pursuance of its duties under this 
Act.'.</font></ul>
<P>
The amendment would further increase the 
commission's powers by giving them the ability, to set up 
regional offices an issue that was raised in debates in 
another place in Committee and on Second Reading, and 
about which several disability organisations have raised 
concerns. The power conferred by the amendment is 
surely an enabling power. The amendment does not 
require the commission to set up regional offices; it gives 
the commission the power to do so if it believes that that 
is necessary in pursuance of its duties.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Tom Clarke:</B> I am following the hon. Lady 
carefully, but am in some doubt about whether the 
definition of "regional"	 includes the nations of Scotland, 
Wales and Northern Ireland? Is the hon. Lady speaking 
just about regions in England?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call the hon. Lady on a delicate 
matter.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I recognise the delicacy and sensitivity of 
the point. My answer to the right hon. Member for 
Coatbridge and Chryston is that it would be for the 
commission to decide where it felt it appropriate to open 
regional offices. As I said, it is an enabling amendment. 
I am not trying to restrict the commission in any way by 
specifying where it should set up offices or requiring it to 
do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> Does the hon. Lady believe that the Bill 
prevents the commission from setting up such offices?
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I would like the Bill specifically to 
recognise that the commission may wish to set up regional 
offices and give it that explicit power. If, the Bill does not 
prevent the setting up of such regional offices surely the 
Government can have no complaint about our wishing to 
place an enabling power clearly in the Bill to ensure that 
everyone clearly understands that it exists? Several 
external organisations have asked that consideration be 
given, for practical reasons, to the commission's ability to 
set up regional offices. There is concern that there should 
be a point of contact for disabled people that is closer 
than the headquarters, which it is assumed will be here in 
London, to provide them with better access to the support, 
help and advice that the commission will offer. That goes 
not only for disabled people but for employers and 
other goods and service providers particularly small 
businesses who might be more likely to take up the 
opportunities offered if there were a regional or local 
point of contact.
<P>
If the Government accept that the commission may 
wish to set up regional offices and that they would provide 
greater accessibility for all those who wish to consult or 
have dealings with it, I hope that they also accept the 
benefit of placing that enabling power in the Bill so that 
there can be no misunderstanding.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Let me say from the start perhaps my 
right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and 
Chryston would like to hear this before he disappears 
from the Room that it is our intention to establish offices 
in Scotland and Wales, as well as in England. We are 
sensitive to the issues that have been raised in various 
debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Clarke:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the 
Minister for throwing sweets and confetti at us, which is 
very welcome. I am delighted to hear of the recognition 
for Scotland and Wales. Perhaps as we discuss the Bill in 
more detail, we will hear about the staffing and resources 
that will be made available.
<P>
I know that there is often some difficulty in 
pronouncing my constituency, but both hon. Ladies have 
got it right.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. On that point, we are delighted 
that we got the pronunciation right, but perhaps if we keep 
our interventions short, we shall have time to consider 
the pronunciation.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> The Bill allows the commission to set up 
further offices to make what other arrangements it sees fit 
to ensure a presence at regional or local level.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> Has the projected first-year funding for 
set-up costs taken into account provision for regional 
offices?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> We examined the budget of the 
Commission for Racial Equality when establishing the 
budget for the Disability Rights Commission. Excluding 
the community relations council element within the CRE 
budget of £11 million, the CRE operates not only the main 
London office but offices in Birmingham, Cardiff, 
Manchester, Leeds and Edinburgh. We would therefore 
assume that there is capacity to meet that need.
<P>
The amendment would add nothing to what is already 
in the Bill. The issue of regional offices was considered 
by the disability rights task force in detail. Our proposal 
reflects its recommendations and we believe that it is 
important to keep faith with those recommendations.
<P>
On the issue of access to the commission for people 
with disabilities, the task force concluded and I agree 
with it that regional offices were not necessarily the 
appropriate answer. If there are three or four regional 
offices, as well as the central one, that will not necessarily 
make the commission more accessible to disabled people 
across England, Wales and Scotland. For some disabled 
people, other issues are relevant, such as access to public 
transport or their own mobility.
<P>
The task force recognised that accessibility can be 
achieved in other ways, for example, by the appropriate 
use of changes in information communications 
technology. We have stressed throughout our 
considerations, and we have incorporated a provision into 
our proposals, that the disability rights commission should 
develop strong links with local organisations not only 
those representing the interests of disabled people, but 
those representing local and national business.
<P>
Of course the commission should always be able to 
communicate directly with disabled people, business and 
other organisations, with whom it should be engaging, but 
it is common sense that it should work with existing 
networks. To replace those would be wasteful and would 
lead to conflict. When the commission is established, 
disabled people and businesses will approach their usual 
adviser in an existing network. It is important that the 
commission should plug into those networks, so that there 
is good information exchange and best up-to-date advice.
<P>
There must be proper accessibility to the services of the 
Disability Rights Commission for disabled people, which 
is not always a question of having offices in the right 
place. People must go out; outreach work will be a crucial 
element of the commission's work. Not only can it take 
advantage of modern technological innovations, but I 
hope that many members of staff will see it as part of 
their day-to-day work to engage in visiting disabled 
people.
<P>
On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for 
Maidenhead will withdraw the amendment, as it adds 
nothing to the Bill. It is not necessary, and we see no 
purpose in pursuing it.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister. As 
I said earlier, the matter has been debated at some length. 
I am grateful to the Minister for making it clear that the 
powers of the commission will enable it to set up regional 
offices, or other more local offices, should that be 
considered more appropriate, either under its own banner, 
or sharing facilities with other suitable organisations. In 
the light of the Minister's remarks, I beg to ask leave to 
withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Ms Hodge:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I 
have considered my position, and feel that it is 
inappropriate for me to speak to amendment No. 16. My 
husband is deputy chairman of the Legal Aid Board 
appointed by the previous Government, I hasten to add 
and I would not want to be seen to have a conflict of 
interest.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is helpful.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> We have all noted the lack of 
cronyism on the part of the previous Government in 
appointing the Minister's husband to such a distinguished 
position, which I am sure he properly deserves.
<P>
I tabled the amendment 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have not called the 
amendment. I assumed that the hon. Lady's remarks were 
further to the point of order.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> They were, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Assistance in relation to proceedings</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 16, in 
page 5, line 7, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(e) underwrite any legal aid liability, subject to the conditions of 
section 7(1).'
<P></ul></font>
On reading the Bill, it occurred to me that there were a 
couple of circumstances that were not covered, but which 
the commission might properly feel were occasions on 
which it could assist with legal aid. Clause 7, which is 
referred to in amendment No. 16, properly sets out the 
recovery of expenses by the commission of providing 
assistance. It mentions the payments of recovering legal 
aid.
<P>
Two sets of circumstances concern me. This matter not 
only concerns people with disabilities; it affects people on 
low incomes generally. Often, the Legal Aid Board will 
grant legal aid on a particular case, but it requires the 
person to make monthly payments into a fund in advance 
of the case being heard. As we know, legal hearings can 
take time, and the effect on that person's cash flow may 
lead him to decide not to prosecute the case because he 
cannot afford to lose that money on a regular basis.
<P>
In such a circumstance, the commission has the 
discretion to support such a case and to fund those 
payments into the Legal Aid Board on behalf of its client. 
I hope that the Minister, or her hon. Friend the Member 
for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), will consider 
that, as the power to underwrite legal aid liability is 
important.



<P>
There is another area of legal aid underwriting that the 
commission should be free to consider. I am not a lawyer, 
but I understand that if legal aid costs are not recovered 
from the losing party the liability will fall on the person 
who brought the case. I am dealing with a case in my 
constituency in which the Legal Aid Board was not able 
to recover the costs from the person who lost the case. As 
a result, the person who won the case is liable for those 
costs, with a running interest charge. People are often put 
off pursuing good cases because they are worried about 
the legal costs.
<P>
The commission will obviously need to decide whether 
to underwrite such liabilities on behalf of those whom 
they seek to assist. Clause 7 already provides for the 
commission to recover legal aid costs. It is important to 
write it into clause 6 that the commission should have the 
discretion to underwrite such liabilities. I should be 
grateful if the Minister would consider those two 
examples, which are not covered at present.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. David Jamieson </B>(Lord Commissioner to the 
Treasury): It falls upon me to reply to the hon. Lady. 
Little did I realise, as I amble among the foothills of 
government, that my trappist silence as a Whip would be 
broken on such a significant Bill. As so many women of 
political importance are members of the Committee, not 
least yourself, Mrs. Dunwoody, I shall resist the 
opportunity to balance the score with the hon. Lady, who 
has, in the past, launched some withering attacks on me.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> You must be horrified, Mrs. Dunwoody, 
to think that I could have attacked a Whip, who should, by 
definition remain silent. I hope that I have helped the hon. 
Gentleman in his career as a Government Whip by 
encouraging him to remain silent; whenever he speaks from 
a sedentary position, I do my best to ensure that it is recorded 
in the Official Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jamieson:</B> I have noticed that I often appear in the 
Official Report because of the hon. Lady's interventions. 
Today, however, I am not gagged. I am here, with pleasure, 
Mrs. Dunwoody, on my birthday [Hon. Members: "Happy 
Birthday!"]
<P>
The Bill has attracted all-party support, and my hon. 
Friend the Minister, in her boundless generosity, has 
accepted at least the substance of amendment No. 19. We 
are a listening Government, and we shall listen to 
amendments and reflect on them. Alas, amendment No. 
16 does not fall into that category. We cannot accept it 
for two reasons. First, it is tautological even otiose 
and, secondly, its drafting is defective. On those two small 
grounds, we oppose it.
<P>
The amendment would allow the commission to 
underwrite a case, under parts II or III of the Disability 
Discrimination Act 1995, in which an employer was 
acting unreasonably in not providing conditions to enable 
a disabled person to work. If the employer declines to 
assist the claimant further, the case can go to an 
employment tribunal. As the hon. Member for Tiverton 
and Honiton pointed out, a person can at present seek 
legal aid to prosecute the case.
<P>
Under amendment No. 16, the commission would be 
allowed to underwrite any legal liability that an individual 
incurred if the commission had granted his or her 
application for assistance in legal proceedings and that 
person also received legal aid. Under subsection (3)(d), 
the commission will be allowed to provide
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any other assistance which it thinks appropriate",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which could include underwriting legal aid costs. Indeed, 
that provision is broad; the commission will be allowed 
flexibility in many circumstances. It could provide 
facilitators for those who need assistance in bringing a 
case or signers for those who are deaf. Therefore, 
amendment No. 16 would have no practical effect because 
the Bill already contains such provisions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton asked 
about the clawback under legal aid, which is a proper 
matter to raise. If costs are not awarded in legal aid cases, 
a clawback is allowed from whatever sums are awarded. 
However, I can assure the hon. Lady that the commission 
will not claw back sums if costs are not awarded. I hope 
that deals with the important point that she raised. Given 
that the amendment is tautological, I ask the Committee 
to resist it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for 
Plymouth, Devonport for explaining that my main 
concerns are met under subsection (3)(d). However, I seek 
further clarification. I used the word "underwrite"	 in the 
amendment. Although it is hoped that the legal advice 
would be that a case had every chance of success 
otherwise one would question whether it was worth 
pursuing legal aid costs might not be recovered, even 
when the judgment was that the other party should pay 
the full costs.
<P>
If a self-employed person or a small business had 
discriminated against an employee or a possible 
employee, but ceased to trade during the legal 
proceedings, legal aid costs would not be recoverable, and 
the Legal Aid Board could put a charge on the individual 
whom the commission supported. Will the commission 
have discretion to say up front before the case is heard 
that it would support the person and underwrite such 
charges, which could be punitive given the financial 
position of those involved?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jamieson:</B> People who take their cases to the 
commission may not even need to apply for legal aid, so 
long as they meet the conditions set out at the beginning 
of clause 6. I can assure the hon. Lady that the matters 
that she raises are amply covered in subsection (3)(d).
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> In that case, I beg to ask leave to 
withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Recovery of expenses of providing assistance</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 17 in 
page 5, line 20, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) The Commission shall publish an annual tariff of charges and 
expenses for routine assistance that may be subject to recovery of 
expenses.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A similar amendment was debated on Second Reading. 
The Minister will recall from that debate that the 
Government recognised that the commission quite 
properly charges for expenses, so there should be a tariff 
of the hourly rate charged for the advice of employees 
and for other specific routine items. This amendment 
would simply add the conclusions of that discussion to 
the Bill. It is important that anyone dealing with the 
commission should have some general guidelines on the 
commission's charging policy, although it may not be the 
final bill. The amendment would give transparency to the 
way in which the commission conducts its affairs, and 
would demonstrate clearly that the commission has a 
strategy for its charging policy and is not charging ad hoc.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> The amendment would require the 
commission to publish specific information about charges 
and expenses for routine assistance. Clause 7 deals with 
expenses only in relation to assistance that the 
commission has provided to individuals under clause 6. 
However, we do not expect the commission to charge 
individuals under clause 6, so on that basis alone the 
Government cannot agree to the amendment.
<P>
Clause 7 provides for the commission to recover the 
costs of providing legal representation to an individual 
from any award of costs made by a court or tribunal, or 
from an award of costs that has been agreed between an 
individual and an organisation outside the court or 
tribunal as part of an out-of-court settlement. So as to 
make the position clear, the provision does not extend to 
recovery of costs from compensation awards.
<P>
I must further say that, in my view, the level of detail 
suggested by the amendment is not appropriate.

<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister. I accept 
her point about clause 7 not being an appropriate place 
for the amendment, but she also said that the commission 
would not be expected to charge individuals for 
assistance. Does she expect it to charge companies, for 
example, who come for advice about requirements that 
they have to meet under the Disability Discrimination Act 
1995? If so, such charges would be included under the 
amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> We would not expect that to happen in 
litigation cases. Charges may be incurred if advice is 
sought by organisations in more general terms on other 
subjects in relation to their duties and obligations under 
the 1995 Act or any subsequent Acts. Clause 7(5) 
provides for the Secretary of State to make regulations to 
determine such expenses, which could include the tariffs 
and expenses that Opposition Members have in mind. 
That may cover the point raised by the hon. Member for 
Maidenhead. As this amendment currently stands, we 
cannot agree to it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> There may be a little confusion among 
Government Members as to exactly what the commission 
will do in relation to charges. I accept the Minister's point 
that clause 7 relates to litigation and the amendment refers 
to something separate. Although the Minister might not be 
willing to accept the amendment I hoped that she would 
reconsider its intention.
<P>
My argument rests not so much on individuals, but on 
companies. A commission representative might visit a 
company for a half day or a day to advise on physical 
alterations to its premises to ensure accessibility. It might 
be appropriate for the commission to levy a charge in 
such circumstances. It is only fair and right that, if the 
commission is levying charges, it should be required to 
make a tariff available in advance rather than making ad 
hoc arrangements. The Minister has not dealt with that 
issue.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> If a tariff or a set of charges is not 
available publicly, how will the commission deal with its 
management accounts? It must be aware of a charging 
structure at the beginning of a financial year that will need 
to be adjusted annually. We want to be transparency in 
advance of those charges being made.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> The commission may want to charge for 
giving advice to an organisation to change its physical 
layout to ensure proper access. Provision is made in the 
Bill for the commission so to do. Opposition Members 
want the requirement to provide a tariff of charges to be 
outlined in the Bill. That is too much administrative detail 
to put into the clause. It will be up to the Disability Rights 
Commission to determine whether it wants to charge, how 
much it wants to charge and how it publicises its tariffs. 
If we are establishing an independent Disability Rights 
Commission, it is not right that Parliament should 
determine the mechanisms by which it operates.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am sympathetic to the fact that 
clause 7 is not the appropriate part of the Bill in which to 
stipulate that a tariff should be published. We are 
concerned about the principle of its publication. Will the 
Minister consider the amendment in the context of clause 
8 and of codes of practice and come back to the matter 
on Report, when she has had a chance to receive further 
advice on it? I understood from our debate on Second 
Reading that she was sympathetic to such a proposal.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I shall have to study the record of our 
proceedings on Second Reading. The hon. Member for 
Tiverton and Honiton raised that matter earlier and I could 
not recall such an exchange. I shall reconsider the matter, 
although Opposition Members are requiring too much 
administrative detail. I shall comment on the proposal on 
Report.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> On that basis, I beg to ask leave to 
withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 8 to 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
