<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good afternoon everybody. We are discussing schedule 1 and we now move to amendment No. 65.
<P>
<B>Mr. Austin Mitchell </B>(Great Grimsby): I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 21, line 10, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`every creditor of the company of'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`any creditor, director, employee or member of the company, or any other person known to the nominee'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 66, in page 21, line 17, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) Proper minutes must be kept of all meetings, and those Minutes must be
<P>
(a) accompanied by a list of all those who attended the meeting;
<P>
(b) available for inspection;
<P>
(c) appended to all reports submitted to the courts; and
<P>
(d) filed with the registrar of companies in accordance with paragraph 11(b)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 67, in page 23, line 17, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) In making its decisions the committee shall have regard for the interests of creditors, directors, members of the company, or any other person affected by the moratorium'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> The amendments would widen the interests that the nominee has to take into account and open up information about the decisions taken throughout the process. It is important that such a process is subjected to accountability and that as much information is published as possible because hole-in-the-corner, secretive arrangements are likely to be damaging and less likely to be responsible arrangements that would protect the interests of all those involved.
<P>
Amendment No. 65 would introduce consistency into the Bill. Paragraph 26 of the schedule gives some rights to parties other than only the creditors, but paragraph 29, which is to operate in light of paragraph 26, does not give any rights to the directors and members of company to attend the meeting called by the nominee. Arrangements can be made that can affect the whole operation, yet such people do not have a right to attend the meetings. In the absence of the ability to know what is going on, members and directors are bound to have little opportunity to become aware of the consequences of the nominee's actions and their effect on the future of the company. At the very least, members of the company and its directors need to have the right to attend the meetings, so that they know what is going on. The amendment would further their rights, conceded under paragraph 26. Such rights make common sense. Such people have a vital interest in the future of the company's operation and in decisions taken by the nominee.
<P>
Amendment No. 66 is simply an information requirement because the Bill does not require the nominee to keep proper records of the meetings, which is again a deficiency in the Bill. If proper records are not kept, what accountability can there be? The schedule does not require the minutes to be circulated nor does it require the nominee to file with the registrar the decisions that have been made. Why not? People in the company need such information, as do creditors, not all of whom will attend the meetings. Stakeholders need it. After all, it concerns their future. Why is there not a requirement to keep records and to circulate them?
<P>
The result of the moratorium will inevitably mean some loss of public revenue&#151;perhaps income tax, value added tax or corporation tax to the Revenue or to Customs and Excise. It might&#151;indeed, if a slimming down follows, it will inevitably&#151;lead to a loss of jobs and, therefore, to burdens on social security. It may result in arrangements that have consequences for current and future creditors of the company, who will want to know about the difficulties that the company has experienced and will want an explanation of what has been going on.
<P>
It is important that public information is available about the arrangements discussed and arrived at in meetings called by the nominee. Labour Members believe in open government; I hope that the Freedom of Information Bill will be made more liberal when it returns to the House of Commons. Such business affairs need to be open to prevent hole-in-the-corner arrangements from being arrived at in an atmosphere of secrecy with no requirement to publish. Such arrangements might be corrupt, although I believe that my hon. Friend the Minister has provided enough safeguards. The arrangements certainly would be self-interested and damaging to the interests of one section, whether it be employees or other creditors. The provisions more or less speak for themselves. In proposing them, I am asking for more light.
<P>
Amendment No. 67 would impose a requirement that the moratorium committee
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>have regard for the interests of creditors, directors, members of the company, or any other person affected by the moratorium
<P>
</UL></FONT>to ensure that it acts for the benefit of all those affected by the moratorium. I have been justifiably critical of banks this morning. They will inevitably dominate proceedings in most instances, although not all. They are very powerful. They will usually be the major creditor and, therefore, a dominant influence on proceedings and nominees. Two powerful interests will be involved&#151;the banks especially, but the nominee, too. There is always a danger that privileged parties to such arrangements will secure the outcomes that are most beneficial to themselves&#151;the banks or, in terms of fees and arrangements, the nominee. The banks and the insolvency practitioner both stand to gain and, if they do&#151;and if the process is slanted in their favour&#151;by the simple fact of dominance it follows that, without a check in the Bill, and as night follows day, the other stakeholders will lose out. The amendment would prevent that by asking the moratorium committee to ensure that the interests of other stakeholders are safeguarded. Nothing could be simpler. I hope that when my hon. Friend the Minister rises to concede those powerful points he will take into account the need for openness and for protection of the other interests involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett (Torridge and West Devon):</B> I thought that I might mention nominees, as we shall shortly leave part IV of the schedule. I hope that now is the appropriate time for the Minister to tell the Committee a little more, as promised, about the qualifications for nomineeship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page </B>(South-West Hertfordshire): I am in a slightly difficult position, as the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) slated the banks and receivers so comprehensively this morning. I believe that they do a good and necessary job, but there are times when they stray. However, I certainly do not go along with the majority theory expressed by the hon. Gentleman. I find myself in a slightly peculiar position because the amendments seem very much in the mould of motherhood and apple pie. They seem to put a little more flesh on the bones of the work that will be necessary for the various functions to be carried out.
<P>
Amendment No. 65 is right that all the players should be informed, but amendment No. 66 shows a degree of tautology. I would like to think that, through the advice and guidance of the nominee, those who attend such meetings would be skilful, knowledgeable and trained, and that proper minutes of all meetings and a full attendance list would be kept and made available for inspection. The hon. Gentleman has proposed something like a code of practice, for all to see, and I see no great harm in that amendment either.
<P>
On amendment No. 67, it is right that the committee should have regard to the wider interest, but I would like to hear from the Minister whether that would cut across the duties placed on a committee when it came to make its decisions. I wonder whether the committee would be honour bound, under the Bill or the Insolvency Act 1986, to make decisions in a particular form on particular matters and whether it would not be able to have regard to the interests of creditors, directors and companies.
<P>
Finally, I endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby that&#151; either to the Committee or on Report&#151;the Minister must spell out in clear phraseology what qualifications, training and abilities the nominees should have. The hon. Gentleman made great play before lunch of those who could qualify and the bodies that could authorise them. Yet another one is coming forward, and it is vital that a clear and unequivocal statement is made about the necessary qualifications for someone to be made a nominee and to be approved by that as yet unknown body&#151;a body that, in turn, must be approved by the Secretary of State. We need a little flesh on the bones.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> My heart sank when my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby hinted that he had been a little critical of the banks this morning. I thought for a moment that he was about to equivocate but, like a true Shi'ite, he went to the stake for his cause. Of course, he did not back off; he kept marching around and he will make those walls quake for as long as he can breathe.
<P>
Amendment No. 65 is unnecessary. Once the Bill is enacted, we intend to provide in the insolvency rules a provision similar to that contained in rule 1.16 of the Insolvency Rules 1986 and rule 1.15 of the Insolvency (Scotland) Rules 1985. They provide that the convenor of the creditors' meeting should give notice to the directors of the company to attend that meeting. Additionally, if a director, employee or member of a company is also a creditor, the Bill already provides that they should be invited to the meeting. We do not think that more is needed, as the purpose of the creditors' meeting is for the company's creditors to take particular decisions. Paragraph 29 of schedule A1 obliges the nominee to summon to the creditors' meeting creditors of whose claim he is aware. That is a practical duty. Without summoning those
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of whose claim the nominee is aware,
<P>
</UL></FONT>he would have the potentially fruitless and expensive task of trying to establish whether there were other creditors of whom he was not aware. It is not clear whether the requirements would apply to the classes of people in the amendment, or merely to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any other person known to the nominee.
<P>
</UL></FONT>If the requirements did not apply to creditors, the nominee would be in a difficult position.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Rule 1.24 of the Insolvency Rules 1986 and rule 1.17 of the Insolvency (Scotland) Rules 1985 currently make similar provision to that contained in amendment No. 66. For example, the chairman of the meetings is charged with the duty of preparing a report stating, among other things, the resolutions taken at a meeting and the decision reached. The report must also include a list of creditors and of company members who attend the meetings, and must be filed in court. If the company voluntary arrangement is approved, the report must be filed with the Registrar of Companies. It must also be sent to everyone who is given notice of the meetings. Those rules apply in relation to meetings at which a company voluntary arrangement is sought without the benefit of a moratorium. We will make similar provision in our revision of those rules, which will occur once the Bill has been enacted.
<P>
On amendment No. 67, a moratorium committee may be formed under paragraph 35 of schedule A1 when the company and its creditors have decided to extend the moratorium. It is important to note that the formation of a moratorium committee is not obligatory. It may be decided at the meetings that it is useful and helpful to establish a representative committee. However, we do not consider it necessary to prescribe its role and power in the Bill. Its functions should be a matter for the meetings to determine, in accordance with what the Bill provides. Obviously, such a committee will represent the interests of creditors and members of the company. We never intended to require the committee to represent the interests of directors or any other persons affected by the moratorium. We see no reason why it should do so. Indeed, such a practice could generate inappropriate conflicts. The only responsibilities placed on the moratorium committee by the Bill are to consider whether to approve any disposal of property or any payment by the company under paragraphs 18 and 19 respectively of schedule A1.
<P>
No such committee would have the power to override the Bill or the decisions or acts of the nominee or directors. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby asked about the wider interest, which is very important. There is nothing to stop such a committee having regard to wider interests, but we feel that it would be inappropriate to impose an obligation to do so. I urge my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): The wider community is often affected by the unnecessary liquidation of companies, which can have a major impact. There is much frustration about the fact that that happens overnight and in secret. How will the views and interests of the wider community be heard by the nominee when a moratorium has been established?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The meetings would not occur under a moratorium. My hon. Friend is referring to insolvency proceedings. The moratorium gives directors a breathing space so that they can try to formulate a rescue package that can be agreed by all parties. I hope that my hon. Friend will excuse me when I say that I recognise his point and the pain that the speed of such decision-making can generate, but it does not relate to the provisions under discussion.
<P>
The hon. Members for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) and for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) asked me to describe this creature of ``the nominee''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> This new beast.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Indeed. At present, only licensed insolvency practitioners may act as nominees or supervisors of voluntary arrangements and they will continue to undertake those roles. I have no hesitation&#151;unlike, perhaps, my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby&#151;in acknowledging that their skills, education and experience make them particularly suited to that role. There are professions in which people have great skills and learning but do a lousy job, so the possession of such qualifications is not an automatic commendation; such core skills are, however, necessary.
<P>
That is not to say that the members of no other body would not be capable of acting as nominees or supervisors, or that such a body might not emerge. My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby told us about the eight different recognised professional bodies, including the Department for Trade and Industry&#151;which I had forgotten about. As he said, that could become nine or more. Accountants, solicitors and other lawyers might well choose to undertake the role. No Secretary of State for Trade and Industry would choose a group of individuals who would immediately be at sea on a specialised subject that requires special skills. I hope that I have sketched out the kind of area from which nominees and insolvency practitioners will come.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> For various reasons, I did not pursue the points raised by the amendments. However, notwithstanding the Minister's arguments, which I understand, one important point needs to be made: I refer the Minister to paragraph 29(1) which vests power in the nominee to call a meeting of creditors ``as he thinks fit''&#151;he has complete discretion. A nominee might decide to go into permanent purdah during a moratorium. That would be wrong. During the moratorium period, the nominee should be obliged to call a meeting of members of the company and, at least once, of creditors. I do not know if that has been discussed with the Department of Trade and Industry, but I should like to know what the Minister thinks. The point made by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby is compelling. The nominee should have to attend a meeting of members as well as creditors at least once during a moratorium; he should have to listen to the submissions of members and, I believe, creditors at least once during that 28-day period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The issue that the hon. Gentleman opens up lends the amendment strength and validity. In many companies that are going wrong, the managers do not sing from the same hymn sheet; one or two of them have their own agenda, in which others who are equally responsible for what has gone wrong are not included. The hon. Gentleman makes the valid point that the management should have the complete story from the nominee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire for that endorsement. This is not a good amendment because it does not go far enough; it does not take away the nominee's complete discretion. For the reasons I gave earlier, the nominee should be required to have at least one meeting with the members and managers during the moratorium period, so that those people can make submissions to the nominee. To be even-handed, the nominee should also have at least one meeting with the creditors during that period.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I remind the hon. Gentleman that we have covered the territory to which he refers. The nominee must call meetings to be held in the first 28 days of the moratorium; I am sure that the hon. Gentleman remembers that that requirement was encapsulated in amendments Nos. 39 and 41. Of course, if people want to give the nominee or directors their views, there is nothing to stop them. The Bill allows enough flexibility in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> This has been an interesting and educative little debate, in which I am pleased to have participated. It has been educative, for example, to find that the Opposition do not want to add motherhood, virtue and apple pie to their policies. I thought that the Conservative party had only two policies: shoot burglars and keep the pound. I gave Conservative Members the opportunity to add motherhood, virtue and apple pie to those policies, but they spurned it&#151;which is ridiculous. However, I am grateful for the support given by the Liberal Democrat spokesman, who has made an important point. There should be a requirement to call at least one meeting at which all interests are represented.
<P>
The reply from my hon. Friend the Minister was also educative. He accuses me of being negative about the virtues of insolvency practitioners. I do not want to give that impression, because I know that many of them are adept at company rescue and I respect those skills. I realise also that nominees will initially be drawn from the ranks of insolvency practitioners, who are the only people with the experience to do the job. However, I am worried by the culture of that profession, rather than convinced that there is a specific malign intention on the part of individual insolvency practitioners. That culture, which is imposed by the general economic climate of the time, holds it to be imperative that they should be shipwreckers who wind companies up, rather than rebuilders.
<P>
Nominees should develop as a rescue branch of the insolvency industry, with the rescue skills that are essential in the cases under discussion. I hope that the economic and regulatory signals can be oriented to change that culture, so that that body of skills can develop. I am sure that that is what the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon would like, too.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister gave an explanation that carried some weight in respect of amendments Nos. 65 and 66, but I was less happy with the explanation that he gave in connection with amendment No. 67. The nominees should be exposed to those meetings, but he suggests that such meetings would be the exception rather than the rule, and that they were neither expected nor necessary. I would prefer that they were the rule.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was wholly happy with my hon. Friend the Minister's arguments in respect of the other two amendments, especially amendment No. 65. Ministers' comments about the intentions behind legislation will be used by courts in judgments when the legislation is unspecific; that is the burden of the recent House of Lords decision. The intention is clearly that the system will act in the way that I have tried to prescribe and that the rules will be imposed by regulation that will spell everything out.
<P>
I was interested to hear that the rules will be taken from Scottish practice. I do not know why the Scottish rules are more enlightened and effective than ours. It is interesting that my hon. Friend the Minister and I, a Welshman and a Yorkshireman, are discussing the virtues of Scottish canons. It is good to know what will be the rule, and what is the intention in the regulation. With that song of praise to the nationality that now leads the Labour party, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 42, in page 23, line 35, leave out from `(3)' to end of line 36 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `shall not be made after the end of the period of 28 days beginning with&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (a) the day on which the decision was taken by the creditors' meeting,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (b) where the decision of the company meeting was taken on a later day, that day.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 22, in page 23, line 36, at end, insert:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `but may only be made within 7 days of the decision taken by the creditors' meeting'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 23, in schedule 2, page 32, line 9, at end, insert:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `but may only apply within 7 days of the decision taken by creditors'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment No. 44.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I shall deal first with Government amendments Nos. 42 and 44. Under paragraph 36(3) of proposed new schedule A1 to the Insolvency Act 1986, or paragraph 5 of schedule 2, a member of a company may apply to the court if the decision taken by the creditors' meeting differs from one taken by the company meeting, if that decision relates to approval of the voluntary arrangement, extension of the moratorium, bringing the moratorium to an end, establishing a committee or approval of the expected cost of the nominee's intended actions.
<P>
Although we believe that the timing of such an application will be largely self-regulating&#151;a member of a company is not likely to want to delay his application to court unnecessarily&#151;we consider that there would be an advantage in setting a cut-off point beyond which such applications cannot be made. A member could make a successful application once implementation of the voluntary arrangement was well under way or even concluded. The Government amendments provide that a member of the company has 28 days in which to make such an application to the court.

<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> I have the temerity to flesh out the background to the group of amendments. Before doing so, I should say that I am either going slightly deaf or muddling my words&#151;I usually do the latter. I supported the thrust of the amendments moved by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. I was not against him, even though opposing him is my usual stance and it is normally the right one to adopt.
<P>
The amendments are important. When a meeting of the company does not reach the same conclusion as that of the creditors, it is obviously desirable that the members of the company should have some form of redress if the circumstances justify it. The redress provided by the Bill is an application to the court under proposed new section 4A(3) of the Insolvency Act 1986, set out in schedule 2(5), which relates to voluntary arrangements. It is equally desirable that, once the creditors have reached the decision, the nominee, the directors and the people dealing with the company know where they stand and can get on with saving the company. It is a good thing&#151;it is the reason behind the provisions&#151;that they can do so without the risk of a court overturning the creditors' decision.
<P>
Without the addition of that time limit to paragraph 36, the period in which members of the company can go to court to try to reverse the work of the nominee and the directors is potentially open-ended. That cannot be right; it would be against the spirit of what we are trying achieve. The nominee, the directors, the creditors and those who deal with the company are entitled to certainty in their dealings with the company after their approval of the voluntary arrangements or the extension of the moratorium. The amendments provide that certainty. That will come as a huge shock to the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. In our first sitting, in a moment when he was not having a go at my political position, he said that some of my amendments were ``finely crafted''. I have been clutching that phrase to my bosom ever since.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 will have a consequential effect and amendment No. 23 will require rewording to deal with the possibility that the company's meeting might take place more than 10 days after the creditors' meeting. Various things could be done to change the provision proposed in amendment No. 23. However, the Government in the shape of the Minister&#151;who, to my immense surprise and shock, has revealed his Welsh origins to the Committee&#151;has finally and correctly accepted the fact that a time limit should be imposed on the ability of a member of a company to challenge the decision of the creditors' committee. That time limit was suggested in Committee in another place on 15 June. What more can I say, except that it is a sensible and necessary amendment and I support the Minister?
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Chope (Christchurch):</B> The Minister kindly sent a note to you, Mrs. Michie, to your co-Chairman Mr. Gale, and to members of the Committee. In it, the Minister referred to group 4 and amendments Nos. 8 and 10 and said that unless the amendment is passed,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a member could possibly make a successful application once implementation of the voluntary arrangement was well under way or even concluded.
<P>
</UL></FONT>I can understand that a company member might be able to make an application, but I am concerned that the amendment would exclude the making of a successful application. In what circumstances might an application made after 28 days be regarded as successful? If it was likely to be persuasive and to succeed after 28 days, surely we should not be thinking of excluding the possibility.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am not entirely clear to which group of amendments the hon. Gentleman was referring. However, the group of amendments that we are dealing now with includes amendments Nos. 22 and 23&#151;two finely drafted amendments tabled by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, which deal with time limits. Although a time limit on the ability of a member of a company to go to court if the decision of a creditors' meeting&#151;which would take effect under paragraph 36 of proposed new schedule AI or paragraph 5 of schedule 2&#151;differs from that made by the largely self-regulating company meeting, we can see an advantage in having a cut-off point beyond which such applications cannot be made. We tabled amendments Nos. 42 and 44 to provide for the cut-off point for such applications to be 28 days.
<P>
We consider 28 days to be more appropriate than the seven days proposed in amendments Nos. 22 and 23. I am not sure what the hon. Member for Christchurch thinks, but we believe that seven days is too short, especially for members of a company to consider what to do when the decision of the two meetings conflicts. A period of 28 days is more sensible. Of course, if no resolution is achieved at the end of that period, the moratorium falls and a different set of circumstances arise. That is what we are trying to deal with.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 69, in page 27, line 9, after `company', insert `and/or a nominee'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 68, in page 27, line 16, after `company', insert `and/or a nominee'.
<P>
No. 34, in page 27, line 25, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`to the value of &#163;500 or more'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> This is a straightforward and simple amendment. The Bill is deficient in terms of the accountability and independence of the nominee. I want nominees to develop as the rescue branch of insolvency&#151;the ship repair industry rather than the knacker's yard. The nominees must have the appropriate skills and it must be incumbent on them to impose certain controls. It is possible that they will commit fraudulent acts. I have raised with my hon. Friend the Minister and his predecessors the Channel 4 ``Dispatches'' programme that highlighted abuses of the system by insolvency practitioners&#151;the very people on whom we shall rely to provide the first contingent of nominees.
<P>
The programme was a classic product of undercover journalism. An insolvency practitioner was approached by journalists with concealed cameras pretending to be company directors who were anxious to put their company into receivership, but wanted its assets at knockdown prices. It was an obvious scam, as such actions would have deprived unsecured creditors of any money. They told the insolvency practitioner what they wanted and he happily obliged them&#151;what a service the insolvency profession can provide! Abuse of practice is a minority phenomenon, but it does exist and it could become evident in the nominees' new role. I asked the DTI and the regulators what disciplinary procedures had been exercised in respect of the practitioner involved in that case, but I have not so far been informed whether the matter has been investigated.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> In what year was the broadcast made?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Four years ago, but I did receive a letter from my hon. Friend the Minister about it just the other day.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I hope that my hon. Friend will inform the Committee that he wrote to me about a week before that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> My hon. Friend is correct. However, I had continuing correspondence with his predecessor. The point at issue is that a fraudulent practice had been revealed to the public and aroused much concern, but it was not effectively dealt with. Supposedly, disciplinary procedures are in place to regulate the activities of insolvency practitioners and now the new breed of nominees. I do not suggest that my hon. Friend is responsible for television programmes that were screened four years ago. However, the case illustrates the difficulty in dealing with such matters through the existing control structures. The amendment would merely secure effective control. It would not subject the nominee to any measures that are not applied to other parties, such as company directors, who have specific obligations. It provides a simple means of ensuring a degree of probity that one hopes is already present, but which might not be.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am glad that my hon. Friend acknowledged that I answered his letter within a week, as I pride myself on such things. With great respect to him, I must say that the amendment misses a fundamental point about the moratorium: the nominee is not in charge of the company or its assets during the moratorium; the directors remain in charge. That is an important distinction. There is no need for the offences in paragraph 41 of new schedule A1&#151;which relate, for example, to the spiriting away of a company's assets and records&#151;to apply to the nominee.
<P>
That is not to say that a nominee cannot be prosecuted in appropriate circumstances. If he aids or abets an officer of a company that disposed of property contrary to paragraph 41, he can be prosecuted as a secondary party. In Scotland, he can be prosecuted under common law for commission of an offence on an art-and-part basis. If the nominee were to steal company property, he might be prosecuted for theft. Those controls are strong enough, so I urge my hon. Friend to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> This is an opportune moment to remake a point that we have discussed previously. I am not convinced that we received an adequate response on the minimum duty that nominees owe to members and creditors. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will agree that nominees have duties of care: for example, they should have a duty of confidentiality to the company and its members. Who will have the right to sue a nominee? Will it be granted in tort? Will there be a statutory right? I envisage that a right will be established in tort to ensure that a nominee has a duty of confidentiality and of care. Will the Minister assure the Committee that anyone who is injured by a failure to fulfil duties of care or confidentiality will have the right to sue in tort, so as to recover damages from a nominee who has failed?

<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> Earlier, during discussions on the difficulties of ensuring that assets do not walk, the Minister confidently announced that everyone would want the moratorium to work. We all said amen to that, but, for a variety of reasons&#151;I shall not run over that ground again&#151;a number of cases might evolve in which the moratorium will not work. Before the 28 days are up, halfway through a moratorium that was begun in good faith as a means of rescuing a company&#151;that, of course, is the whole purpose of a moratorium&#151;it may enter the consciousness of the directors of the company that they are not going to get out of their difficulty. They may realise that the company will not be saved and will, in fact, have to close. The Minister stated that the members, the directors and managers run the company, not the nominee. Amendment No. 34, which did not have to be finely crafted because it is very simple, would remove the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to the value of &#163;500 or more.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In that way, it would remove the minimum limit for the offences of concealing and removing any part of the company's property, so that those accused of such offences could be prosecuted.
<P>
I have been told that the provisions contained in the Bill have been enshrined in legislation since the Bankruptcy Act 1914, when the figure mentioned was &#163;10. I cannot calculate whether that &#163;10 is worth &#163;500 now, with inflation. However, as the Minister goes back a number of years he may be able to bring us up to date on those figures&#151;[Laughter.] Nevertheless, the message that the provisions send to an officer of a company, that he can steal items of up to &#163;500 in value and not expect to be prosecuted, is utterly unacceptable and not one that should be sent by the House or enshrined in legislation. Let us imagine what would happen if that provision was translated into the general law of the land and we said, ``It's all right, you can go stealing around your local supermarket and as long as you do not take goods worth more than &#163;500, you will not be prosecuted.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend's argument, but I cannot understand why he did not table a second amendment dealing with paragraph (a). As a result, one would be allowed to conceal
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>part of the company's property to the value of &#163;500 or more.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Does my hon. Gentleman not think that the restriction should apply to both paragraphs (a) and (b)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> That is what friends are for&#151; publicly to humiliate me, reveal the shortcomings of my amendment and give Labour Members a laugh at my expense. However, I am made of strong and stern stuff, and when my hon. Friend has been in the House as long as I have, he will know that what I have done is all part of a cunning plan to have two bites of the cherry: the Bill will soon be on Report, at which stage further amendments can be tabled, and if we shoot all the geese on one day, we do not have a crack later on. My hon. Friend, no doubt, in the desire to be helpful, give me guidance and embarrass me&#151;no, not wanting embarrass me but to proceed in the right spirit&#151;has exposed plan B. I will still try to table that amendment, but I am afraid that the Clerk will feel that the revelation inhibits the chance of its being selected for debate on Report. I think, in all modesty, that you will agree that I did rather well there, Mrs. Michie.
<P>
To return to the serious point&#151;I must look the Minister in the eye as I say this&#151;the Government claim to be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. Even though the crime rate seems to be going up, I am sure that they are tough, so why are they allowing people to steal &#163;500 and not be prosecuted? That is utterly beyond my comprehension. I look forward to the Minister's explanation of why it is all right to steal &#163;499.99. Surely the principle at stake is that it is wrong to take goods and materials that should, if the moratorium fails, belong to the creditors. The Minister is receiving advice on the rate of inflation between &#163;10 and &#163;500; he will probably come back with a smart move such as saying that the sum should have been &#163;625.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): There is a look of complete amazement on the face of my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire that the Whip should seek to intervene, but I am only slightly puzzled. The schedule refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the value of &#163;500 or more
<P>
</UL></FONT>and to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any part of the company's property.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Surely, that refers to any individual removal. Therefore, it may well be possible for that individual to remove several items, each of which is worth &#163;500. We might be talking about substantial removals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> My hon. Friend, if not the other members of the Committee, will believe me when I say that I am glad that he has mentioned the point that I was about to make. It is not clear whether that sum refers only to one item. In practical common sense, &#163;500 is more than enough. To imagine that someone would be able to take &#163;499.99 home every night for the 28-day period is stretching things&#151;even this Government would not allow that. The other point that I would like answered is how that &#163;500 will be accounted for: an item may for several years be written in the books with a price of, say, &#163;100, when it is known to have an open-market value of about &#163;2,000.
<P>
The Government have kindly accepted many of the points that my noble Friends made in another place and introduced them into the Bill. My noble Friends attempted to do something with the figure that was rejected; I ask the Minister if he would reconsider that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I looked at this matter. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman agrees with me that one cannot contract out of a criminal offence. If someone fraudulently removes any part of the company's property, of whatever value, they are in any event guilty of an offence under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The hon. Gentleman again raises a matter of principle and the way in which it cuts across to other Acts. One wonders whether a creditor would be allowed to bring a private prosecution against an officer or member of the company who took an item worth &#163;499.99. Is that a means by which the Government are privatising the operation and giving individuals the task of trying to get the money back?
<P>
I shall draw my remarks to a close. I hope that I have given the Minister long enough to work out the rate of inflation between &#163;10 and &#163;500 and I look forward to what he has to say on what is a matter of principle.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman </B>(Chipping Barnet): I said on Tuesday that my contributions would be brief and rare. That is because I am on a steep learning curve.
<P>
I do not claim to be an expert on insolvency as, happily, I have not yet experienced it.
<P>
I was drawn to support amendments Nos. 69 and 68, moved by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby, until the Minister gave an adequate response. I would like to put on record that the Minister is one of the few who replies courteously and reasonably promptly, and I am grateful for that.
<P>
I am strongly in favour of the aims of my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire in amendment No. 34. As well as giving the wrong message, it would be quite wrong to set a value beneath which no offence is committed. If it is true that such a person can be prosecuted under section 1 of the Theft Act 1984, I see no need for such a provision. I am strongly in favour of my hon. Friend's amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I, too, support amendment No. 34, and I am delighted that the debate has given us the opportunity to appreciate my hon. Friend's sharp intellect, his quick thinking and the mastery of parliamentary procedure and tactics that underlie the amendment.
<P>
It shows how out of touch with ordinary people the Government must be for them to say that sums of less than &#163;500 are of no consequence. If we told our constituents that we could not deal with cases that involved such small sums, we might significantly reduce our caseloads but we would be doing our constituents a grave disservice. For instance, an 84-year-old widower with a severe heart problem, and other medical problems, came to see me at my constituency surgery in Ferndown last Saturday. He said that, due to cuts in the local NHS chiropody service, he could not get his toenails cut. I could have told him that it would not cost much&#151;it would have cost &#163;14. That might be a sum of no consequence to the Government, but to my pensioner constituent in Ferndown it was sufficiently significant for him to come to my surgery.
<P>
At the same surgery, another gentleman of over 75 said that because he would be on holiday during October he would not be watching his television. He did not see why he should have to renew his licence in October because he would be eligible for a free television licence in November. Again, the sum of money involved might seem trifling to the Minister and the Government&#151;only one twelfth of &#163;105 was at issue&#151;but it was of great significance to my constituent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> That man could have reclaimed the twelfth month of the licence fee because his free licence would start on 1 November. I apologise if the hon. Gentleman was about to say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right that people at my advice centre get the very best advice. The pensioner's previous licence had expired and he wanted to know whether to apply for a new licence and claim a rebate for the 11 unused months or whether to do without a licence for that month because he would be on holiday.
<P>
I shall not give any more examples from my Saturday surgery of how such small sums may be critically important to our constituents. Those of us who belong to the learned professions know what could happen if we were to appear in court for stealing even sixpence; I remember a bus conductor in Lincoln who was sent to jail for stealing a similarly small sum. If professional people in positions of trust or responsibility are guilty of stealing even small sums, they can find themselves stripped of their professional standing and even put behind bars. However, if the Bill is left unaltered, we will send out a message that such activities do not matter if less than &#163;500 is stolen. I strongly support the intentions of my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire in tabling amendment No. 34.

<P>

<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): I rise not because I claim any expertise in these matters&#151;especially as I did not take part in the Second Reading debate&#151;but because I seek clarification on a particular point. I mean no disrespect to my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire, but I do not believe that amendment No. 34 goes far enough. Having read the clause carefully, I support my hon. Friend's remarks about the absurdity of creating an offence applying only to the removal of any part of the company's property worth &#163;500 or more. However, amendment No. 34 seems even more absurd. If it were agreed to, the Bill would state merely that anybody
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>fraudulently removing any part of the company's property<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will be committing an offence. Of course such a person would be committing an offence, as any person who removes any part of any property does so.
<P>
I am sorry to introduce a note of division among Opposition Members in that respect. I am not sure whether the word ``tautological'' is correct for describing the measure as it would appear if amendment No. 34 were agreed to; ``completely obvious'' is another way of putting it. Introducing the proposal would be rather like saying that any man who murders his wife is guilty of an offence.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> My hon. Friend is making the same point as me. What is the need for paragraph 41(4), and especially for paragraph 41(4)(b)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who takes the words out of my mouth. I do not intend to delay the Committee on this point, but I should like clarification. Will the Minister consider not only amendment No. 34, which suggests the removal of the &#163;500 provision, but the removal of paragraph 41(4)(b), which seems a more logical course of action? We all know that it is an offence for anyone to remove the property of any company. As the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon pointed out, it is an offence under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 anyhow, so what is the point of including it in the Bill? We might as well remove the entire paragraph, whether or not the offence applies to thefts of &#163;500 or more. I do not wish to be disloyal to my hon. Friends and I ask the Minister to consider that notion later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> It might help the Minister&#151;I travel only in a spirit of co-operation and assistance&#151;if he told us that he would table an amendment on Report. Such an approach has been adopted throughout the Bill's passage, during which many suggestions have been taken from the other place. Will he guarantee that we will consider an amendment on Report with the clear message that the Government are firm supporters of law and order and do not believe that stealing amounts up to and including &#163;499.99 is legitimate? If he does, I shall be only too happy not to press amendment No. 34. If he cannot give such an assurance, I shall ask for your indulgence, Mrs. Michie, and seek to press it to a vote.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> It is wonderful how these elephant traps appear magically when the ground seems firm. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon asked about the rights to sue nominees and duty of care. As he knows, the nominees' functions are set out in the Bill. Paragraph 26 of schedule A1 contains a provision ensuring that the nominee's actions or decisions can be challenged by application to the court. The court can confirm, reverse or modify the nominee's acts or decisions and give him directions or make such other orders as it thinks fit. However, if someone believes that he has a cause for action against the nominee, he can pursue that action through the courts just as anyone else can. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
I turn to the vexed question of whether it is right to steal &#163;499.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> And 99p.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> We must not forget the 99p.
<P>
As the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said, the provision appears elsewhere in insolvency legislation, and it works well. It is supplementary to other general criminal offences of dishonesty, including, for example, as the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) said, theft.
<P>
If theft has taken place, the person involved can, as the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon suggested, be prosecuted for theft, no matter how small the amount involved may be. Several hon. Members asked why concealing or fraudulently removing part of the company's property worth less than &#163;500 should not constitute an offence. The two offences to which the limit will apply are specific offences that apply only in the event of insolvency&#151;in this case during the 12 months immediately before the moratorium commences and during the moratorium itself. If, however, misconduct that could amount to theft has taken place or another type of offence has been committed, that could be considered for prosecution as such and no minimum financial limit prescribed in the Bill would apply.
<P>
Similar offences exist elsewhere in the Insolvency Act 1986. For example, section 206 deals with offences in relation to companies that are wound up, and section 354 deals with bankruptcies. Both have a &#163;500 minimum limit. In addition, such offences have had a minimum limit from at least as far back as the Bankruptcy Act 1914, as the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said, when the limit was &#163;10.
<P>
If we discovered that we could not prosecute people for those two offences in cases in which we thought we should be able to do so, we would review the &#163;500 limit. Paragraph 10 of schedule 1 gives the Secretary of State the power to vary the minimum value of property for the purpose of those offences, and we would have no hesitation in reviewing that level if we felt it appropriate to do so. However, experience of sections 206 and 354 suggests that &#163;500 is the right cut-off point, and it therefore seems perfectly reasonable to assume that it would be appropriate in this case, too.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. As he will know, a considerable amount of legislation is in the parliamentary pipeline at the moment. For various reasons, good or otherwise, the amount of legislation has increased year on year over the years. We owe it to our constituents not to make new measures longer than they need to be. Although there may be precedents in previous legislation for specifying an amount, a matter of principle is involved. Surely we serve the interests of the people of our country best by removing from legislation unnecessary provisions? I ask him to consider the matter carefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> As a Scot, I hope that I am pronouncing your name correctly, Mrs. Michie, which none of our English colleagues seem to be able to do. [Interruption.] Our Welsh colleagues may be able to find the correct noise in their throats somewhere.
<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister's response. I am an ingenue in such matters and do not understand them at all, and I did not understand a word that the Minister said. Surely if an officer of a company or a nominee removes property from a company fraudulently, he commits an offence? The Minister seems to justify the provision by saying that he needs some means of being certain that such people can be prosecuted. But surely under the law as it stands, such people can be prosecuted legitimately, in the same way as a person who walks into Sainsbury's and picks up &#163;10-worth of goods can be prosecuted for shoplifting. I speak from a position of extreme ignorance on the subject, although that may be a good position for a Whip to speak from.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If someone fraudulently removes the goods of a company, surely he is already in breach of the law. Rather than doing what the Minister has said that it should do, which is to strengthen the law and his ability to prosecute people, the proposal will weaken the law. It suggests that some people who fraudulently remove goods from a company may not be prosecuted; that those modest little chaps who nick only &#163;200-worth of goods will get off, but that the big fellows who nick &#163;600-worth of goods will get busted.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I have misunderstood the position, but the Minister seems to be resting his case on an awkward situation whereby he needs certainty of the ability to prosecute successfully. Surely we already have that ability under the Theft Act 1968. What will the provision add to the state of the present law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> It is not often that a Committee has the chance to discuss an issue in principle. The Minister deployed the traditional defence of a precedent and an assertion of expediency. Will he tell us exactly what would be lost if the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire were accepted? The Minister should not think that, just because such a provision is already on the statute book in a similar form, it must be right. The whole purpose of a sovereign Parliament and discussing matters in Committee is to put right matters that were perhaps overlooked by our predecessors. I have yet to be persuaded by the Minister's argument that our predecessors were right when they passed such legislation.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am not a constitutional historian; I am an economic historian. I am grateful for the wisdom imparted by the hon. Member for Christchurch, but the current Insolvency Act 1986 covers analogous offences with a &#163;500 limit and it has been praised at previous sittings of the Committee. It has been said that the status quo should be examined carefully and that we should be conservative when attempting to tamper with it. However, the provisions of the Act were set in 1986 by the then Conservative Government. There was a great deal of wisdom around at that time. Clearly, the Act works very well. I rest my case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Minister justify why, when creating a new offence, a limit of &#163;500 is placed on it? That might be part and parcel of what is behind the Government's thinking. However, a financial limit being set on what is or what is not a theft seems bizarre to any normal individual. Theft is theft, and that is it.

<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I was sorry to hear those last remarks from the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon because, until then, the old Lab-new Lib coalition had been working well by concentrating on the basics of the Bill, which is about the responsibilities and duties of the nominees and how they will conduct insolvency proceedings. I did not go to public school, so the hon. Gentleman must forgive me when I say that the principle is de minimis non curat lex. That sentiment has been of great benefit to the food industry because it means that the law is not concerned with trifles&#151;which we make in Grimsby. The Conservatives are concerned, but we are straining at gnats. I hope that I can short-circuit that by withdrawing my amendment. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire can press his silly point separately, but I shall withdraw my amendment as I am happy with the explanation given by my hon. Friend the Minister.
<P>
Frankly, I want the duties and responsibilities of insolvency practitioners and nominees to be set out with the same precision as those of company directors in companies legislation. I was trying to couple the two, but that is clearly better pursued in the regulation of insolvency rather than in the Bill. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
