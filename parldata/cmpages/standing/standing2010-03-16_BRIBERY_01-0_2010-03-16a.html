Chair:</b> Before we begin, my co-Chair, Joan Walley, is sat
on my right and will remain as long as she wishes during this sitting,
but she will chair the Committee this afternoon. Before we begin our
formal business, may I make one or two preliminary announcements? Many
members of the Committee will have heard them before from other Chairs.
Members may, if they wish, remove their jackets during Committee
sittings. In future, if they wish to do so they do not have to look to
me to give permission. I am very happy that they should be as
comfortable as they want to be during our deliberations. Will all
Committee members please ensure that all electronic
devices&#151;mobile phones, pagers and so on&#151;are turned off or
switched to silent mode during Committee sittings? I should like, too,
to remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of
amendments. As a general rule, I and my fellow Chair do not intend to
call starred amendments, including any starred amendments that may be
reached during an afternoon sitting of the
Committee.</div><a name="10031672000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
will probably be the last Committee that I shall chair in my
parliamentary
career.</div><a name="10031672000012"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031672000398"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000399"></a>The
Chair:</b> Thank you very much. This Committee is one of the
first that my co-Chair is taking, and I have a sense that it will be a
very agreeable and constructive one. I am confident that members of the
Committee will not let me down on my initial instinct.</div>
<a name="10031672000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now move

without further ado, I ask the Under-Secretary to move the programme
motion.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div><a name="10031672000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome you, Sir Nicholas, to the Chair. I note that this may be your
last Committee before the impending general election. No doubt you will
face new and different challenges. I am sure that you and your
co-Chair, Mrs. Walley, will ensure that our proceedings are
conducted fairly and that we have proper scrutiny of this very
important Bill.</div>
<a name="10031672000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The programme
motion provides for up to eight sittings, which I trust hon. Members
will agree will prove more than adequate to ensure that the Bill is
properly scrutinised. Whether we will need all eight sittings remains,
of course, to be seen, but I look forward to a constructive debate. I
commend the programme motion to the
Committee.</div>
<a name="10031672000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031672000401"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): Good morning, Sir
Nicholas. May I join the Under-Secretary in saying how much we look
forward to serving under your chairmanship and, indeed, the
chairmanship of Mrs. Walley? I believe that this is her
first Committee, so I welcome her. I have served under your
chairmanship on many occasions, Sir Nicholas, and I have every
expectation that you will do as good a job on this Committee as you
have always done on previous occasions.</div>
<a name="10031672000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the time allocated is broadly correct, given the serious changes
to the law that the Bill involves and its dramatic implications for
British business. I have one further point on programming, Sir
Nicholas. Yesterday, my office received a number of e-mails and calls
from a variety of organisations that have been making serious and often
important contributions to issues associated with the Bill. However,
those organisations have a concern, which came back to me via a
national newspaper: that we should curtail these proceedings because a
number of today&#146;s amendments have previously been debated by
their Lordships in the other place.</div>
<a name="10031672000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
going to name those organisations, but they were lucky that I was out
of the office when they called yesterday. To talk about curtailing the
programming of this debate is to subvert the democratic process in an
unacceptable way. We have reviewed the debates in the other place and
have noted a number of issues on which such debate needs to continue.
It is unacceptable that so-called anti-corruption and pro-civil rights
organisations should suggest that we curtail democratic debate on an
issue of such importance to the anti-corruption movement and British
business. Shame on the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for
Cambridge, for his comments to the <i class="I">Financial Times </i>yesterday. He
said:</div><a name="10031672000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It&#146;s
very disappointing and disturbing to see these kinds of issues being
raised again...One suspects it&#146;s an attempt to prevent the
bill getting through in this parliament, which would be a disaster for
this country&#146;s
reputation.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like him to confirm and to address those comments, which I find
despicable and undemocratic.</div>
<a name="10031672000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">This House
and the upper House have every right to debate these issues, and we
intend to do that over the next two weeks. As I spelled out clearly in
my letter to the <i class="I">Financial Times </i>last week, we share the
frustration of those organisations and we have been calling for the
Bill to be brought forward for the past three years. Just because the
Government have left the Bill to the dying days of this Parliament,
that does not mean we are prepared to say that this Committee is
irrelevant. Those organisations, which I am not going to name today,
are warned to leave the programming of this Committee to
Parliament.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div><a name="10031672000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031672000402"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): May I say how sad I am, Sir
Nicholas, that this is your last Committee? It is also my last
Committee, unless some other Bill appears between now and Dissolution,
which I doubt. It has been a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
on all the Bills we have considered together. Your view of how a
Committee should progress, to ensure that the issues are debated
properly but promptly, is a model of how a Committee should be chaired
in this House. I hope that your successor in the House, and
mine, have an opportunity to learn those
lessons.</div><a name="10031672000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am content with the programme motion, although I agree with the
Under-Secretary that we should not need all the time put down for our
deliberations. I am also content with the order of consideration that
she proposes. Our one major concern is with clause 13, which exempts
from the scope of the offence certain public officials: members of the
defence forces and intelligence services. We will require some time to
discuss that.</div>
<a name="10031672000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues
associated with the Bill have been discussed extensively, not just in
the other place but in the Joint Committee that considered the
drafting. There have been numerous consultation exercises involving
august bodies such as the Law Commission, and not just the
non-governmental organisations to which the hon. Member for Huntingdon
referred. It would be unfortunate if our debates were simple
repetitions. I am perfectly happy to discuss new and important points
as they arise, but I think the hon. Gentleman doth protest too much.
The issue he raises will be judged by the Committee, and by those
outside, by what he does, not just by what he says
now.</div>
<a name="10031672000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031672000403"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Oliver Heald</b> (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con): I did not
want to lose this opportunity to say how much I have enjoyed being
chaired by you over the years, Sir Nicholas, and making
contributions in debates with you over such a long time. It will be
rather nice to be on your Committee swan-song. I certainly look forward
to you chairing it with your usual aplomb.</div>
<a name="10031672000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the
hon. Member for Cambridge, he and I were spokesmen on constitutional
affairs for a period and battled away against the Government&#146;s
ideas on legislative and regulatory reform, quite successfully in the
end. He will be missed, but I do not think we will feel too sorry for
him because he is going back to be a reader at Cambridge university by
the gently lapping waters of the Cam. That is no doubt a pleasant life
in its own
way.</div><a name="10031672000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two issues that concern me. The first is this modern idea that it
is always better to find a new word to describe what the public,
lawyers and all of us have understood as being the crime. There are not
many people who do not know what bribery and corruption are. As far as
I am aware, the public have never had any difficulty in recognising a
corrupt act or an act of bribery&#151;a backhander in ordinary
parlance.</div>
<a name="10031672000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally, when
it comes to our forces trying to civilise an area after a conflict, it
is useful if they can have money available for good
purposes.</div><a name="10031672000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000404"></a>The
Chair:</b> Order. I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman
as he is always so agreeable, but he is going slightly wide of the
matter we are debating. If he can relate his remarks to the programme
motion I shall be happy for him to continue, but I suspect he wants to
bring his remarks to an end.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div><a name="10031672000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000405"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I just wanted to make the point&#151;I was
setting it in context and, as ever, at perhaps at too great a
length&#151;that I hope we have sufficient time to discuss these two
important issues. It seems part of a trend to start calling a shovel
something else, and our forces need a certain amount of discretion in
how they use funds when they are trying to civilise a difficult
situation after a conflict. Those were the two issues I wanted to be
sure we had time
for.</div><a name="10031672000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000406"></a>The
Chair:</b> I am sure the Committee and both Chairs will commit
time to ensuring that both those matters can be debated. If there are
no further contributions on the programme motion, I will put the
question.</div><a name="10031672000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000410"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The grouping of so many amendments means that a
large number of issues will be debated together. These can be split
into two broad strands: clauses 1 to 3, and clause 6. Given that many
of the concepts we will discuss are interlinked, I can understand why
they were put together in this grouping. Clauses 1 to 3 are in many
ways the core of the Bill. These probing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>amendments question the founding premise of how the law is being changed
from the 19th-century concept that currently
prevails.</div><a name="10031672000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will begin by explaining the rationale for amendment 1. The
Bill has a core of four offences: to promise or offer a bribe; to
request or agree to receive or accept a bribe; a new and bespoke
offence of bribing a foreign public official in order &#147;to obtain
or retain&#148; a business advantage; and failure by a commercial
organisation to prevent bribery. That quartet of offences goes
significantly further than previous legislation. On the one hand, it
codifies the previous common-law offences, and on the other it
supplements them with new offences that seek to deal with the threat of
bribery to the increasingly globalised business world. They are all
serious offences, and the penalties attached to them have been
increased to reflect that. The current maximum penalty of seven years
will be increased to 10 years for an individual, while a commercial
organisation convicted on indictment of an offence under the Bill will
be liable to an unlimited
fine.</div><a name="10031672000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all wish to ensure that the offences are applied in a proportionate and
easily comprehensible fashion to make certain that the threshold for
criminality is defined with clarity and common understanding. It also
needs to be made certain that, by introducing new terminology to this
area of the law, the Government will not force us to undertake a
further redrafting exercise down the
line.</div><a name="10031672000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
1 defines the offence of bribery as it applies to the person
who</div>
<a name="10031672000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;offers,
promises or gives a financial or other advantage to another
person&#148;,</div><a name="10031672000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
it sets out two specific examples of behaviour. The first relates to
cases in which the advantage is intended to bring about an improper
performance by another person of a relevant function or activity, or to
reward such improper performance. The second relates to cases in which
a person knows or believes that the acceptance of the advantage
offered, promised or given constitutes in itself the improper
performance of a function or activity, as further defined in clause
3.</div><a name="10031672000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
2 defines the offence of bribery as it applies to the recipient or
potential recipient of the bribe, and distinguishes four separate
instances. Cases 3, 4 and 5 require that the individual</div>
<a name="10031672000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;requests,
agrees to receive or
accepts&#148;</div><a name="10031672000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">an
advantage. It does not matter whether he actually receives it, but the
requirement must be linked to the improper performance of a relevant
function or activity by the individual, or someone else, receiving the
benefit. Case 6 requires improper performance by an individual or
another person where the individual in question requests it, assents to
it, or acquiesces in it in anticipation or in consequence of a request,
agreement to receive, or acceptance of an

6 creates a separate offence of bribery of a foreign public official.
Unlike the aforementioned clauses, clause 6 covers only the offering,
promising or giving of bribes, and not the acceptance of them. The
person giving the bribe must intend to influence the recipient in the
performance of his functions as a public official, and must intend to
obtain or retain business, or a business advantage.</div>

7 creates an offence of failure of a commercial organisation to prevent
bribery. The offence will occur when a person associated with a
commercial organisation bribes another person with the intention of
obtaining or retaining business for, or an advantage in the conduct of
the business of, the commercial organisation. The clause provides for a
defence where the commercial organisation can show that it had adequate
procedures in place to prevent such associated persons from committing
bribery
offences.</div><a name="10031672000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
overview is necessary because, when considering the amendments, it is
important for members of the Committee to have at the forefront of
their minds the breadth of the new offences. The debate in the other
place on our proposed amendments was extensive but inconclusive. Much
is owed to the noble and learned Lord Lyell, a distinguished former
Attorney-General, for the comprehensives of his speeches on the issue.
Through my following arguments, I am looking to move the debate on from
the point reached in the other
place.</div><a name="10031672000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendments are designed to initiate debate and consideration of the
criminality threshold required for the new offences under the Bill. The
Government&#146;s response in the other place lacked, to my mind,
absolute persuasiveness, so I tabled the amendments to elicit from the
Under-Secretary a refinement to the justification for the use of
&#147;impropriety&#148; over &#147;corruption&#148;.
&#147;Russell on Crime&#148;, a leading text on the criminal law,
defines bribery
as</div><a name="10031672000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
receiving or offering of any undue reward by or to any person
whatsoever, in a public office, in order to influence his behaviour in
office, and incline him to act contrary to the known rules of honesty
and
integrity&#148;.</div><a name="10031672000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
&#147;Compact Oxford English Dictionary&#148; defines &#147;to
bribe&#148; as
to</div><a name="10031672000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;dishonestly
persuade (someone) to act in one&#146;s favour by paying them or
giving other
inducement.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the draft Bill received from the Law Commission and the Bill we have
now use merely the concept of impropriety as the benchmark for the
offences.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000411"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> My concern is that without the words that my hon.
Friend is proposing, which import the idea of corrupt intent, we are
left with the rather vague terms of &#147;improper&#148; or
&#147;impropriety&#148;. I looked in a dictionary and
&#147;improper&#148; means indecent, irregular or incorrect,
whereas &#147;impropriety&#148; means unsuitable or slightly
improper behaviour. Given how seriously we have always viewed
corruption and bribery, to have words with such weak connotations risks
widening out the category so that all manner of civil wrongs are
potentially included; however, they do not get to the nub of the
criminal behaviour that people have traditionally associated with
bribery and
corruption.</div><a name="10031672000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000412"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a very important point,
which I shall come to. What he says is important not only in itself,
but in terms of the practical application. One of the reasons why it is
so important to continue the debate on this issue is that, although the
Joint Committee examined the law relating to it in great detail, as we
pointed out in our report, we did not have time to look at how that law
should be applied. I have tabled new clauses, and amendments to later
clauses, that give specific instances that will enable us to examine
the problems of criminality that my hon. Friend has rightly
mentioned.</div>

was saying that I agree with my hon. Friend that one of the
difficulties with &#147;improper&#148; is that it brings civil
cases within the remit. Is it not also nonsense that, as I understand
from the Joint Committee, for &#147;improper&#148; to have a proper
place in the legislation we will need a whole lot of guidance to
explain it?</div>
<a name="10031672000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000416"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a very important point on a
matter that the Joint Committee reviewed, and it agreed with his
position. We will be debating the vital need for guidance&#151;the
need to explain to companies not just the law, but how it will be
applied in practice. That will be a key issue, and we will return to it
in later debates.</div>
<a name="10031672000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031672000417"></a><b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): It is also right that
we recognise that, whether or not impropriety is the right measure of
behaviour here, it describes the behaviour of the person receiving the
bribe, and my hon. Friend&#146;s amendments rightly consider whether
we should qualify the behaviour of the person giving the
bribe.</div><a name="10031672000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000418"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Yes&#151;my hon. Friend makes a good point. To
some minds, inherent in the offence of bribery, as clearly indicated by
the definitions my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire
read out earlier, is an element of criminality greater than
impropriety. That issue was debated at some length in the other place,
and we can review it in this House. A constituent element of such
actions must be that they are committed in a manner that is dishonest
and/or corrupt. Much evidence was heard before the Joint Committee and
in the other place showing that the concept of corruption in current
law is in disarray and that the case law is conflicting.</div>
<a name="10031672000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such case law
spans more than 150 years, with the earliest decision being in Cooper
<i class="I">v.</i> Slade in 1858 right through to the 1999 case of the Crown
<i class="I">v.</i> Harvey, and reflects the fact that the concepts required to
establish the criminality involved in corruption offences are much more
complex and consequently more difficult to express than those in, say,
an assault case. Yet I suspect that the layman would consider that
lawyers were splitting hairs over terminology and syntax, and that
underpinning all such activities is an element of dishonesty that will
be self-evident when present in a case in a court of law.</div>
<a name="10031672000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Judicial
interpretation has defined &#147;corrupt&#148; in the following
ways. In Cooper <i class="I">v. </i>Slade, which concerned bribery at elections,
&#147;corruptly&#148; did not mean dishonestly
but</div><a name="10031672000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;purposely
doing an act which the law forbids as tending to corrupt
voters&#148;.</div><a name="10031672000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Bradford election case in 1869&#151;it is surprising that all
these bribery cases seem to concern elections&#151;it was held that
&#147;corruptly&#148; was not otiose and had to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>given some meaning that was akin to an evil mind. In the Lindley case of
1957, which concerned bribery of company employees,
&#147;corruptly&#148; was held to mean</div>
<a name="10031672000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to weaken the
loyalty of the servants to their master and to transfer that loyalty
from the master to the
giver&#148;.</div><a name="10031672000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000419"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Is not the case law the hon. Gentleman refers to
exactly that which makes it clear that the word
&#147;corruptly&#148; should not be put on to the statute
book?</div><a name="10031672000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000420"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Arguably, the answer is no. I think it fair to
review how the word &#147;corruptly&#148; developed to see what the
existing law is and to decide whether we should change it. If the hon.
Gentleman disagrees I shall be pleased to take another
intervention.</div><a name="10031672000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000421"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> But surely the word &#147;corrupt&#148; is the
proper term to be used. The cases show that on some occasions, courts
have decided there is an element of dishonesty and corruption; on
others, they have decided that it is more an act of unfaithfulness.
However, it is clear from all the research that &#147;corrupt&#148;
is a term that people understand. It can have one connotation in some
instances, and another in others, but &#147;corrupt&#148; is a
British word that is understood by British
people.</div><a name="10031672000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000422"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a fair point, which we will
look at in a bit more detail. He mentioned that others have different
views of the word &#147;corrupt&#148;. The other place did not look
at that issue, but I have and I will examine how other countries have
dealt with it.</div>
<a name="10031672000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
Calland case of 1967, &#147;corruptly&#148;
meant</div><a name="10031672000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;dishonestly

that</div>

the Wellburn case of 1979,</div>
<a name="10031672000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Court of
Appeal again approved the words of Willes J, taking the view that
&#145;corruptly&#146; was an &#145;ordinary word&#146;, the
meaning of which would cause a jury little
difficulty.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

Hertfordshire just
made.</div>

am</div><a name="10031672000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">None
of those cases deviates significantly from the idea that there is a
core element of criminality that is greater than mere impropriety.
However, they appear to show that there is a standard definition of
corruption that would also be testing. I respectfully echo Lord
Lyell&#146;s assertion that juries understand well&#151;I think
that this is the assertion made by my hon. Friend&#151;what is meant
by &#147;dishonesty&#148; and by &#147;corrupt&#148; and
that,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>regardless of the wording of the Bill, they will be reluctant to convict
an individual unless they are satisfied that the underlying conduct was
dishonest or corrupt.</div>
<a name="10031672000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fear, though, is that we may, with the proposed test of
&#147;impropriety&#148; in the Bill, have pushed the boundaries of
the offence too wide and at the same time provided no more clarity for
juries than the current law does. I strongly support the view of Lord
Lyell when he stated
that</div><a name="10031672000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provided
the prosecution can marshal and present the basic facts, the dishonesty
or corruption of the conduct usually sticks out like a sore
thumb.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i>

1102.]</div><a name="10031672000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Bill is enacted and first falls on to the desk of practitioners
outside the walls of this place, their primary source of statutory
interpretation will be the natural and ordinary meaning of the words
that we, in Parliament, have chosen to include in the Bill. The words
were are considering here are principally &#147;corruption&#148;
and &#147;improper&#148; or &#147;impropriety&#148;. I trust
that hon. Members will agree that, to determine the ordinary meaning of
those words, &#147;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&#148; is as
appropriate a source as any. The word &#147;corruption&#148; in the
area of criminality when viewed as a verb gives us the
definition</div><a name="10031672000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
induce to act dishonestly or unfaithfully...to
bribe.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we compare that with the definition of &#147;improper&#148; from

the two concepts is significant. &#147;Improper&#148;, as defined
in the &#147;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&#148;, has three

of the word &#147;improper&#148; as defined by the dictionary, why
does he not take up the meaning of the word &#147;improper&#148; as
defined by clauses 4 and 5? It is not a problem that we have to refer
to the dictionary, when it is in the
Bill.</div><a name="10031672000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000424"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> As I said, the interpretation of the Bill will
be dependent on previous case law and what juries have done in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000425"></a>Mr.

<a name="10031672000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is performed

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000426"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend has nailed the point as well as I
ever could. Back to the definition in the &#147;Shorter Oxford
English Dictionary&#148;, which, given my hon. Friend&#146;s
intervention, may actually be something that people will want to look
at. It has three
meanings:</div><a name="10031672000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;incorrect,
inaccurate, irregular, wrong...unsuitable,
inappropriate&#148;</div><a name="10031672000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="10031672000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unbecoming,
unseemly,
indecorous.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
simple comparison of the plain English meaning of the two words shows,
therefore, a very broad gap between the two groups of behaviour that
would be caught by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>the different constructions. As it stands&#151;it is important that we
understand this&#151;we could be criminalising behaviour that may
simply be unbecoming or unseemly, the so-called sharp practice that the
judgment in Calland specifically distinguished from dishonesty. I
suggest to hon. Members that such behaviour may, in certain
circumstances, be a far cry from what a lot of people currently
understand to be bribery. On the other hand, to cite Lord Lyell, the
Law Commission reports that the meaning of &#147;corrupt&#148; is
understood by 95 per cent. of the population. Jurors are quick to see
the backhander and are quite ready to convict. Has the Minister had the
opportunity to read the letter to the Committee from the Director of
Public Prosecutions, which was referred to by Lord Lyell? It states
that in the last 15 years, the concept of corruption has not caused
jurors a problem, yet in at least 10 of those years, bribery has been a
major concern for the
DPP.</div><a name="10031672000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to my previous comments on the differences in judicial interpretation
of the term &#147;corruption&#148; in reported case law, it is a
matter of concern that we are in danger of perpetuating in the Bill an
academic legal point that in reality does not cause jurors any problems
or hinder prosecutions. The Earl of Onslow concisely summarised the
basis of jurors&#146; ease with the terminology when discussing
facilitation fees in the other place. He said
that</div><a name="10031672000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
is an area which slides. You know it when it is there, but it is very
difficult to define a boundary.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,

GC32.]</div><a name="10031672000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question is whether the concept of impropriety, as currently drafted,
significantly detracts from the inherent understanding of what bribery

are probing amendments. I do not seek to do away with the test that was
so ably drafted by our parliamentary draftsmen, or to undermine the
work of the Law Commission, which needs be recognised because it did a
magnificent job. Instead, I hope that hon. Members will see this debate
as a way to strengthen the offences under the Bill and to provide
workable legislation by giving the Minister the chance to offer added
clarity and practicality in relation to the use of the word
&#147;improper&#148;. I have explained to some extent that that
word has not yet been explained to the desired
degree.</div><a name="10031672000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Lyell touched, both in the House of Lords Grand Committee debate and on
Report in the other place, on the legal position on criminalising
bribery in other common law jurisdictions in the world. The issue,
however, was not addressed to any great extent in the other place, so I
would like to explore it in more detail. I am thankful for the minutes
of evidence provided to the Joint Committee on the original Corruption
Bill in 2003. Having reviewed the <i class="I">Hansard</i> record of the debates
in the other place, I do not think that sufficient consideration was
given to the issue in the Government&#146;s response. By giving such
consideration, I hope that we will be able to demonstrate the fact
that, in legal systems that are directly aligned with our own, a need
for dishonesty or corruption was thought crucial. The Government
asserted in the other place that the concept of acting corruptly
is</div> <a name="10031672000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
vague and unhelpful construct that has spawned a number of different

a Commonwealth public official to receive a bribe or corrupting
benefit. Under sections 141.1(1) and 142.1(1), a person is guilty of an

benefit to be provided, or</div>

the offence relates to public officials. Section 119(1)(a) of the
Canadian criminal code makes it an offence for a holder of a judicial

corruptly accepts, obtains, agrees to accept, or attempts to obtain any
benefit for himself or herself or another person in respect of anything
done or omitted to be done by him or her in his or her official
capacity. Section 119(1)(b) of that code makes it an offence for a
person to bribe a holder of judicial office, or a Member of Parliament

a person corruptly gives or offers any benefit in respect of anything

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000427"></a>John
Howell:</b> My hon. Friend has, for obvious reasons, cited
three English law jurisdictions, but is not the problem with the Bill
that one of its major influences is the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, a body that deals not just with English
law jurisdiction but a whole range of jurisdictions, including some
that have sui generis types of legal establishments? Therefore, we are
seeing an attempt to compromise between a whole number of different
legal systems, some of which take a radically different and
incompatible line with English
law.</div><a name="10031672000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000428"></a>Mr.

would pick him up on one thing: I would not say that the Australian or
Canadian systems were subject to English jurisdiction. He probably
meant to say English common law practice. On that, he would be
absolutely
right.</div><a name="10031672000105"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000431"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that important
clarification. On the OECD and his broader argument, he makes a fair
point. The OECD came out with a set of constructs that we bought into
by treaty, with which the Conservative party agreed. We have spent the
past year, since the signing of that treaty, calling on the Government
to bring forward this Bill, in order not least to comply with our
international obligations, which we have not done recently. That it is
now being brought forward is welcome.</div>
<a name="10031672000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend is right that ultimately the construct of the OECD formula is
not going to tie in with every national route towards dealing with
bribery. To some extent, that means there is give and take. There are
problem areas&#151;not least in relation to the role of the
Attorney-General&#151;where some very English concepts have stood the
test of time, and we will reach an important debate on them later. To
answer his question specifically, yes, there will be areas where we
will want to pick up on our position regarding the OECD and where we
feel that a compromise has not yet been reached in the right
manner.</div><a name="10031672000371"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15

get back to the subject of foreign jurisdictions, will the Minister
clarify why the UK proposes to put on the statute book a criminal
offence that, in its current form, has no requirement for a guilty
mind? As every undergraduate law student can recount, a core premise of
English criminal law is the requirement for both mens rea and actus
reus. Although I accept that there are crimes that are strict
liability, we need clarification of why we require a law that will make
someone a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>criminal without a guilty mind? Might there be a danger that we will
misguidedly alter that basic tenet of English law in an attempt to dumb
down the law to help jurors? More than that, will we make things easier
in reality by using the concept of improper conduct? I will be
interested to hear why the Minister believes that the concept of
impropriety is any less complex for the average lay juror than
corruption.</div>

the offence of corruption implies&#151;it is a different level of
offence.</div><a name="10031672000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to address some of the responses that the Government offered
when they opposed such amendments in the other place. Their objections
may be summarised as having two distinct veins: first, that
prosecutorial discretion will serve to mitigate any disproportionality
that arises as a consequence of the breadth of the new requirement of
impropriety to criminalise acts that would previously not have been an
offence; and, secondly, that the concept of &#147;corrupt&#148; is
more complex and vague than impropriety.</div>
<a name="10031672000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall begin
a review of proportionality with a consideration of the example cited
by Lord Lyell on Second Reading and Report in the other place, which
was supported by Lord Williamson in Grand Committee. I would struggle
to provide a better or more concise example of the problem so, if you
will permit, Sir Nicholas, I will quote directly from <i class="I">Hansard</i>.
Lord Lyell
said:</div><a name="10031672000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
hypothetical example that I give is of someone who has bought an
aeroplane ticket. He arrives at the gate and is asked for a bribe in
order to get his boarding pass. He is absolutely entitled to get the
pass&#151;he has paid for it and would expect to get it as a matter
of course&#151;but he finds that he cannot get on to the aircraft
without handing over a bribe. He has a choice. He can say to the chap
who is demanding the bribe, &#145;This is utterly wrong. You
shouldn&#146;t do it. If you won't let me on to the aircraft I shall
go and report you at once&#146;, or he can pay over the money
demanded, get on to the aircraft and, one hopes, report the person when
he lands, or perhaps even report the person to the cabin
crew.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
noble Lord went on to highlight the problem that such an individual
would face under the
Bill:</div><a name="10031672000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
difficulty is that under the Bill as drafted the offence is committed
by the payer of the bribe&#151;the person from whom the bribe has
been wrongly and corruptly demanded by the official standing at the
boarding gate. Simply by handing over the money, he is giving the
bribe. Of course, it would depend on the detailed facts of a case but I
think that, if the Bill were drafted so as to require a guilty mind, a
jury would be very reluctant to convict someone in those circumstances.
On the wording of the statute the jury would be obliged to convict,
although it may be reluctant to do so as juries do not like a sense of
injustice in any event...The person&#146;s
protection&#151;this is how the Government have put it so
far&#151;lies in the sensible discretion of the prosecutor not to
prosecute in those circumstances as there would be strong
mitigation.&#148; &#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 2

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000439"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> To be honest I do not know. My hon. Friend the
Member for Poole did not go into the circumstances in that amount of
detail. That might or might not
apply.</div><a name="10031672000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not condone such behaviour; I am simply giving a statement of fact.
My concern is that the Bill could criminalise individuals who are at
the mercy of such petty tyrants across the globe in one broad stroke.
There are a multitude of situations that one can imagine in which such
actions may occur without the &#147;corrupt&#148; element of the
offence that is currently required by law, but changing the test to
impropriety would see such individuals liable to
imprisonment.</div><a name="10031672000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s position, as stated in the other place, is that
these situations can safely be left to the prosecutor and that
proportionality will win through. I have considerable respect for
prosecutors, but I am reluctant to allow Parliament to wash its hands
of this issue and to leave it to the prosecutors alone, not least
because not only does that leave the law open to differing
applications, but it unnecessarily increases prosecutors&#146; work
load.</div>
<a name="10031672000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
aims of this Bill is to provide certainty but, as it stands, the idea
of prosecutorial discretion on which the Government rely to counter
arguments that impropriety represents an unworkable test flies in the
face of that. The difficulty for businesses is obvious. It cannot be
correct that businesses instruct employees that a certain course of
action, although theoretically falling foul of the legislation, may
nevertheless proceed because prosecution is unlikely.</div>
<a name="10031672000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
ambiguity and uncertainty will inevitably lead to problems as a
two-tier system develops involving actions that will be caught and
prosecuted, and acts that individually are too small to be prosecuted.
When taken collectively, the attitude that bribes are acceptable, as
long as they are below a certain de minimis level, could be corrosive
to the very foundations of the Bill and one of its central
aims.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div><a name="10031672000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">To avoid that
situation, the Government face two options: first to accept that an
inherent element of the offence must be corruption rather than
impropriety, thus ensuring that the mens rea element of a guilty mind
is central to the offence; or, secondly, to go for the American and, I
believe, OECD-approved route and provide for a specific exclusion for
so-called facilitation payments in the Bill. This is not the last that
the Committee will hear from us on facilitation payments, but for now I
wish to move on and consider one further difficulty with the
Government&#146;s
position.</div><a name="10031672000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
inherent problem with prosecuting offences of bribery and corruption is
not that juries are reluctant to convict or incapable of understanding
the offence, but that the activities that give rise to these cases
happen in the shadows, and the great difficulty is getting the evidence
in the first place. It is sometimes forgotten that there are two
requirements before one can prosecute in any case: sufficient evidence
to give rise to a realistic prospect of conviction before a jury; and
that it is in the public interest to prosecute, which will depend on a
large number of factors but might relate to the trivial nature of the
offence or the person committing the offence.</div>
<a name="10031672000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tipping
someone to do something slightly out of the ordinary, such as having a
doorman hail a cab in the rain while one waits inside, might be
improper behaviour, but do we really wish to criminalise such activity?
The argument goes that if the word &#147;corruptly&#148; was
inserted, such behaviour would not be a criminal offence. That was
noted in the other place, where it was said that the behaviour of a
person</div><a name="10031672000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;who
gives a tenner just to get personal advantage is not attractive. It is
rather improper: I would not like to be seen doing it. But is it the
offence of corruption? Is that what we are dealing with here? That
needs to be clear in the Bill and not simply left to prosecutorial
discretion.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords, </i>7
January 2010; Vol. 716, c.
GC26.]</div><a name="10031672000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the Government&#146;s reliance on prosecutorial
discretion plays a role at the public interest stage, but it skews the
consideration of whether an act is a crime, which is more fundamental
than any issue of proportionality. We must not forget that the Joint
Committee was presented with evidence that prosecutions fail not as a
result of confusion over the law, but because of a failure to meet the
first limb of the test&#151;because of a lack of evidence. In its
evidence to the Joint Committee, the law firm Herbert Smith succinctly
summarised the problem by
saying:</div><a name="10031672000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
fail to see why public policy should require that an
individual&#146;s actions be criminalised and for the individual then
to rely on a prosecutor's discretion, on whether with hindsight, the
public interest requires a
prosecution.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Second Reading and in the other place, the Government rightly relied
heavily on the Joint Committee&#146;s report. However, I would be
interested to hear from the Minister why they have been selective and
ignored the recommendation in paragraph 36 of that report, which
states:</div><a name="10031672000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
do, however, acknowledge the concern that conduct which ought to be
viewed as a civil wrong may, in future, be criminalised. The limited
time for completing our inquiry has prevented us from exploring
possible solutions to this problem, although we note the potential for
developing an effective &#145;avoidance of doubt&#146; provision.
The Government must address this issue before
introducing  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>the Bill into Parliament in order to minimise the need for reliance on
prosecutorial discretion and maximise certainty for all those who will
be asked to comply with, and enforce, the new
law.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister please explain the Government&#146;s decision to rely so
heavily on prosecutorial discretion in the context of concerns that the
concept of impropriety allows for so-called offence creep, and given
that the Joint Committee was so emphatic about its concerns and the
need for an alternative? Why have the Government not produced an
alternative in the
Bill?</div><a name="10031672000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall now directly address the Government&#146;s argument that the
concept of corruption is too complex and vague for juries to understand
or apply. I have touched on that at various points in my remarks, but I
would like to add two further points that are central to the
Government&#146;s consideration of the issue. In the other place,
Lord Bach stated that the Government argued that the concept of acting
corruptly</div><a name="10031672000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has
proved to be a vague and inherently difficult concept. Courts have
expressed differing opinions on whether it involves dishonesty or
&#145;doing an act which the law forbids as tending to
corrupt&#146;.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,
</i>7 January 2010; Vol. 716, c.
GC34.]</div><a name="10031672000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the evidence from the Director of Public Prosecutions, and from many of
those who have held positions as Law Officers over the past three
decades in the other place, suggests that no prosecution has failed and
no conviction has been quashed on the basis of whether dishonesty ought
to be included. The Government have relied heavily on the Law
Commission&#146;s report to justify a change to a test of
impropriety, but I found no evidence in that report that the definition
of corruption was ever a practical problem for prosecutors or jurors. I
would be interested to hear whether the Minister has any empirical
evidence that did not make it into the Law Commission&#146;s
report.</div><a name="10031672000372"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="10031672000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the Government have suggested that jurors find the concept of
corruption, which has been in the current bribery law&#151;in common
law and in statute&#151;for over a century, too difficult to fathom
and to apply to the facts of a given case. I find that view of the
deductive power of jurors somewhat confusing and contradictory,
especially when the Government, through Lord Bach in the other place,
have
stated:</div><a name="10031672000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Juries
are perfectly capable of dealing with concepts such as &#145;good
faith&#146;, &#145;impartiality&#146; and &#145;position of
trust&#146; when considering them in the context of a particular
case, so these terms do not require
definition&#148;.</div><a name="10031672000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister explain how those terms differ from, or are easier for a
jury to interpret than, the word
&#147;corruption&#148;?</div><a name="10031672000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been responding to some of the Government&#146;s prior arguments
against such amendments, but I shall leave the last word to Lord Lyell,
whose erudite and diligent work in the other place has provided such a
solid bedrock for much of my work on this issue. He
said:</div><a name="10031672000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is often said in academic discussions and by the Law Commission, for
which I have great respect, that there have been inconsistent decisions
on this. I have looked at all the cases and think that that is rather
overstated. The DPP has told us in writing that this has caused no
practical problems in the past 15 years and I believe that
has been so for much longer. The Minister has explained that it is all
down to prosecutorial discretion. My point, which I will not press now,
is that that is not good enough. This is a serious
offence.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 2
February 2010; Vol. 717, c. 121-123.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div><a name="10031672000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have spoken
at some length on this issue. I am grateful to you, Sir Nicholas, and
to the members of the Committee for hearing me out on a serious issue
that is core to the essence of the Bill. I hope not only that I have
been comprehensive, but that I have encouraged the Minister to look a
little bit harder at the issue. The word &#147;corruption&#148; has
been much debated in academic legal circles, but it has been a
requirement in common law and all forms of this offence to date. There
is no evidence to suggest that the concept causes jurors any particular
difficulty. In fact, the DPP has written to confirm that no case has
failed in the past 15 years as a result of confusion over the
concept.</div>
<a name="10031672000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard
from the Government in previous debates about this issue that the
problems that we have outlined are not problems, because the consensus
decision of the Law Commission and the Joint Committee&#151;on which
I hasten to add I was proud to serve&#151;upheld the idea of
impropriety. However, the Joint Committee was extremely pushed for time
and failed to consider the Bill as fully as it would have liked. Even
in that tight time frame, however, we managed to express concerns that
impropriety was so broad a concept that it captured tortious wrongs and
criminalised actions that would not previously have been considered as
bribery. The Joint Committee warned against that situation when it
said:</div><a name="10031672000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government must address this issue before introducing the Bill in
Parliament in order to minimise the need for reliance on prosecutorial
discretion and maximise certainty for all those who will be asked to
comply with, and enforce, the new
law&#148;.</div><a name="10031672000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister explain why so much store has been put on the Joint
Committee&#146;s support for &#147;impropriety&#148;, when its
advice, which appeared as I have just cited, has been overlooked?
Furthermore, it would seem as though corruption or dishonesty is a
requirement for such an offence in every common law jurisdiction in the
world, with the possible exception of the federal law in one state of
Australia&#151;Victoria. Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand
and the United States, however, have the &#147;guilty mind&#148;
element. Will the Minister justify how it can be appropriate to buck
that trend when unifying international standards on bribery is central
to the Bill&#146;s
rationale?</div><a name="10031672000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will now move on to clause 6 and the offence of bribing a foreign
public official. The aim of amendments 7 to 10, which are
probing amendments, is to focus on the intention of a paying person, P,
and the nature of the payment as a criminalising aspect of the offence,
and by so doing to consider that it might be easier to retain the
concept of proportionality in prosecutions. Further, that could provide
a clear benchmark against which an individual can judge their behaviour
in foreign lands. I have used a number of differing terminologies to
convey what I hope is the same point in a manner that avoids the
problems already discussed on the use of &#147;corrupt&#148; or
&#147;improper&#148;. In effect, I suggest that if the use of the
word &#147;corrupt&#148; is not acceptable for clauses 1 to 3 then,
as an alternative, consistency should be applied by including the word
&#147;improper&#148; in clause
6.</div><a name="10031672000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
6 turns on the question raised by subsection (3)(b). Whether
a payment by person P to foreign official F constitutes a bribe will
depend on whether F was permitted or required by written
law&#151;the written  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>law of the country in which the bribe takes place&#151;to accept a
payment. There is no question of what motivated P or what his intention
was, beyond securing himself a business advantage. The amendments would
change the clause so that the offence was applicable when a bribe of
improper financial or other advantage was intended corruptly to
influence a foreign public official to obtain an undue business
advantage. As it stands, the intention of P, the payer of the alleged
bribe, does not matter, but our amendments suggest that it ought to
matter.</div><a name="10031672000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concern is that it is not enough to say that all that P must have
intended was to secure some business or business advantage, and that
whether he is guilty of bribery rests on the interpretation of local
written law. No question is asked about whether P was acting
improperly, but merely whether the recipient official went against what
was permitted or required by written law. The Government have put
forward the principle that P&#146;s ignorance of the local law should
not be a defence. However, will it always be possible to say whether a
local law was broken? In essence, the amendment would circumvent much
of the ongoing debate on issues such as facilitation payments, the
knowledge of foreign laws and the possibility that a written provision
simply might not exist in the jurisdiction to cover the custom or
practice.</div><a name="10031672000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yesterday,
the CBI sent a briefing on the Bill stating that the wording of the
clause 6
offence</div><a name="10031672000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;omits
the notion of corruption, dishonesty or impropriety. This should be
required as part of the new offence. Failure to do so would mean that
criminal liability would arise even in circumstances where the activity
is on any view perfectly proper. It cannot be fair to criminalise
honest company behaviour. A response that relies on prosecutorial
discretion under the current wording of Clause 6 would not, we believe,
be enough to address this particular
shortcoming.</div><a name="10031672000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">This
has two key implications. Firstly, businesses either have to commit to
no promotional expenditure, which is clearly unsustainable, or openly
condone criminal acts by their staff on the basis that they probably
will not be prosecuted, which is also unsustainable. Secondly, any
proper promotional expenditure would, irrespective of prosecutorial
discretion under the Bribery Bill, be a breach of s328 of the Proceeds
of Crime Act unless companies obtain consent to make each payment from
the Serious Organised Crime Agency. This is plainly
unworkable.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000440"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> The British Broadcasting Corporation and many other
public corporations have many people abroad. There are occasions in the
third world when some kind of payment has to be made to unblock things.
Would the director-general or the head of news be prosecuted in such
circumstances? Have we received any information from journalists from
the BBC, ITN or other organisations who, when abroad, might
occasionally make payments to secure a particular
objective?</div><a name="10031672000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000441"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I have not been advised of any such situations,
but one hears stories about what happens on the ground from business
and media people. Facilitation payments, which are usually small
sums&#151;let us call it grease money&#151;can be handed over to
make something happen.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div><a name="10031672000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000442"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> Many journalists who were deployed in Bosnia had to
make payments to get through checkpoints, whether they were manned by
irregular forces or police officers, or were part of a particular
state. Presumably, in future, BBC journalists will be the only ones who
are not able to get through such
checkpoints.</div><a name="10031672000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000443"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I certainly think that organisations such as the
BBC will have to consider carefully the situations in which their staff
can provide facilitation payments, because they will be illegal under
the Bill. They will rely on prosecutorial discretion, which is
why&#151;as we shall come to later&#151;the question of the
guidance given to companies is vital. I thank my hon. Friend for
raising that important issue.</div>
<a name="10031672000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our primary
concern is that the Bill in its current form will put us in danger of
disadvantaging British businesses. The questions that were posed about
that in the other place went unanswered by the Minister. For example,
Lord Henley
said:</div><a name="10031672000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Have
the Government made an assessment of any impact that Clause 6 might
have on British companies operating abroad? Will it, for example,
disadvantage them in cases where other OECD nations operate according
to local custom while their UK counterparts must strictly observe the
local written laws?&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,
</i>7 January 2010; Vol. 716, c.
GC40.]</div><a name="10031672000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the key issue. For the act to be permissible, it has to be allowed
by the local written laws in that country. Even when the habit of a
country might be to allow facilitation payments, or even to encourage
them, it is unlikely that that would be written into those
countries&#146; legal systems, which shows the problem with the
drafting. Will the Under-Secretary now address the question posed by my
noble Friend Lord Henley?</div>
<a name="10031672000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 34
of the explanatory notes states that the offence of bribing a foreign
public official</div>
<a name="10031672000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;closely follows
the requirements of the OECD&#146;s Convention on Combating Bribery
of Foreign Public Officials in International Business
Transactions.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will read to the Committee article 1 of the OECD convention, however,
as it contains one important element:</div>
<a name="10031672000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Each
Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish that it
is a criminal offence under its law for any person intentionally to
offer, promise or give any undue pecuniary or other advantage, whether
directly or through intermediaries, to a foreign public official, for
that official or for a third party, in order that the official act or
refrain from acting in relation to the performance of official duties,
in order to obtain or retain business or other improper advantage in
the conduct of international
business.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
OECD&#146;s guidance attached to the convention notes, at paragraph
5, a definition of &#147;other improper advantage&#148;. Of course,
our amendments would insert such a provision. The guidance says that
such an
advantage</div><a name="10031672000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;refers
to something to which the company concerned was not clearly entitled,
for example, an operating permit for a factory which fails to meet the
statutory
requirements.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Under-Secretary explain why the Government saw fit not to copy this
OECD requirement for impropriety to be relevant? We are concerned
that&#151;as is typical of many of the Government&#146;s attitudes
towards compliance with external legal obligations&#151;the
Government are gold-plating these OECD laws. By doing so, they are
enacting a law that is at the most prohibitive end of the spectrum
allowed under the relevant international agreements. They could be
hamstringing UK businesses from operating on a fair playing field,
which is an issue that the CBI and the ICC have also picked
up.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div><a name="10031672000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Tunnicliffe touched on that issue briefly in the other place when he
said:</div><a name="10031672000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However,
we believe that the offence...fully achieves the purpose and
effect of the offence in the convention as
drafted.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords, </i>7
January 2010; Vol. 716, c.
GC42.]</div><a name="10031672000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree
with him. If anything, the Government have gone further than the
convention, and broadened the offence to catch behaviour beyond that
originally intended. In so doing, they might put British business at a
significant disadvantage. The Government have a tendency to take a
myopic view when it comes to competition in the business world. I fear
that the lack of time given to reviewing the practical application of
the Bill is indicative that the Government would be happy to let
British business pay the price for their discomfort over not properly
engaging with the OECD&#146;s convention and their subsequent
over-zealous adherence to international legal commitments as an attempt
to make amends. By my count, there are 34 other signatories to the
convention. Through clause 6, are the Government opting to start
British business in 35th place on the grid in the race for
international business? How many of the other signatories to the
convention have also done away with the improper element of the
offence?</div><a name="10031672000373"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="10031672000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will debate the Bill&#146;s various implications later, and I will
argue that given the toughness of its provisions for business, we will
be at a huge disadvantage unless the Government raise their game, in
terms of getting competitor countries to apply and enforce such laws.
When similar amendments were debated in the other place, the debate
centred on the issues of facilitation payments, having a carve-out, and
what would be considered reasonable hospitality. I do not wish to go
into those issues now; I will save them for the debate on my proposed
new clauses. However, I wish to touch on one aspect that impinges on
the matters and amendments under
discussion.</div><a name="10031672000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the sake of argument, let us suppose that the Bill was passed with no
provision for facilitation payments. Clause 6(3)(b) makes explicit
reference to &#147;written law&#148;, which means that the
established custom and practice of a foreign country would not be taken
into account when prosecuting. Lord Henley gave an example in the other
place that illustrates the point that I would like to make. He
said:</div>
<a name="10031672000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if it is
established practice for a ship&#146;s captain to pay a harbourmaster
in a foreign country what we might euphemistically call an
&#145;unofficial&#146; fee to dock and unload, I am sure that the
Minister would agree that that would amount to a facilitation
payment.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords, </i>7
January 2010; Vol. 716, c.
GC40.]</div><a name="10031672000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Bill stands, that captain would be guilty of an offence and liable to
imprisonment. He would have to rely on prosecutorial discretion to save
him from jail. How is the prosecutor to operate his
discretion?</div>
<a name="10031672000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed in previous debates the need for two elements if a
prosecution is to be successful: the evidence to prosecute and a public
interest in the prosecution. The discretion of the prosecutor is
limited only to whether he can argue that prosecution is not in the
public interest. He may be able to do that, but the decision on where
he draws the line, in terms of public interest, is too arbitrary for
offences of the magnitude that we are talking about, and too dependent
on subjective  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>factors. One prosecutor&#146;s line of public interest may not match
another&#146;s, particularly when different prosecuting agencies are
making the call on whether to
prosecute.</div><a name="10031672000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will return to that issue when we debate how the role of the
Attorney-General has been split between a variety of prosecutors, all
of whom may have different positions on what is in the public interest
and what should be prosecuted. That could lead to an inherent
uncertainty and a fundamental problem for those operating in foreign
lands. It cannot be ideal for the shipping business to instruct the
captain that the paying of the fee, while theoretically falling foul of
the legislation, may nevertheless proceed because prosecution is
unlikely. What business wants is
certainty.</div><a name="10031672000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments endeavour to provide that certainty by focusing on the
intention of P and the nature of the payment. In doing so, they provide
the prosecutor with a greater opportunity to act proportionally and
with a better publicised consistency. Furthermore, they shift the
emphasis back on to the captain. If there is no impropriety or corrupt
element to his motive, he can be more confident that he will not face
prosecution.</div><a name="10031672000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have suggested that that would add another element to the
offence, which would make matters more difficult for prosecutors, but
that is debatable. If anything, the amendments more properly reflect
the wording and intention of the OECD convention. Furthermore, they
would mean that British business might not be hamstrung from the outset
and could compete, in the absence of a specific facilitation payment
carve-out, on a similar footing to its international competitors
without fear of breaking the law, or without looking over its shoulder
constantly in fear of
prosecution.</div><a name="10031672000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have extensively reviewed the debate that took place on the amendments
on Report in the other place. Towards the end of the debate, Lord
Tunnicliffe responded to a question from Lord Lyell by stating that the
Government intended to publish guidance. Will the Under-Secretary
please elaborate on that? Will the guidance be separate from the
corporate offence guidance, or will it be part of it, and when can we
expect it to be
available?</div><a name="10031672000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the other place, the Government said that the offence was deliberately
formulated so as to present a robust response commensurate with the
gravity of the mischief towards which it is directed, namely bribery on
the part of business interests in the developed world that are seeking
lucrative public sector contracts in the developing world. The offence
is therefore drafted to prevent all but the written law of the state
concerned from being irrelevant to consideration of the legitimacy of
the
payment.</div><a name="10031672000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that at the top end we are dealing with systemic bribery in some
sectors and countries, and that the figures involved are extremely
large. The law should come down hard on those perpetuating such
behaviour. However, we could be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut,
particularly in the much smaller-scale, grey area, where what is
required, if anything, is a scalpel rather than a
sledgehammer.</div>
<a name="10031672000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government argued that there are two reasons for the sledgehammer
approach. To ensure that I get this right, I shall quote Lord
Tunnicliffe&#146;s speech in the other
place:</div><a name="10031672000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;First,
we wish to avoid local custom and practice being a relevant
consideration. If our Bill is to make an effective contribution to the
efforts at the national and international level to encourage 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>the developing world to abandon the culture of toleration of bribery we
need to provide a robust deterrent. This offence is designed to fulfil
that need by, among other things, preventing local customs and practice
from being prayed in aid as a defence. Secondly, and extremely
importantly, the experience of prosecutors working with the current law
is that it is extremely difficult to pinpoint with sufficient certainty
what duties or expectations apply to any individual foreign public
official. Local circumstances vary
immensely.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 2
February 2010; Vol. 717, c.
126.]</div><a name="10031672000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendments do not run counter to either of those points. By refocusing
the emphasis on P&#146;s intention, the amendments could serve to
strengthen the commitment to those
ideas.</div><a name="10031672000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have gone on at some length about the first 10 amendments, but I hope
that I have explained to the Committee the importance of the amendments
and the clauses to the Bill. They form the core of the Bill and of our
approach to reforming the law of bribery.</div>
<a name="10031672000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000444"></a>David
Howarth:</b> About an hour ago the hon. Gentleman said that
his amendments were probing, and he repeated that statement with regard
to his later amendment to clause 6, which means that I can be very
brief, as the purpose of probing amendments is to listen to what the
Under-Secretary has to say about the meaning of the clauses and
amendments in question. All I shall say is that if the amendments were
serious, I would oppose them all. They fall into two groups. The first
group adds adverbs to the statute and the second group adds adjectives.
In neither case is that a good idea, because the statute already deals
with the issues in question, and adding extra words to the clauses
would simply add
confusion.</div><a name="10031672000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
intervened on the hon. Gentleman on three or four occasions because
there were, in essence, three points to his argument, and in each case
he was wrong. First, case law on the meaning of
&#147;corruptly&#148; demonstrates that the courts could not make
up their mind about what it meant. That is precisely why it is not a
good idea to put the word &#147;corruptly&#148; into statute. It
would be better to use any word other than &#147;corruptly&#148;.
To use the word &#147;dishonestly&#148; would be to introduce a
panoply of legal decisions about the meaning of
&#147;dishonestly&#148; or &#147;theft&#148;, so that is not a
good idea either. That, presumably, is why &#147;improper&#148; has
been chosen; it does not bring that baggage with
it.</div>
<a name="10031672000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000445"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point
about possible arguments over the definition of corruption, but he is
not suggesting that the courts do not know what
&#147;dishonestly&#148; means, is he?</div>
<a name="10031672000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000446"></a>David
Howarth:</b> No, I am not suggesting that, but the courts say
that it is a jury question. After a long period of debate about the
meaning, they ended up saying, &#147;We don&#146;t know what it
means. Let a jury decide&#148;, and we do not want that, either.
[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;Why not?&#148;]
Conservative Members say, &#147;Why not?&#148;, which leads me to
my second
point.</div><a name="10031672000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need a more accurate definition of the conditions under which the crime
is committed, rather than simply leaving the matter to the jury. In
fact, if the argument of the hon. Member for Huntingdon is that we need
the law to be clearer, I say to him: the Bill is drafted as it is
precisely so that the matter is not simply left to the jury. So, the
second point concerns the meaning of the word &#147;improper&#148;.
The whole point of the statute is that the meaning of the word
&#147;improper&#148; is put into it. We do 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>not have to go to a dictionary to find out the meaning, because clauses
3 to 5 define it. That is precisely how the statute works. There is no
need to go any further. I will leave to the Under-Secretary the task of
saying what clauses 3 to 5 mean, because her remarks on that have great
authority and mine have none
whatever.</div><a name="10031672000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third point concerns mens rea. The hon. Member for Huntingdon seemed to
be under the impression that mens rea in criminal law had to import
some notion of evildoing. That has never been the case. Mens rea
includes the notion of intention&#151;of intentionally doing the
actus reus. As far as I can tell&#151;I am no great expert in
criminal law&#151;clauses 1, 2 and 6 include the notion of intention,
so I do not think that that problem arises.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000447"></a>John
Howell:</b> May I draw the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention
to clause 5(1)? It
says:</div><a name="10031672000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the purposes of sections 3 and 4, the test of what is expected is a
test of what a reasonable person...would
expect&#148;.</div><a name="10031672000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
is that not a jury question?</div>
<a name="10031672000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000448"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Of course all the elements of a criminal offence
are a jury question. The question is how much guidance the law gives
the jury in particular cases. By breaking down the elements in this
way, we give the jury a better chance of getting to an accurate answer
than if we simply leave things at large to the jury in the way proposed
by the hon. Member for Huntingdon.</div>
<a name="10031672000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000449"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> The concern about the word &#147;improper&#148;
is that it is a weaker word&#151;a less serious word&#151;than
&#147;corrupt&#148;, or indeed &#147;bribery&#148;. There is
nothing in clause 4 that disabuses one of that notion. That is why it
is proposed that the words &#147;with corrupt intent&#148; be
added&#151;to ensure that we do not bring all sorts of less serious
acts into the criminal sphere. Historically&#151;and, I think,
rightly&#151;we want to tackle corruption and bribery, not a wider
range of actions.</div>
<a name="10031672000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000450"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The point is that clause 4, along with clauses 3
and 5, define what &#147;improper&#148; means, and that is what is
put to the jury. What is not put to the jury is simply a decision at
large about the meaning of the word &#147;improper&#148;. They will
be told what the law is in terms. The law in terms is proposed to be
what is in those clauses, so I do not think that is a problem. Adding
an extra layer of complication would be a problem. As in one of the
cases to which the hon. Member for Huntingdon referred, the court
assumes that Parliament does not add surplusage to statutes. It assumes
that words mean something. If we add the extra test, the courts will
assume that that would add something over and above impropriety as
defined in the statute.</div>
<a name="10031672000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000451"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> But is not the issue of impropriety connected to
the behaviour of the person receiving the bribe? That is a point that I
made to my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon a littler earlier. The
argument in favour of my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment 1, or indeed
his amendment 2, to clause 1 is that we are refining the description of
the necessary behaviour for the person giving the bribe, and that is
where the mens rea gap is, if there is one.</div>
<a name="10031672000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000452"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I do not accept that point, because if we take
case 1, clause 1 says that a person is guilty of an offence where they
offer the advantage, and that
person</div><a name="10031672000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;intends
the advantage...to induce a person to perform
improperly&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div><a name="10031672000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the
defendant&#146;s intention to induce improper behaviour that is the
essence of the offence, so I do not think that the point
arises.</div><a name="10031672000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Huntingdon is correct to say that clause 6 takes a
different approach from clauses 1 and 2 when it comes to how
impropriety, corruption or undueness are dealt with. However, in
essence, clause 6 has the same structure as the rest of the law. The
reason why there is no need to put &#147;undue&#148; or any such
word into the definition of the offence is that clause 6 defines the
illegal aspect of the act in terms of the law of the state
concerned.</div><a name="10031672000374"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="10031672000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
someone does something to induce a foreign official to act in a
particular way because of an advantage being offered to them, we work
out under the clause whether that is undue by looking at whether it is
permitted or required by the law of that state. That is how it is done;
that is why we do not need the word &#147;undue&#148; to be added
to
clause.</div><a name="10031672000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
statute might be drafted in a way that is too elegant, too effective
and too economical for those who are used to a more grandiloquent
style, but it strikes me as being perfectly adequate for the purposes
that it is meant to fulfil. Better than that, it is statute that will
be more effective because it is clearer than the current law, which is
the point of the exercise. We want to ensure that bribery is prosecuted
successfully in cases when it is happening and when the fact of its
existence undermines not only our reputation in the world, but the
economic interests of our
businesses.</div><a name="10031672000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000453"></a>John
Howell:</b> I rise on the assumption that I am the only
non-lawyer on the Opposition side of the Committee. The Committee might
think that that is something to be praised, but I am looking at the
Bill from the point of view of someone who, in the summer, will do jury
service. Perhaps I can therefore bring the juror&#146;s perspective
to our
proceedings.</div><a name="10031672000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to start with the OECD background to the Bill. The great impetus
on getting the Bill through the House seems to be that there is great
international pressure for us to do so, and that it fits in with our
obligations for the OECD convention. The commentary to the convention
brings out several interesting points that amplify some of those that
have already been made. It points out that the OECD convention has to
span a wide universe, that its concepts are to apply

<a name="10031672000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that it must
anticipate the future and possible newcomers to the OECD, such
as</div><a name="10031672000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;China,
India, Russia and South
Africa&#148;.</div><a name="10031672000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
it was written a little while

concepts
diverge&#148;</div><a name="10031672000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">considerably
in those countries. Since bribery is a legal construct very much in its
development, the OECD negotiators, it says,
opted</div><a name="10031672000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for
a very broad common denominator
indeed&#148;</div><a name="10031672000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
the convention.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div><a name="10031672000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commentary
also points out&#151;the OECD convention itself makes this
point&#151;that there is a distinction between criminal and civil law
aspects of bribery. The convention does not rule that out; it
specifically accepts that that distinction is there. However, it rules
out it being its job to intervene and decide which of those is more
prominent or how they should be dealt with under individual legislation
around the
world.</div><a name="10031672000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commentary also points out that the international trend is towards
wrapping up civil and criminal activities into one for simplicity
around criminal responsibility. To what extent have the Government been
motivated by that trend? How are they reacting to it and to the
inevitable simplification that the OECD convention
achieves?</div><a name="10031672000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
convention makes the difference between criminal and civil less
distinct. Paragraph 31 of the report produced by the Joint Committee on
the draft Bribery Bill gives the example
of</div><a name="10031672000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
scenario of a senior banker being asked by a rival bank to induce his
or her trading team to join that rival in return for increased
remuneration&#148;.</div><a name="10031672000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
answer from the UK Anti-Corruption Forum as to whether that would be
caught by the Bill was that it would, but that in all other
circumstances it would be best dealt with in the civil courts.
Therefore, we have a good example of the extension of this along the
lines that the OECD took, but only for convenience rather than for
instruction.</div><a name="10031672000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
distinction is an important one to make. From a potential
juror&#146;s point of view, I have no difficulty in understanding
what corruption means. However, I would have enormous difficulty, in
this context, in understanding what &#147;improper&#148; meant. It
could cover many different things, and I would need guidance on what
should be considered improper. In my mind as a legislator and as a
juror, the more legislation requires guidance, the less perfect it
is.</div><a name="10031672000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000454"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I, too, welcome you to the Committee, Sir
Nicholas. I recall serving on a Committee under your chairmanship last
week, when you suggested that it might be your last Committee in the
Chair. I am delighted to see that you were wrong then, but obviously
saddened to think that you might be right in saying it this
morning.</div><a name="10031672000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also declare an interest as a non-practising barrister in the field of
criminal law. To deal with the point that the hon. Member for Cambridge
made earlier&#151;much as I regret to do this, especially in his last
Committee&#151;I disagree with him on the drafting, particularly of
clause 1. That is, I might add, an unwise thing to do
generally, because he is an extremely accomplished lawyer, and he is
usually right on the questions of legal drafting. However, I am not
sure that he is this time, and I want to explain why I think
that.</div><a name="10031672000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
support entirely amendments 1 and 2, tabled by my hon. Friend the
Member for Huntingdon&#151;or rather, I should say, amendment 1 or
amendment 2, because it seems clear that the amendments are
alternatives to each other. I am agnostic as to which drafting is
preferable. One of the two is desirable, because it is important to
refine the intent of the person alleged to have given a
bribe&#151;that is what clause 1 deals with.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div><a name="10031672000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">There seems to
be a scenario that we need to consider. The answer to it may be
delivered by changing the drafting in the way that the amendments
suggest, or it may, conceivably, be dealt with by the Minister
reassuring me that that point is covered and by putting things on the
record in Committee, which the courts will find of use when dealing
with the point
later.</div><a name="10031672000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
point of this: imagine a case where an individual is desperately
waiting for the verdict of a public official, whether it be a planning
official or a public official of some other type, whereby a decision
one way would be a triumph, and a decision the other would mean
disaster. The decision comes and it is in favour of that individual,
who is understandably delighted and chooses to reward the public
official in some way. It may be because the official is personally
known to him or because of another set of circumstances that we cannot
see at the moment. However, for whatever reason, a reward is
given.</div><a name="10031672000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
later transpires that the decision taken by the official was the result
of an improper performance of his duties as defined under the Bill.
However, the individual did not know at the time that the performance
was improper. In other words, the official took the decision for an
improper reason that was completely unrelated to the behaviour of the
person finding himself accused of allegedly giving a
bribe.</div><a name="10031672000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000455"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Minister will give a more authoritative
answer, but my impression is that, in those circumstances, P would not
have intended the advantage to reward the person for the improper
performance, because there was no connection between the
two.</div><a name="10031672000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000456"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I thought that the hon. Gentleman would say that.
That is the bit that worries me. That might be the case, and it might
well be what the Government intend. Paragraph 17 of the explanatory
notes, on page 4,
says:</div><a name="10031672000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is sufficient for the purposes of the offence that P intended to induce
or reward
impropriety&#148;,</div><a name="10031672000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is the point that he is making. However, clause 1(2)(b)(ii)
deals with an allegation that someone has rewarded a
person</div><a name="10031672000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for
the improper performance of such a function or
activity.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">If,
in the scenario that I described, the individual waiting for the
decision from a public official rewarded the official and the official
had carried out improper performance, the individual would be doing
exactly what is described in that clause&#151;rewarding a person for
the improper performance&#151;without knowing that it was improper
performance. That is the bit that worries
me.</div><a name="10031672000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as I can see, the individual would satisfy the clause as it stands
as he would have rewarded an official for improper performance, but he
would not know that the performance was improper. How could he, if the
official&#146;s decision was taken for reasons entirely outside his
knowledge? That seems to be the
issue.</div><a name="10031672000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000457"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> My hon. Friend is making a valid point. I
refer to one difficulty. Somebody whose company had a factory in the
midlands, for instance, and who was trying to sell goods to a country
abroad might bring the officials who were part of the tendering process
to the factory to show them what it could do, how it would be done and
the work force. If that person paid their costs, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>either before the tender or after the contract was awarded, would that
fall within the remit of the Bill? That might cause difficulties:
somebody might be able to fly to Paris to see what the French could
provide, but not be able to fly to Birmingham to see what the people
there could
provide.</div><a name="10031672000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000458"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> My hon. Friend might be right, but my question
refers to inducements made before a decision is taken as much as to
rewards after it. The issue that I am raising is whether, after a
decision has been taken and someone decides to reward an official for
taking it, they will at that point make themselves liable under the
clause, without having any idea that the official&#146;s performance
in taking that decision was in fact improper, for reasons outside their
knowledge. That is a real possibility. One way to avoid it arising
would be to do precisely what my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon
suggests and add to clause 1 the requirement that a person is guilty of
an offence if they act either with corrupt intent or dishonestly in
doing the things described in the
clause.</div><a name="10031672000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will reassure me on that point, as it is a
genuine difficulty with the clause. I very much hope that the hon.
Member for Cambridge is right, as he usually is, but, on this rare
occasion, he might not be. If he is not, we shall leave ourselves open,
I would have thought, to the possibility of someone in the scenario
that I have described leaving themselves open to criminal prosecution
for something that I do not believe that we would wish to penalise in
that
way.</div><a name="10031672000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will either accept one of the amendments tabled
by my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon or reassure us that they
are not necessary and that the specific scenario that I have described
is covered by the
Bill.</div><a name="10031672000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000459"></a>The
Chair:</b> Before I call the Minister, I want to be helpful to
the Committee. I understand that this is an important clause in an
important Bill, and that the amendments selected for debate are
critical, going as they do to the core of the legislation. I understand
also that there is some concern that we are making rather slow
progress, and that it is possible that the Government might wish to sit
after 7 o&#146;clock
tonight.</div><a name="10031672000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
co-Chairman and I have spoken about that matter. There will be a
Division in the House at 7 o&#146;clock. We have reached the
conclusion that, if the Government wish to continue the debate later
today, it would be sensible to break for an hour at 7 o&#146;clock
and return at 8 o&#146;clock. After that, the matter of
how long the Committee sits is, to an extent, in the hands of the
Government Whip. However, I think that it is helpful for members of the
Committee to know how the Bill will be considered to enable them to
plan their day. I give that due
notice.</div><a name="10031672000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
co-Chairman Joan Walley and I have discussed the matter. We believe
that that will be the best way for the debate to be taken today, if it
is the wish of the Committee to sit after 7 o&#146;clock. I hope that
that is helpful. If there is any problem, I am sure that Members will
come to the Chair and discuss it with
us.</div><a name="10031672000375"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000460"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. You have given us some
interesting and helpful guidance. It is interesting to note that the
hon. Member for Huntingdon, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>along with his colleagues, has taken nearly two hours to debate the
offences of bribery, which many of us already understand. He has done
so in the context of a Bill which supposedly has cross-party support
and has been the subject of considerable discussion and debate both in
another place and through a series of other measures. Indeed, the Law
Commission and the Joint Committee, on which the hon. Gentleman and, I
believe, the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth also sat, agreed with
the report
and&#151;</div><a name="10031672000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000461"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> May I stop the Under-Secretary in mid-flow and
ask her to explain which elements of the debate we have just had were
unnecessary?</div><a name="10031672000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000462"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The debate is certainly necessary However, I
question the hon. Gentleman&#146;s commitment to the strong and
robust Bill that we are seeking to get on to the statute book to stamp
out bribery by
business&#151;</div><a name="10031672000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000463"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Will the Under-Secretary give
way?</div><a name="10031672000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000464"></a>Claire
Ward:</b><b class="B"> </b>Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will let me
finish. We have had a considerable amount of time to listen to him. It
is important that I respond to the various points that he and his hon.
Friends have raised this morning. In respect of the commitment of the
Conservative party to this legislation, I trust that we will see the
all-party support that he and his party have been keen to indulge in
outside this
place.</div><a name="10031672000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000465"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friends and I rather resent the
Under-Secretary questioning our commitment. For the last three years we
have been committed to this Bill, calling for it on a regular basis,
long before the Minister had anything to do with it. I personally have
been calling for this Bill. For her to say today that we are not
committed to this Bill when the Government are bringing it to Committee
some three weeks before a general election, after it was first brought
to the House in 1998, is
outrageous.</div><a name="10031672000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000466"></a>The
Chair:</b> Order. I do not like to intervene, but I said at
the beginning of this sitting that I hoped it would be agreeable and
constructive. We do not want to trespass into Second Reading speeches.
We need to deal with clause 1 and the amendments that I have selected
for debate at this stage. I hope that the temper of the Committee can
be kept at a constructive and low
level.</div><a name="10031672000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000467"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I note, of course, your guidance, Sir
Nicholas. I am sure that others outside the House will draw their own
conclusion from the content of this morning&#146;s
discussion.</div><a name="10031672000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments seek to reconstruct both the general bribery offences and
the clause 6 offence of bribing a foreign public official. The
amendments to the general bribery offences seek to introduce the
requirement that the person must either be &#147;acting with corrupt
intent&#148; or &#147;acting with dishonesty&#148; to commit the
offence, while those to the clause 6 offence seek to introduce the
concepts of &#147;improper&#148;, &#147;corrupt&#148; or
&#147;undue&#148;. The amendments would have the effect of
maintaining the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>current law&#146;s unsatisfactory reliance on the concept of corrupt
intent and undermine the effectiveness of the new
offences.</div><a name="10031672000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concept of &#147;acting corruptly&#148; is used in the existing
outdated legislation, of which we heard much from the hon. Gentleman
this morning, which we are seeking to replace&#151;the Public Bodies
Corrupt Practices Act 1889 and the Prevention of Corruption Act
1906.</div>
<a name="10031672000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000468"></a>John
Howell:</b> I now cannot remember the word the Minister used
for the existing practice, but it was something like
&#147;unacceptable&#148;. Will she therefore tell us why the
Director of Public Prosecutions stated that the old test had worked
adequately in
practice?</div><a name="10031672000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000469"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> We considered the views of the Law Commission on the
matter. The term is not defined in those statutes and, as a result, the
concept has proved to be vague and intrinsically difficult to apply in
practice. That unhelpful construct has led to a number of different and
often inconsistent interpretations from the courts on whether intending
to corrupt involves dishonesty or committing an act that the law
forbids. Furthermore, the Law Commission&#146;s comprehensive
research and consultation on the point concluded that the lack of
clarity surrounding the concept of acting corruptly has weakened the
effect of application of the law, and that offences based on the
improper conduct model were the best option. Similarly, the Joint
Committee on the draft Bribery Bill, on which the hon. Members for
Huntingdon and for Rugby and Kenilworth sat, fully endorsed the
improper performance
test.</div><a name="10031672000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000470"></a>John
Howell:</b> I thank the Under-Secretary for giving way
again&#151;she has been generous&#151;but I am sorry to return to
the same point. She cited a lot of organisations that supported her
case, but would she say therefore that the Director of Public
Prosecutions is wrong to state that the test has worked adequately in
practice?</div><a name="10031672000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000471"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I can cite rather more than simply organisations; I
can cite the Conservatives&#146; own Front-Bench spokesman in the
other place, Lord Henley, whom we heard little about from the hon.
Member for Huntingdon in the earlier part of the debate&#151;at one
point, I thought that Lord Lyell was the spokesperson for the
Conservative party. Lord Henley said of similar amendments tabled by
Lord Lyell in another
place:</div><a name="10031672000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
have some sympathy, but regret that I cannot fully agree with him. In
our earlier debates, the Minister argued that &#145;acting
corruptly&#146; is a vague and inherently difficult concept-I think
that I quote him correctly. On this occasion, I agree with the
Minister's argument over that of my noble and learned
friend.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 2
February 2010; Vol. 717, c.
120.]</div><a name="10031672000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">At that
important stage of the Bill&#146;s transition through Parliament,
that appears to have been the official view of the Conservative party.
However, for other reasons, perhaps related to the impending general
election and such considerations, the view of the Conservative Front
Bench might have
changed.</div><a name="10031672000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the improper performance model, an offence is committed if financial or
other advantage is given to induce or reward impropriety in relation to
a relevant function or activity. There must be expectation that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>relevant function or activity is to be carried out in good faith or
impartially, or that the person performing it is in a position of
trust. With that in mind, clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill set out two
active and four passive bribery cases, which describe the conduct of
the payer or of the recipient that would constitute a bribery offence.
Those cases can easily be understood and provide the necessary legal
certainty.</div><a name="10031672000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Joint Committee on the draft Bribery Bill endorsed the improper
performance test and commented
that</div><a name="10031672000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
reliance on a reasonable person's expectation of &#145;good
faith&#146;, &#145;impartiality&#146; and &#145;trust&#146;
represents a careful balance between simplicity, certainty and
effectiveness.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Transparency
International has been rather more forthright in its comments. Its
briefing on similar amendments tabled in the other place said that
they</div><a name="10031672000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would
take the law back to its vague and inadequate state of which such
strong and consistent criticisms have been made since the Law
Commission first reported in
1998.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the amendments to clause 6, I recognise that they seek to address a
view that the offence as currently drafted does not adequately describe
what is properly regarded as corrupt conduct, because there is no
requirement to prove impropriety or dishonesty on the part of the
person offering the bribe. However, that criticism fails to recognise
the overall formulation of the offence. Furthermore, amendments 7 and 8
fail to define what is meant by intending to influence
&#147;improperly&#148; or &#147;corruptly&#148; the foreign
public official. A prosecution could be opened up to legal arguments on
subjective factors, such as defence awareness or knowledge of local
laws, or the existence of local customs that tolerate
bribery.</div><a name="10031672000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the hon. Member for Huntingdon agrees that we are seeking to
put on the statute book legislation that is robust in its view of
bribery and that sets out a clear message that bribery by British
businesses and others across the globe is not acceptable. We do not
want to do anything that might water down the offences or the clear
message that we want to send
out.</div><a name="10031672000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
same might be said of the proposed qualification in amendments 9 and 10
of undue or improper advantage. In the absence of a clear definition,
it is unclear how the courts should draw the line between a financial
or other advantage, and an improper financial or other advantage. The
additional words would introduce an unnecessary, added complication.
They represent additional matters for the prosecution to prove, which
could undermine the value of the specific
offence.</div><a name="10031672000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause 6 offence covers only the offer, promise or giving of a bribe to
a foreign public official, not the acceptance of a bribe. Although the
general offences are based on the concept of inducing improper
performance of a relevant function or activity, clause 6 provides
prosecutors with an alternative to the clause 1 offence, tailored to
the particular complexities of prosecuting foreign
bribery.</div><a name="10031672000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
prove the clause 6 offence, first, the person giving the bribe must
intend to influence the recipient in the performance of their functions
as a public official. Secondly, the bribe must be intended to obtain or
retain business or a business advantage. Finally, the advantage,
financial or otherwise, that is offered, promised or given to the
foreign public official is defined as a bribe when the foreign official
is neither permitted nor required to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>be influenced by the offer, promise or gift as determined by the written
law applicable to the foreign public official. The offence is
deliberately formulated so that the only relevant consideration
regarding the legitimacy of a payment or other advantage will be the
written law applicable to the foreign public
official.</div><a name="10031672000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are sound reasons for that approach. It provides legal certainty for
those engaged in business overseas, contrary to the view of the hon.
Member for Huntingdon, and avoids local custom or practice being a
relevant consideration. It is not premised on impropriety because
experience shows that such a requirement creates difficulties in
achieving a successful prosecution in foreign bribery cases. Inserting
a requirement for impropriety would negate the usefulness of having a
specific foreign bribery
offence.</div><a name="10031672000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman and his colleagues referred to facilitation payments and
rightly said that the Committee will return to the issue when we come
to his new clause. I do not want to go into much detail, because I will
return to the matter, but a facilitation payment, whether it is called
a small facilitation payment, a facilitation payment, or a large
facilitation payment, is clearly a bribe. If the hon. Gentleman wants
to ensure that outside the House, in the places that matter in the
conduct of business, this Parliament sends a clear message that bribes
are not acceptable, and that they damage business and British business,
I trust that he accepts that facilitation payments, however he wishes
to describe them, are simply a bribe in one form or
another.</div><a name="10031672000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the hon. Member for Huntingdon was a member of the Joint
Committee, which backed the formulation of the offences in the Bill. He
and his hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth are entitled to
take a different view from that of the Joint Committee in its report,
although I am not aware of significant views being expressed previously
about how they disagreed with the Joint Committee, but I hope that he
understands why we do not propose to change tack at this stage of the
process.</div>
<a name="10031672000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments were fully debated in the other place, when the Conservative
Front Bench took a sensible position in disagreeing with the amendments
tabled by Lord Lyell. I do not seek to encourage the Committee to
support the amendments; indeed, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw
his
amendment.</div><a name="10031672000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000472"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I may have missed it, but I am not sure the
Under-Secretary dealt with the point I raised about clause 1. I
specifically asked if there is enough reassurance in the clause as
drafted regarding whether or not someone who is offering a
bribe</div>
<a name="10031672000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to reward a
person for the improper performance of such a function or
activity&#148;</div><a name="10031672000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
going to be caught if they are simply offering a reward for the
performance of an activity that they did not at that stage know
constituted improper
performance.</div><a name="10031672000376"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="10031672000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000473"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The hon. Gentleman is looking at the mens rea aspect
of the issue. It is clear that we share the view of the Law
Commission&#151;again, it was endorsed by the Joint Committee, which
scrutinised this issue&#151;that R&#146;s knowledge and intent
should be immaterial as to whether an offence has been committed in
cases 4 to 6. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>To that end, subsection (7) makes that explicit. In cases 1 and 2 of the
offence, if the payer intends the improper performance of a function,
the offence is made out. That is quite simple. If they
intend&#151;case 1 refers to intention&#151;improper performance,
they have made that
offence.</div><a name="10031672000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000474"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b><b class="B"> </b>I think the Under-Secretary is answering my
question in the way I hoped she would, but just to be absolutely clear,
is she saying that the intention relates to the improper performance,
not simply to the process of rewarding? I suspect that that is where
the potential confusion lies in the current drafting, which is why it
would be helpful if she clarified the
position.</div><a name="10031672000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000475"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I am happy to come back to the hon. Gentleman if
there is any misunderstanding or doubt about what I have said, which is
that, as in clause 1(2), if the payer intends the improper performance
of the function, that offence is made out. If there is any
misunderstanding about that, I am happy to write to the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
<a name="10031672000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe I
have answered all the relevant issues raised in the earlier part of the
debate. I once again encourage the hon. Member for Huntingdon to
withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="10031672000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000476"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> This has been a full debate&#151;I hope my
hon. Friend the Member for Henley has not been put off his jury service
as a result. The debate was required to provide the Commons with the
opportunity to discuss serious issues and a serious change in the law.
I am pleased that we had this debate and had we not done so&#151;as I
think the hon. Member for Cambridge wanted&#151;that would have been
wrong. I am not going to talk about our commitment to the Bill because
I have mentioned that previously, but I point out that by lunch on the
first day, we will have covered at least 10 of the approximately 30
amendments that have been tabled. To suggest in any way that we are
trying to hold back progress is
ridiculous.</div><a name="10031672000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000477"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> While my hon. Friend is at it, will he also
observe that the Government&#146;s programme motion, with which we
have all agreed, allows what the Government consider to be an
appropriate amount of time for the Bill. As he rightly points out, we
are making steady, if not swift,
progress.</div><a name="10031672000253"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000478"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The spokesman for the Lib Dems, the hon. Member
for Cambridge, said that the definition of corruption is a question for
the jury and that that should be separated from the concept of
&#147;proper,&#148; which is clearly defined in the Bill, and
therefore everything will be fine.</div>
<a name="10031672000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000479"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I did not say that at
all.</div><a name="10031672000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000480"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Let me say that what the hon. Gentleman did say
was slightly unrealistic. The question of what is improper will also,
in practice, have to be put to the jury. The hon. Gentleman needs to
appreciate that we are creating new law here that is a dramatic change
from the previous law. The definition of &#147;improper&#148; will
be heavily debated in court. The courts will have to give significant
guidance that will be a patchwork of what the Government will come out
with, and, inasmuch as they have had debates over the years about what
&#147;corruption&#148; means, they will debate over the years 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>what &#147;improper&#148; means. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Rugby and Kenilworth said, if we are concerned about the scope of the
word &#147;improper&#148;, even if we accept it in the Bill, we
need to appreciate that the courts will have to spend some time looking
at it again at some future point. I will leave it at
that.</div><a name="10031672000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
make no apology for wanting to cover all the bases in the Bill. The
Under-Secretary answered the questions on its legal aspects to some
degree, and I will consider what she said in preparation for Report
stage. However, I should like to make a few points on the Bill&#146;s
practical applications. She rightly said that we will debate
facilitation payments on another occasion, but I am proposing in my
amendments a way of avoiding that debate. Without these proposals,
which admittedly we are advancing in the form of probing amendments, we
would still have to deal with the question of facilitation payments,
which would not otherwise be dealt with
now.</div><a name="10031672000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000481"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that a facilitation
payment is a
bribe?</div><a name="10031672000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000482"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> A facilitation payment is a bribe. However, the
Under-Secretary needs to recognise that in certain jurisdictions
carve-outs are made for facilitation payments under strict guidelines.
For instance, the United States has a specific exemption for what it
calls &#147;facilitation payments&#148;. We are moving from
differentiating between what is, in effect, a tip and a bribe. Yes,
differences are made up and I accept that, under the Bill, those
payments are
bribes.</div><a name="10031672000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are dangers associated with facilitation payments that the
Under-Secretary did not mention. It is not only a matter of the law of
our country looking at facilitation payments. If there is a
carve-out&#151;we will debate this later and I will make this
point&#151;the fact that someone is bribing under the law of the
country where the facilitation payment is made means that the business
man making that payment would still be liable for prosecution in that
country in any event. That is often forgotten. That is a debating
point, and we suggest that the amendments would get round having to
have that debate at
all.</div><a name="10031672000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary did not mention various practical aspects, such as
whether the Government have assessed the impact of clause 6 on British
companies, which are concerned about that. On clause 6, has she looked
at which other signatories to the convention have also done away with
the &#147;improper&#148;
element?</div><a name="10031672000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000483"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The OECD has endorsed the Bill and has suggested
that it presents a best practice model. Although the hon. Gentleman
speaks about the practice of facilitation payments in rather flowery
language, I note that he endorses the fact that they are indeed a
bribe. The purpose of the Bill, and our intended purpose as a
Government, is to set out clearly that bribes are not acceptable. I
hope he agrees with
that.</div><a name="10031672000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000484"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I do not think anybody is arguing that the Bill
is unnecessary or that we do not need to crack down on bribery. The
question is the extent to which there should be prosecutions and
exemptions under the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>law in particular circumstances. The Under-Secretary did not answer my
question, which was, in the context of the clause 6 offence, to what
extent other signatories to the convention have done away with the
&#147;improper&#148; element of the
offence.</div><a name="10031672000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take the Under-Secretary&#146;s point that we will have the gold
standard in anti-bribery law among the OECD countries, and probably in
the world. We not only recognise but support that. However, we must
ensure that our companies are prepared for that challenge. I do not
think she answered my question about publishing guidance. Will guidance
on clause 6 be merged with the other guidance on the Bill that is being
published, or will it be done separately? When can we expect it to be
published?</div><a name="10031672000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000485"></a>The
Chair:</b> Does the Under-Secretary wish to
intervene?</div><a name="10031672000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000486"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I will accept the invitation. With all due respect,
Sir Nicholas, the issue of guidance will be dealt with in our debates
on clauses 7 and 9. I think it appropriate to reserve my comments until
that
point.</div><a name="10031672000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000487"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> When the Under-Secretary addresses the question
of guidance on other aspects of the Bill, I ask her to ensure that she
includes the Government&#146;s position on clause 6. On the basis
that we can consider what the Under-Secretary has to say on other
aspects of the Bill, which all merge together and will have to be
considered as a whole when we move towards Report stage, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10031672000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000489"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment 11, in
clause 6, page 4, line 12, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3A) It shall
be a defence if P reasonably believed at the time of the alleged
offence that F or the third party to whom the financial or other
advantage was given was required or permitted to accept it under the
domestic law of the jurisdiction in which F or the third party
operates.&#146;.</div><a name="10031672000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
you have explained, Sir Nicholas, we have covered about a quarter of
the Bill by lunch. If anyone thinks we have been holding up
proceedings, I ask them to think
again.</div><a name="10031672000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
probing amendment would insert a defence of reasonable belief into the
offence of bribing a foreign official. The reasonable belief relates
directly to the defendant&#146;s knowledge of the laws of the foreign
country.</div><a name="10031672000377"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div>
<a name="10031672000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">As before,
presumably, the Government will counter with the argument that
prosecutorial discretion will cure any of the failings in the offence.
We question how they can be sure of that. Is it sufficient to rely on
that discretion as a cure-all to what are fundamental problems 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>with the structure of the offences as they stand? We have already
debated the need for a change to the test of impropriety, and this
amendment is in similar vein.</div>
<a name="10031672000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
important point concerning the circumstances in which different
countries or cultures have different laws or cultural norms, and
whether those laws or norms should be taken into account when
considering the criminality of an individual&#146;s actions. A report
from the Law Commission in 2008 noted that standards of conduct in the
UK and Europe were not &#147;universally recognised&#148; within
Europe, let alone within a wider global
context.</div><a name="10031672000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Law Commission proposed a defence for any person who mistakenly but
reasonably believed that a foreign official was required or permitted
to accept an advantage under the official&#146;s local law. However,
the Government have decided not to include that defence in the Bill and
I would be grateful if the Minister explained the reasoning behind its
exclusion. I understand that the majority of respondents to the Law
Commission report, which included the Serious Fraud Office and the
Association of Council Secretaries and Solicitors, were in favour of
such a defence.</div>
<a name="10031672000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must make a
brief aside, for the purposes of clarification. We are seeking this
amendment and the proposed defence in relation to the discrete offence
of bribery of a foreign official, not in relation to the general
offence of bribery. The distinguishing advantage is that the focus of
the general offence is on the propriety of the offending
individual&#146;s conduct, not on the supposed legal propriety of the
advantage. The offence is founded on a hybrid &#147;influence or
improper conduct&#148; model, rather than on the &#147;influence or
undue payment&#148; model, which forms the basis for the discrete
offence of bribing a foreign public official.</div>
<a name="10031672000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I concede
that bribery is subject to almost universal prohibition across the
globe. However, that prohibition does not solve the problem of whether
particular payments or other advantages are bribes, or could reasonably
be seen as being bribes. &#147;Taxes&#148;, &#147;fees&#148;,
&#147;administration payments&#148; and so forth may all be legally
required or permitted in certain circumstances. Quite understandably,
those paying them may believe that they are legal requirements, or that
they are legally permitted in particular circumstances&#151;for
example, when the administration involved is time-consuming.</div>
<a name="10031672000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
makes no provision for the carve-out of &#147;facilitation
payments&#148;, but the defence recommended in the amendment would
provide some protection for so-called innocents abroad. There is the
potential for flexibility in the application of the defence, as there
is between individuals and commercial organisations. The threshold of
reasonableness for the latter would be much higher; they would be
required to prove far higher diligence than an individual. For
instance, the Law Commission suggested
that</div><a name="10031672000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;companies
seeking to make use of the defence should have to show, as part of
their business strategy for dealing with the officials in question,
that they took appropriate steps to discover whether any payments
requested would indeed be required or permitted by
law&#148;.</div><a name="10031672000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the key arguments against the Law Commission&#146;s recommendation
for a defence was the suggestion from the High Court judges that a core
principle of English law is, &#147;Ignorance of the law is not a
defence.&#148; However, that was tempered with the judges&#146;
suggestion that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>might be preferable to build into the offence a fault element, so that
the accused must have acted &#147;dishonestly&#148;. I do not wish
to rehash the earlier debate on the issue, other than to flag up that
endorsement for our earlier
proposals.</div><a name="10031672000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
evidence to the Joint Committee and to the Law Commission in its
original report, Professor Horder highlighted the fact that not all
English authorities support a completely unyielding adherence to the
maxim that &#147;ignorance of the law is not a defence&#148; and
the leading case law is not entirely consistent in its application of
the maxim. Members should contrast Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely
county council <i class="I">v.</i> Rust with Postermobile plc <i class="I">v.</i> Brent
borough council as proof of
that.</div><a name="10031672000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Canada,
which is another common-law jurisdiction and also a signatory to the
OECD convention, takes a more generous approach, at least where the
error was induced by an official. Where the law in question, of which
the defendant was ignorant, is not English law but the law of another
jurisdiction, the case for adhering strictly to the maxim seems even
less persuasive, as the Law Commission sensibly suggested. Professor
Horder also reiterated that distinguishing element and suggested that a
mistake of foreign law may legitimately be treated differently from a
mistake of domestic
law.</div><a name="10031672000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
strictly speaking it is not ignorance of the law that is the basis of
the defence proposed in the amendment, in so far as that implies that a
mere absence of knowledge of the law would, in and of itself, amount to
an excuse. The defence would require a positive and adequately grounded
belief that a payment was required or permitted by law, which would be
sufficiently flexible to allow for a proportional application of the
defence. A test of reasonableness is not something that has
traditionally proven difficult for jurors in the English court system
to
apply.</div><a name="10031672000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
International Chamber of Commerce supported a defence as</div>
<a name="10031672000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a useful
addition to the written law&#148;</div>
<a name="10031672000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">test, since juries
are</div>
<a name="10031672000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;much more
suited to find whether a reasonable attempt to ascertain law had been
made rather than to decide upon the law
itself&#148;.</div><a name="10031672000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Professor
Horder alluded to that in
evidence:</div><a name="10031672000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
practice this defence would not run very often, but when it was
it&#148;</div><a name="10031672000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">would
be</div><a name="10031672000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;perfectly
reasonable for a firm to say, &#145;Well, look, the biggest law firm
in the world has given us this advice that it is perfectly lawful to
make this payment, what can we do? We can only rely on that&#146;.
That is important because we are talking about convicting someone of a
pretty serious offence. The taint of corruption is pretty
significant.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
was not alone in that view, as many of those providing evidence to the
Joint Committee reiterated that
sentiment.</div><a name="10031672000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Major
global law firms Herbert Smith LLP and Clifford Chance both supported
the idea of a clear defence and suggested that a dearth of legal
authorities in some countries can lead to advice being heavily
qualified, leaving quick decisions to be made on a &#147;best
guess&#148; basis. The Director of Public Prosecutions also preferred
the option of adding a statutory offence in the interests of
&#147;transparency and accountability&#148;. Considering that
weight of evidence in favour of a defence in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>manner proposed by the amendment, will the Minister please let me know
why the Government decided not to include it in the draft
Bill?</div><a name="10031672000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s response paper to the Joint Committee&#146;s
report is noticeably light in that regard when discussing the defence,
despite the Joint Committee&#146;s concerns. Much emphasis seems to
be placed on appeasing the OECD. Paragraph 69 of the Joint
Committee&#146;s report
states:</div><a name="10031672000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government&#146;s decision to drop the defence followed objections
from the OECD. Its Working Group considered that such a defence would
be open to abuse and would contradict the general stance of the UK
legal system, under which mistake of the law is no
excuse.&#148;</div><a name="10031672000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be interested to know from the Minister why such weight was
afforded to the objections of the OECD but not to the arguments put
forward by the DPP, Professor Horder, the ICC and 19 other members of
the Law Commission&#146;s consultation who voted in favour of a
defence being drafted into the Bill.</div>
<a name="10031672000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">In evidence
to the Joint Committee, the Secretary of State for Justice stated that
not having a defence in the Bill struck the &#147;correct
balance&#148; and placed reliance once again on prosecutorial
discretion. However, two paragraphs earlier, in paragraph 68, the DPP
is recorded as saying that he preferred the option of adding a
statutory defence in the interests of &#147;transparency and
accountability&#148;. Is the Minister not concerned that the
prosecutor, whose discretion he is relying so heavily upon to moderate
the effect of the offence, has publicly asked for a statutory offence?
That concerns us, which is why we tabled the
amendment.</div><a name="10031672000293"></a>

Howarth:</b> I want to be fair to the hon. Gentleman, as I
think that that point, unlike those we discussed at length this
morning, needs to be discussed, and I will be interested to hear the
Government&#146;s responses to his questions. My view is that what
the Government have done is probably right, but I will listen to the
Minister&#146;s reply with
interest.</div><a name="10031672000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point, as the hon. Member for Huntingdon said, is of course that the
OECD did not like the idea of that extra defence. To paraphrase an OECD
official, the reason it did not like it was that it is all too easy to
obtain bad legal advice if one wants it. That might be a cynical point
of view, but given the history of corporate behaviour in this area, I
do not think it
unrealistic.</div><a name="10031672000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
point to add is that proving foreign law is a matter of fact in our
courts. The process of proving what the foreign law was would be for
the court to decide on, as a matter of fact. As to the notion that a
defendant might say that foreign law was x, and the prosecution that it
was y, I do not think that that will become an issue. It would be too
difficult for the prosecution to prove. The onus would be on the
prosecution to prove that foreign law was not what was
claimed.</div><a name="10031672000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000491"></a>Mr.

Howarth:</b> I do not think that that will arise at all in
practice, because it would be for the prosecution to prove that foreign
law was not what the defendant believed it to be. I just do not see
that happening in the way that the hon. Gentleman supposes. I suppose
that there might be circumstances in which a case that occurred in the
foreign jurisdiction showed that the law was different from what it was
thought to be at the time, but that is a very low-probability
event.</div><a name="10031672000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000493"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I spent many years practising as a corporate
lawyer advising companies working in far-away places, and often having
to look for local legal opinions. Sometimes they are almost impossible
to find; sometimes transactions happen fast and there is not a year to
find out&#151;an opinion is needed in a few days. There might be one
expert in the whole country on a given matter, particularly in
ex-Soviet countries&#151;perhaps not so much now, but certainly a few
years ago when they did not have a very developed corporate law. There
were very few lawyers who could interpret, and often their
interpretations were not of the standard that one might have expected
in our country. That can sometimes be an issue in real
life.</div><a name="10031672000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000494"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I fully accept that point with regard to trying
to find out what the courts of a particular country would do. However,
my fundamental point is that we are talking about what the courts here
would do about foreign law, and it seems to me to be an issue of fact
that the prosecution would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt, so I
do not think that the issue the hon. Gentleman raises would be a
problem in
practice.</div><a name="10031672000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031672000495"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The amendment would create a defence in
circumstances where P reasonably believed that F or a third party was
permitted or required to accept the advantage by the applicable
domestic law. I appreciate that, as has already been explained, the Law
Commission originally proposed such a defence in its report. We
considered the matter seriously and took into account the
representations and views of the OECD. We came to the conclusion that a
specific defence of the kind set out in the amendment would not be
appropriate.</div>
<a name="10031672000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
for our view is that, as has been mentioned, businesses are engaged in
transactions and business across the world, and have a responsibility
to understand the law of the countries in which they operate. If
necessary, they should have access to legal advice on the legitimacy of
payments to foreign public officials. It is not acceptable to plead
ignorance of the law as a defence in this country, and it is not
acceptable in the circumstances set out in the clause to plead
ignorance of the law in another country where one is doing
business.</div><a name="10031672000378"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1
