<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General </B>(Mr. Ross Cranston): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That during proceedings on the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Olner&#151;doubly so, because I think that we are the only two Members in the Committee who come from that vital part of the United Kingdom, the west midlands. I know you well and I know that the proceedings will move expeditiously and efficiently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): On behalf of the official Opposition, I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Olner. I welcome the passage of the Bill, at least this far, and trust that during our deliberations&#151;whether they are lengthy or otherwise&#151;the cross-party fraternity which existed at earlier stages in this place and in another will continue to be evident.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I, too, welcome you, Mr. Olner. This important Bill deserves careful scrutiny and I am sure that you will be interested in our proceedings and guide us in your usual fluent way.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are available in the Room. I remind hon. Members also that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.
<P>
Clauses 1 and 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Short title, commencement and extent</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I beg to move the Government amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 6, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
This is a formal amendment. The Bill originated in the House of Lords and the amendment removes that subsection concerning privilege.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I predicted that the Bill would be considered expeditiously and efficiently, and that has happened. I am sure that we are grateful for the way in which you have conducted the business, Mr. Olner.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am grateful for the way in which members of the Committee have acted.
