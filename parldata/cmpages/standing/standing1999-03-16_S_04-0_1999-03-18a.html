<H4><center>Memorandum from the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture</center></H4>
<H4><center>A: Overview of the Bill</center></H4>
<P>
The Medical Foundation is disappointed that the ``comprehensive, integrated strategy'' promised by the government has not been served by a consolidating Act but by an unwieldy collection of often awkwardly drafted provisions to be bolted onto all the immigration Acts going back to 1971, with only one Act repealed in its entirety. The form and content of this Bill are an eloquent testimony to the dangers of prioritising speed over quality.
<P>
We are hampered in our discussions of the Bill by the extent to which its proposals depend on sweeping and draconian powers to make delegated legislation and guidelines, with grossly inadequate restrictions on the exercise of these powers either now or in the future. The adequacy and cost, and hence viability, of the proposals are therefore not open to scrutiny.
<P>
It is an indictment of the consultation process surrounding this legislation that the reforms identified by those consulted as the key to a fairer, faster, firmer system&#151;the reform of initial fact-finding and decision-making procedures&#151;have not been addressed, and objections to the systematic social exclusion of asylum seekers have been ignored. The Minister has suggested that broad powers have been taken in order to enable account to be taken of future consultation, but the very limited impact consultation has had, and the extent to which wholly proper concerns highlighted by those participating have been disregarded, lead us to look to parliament and to amendment of the primary legislation to provide protection for our patients.
<P>
At paragraphs 9.1 and 9.8 the White Paper made commitments toward treating torture survivors with sensitivity and taking evidence of torture seriously. At paragraph 12.4 it made the commitment that evidence of a history of torture should weigh strongly in favour of temporary admission or temporary release while a claim is being considered. None of these commitments find expression in the Bill.
<P>
To realise the commitments made to torture survivors in the White Paper, it is necessary:
<P>
_to put in place specific procedures and
<P>
 &#151;to create the most propitious general conditions both
<P>
 &#151;to identify survivors of torture at the earliest possible stage; and
<P>
 &#151;to react to identification with appropriate procedures: for the provision of, and opportunities to access, appropriate care and support, for opportunities to obtain evidence of torture where appropriate and for proper evaluation of that evidence.
<P>
This has not been done. There are no specific references to survivors of torture in the Bill except for sub-paragraph 9(5) of Schedule 4, a saving provision. The systems proposed militate against early identification of torture survivors and appropriate reaction to identification.
<P>
An example will illustrate this. Historically, applications have been reconsidered in the light of new medical evidence whenever submitted. We obtained a sensible concession that the five-day time limit for submitting further evidence will not apply to medical reports. The decision would await the report. However, despite criticisms, the general five day time limit remains. Thus a survivor of torture must find a representative, and that representative arrange to see the applicant with an interpreter, obtain details of past torture, make a referral to us, obtain our response, and communicate this to the IND, all within five days, in order to benefit from the concession. Only thus will s/he avoid the negative impact upon healing of a rejection of his/her experiences in a premature and inappropriate refusal. Support provisions resulting in dispersal and isolation of survivors of torture, while limiting their own ability to take steps to seek assistance, failure to make provision for early access to independent clinicians or to representation, and failure to improve Home Office fact-finding procedures, all mean that the necessary conditions for this concession to start to yield tangible benefits are not in place.
<H4><center>B: Home Office Decision-making: The Missing Chapter</center></H4>
<P>
The White Paper and Draft Process Manual justify the harshness of support proposals on the basis that people will be subject to them only for a short time: two months for an initial decision, six to complete the appeal stage. We understand that the proposals have been costed on this basis. We have not met any officials or practitioners who believe that these time limits will be achieved. Exchanges of wry smiles are the norm when the issue of the two month and six-month time limits arises in official meetings, mocking laughter in other fora.
<H4><center>B(i): Reorganisation and Computerisation of the IND</center></H4>
<P>
As members of the User Panel we have seen for ourselves and discussed with officials the endemic delays in the IND. The system being implemented was designed to cope with the volume of cases believed to exist in 1996-7. Recent reorganisation has revealed that the directorate has a greater volume of work than it thought. The new system is not designed to cope with the current volume of work, even when fully operational. Scanning of files on to computer is not scheduled to start until late this year and will take years. Documents currently being generated are not stored on disk but will have to be scanned in later. The IND is to move back in two years into the offices now vacated for refurbishment. Current changes have added to the backlog and will not make time limits viable in future.
<H4><center>B(ii): Reform of Fact-find and Decision-making</center></H4>
<P>
A fairer, faster, firmer system depends upon getting all necessary information at the earliest possible stage and dealing with all issues in a decision that gets matters right first time. In our response to the White Paper and elsewhere we have made detailed suggestions for ways in which to achieve this where the applicant is a torture survivor, emphasising the need to focus on overall expedition, rather than shifting delays to different stages of the procedure by putting in place arbitrary and inefficient time limits. We have highlighted the need for specific improvements to the quality of fact-finding and decision-making procedures. Without such reforms, evidence of torture will continue to emerge in piecemeal fashion during successive challenges to poor quality decisions. We emphasised, inter alia:
<P>
&#151;optimising of asylum-seekers' contacts with all officials, including Port Medical officers, medical staff in detention centres, and IO's to increase the chances of identification
<P>
&#151;procedures to ensure referral of torture survivors for care and treatment, and to ensure that medical evidence was forthcoming in appropriate cases
<P>
&#151;access to a competent representative of probity with whom the torture survivor could establish a relationship of trust and confidence at the outset of fact-finding procedures
<P>
&#151;the use of a self-completion questionnaire to establish initial details of the case
<P>
&#151;improvement of the quality of decision-making inter alia by ensuring access to accurate country information through the establishment of an independent Documentation Centre
<H4><center>Key Amendments</center></H4>
<P>
New clause Transitional provisions so that the support arrangements proposed in the Bill cannot come into effect until the proposed two month and six month average times for the determination of an application are met
<P>
New clause As a minimum, safeguards for individuals whose cases are not determined within six months: access to benefits and the opportunity to work
<P>
New clauses Rights of early access to an independent clinician and legal representation during the period in emergency support, prior to dispersal, for anyone in this system
<P>
New clauses Duties on the relevant officials to ensure that those relating a history of torture are given access to specialist care and treatment and the opportunity in practice to obtain medical evidence in support of the application where appropriate
<P>
New clause Incorporation of the RWLG Gender Guidelines, supported by NUNHCR and many MPs, to facilitate identification of torture survivors in especially problematic cases
<P>
New clause Express provision in the Bill for the allocation of resources for the setting up of an independent Documentation Centre as recommended by the Consultative Group.
<H4><center>C: Part VI & Schedule 8&#151;Support</center></H4>
<P>
We commence, out of sequence, with support because this is what happens when a patient presents at the Medical Foundation. In initial contacts and subsequent sessions immediate and pressing subsistence needs prevent attempts to engage with the sequelae of torture and to commence the process of healing. We have taken a number of steps to address these difficulties: undertaking casework on housing and related problems, providing food parcels, basic toiletries and clothing, making of financial grants for travel, education, household goods and living expenses. It goes without saying that these are not the primary functions of an institution providing clinical assistance. Without them, however, many of our clinical interventions would be less effective. Indeed, some would be altogether ineffective.
<H4><center>C(i): Dispersal</center></H4>
<P>
Survivors of torture should not be compulsorily dispersed as specialised services for their care and treatment are concentrated in the London area and they cannot be accommodated in safety if dispersed to areas in which specialised support is not available. We increasingly receive requests for assistance where torture survivors have been dispersed under current arrangements, because appropriate services are not available locally. The specialist work of the Foundation, its expertise and holistic approach, and the support provided to patients and practitioners, cannot be replicated under a dispersed structure. Nor can intensive services be provided at a distance. A lengthy journey, even if the funds and assistance to make it were put in place, is not the best prelude or sequel to an appointment with a doctor, or to a counselling or physiotherapy session.
<P>
All steps to identify survivors of torture at the earliest possible stage must be taken. To this end provision must be made for access to an independent clinician, and to a representative with whom a relationship of trust and confidence can be established, during the period in emergency support. Current proposals that asylum-seekers will leave emergency support without knowledge of their new address exacerbate the problem. Where a survivor of torture is accepted for London-based care and treatment prior to dispersal, s/he should be given the choice of remaining in London to access this. Torture survivors identified after any dispersal should be given the option of returning to London to take up care and treatment there.
<P>
Early identification of survivors of torture, appropriate responses to that identification, and the obtaining of medical evidence where appropriate, require access to appropriate refugee community organisations, specialist voluntary organisations and legal representatives. They often provide the gateway through which torture survivors access specialist care, as well as providing essential support in their own right. Physical disabilities, mental distress and fears resultant from past experiences mean that some of the most isolated asylum seekers in the country are torture survivors. Dispersal to areas where there are not strong existing support network risks compounding this isolation and increasing the likelihood that evidence of torture will not emerge until a late stage, if at all, and that torture survivors will not make contact with specialist help.
<H4><center>Key Amendments</center></H4>
<P>
To Clause 76 to provide for the taking into account of a preference to remain in/return to the London area to access care and treatment for the sequelae of torture.
<P>
To Clause 76 (1)(c) to ensure that dispersal is not led solely by the availability of housing. Factors including the existence of established community and other organisations working with refugees and asylum seekers and appropriate to the particular asylum seeker, specialised medical services appropriate to the asylum seeker, access to legal advisors regulated and funded to practice in this area, appropriate linguistic support and race relations, should be included in primary legislation and not left to regulations.
<P>
To the Draft Process Manual to ensure that asylum-seekers have a destination address before leaving emergency support.
<H4><center>C(ii): A Separate and Wholly or Mainly Cashless System</center></H4>
<P>
One of the aims of the torturer is to destroy the sense of dignity, self-worth and strength of the victim. One of the central aims of the healing process is to nurture the sense of dignity, self-worth and strength of the survivor. Proposals to provide support wholly or mainly in kind rob asylum seekers of autonomy and privacy, humiliate them, and place them in a position of absolute dependency, jeopardising their psychological, and in some cases physical, health and undermining the healing process for survivors of torture.
<H4><center>Key Amendments</center></H4>
<P>
To Clauses 73-74 to provide for survivors of torture to receive welfare benefits.
<P>
	To Clause 75(2) to recognise a history of torture as an exceptional circumstance.
<H4><center>C(iii): Unsafe Provision</center></H4>
<P>
It is course unsafe that the Secretary of State, and future secretaries of State, are placed under no duty, and no-one else has any power, to support asylum seekers (Clause 74(1)). It is not only unsafe, but a threat to the rights under articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and under the Human Rights Act, to create a group at the end of the asylum process with no rights to food or shelter. These provisions, in their disregard for fundamental human rights, set the tone for the support section of the Bill. We refer you to the evidence of ILPA and others for a detailed commentary, while focusing here on the particular dangers of the failure of the Bill and Draft Process Manual to take proper account of the particular needs of vulnerable individuals, which have especially grave implications for the safety of many survivors of torture.
<P>
The destitution test for accessing support (Clause 74(3)) is the first bar to safe provision. Where the health and safety of a particular individual is jeopardised by existing arrangements and his/her needs are not being met s/he must be able to access support.
<P>
There can be no safe provision of support to a torture survivor with physical sequelae resulting in impeded functioning, distrubed sleep patterns, disturbed behaviour, or special needs for security and privacy in accommodation, if these are not taken into account. The statements in the Draft Process Manual (paragraphs 3.18, 3.21, 3.23) that support will be according to broad packages, not individually tailored, will mean that survivors of torture are not accommodated in safety. There must be reference to the particular individual in determining what are his/her essential living needs and this should be reflected in Clauses 74-76. Parliament should not grant a Secretary of State the sweeping powers sought to make regulations allowing him to ignore certain needs (Clause 78(7)(b), and, astonishingly, to deem any essential living need not to be one (Clause 74(8)).
<P>
The right of appeal to an Asylum Support Adjudicator should be extended to appeals on the level of support in order to ensure adequacy consistency of provision. Vulnerable individuals require legal representation meaningfully to exercise this right and therefore legal aid should cover these appeals.
<P>
The Draft Process Manual envisages that the provider will allocate the accommodation. Thus what is delivered to the torture survivor depends upon the provider. We understand from officials that the government is considering further amendments to the Bill extending providers' ability to determine eligibility for support. There is no reason to expect that providers will have experience of the needs of survivors of torture.
<P>
There are good reasons to doubt that a system of competitive tendering by consortia will generate the requisite provision. Potential bidders are likely to be deterred by the risks of increased racism and of the creation of an ever-growing group of destitute single adults in the area as support is withdrawn at the end of the process. In addition there is the risk that funding for accommodation and subsistence will run out or be cut because the total sum available is capped and because the calculations on uptake and length of time to be spent in the system on which it is based are flawed. Local authorities have the added disincentives of the expenses of providing for a group with special and expensive needs for language support, health and educational care.
<P>
Assuming a willingness to form consortia, it must be recognised that years of expertise in dealing with the special needs of refugee populations and the corresponding growth of networks cannot be exported overnight. Important lacunae in the Bill are that the asylum seeker is given no rights whatsoever against the provider and the provider no obligations toward the asylum seeker and no provision is made for independent monitoring of quality of service provision.
<P>
The above failures to provide for the special needs of torture survivors are compounded by the effects of Clauses 95 to 99, which will have a disproportionate impact on children and adults suffering physical and mental sequalae of torture. Officials tell us that the desired effect of Clauses 95 to 99 is that vulnerable asylum seekers in special need will receive a social services response. If this is the case then severe disablement allowance, disability living allowance and disability working allowance should not be included in Clause 95. If officials are correct then Clause 97 should be deleted, along with the equivalent provisions for Scotland in Clause 98. Clause 97 preserves no rights. Clause 97(1) baldly takes away powers of local authorities to supply assistance to vulnerable elderly people. Clause 97(2) has the same effect, but here the target is the mentally disordered, for the provisions being disapplied provide the framework for social work services for the identification, assessment, diagnosis and social treatment of mental illness. These powers are used where the needs are not being met from other sources; there is no reason to disapply them.
<P>
Clauses 96 and 99, as drafted, risk giving rise to a prima facie assumption that asylum seekers do not require a social services response. We fear that they will result in vulnerable asylum seekers, including children being passed from pillar to post as local authorities tell them that the support directorate should be meeting these needs and the directorate tells them to go to social services. Officials tell us that the word ``may'' rather than ``are being'' in Clause 99(2) is supposed to prevent a family rejecting an offer of accommodation under the support scheme and then seeking assistance from a local authority under the Children Act. If this is the case, then the clause should be redrafted to provide for this express situation and the rights of asylum-seeking children in need to the services set out in 17(1), which also provides access to services under Section 17(2) and Schedule 2 of the Act, expressly affirmed.
<P>
There should be an express statement that none of the exclusions apply to those recognised as refugees or granted ELR. In addition to these amendments, the Bill must include provision for section 74 support to act as a passport to health and other benefits, as income support and job-seekers allowance do.
<H4><center>Key Amendments</center></H4>
<P>
New Clause to place the Secretary of State under a duty to promote the well-being of asylum seekers.
<P>
To Clause 74(1) placing the Secretary of State under a duty to provide support.
<P>
To Clause 74 extending the protection of 74(5) to all asylum seekers whose claims have been decided or appeals disposed of.
<P>
To Clause 74(3) providing that the test for accessing support shall be that the needs of the individual asylum seeker cannot be met without such support.
<P>
Clause 78(7)(b) to be deleted, to remove the power to disregard the needs of individuals.
<P>
Clause 78(8) to be deleted, to remove the power to declare that any essential living need shall be not treated as such.
<P>
To Clause 84(1) to give an appeal against the level of the support provided.
<P>
New Clause to provide for legal aid for representation at appeals before an Asylum Support Adjudicator.
<P>
New Clauses To provide for the independent monitoring of the quality of service provision
<P>
New Clause To provide the asylum-seeker with enforceable rights against the provider
<P>
New Clause To place the provider under obligations toward the asylum seeker
<P>
To Clause 95 providing that it shall not apply to refugees or those granted ELR
<P>
Clause 95(b)(d)(g) to be deleted to reinstate entitlement to disability benefits
<P>
To Clauses 97 and 98 so that services can be provided to elderly and mentally disordered asylum seekers whose needs are not being met
<P>
To Clauses 96, 98 and 99 making explicit the rights of asylum seekers in need to a social services response
<P>
New Clause providing that receipt of support shall act as a passport to health and other benefits, as income support and job-seeker's allowance do now
<H4><center>D: Parts I & II&#151;Pre-Entry and On-Entry Controls</center></H4>
<P>
Torture survivors have frequently been detained or otherwise come to the attention of the authorities in their own country. The presence of visible scars may raise suspicion against torture survivors, as has been the case for many of our Sri Lankan patients. Thus many torture survivors, fearing future persecution, will be unable to risk approaching their own governments for passports or even to risk being seen to approach a foreign embassy for a visa. Unaccompanied children can face particular problems in obtaining documentation, especially when parents have died or been imprisoned.
<P>
A grant of leave to enter in the country of departure may facilitate travel for business and pleasure. A refusal of such leave will prevent survivors of torture from reaching a place of safety. Similarly with measures to penalise carriers for carrying undocumented passengers. These proposals do not distinguish those in need of protection from other travellers and no safeguards are built in to protect those fleeing persecution.
<P>
We are concerned by the breadth of clauses 9-12 on the provision of information which could put torture survivors at risk in the country in which they have been tortured. Express safeguards are essential to limit the information that can be required, the persons who can be approached, to protect confidentiality and to impose duties to inform the subject of the information that it is to be given.
<P>
To reflect the necessity for many torture survivors to resort to the use of false documents to flee and the gravity of the implications of further detention in the UK for them, we are particularly concerned to see the broad and draconian clauses 16 & 17 amended to protect them from prosecution contrary to the UK's international obligations.
<H4><center>Key Amendments</center></H4>
<P>
To Clause 1 so that leave to enter cannot be refused prior to arrival.
<P>
New Clauses and consequential amendments to make express provision for those who seek to travel to the UK to seek asylum from persecution. Pre-entry controls, such as imposing visa regimes should not be applied to countries where torture is practised.
<P>
To Clauses 9 to 12 to limit the information that can be required, protect confidentiality and provide for informing the person about whom information is to be given of this fact.
<P>
Clauses 9(7)&(8), 11(1)(e), 11(2)(d), 12(1)(e), 12(3)(c) and 12(6)(h), the combined effect of whch is to allow the Secretary of State to exchange whatsoever information he chooses with whomsoever he chooses, should be deleted.
<P>
New Clause The powers of the Independent Monitor should be extended to include monitoring of the impact of carrier's sanctions on those fleeing persecution.
<P>
To Clauses 16 & 18 to prohibit prosecutions in breach of the UK's obligations under Article 31 of the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereto.

<H4><center>E: Parts III & VIII Schedules 9, 10 & 11&#151;Bail & Detention</center></H4>
<P>
Survivors of torture at risk of detention under the Bill, despite the compelling medical evidence that the detention of torture survivors has caused serious mental and emotional effects. The White Paper made a commitment that ``evidence of a history of torture should weigh strongly in favour of temporary admission or temporary release while a claim is being considered'' (paragraph 12.4). Yet neither provisions for the running of detention centres nor those for bail address either the detection of torture survivors nor procedures to ensure that this is taken account in deciding whether or not to detain. We focus here on the failure to make good the commitment to survivors of torture, referring you to the evidence of ILPA, UNHCR and others for detailed comments on Parts III & VIII.
<H4><center>E(i): Bail Hearings</center></H4>
<P>
The Bill should expressly reflect the presumption in favour of liberty for torture survivors that underlies the commitment in the White Paper. That commitment also requires that reasons for detention and bail summaries should make express reference to any account of past torture in order that the bail hearing can address this issue. Use of a checklist as proposed in the White Paper (paragraph 12.7) is inadequate.
<P>
We have emphasised repeatedly the difficulties that a torture survivor may have in articulating what has happened to him/her and these are compounded by the fears and suspicions aroused by being detained. A requirement to provide legal representation at bail hearings for all would increase the chances of a history of torture emerging for consideration at a hearing. Extension of routine bail hearings beyond 37 days would help to ensure review of detention in the light of evidence of torture emerging at a later stage.
<H4><center>Key Amendments</center></H4>
<P>
New Clause Expressing a presumption in favour of liberty
<P>
New Clause An express prohibition on the detention of torture survivors
<P>
New Clause Statutory provision for bail summaries particular to the individual and incorporating express reference whether and what history of torture the detainee has given
<P>
New Clause Requiring provision of legal representation at routine bail hearings
<P>
To Clause 29 to provide for routine bail hearings throughout the period in detention
<H4><center>E(ii): Detention</center></H4>
<P>
The Bill fails to give statutory recognition to the rights of detainees and in particular to recognise a right to an independent medical examination prior to entry into detention, on, or during detention. The introduction of compulsory medical screening on entry into detention is not accompanied by safeguards to ensure that medical staff in detention centres do not content themselves with these powers and therefore fail to promote voluntary uptake of full medical screenings, with adequate linguistic support, at which detainees might be encouraged to disclose a history of past torture. This makes independent examination all the more essential. The criminalisation of refusal to submit to a medical examination reveals a profound lack of understanding of the fears of those tortured in detention in the past. We are concerned that the use of ``reasonably force'' in these and similar circumstances, particularly given the failure to make adequate provision for training, supervision or accountability of staff, will underscore for torture survivors the parallels between present and past detention.
<P>
Detention centre rules must, not ``may'', make provision for the safety and care of detainees. In order to ensure that survivors of torture are not wrongfully detained, not only must contacts with medical personnel prior to and on entry into detention be optimised, but officials must be under a duty to seek the consent of a detainee giving a history of torture to refer him/her for independent clinical examination. Procedures should be put in place for such referrals.
<H4><center>Key Amendments</center></H4>
<P>
New Clause setting out the rights of detainees, including to independent medical examination
<P>
New Clause imposing duties on staff where a detainee gives a history of torture
<P>
New Clause dealing with training supervision and accountability of detention centre staff.
<P>
Amend 124(2) Regulations must make provision for the safety and care of detainees, their health, well-being and procedures to be followed where detainee given a history of torture.
<H4><center>F: Part IV & Schedules 2, 3, & 4&#151;Appeals</center></H4>
<P>
We refer you to the evidence of ILPA and others for detailed comments on Part IV, which close reading suggests is at the moment far from in its final form. We welcome the intention, perhaps as yet insuffienctly developed, to provide a right of appeal on Human Rights Act grounds. There are two matters to which we wish to make specific reference.
<H4><center>F(i): Certification</center></H4>
<P>
We are opposed to certification for all the reasons we set out at the time of the passage of the 1996 Asylum and Immigration Act. The decision to retain certification should be of no moment to us because during the passage of that Act, parliament intervened to keep torture survivors out of the system of certified appeals. However, despite assurances given to the Medical Foundation that where torture was in issue there would be no certification, appeals of torture survivors have been certified because decision-makers have ignored the histories of torture they have given.
<P>
Refusal letters have also suggested that the ill-treatment suffered is not torture within the meaning of the 1996 Act for technical reasons relating to the motivation of the torturer, despite clear statements during the passage of the 1996 Act that the term torture was to apply ``to any severe form of physical and indeed psychological abuse deliberately inflicted to cause suffering'' (HL Report, 20/06/96, Cols 494-495), the aim being to protect those who had undergone a certain intensity of suffering rather than to decide an aspect of the appeal. The intention of parliament has not been given effect.
<H4><center>Key Amendments</center></H4>
<P>
Schedule 4 Part II, paragraph 9. Delete
<P>
To Schedule 4, Part II, paragraph 9 As a minimum safeguard, clarification that there is no power to certify appeals where torture is in issue
<H4><center>F(ii): Compassionate Circumstances</center></H4>
<P>
There may be strong compassionate reasons why a survivor of torture found not to face a breach of his/her human rights or rights under the the 1951 Refugee Convention on return should not be sent back to the country where s/he was tortured. The Bill provides for consideration of compassionate circumstances, but it appears that the first stage at which these will be raised will be in the grounds of appeal. We have referred to negative effects upon healing of an inappropriate refusal, effects compounded by delay. Delays will ensue either if the IND has to reopen a case it has already rejected, or if an adjudicator is the first to consider such issues, resulting in more lengthy hearings and thus a greater backlog at the appellate level. We are also concerned for those, particularly those without competent representation, who fail to articulate their compassionate circumstances clearly in the appeal form and are therefore deprived of a right of appeal. Provision should be made for the IND to invite submissions on compassionate circumstances prior to issuing a final decision where it has decided not to recognise the applicant as a refugee.
<P>
We are concerned that consideration of compassionate circumstances may be limited to ``published concessions''. A comprehensive appeal should address all compassionate circumstances, and all applicants should have such an appeal prior to removal.
<H4><center>Key Amenendments</center></H4>
<P>
To Clause 55 to place a duty on the Secretary of State to invite submissions on compassionate circumstances prior to making a decision on an application
<P>
Clause 56(2) & (8) As a minimum safeguards to exclude unpresented appellants and to allow adjudicators to consider reasons for not having detailed the ground in the notice.
<P>
Under Clauses 55 to 58 As a minimum safeguard, a concession for torture survivors Related amendments to ensure a right of appeal prior to removal and a right to raise compassionate grounds at that appeal in all cases.
<H4><center>G: Part V & Schedules 5, 6 and 7&#151;ImmigrationAdvisors</center></H4>
<P>
The Bill is extremely vague as to how regulation will work. Others will be making detailed comments on Part V, so perhaps the most useful contributions we can provide is to offer the Medical Foundation as an example of some of the uncertainties. By looking at Part V from our own point of view we can address our primary concern, which is to see it protect our patients from the poor advice all too many of them receive from a variety of sources.
<H4><center>G(i): Regulation in Practice: Example of the Medical Foundation</center></H4>
<P>
We are a registered charity. Our work is as a treatment centre, not an advice agency, but we do advise on support and on certain other asylum and refugee issues. Are we a not-for-profit business giving immigration advice within the meaning of Clause 61(2)? If so, presumably we should require an exemption or we could all end up in prison (Clause 70(1)). Our legal officer is a non-practising barrister. If she should be regulated would it be by the Bar Council or the Commissioner? Could she choose? Would she be regulated by the Bar Council even if the organisation as a whole opted for exemption? The Bill is silent on the criteria for exemption, what one must do to meet them, and on how to obtain, and retain, an exemption. Could we seek an exemption for certain areas of work, or to cover certain staff only? Must we all be competent to represent in asylum cases to obtain an exemption, or will it suffice to show that a member of staff is competent to give the sort of advice s/he provides? Will fear of the burdens of exemption, or simply of prison, prompt us to decide to cease saying anything that might be construed as immigration advice?
<P>
We do not wish to see our patients given incompetent advice by voluntary agencies, however well-intentioned. We do not want to see non-practising barristers regulated, whether by the Bar Council or by the Commissioner. We are aware that those giving excellent advice on support issues are not always those who practice in the field of asylum and would not wish to see them deprived of the right to register and/or obtain exemption just because the experts are in one regulated area only or because they provide basic advice then refer applicants on.
<P>
Survivors of torture require the assistance of competent representatives with whom they can establish a relationship of trust and confidence in order to present the often very distressing facts of their cases, a situation fundamentally misunderstood in the White Paper with its comment at paragraph 8.10 that ``legal representation is not necessary to enable an applicant to set out his or her case truthfully''. Representatives have a central role in ensuring that torture survivors get therapeutic support and, in appropriate cases, clinical evidence in support of applications. We do not want lack of clarity on regulations and exemptions, or sweeping provisions criminalising the giving of advice on asylum, to lead to competent advisors abandoning this area of work. The already yawning gap between supply and demand for competent advice on asylum is one of the circumstances that creates a market for unscrupulous advisors in the first place. Unless it is addressed we fear that regulation will be circumvented by those who levy fees to complete forms, then get their clients to sign them as though unrepresented.
<P>
Organisations such as the Medical Foundation are in a position to observe the quality of representation our patients are receiving. Officials have indicated that we shall have locus to bring complaints and we wish this reflected in the Bill.
<H4><center>Key Amendments</center></H4>
<P>
To Clause 61(20)(b) to define ``in the course of a business''
<P>
To Clause 63(2)(c) to clarify the position of non-practising or employed barristers and employed solicitors or those not in private practice
<P>
New Clauses Clarifying how the system of exemption will operate in practice
<P>
New Clauses Making provision for registration and/or exemption for particular areas of advice and for different levels of advice-giving
<P>
New Clauses Addressing the issue of access to representation, including in the context of dispersal and making appropriate provision for funding for representation and training
<P>
New Clause Detailing who will have locus to complain to the Commissioner
<H4><center>H: Children</center></H4>
<P>
The Bill exploits the UK's reservation to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (criticised by the Committee on the Rights of the Child as apparently incompatible with the Convention), which allows it to legislate on immigration without regard to the Convention.
<P>
The Bill fails to give express recognition to the needs of children for representation and to their difficulties in articulating their experiences. It does not provide for the adoption of guidelines dealing with their applications to the Home Office or appeals. Comments on support in the White Paper (8.24) included a commitment to ensuring that ``the needs of children are fully respected and their welfare and rights respected''. Both the Bill and the Draft Process Manual are silent on child protection issues. Disability living allowance is to be denied disabled asylum-seeking children. Dispersal to areas where there is a sufficiency of housing risks isolating children, be they unaccompanied or not, from connections to their cultural roots provided through communities and from the specialist care from adults, including specialist clinicians such as ourselves, who could make sense of the human rights abuses, loss and change they have experienced.
<P>
We draw particular attention to the barrier Clause 99 as drafted presents to children's access to social services support in practice. The wholly or mainly cashless subsistence system will deny asylum-seeking children access to a childhood that could be called ``normal'' by any definition and there is a risk that these support arrangements will create conditions whereby children can no longer be supported in families. Similarly with Clause 77 which means that an asylum seeking family could lose its right to agency support. Will Clause 99 deprive social services of the ability to intervene to provide assistance to keep the family together?
<P>
None of the tortured children or children of torture survivors with whom we work came to the United Kingdom of their own volition. They were brought or sent. The concerns we have outlined in parts A-G above will affect them as they will affect adults, for the sum total of the ``measures to safeguard the welfare of children'' promised by the White Paper (at 8.25) are the provision that unaccompanied children shall not be the responsiblity of the support agency but of social services, and that families with children will not be deprived of food and shelter solely because their claim is determined or their appeal disposed of.
<H4><center>H(i): Detention of Children</center></H4>
<P>
The White Paper refused to outlaw the detention of children, arguing that this would be required in limited circumstances. We oppose any detention of children and as a minimal safeguard would have expected detailed provisions in primary legislation strictly limiting the exceptional circumstances in which children can be detained. While disputes over age are being sorted out, a child or adolescent should not be detained. Any other approach undermines the White Paper's commitment to never detaining unaccompanied minors for longer than one night. A duty should be placed on all detention centre personnel to make contact with social services immediately when there is a dispute as to age. The suitability of those working in private detention centres to work with children should be subject to checks.
<H4><center>Key Amendments</center></H4>
<P>
(See also amendments proposed in Parts B to G above)
<P>
New Clause The Bill shall not come into force until above-mentioned reservation to the Convention on the Rights of the Child has been withdrawn
<P>
New Clauses & amend Clause 99 accompanied by an audit of all provisions of the Bill to make explicit provision for children's rights through both the support and the asylum determination process
<P>
To Clauses 73-74 to provide for families to receive welfare benefits
<P>
New Clauses prohibiting the detention of children. As a minimum, restricting it tightly
<P>
New Clause A duty on detention centre staff to contact social services immediately in cases of disputes as to age
<P>
New Clauses providing for checks on the suitability of providers of accommodation, detention centre staff and detention custody officers and others to work with children

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Good afternoon. Thank you for coming before us. As you have been told, we are not taking any opening statements because of time limitations. For the record, will you introduce yourselves and explain where you are from?
<P>
<B>Mr. Sherman Carroll </B>(Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture): I am the director of public affairs at the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. My colleague Ms Harvey will respond to your questions and represent the views of the foundation. For the benefit of those who are not familiar with the foundation, I should explain that we are an independent charity providing on-going care and treatment for torture survivors, the majority of whom are asylum seekers and refugees, although we also provide services to people who were formerly British prisoners of war in the far east, to holocaust survivors and to the victims of violence in Northern Ireland.
<P>
Our 115 medical doctors, clinicians and counsellors spend 13,000 person hours per year treating torture survivors. In addition to those clinical services and in response to the needs of our asylum-seeking patients we have developed caseworking services that include housing, subsistence problems and access to legal support.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> For those hon. Members who have just come in, I should point out that Ms Harvey and Mr. Carroll will stay on to participate with the next witnesses, and we should prefer certain questions to be put to them then, rather than now.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): As Sherman will know, we very much appreciate the work of the Medical Foundation, and the particularly important job that it does in catering for the victims of torture.
<P>
You have 115 medical doctors working for you, most of whom are, I gather, based in London, although I understand that some consultants from outside London advise you. The Bill would necessitate the development of a structure outside London. Whether or not you approve of that process, how best should we set about developing that structure?
<P>
<B>Ms Alison Harvey </B>(Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture): The foundation's primary plea is that survivors of torture be left in London where they can access the specialised services that we provide. If it is a question of rolling out these services across the country, what we must appreciate is that that process will take a long time. At present, people coming to us from the regions actually feel disempowered&#151;they are not gaining in skills looking after torture survivors but are becoming panicked and less capable of coping.
<P>
We received a letter a few days ago from a child psychiatrist in Liverpool stating, ``Help, we don't know what to do. If people have physical problems, mental problems, dental problems, we cannot cope.'' From Birmingham a social worker wrote, saying that they had a Kosovan 15-year-old, dispersed alone&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Forgive me, Alison. As you know, I am familiar with the points that you make, which you also made in the report.
<P>
If the Bill is passed in its current form, how are we to best develop some structures other than in London so as to cater for victims of torture? Do you think that we should not do that, or that it is not possible? I know that you have consultants who come from outside London.
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> It is possible over time. The problem is that we developed the expertise on torture survivors and then combined it with the various social subsistance housing problems that have come about over recent years. At the moment, people are facing problems so they never get to the work on torture. At present, what they need and are asking of us is the facility to refer these people back to us. Knowing that they have that back-up and support, gradually they can, with confidence, develop greater skills, but at the moment the opposite is happening: they are being deskilled in the process of dispersal. So, long term, the Medial Foundation would look not to support people, but it is a very long-term process that has taken us a long time, and the creating of a centre of excellence keeps it as on-going support.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> But it is causing problems at present, is it not? This morning I was at Rochester prison, where there are some detainees in the medical wing. They have difficulty getting support from the Medical Foundation to go out there, although it is not far from London. That is already causing problems. Is there not already a need to build this type of network beyond London?
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> We have doctors who are able to visit Rochester. As you say, that proximity to London certainly assists greatly in providing these services. It is different from providing them a long way away.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am hearing you perfectly well but, then, I am a young man in comparison to the other Committee members. The accoustics in these rooms are not particularly good so please make sure that you speak up, and do not touch the microphones, which are controlled elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I apologise for my late arrival, Mr. Maxton. I apologise particularly to our witnesses because I have been looking forward to hearing their evidence.
<P>
If I heard you right, you said that the changes in the Bill would make it even more difficult to deliver your services to torture victims because they would be in even more far-flung places than at present.
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> That is precisely so, and they are without the gateways through which they tend to come to us. The gateway is often the legal representative and the community, who give them the confidence to come to us because there is a huge problem with refugee uptake of national health service provision of any kind. Those gateways would be removed in regions where those networks are not as developed, so, even if a person was prepared to travel, he or she might not have heard of us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We would find it helpful if you could say a little about the problems faced by the people who come to you and about their experiences as victims of torture and the things with which you have to deal.
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> The problems go right across the board. We are dealing, at the moment, with various child survivors of torture. We have a team dedicated to that. To give two examples, we have a Kosovan child&#151;very badly scarred when the house was burned in a Serbian attack&#151;who is suffering from serious night terrors and serious head pains because of the damage that was done to his head. Unfortunately, he has been placed in single-person adult accommodation, which he shares with someone whom he wakes up, because he screams in the night.
<P>
Another example is a 15-year-old Kosovan woman, who has a two-year-old child. Her husband was killed by a mine as they left. She has been used to extended families. She was a mother when she was 13 years old; her child is two now. She is now in adult, single-person accommodation, and having grave difficulties.
<P>
Among adults, there is a whole range of people from different countries. The majority of our patients at the moment come from Sri Lanka and Turkey, but you will find a whole range of countries, languages and cultures. These are people who have been subject to torture, often in detention, subject to violence, and perhaps to witnessing atrocities. That is another thing&#151;seeing people killed before you and not being able to intervene or seeing your family killed before you.
<P>
Sexual torture is a particular problem for people to reveal. They have great difficulty in saying what happened to them. In the White Paper, and in several letters that we have received from officials there is this line that ``we do not see why someone should have a problem telling us the truth at their asylum interview''. In the Asylum Directorate instructions it is stated that people will be frightened, and that there will be shame and humiliation. It is difficult to tell someone in officialdom, when your last experience of officialdom was with you torturer.
<P>
The Asylum Directorate instructions say that this is in some way an ``intractable problem''. The White Paper says something along the lines of ``We don't see why people can't tell use the truth when they arrive.'' We are working with people who have not revealed for many years&#151;in one case, a lady had been here for nine years before she told anyone that she had been raped, and that her 12-year-old daughter had been raped in front of her. Another woman, whose husband we were treating because he had been tortured, had never revealed that she had been raped as a result of his torture. There was clearly a pressure building up, but it took a long time for our counsellor to get to that.
<P>
There is one more example of a woman who continued not to reveal what had happened to her. She, too, had been sexually tortured and we had a counsellor working with her. She had been refused asylum, and she eventually told the counsellor what had happened to her, which was horrendous. She then deeply regretted telling the counsellor&#151;that was a whole new problem for counselling&#151;and when the counsellor explained that she was going to put it into her medical report to go before the special adjudicator, the patient was horrified. It could not go to anyone else. She knew that it was crucial to her case, and, eventually, after further counselling, the report was written, but her reaction was, ``I shouldn't have told you. I don't want you to tell anyone else, even if my asylum claim depends on it.'' Other pressures were stronger. You can imagine that many of those people face enormous pressures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I suppose you must develop a certain amount of understanding and special skill in dealing with people from such a wide variety of backgrounds, suffering from such a wide variety of problems of torture?
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> We do and our interpreters do. That expertise is shared. There will always be someone who has more expertise or a different skill, when you feel that you have reached the limits of your expertise and skill, so that people are supported. It is frightening work for people, in many ways. The feeling of being overwhelmed is not just something that happens to the torture survivors; it also happens to people with whom they come into contact.
<P>
That is what I was describing to the Minister, in saying that the problem at the moment is that people who have skills that could grow and develop, were they supported, are feeling overwhelmed by being faced with tortured children and tortured adults. They will not engage with us. They say, ``We can't do anything. It's not working.''

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will you be asking us to take account of this need for specialist treatment when we look at the Bill?
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> We will ask for the need to be taken into account. The Minister's letter of 13 November indicated that the availability of appropriate support, including specialist support offers from organisations such as the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, will be taken into account when decisions are taken about where an asylum seeker should be accommodated.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Several Committee members wish to ask questions. There is a very short period left for these witnesses on their own. Questions about dispersal and support should be left until these witnesses are joined by the next set.
<P>
<B>Dr. Stephen Ladyman </B>(South Thanet): I want to return to the questions that Mr. O'Brien was asking, as I did not hear a clear answer.
<P>
You seem to be arguing, Ms Harvey, that as your foundation is in London, that is where people needing access to your specialised resources should primarily be based.
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> However, you also argue that you cannot rule out such resources going to other areas. East Kent has probably one of the largest populations of Kosovans. You have told us about unfortunate people who have had horrendous experiences. Presumably, east Kent is the best place for resources for them.
<P>
We need to develop a way of rolling out your resources and spreading them further afield, whether or not we like it, and irrespective of the Bill's provisions.
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> I would not disagree with that. However, I was trying to make the point that that is a gradual process. It takes a long time and entails providing support and back-up to people in the region. Those people are taking cases with which they feel unable to deal, but with support and space their own skills will gradually develop. However, one cannot make everyone confident in dealing with such difficulties by 2001.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Would those resources normally be available through the national health service?
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> No. There are huge problems with the refugee uptake of NHS services of any kind and with interpreting. Those problems should be solved within the NHS, and a lot of work is being done on that.
<P>
However, there are difficulties. Counselling, for example, normally lasts six weeks on the NHS. In six weeks one might not even start to make a difference with a torture survivor. In some cases, we counsel people for more than a decade.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Can I clarify that? Presumably, the extent of the problem faced by the people with whom you deal is clear to anybody involved with them?
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> In some cases, yes, in others, no.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> What percentage of people who are true victims of torture are assessed as genuine refugees and get leave to remain in this country? You probably do not have an exact figure, but is that percentage high or low? Is it the same as that for the general population of asylum seekers?
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> We could not say how many people are torture survivors overall, because we may not see them all. They may not come to us, and they may never be identified.
<P>
We are represented in the Asylum Directorate instructions, so the fact that we are treating people and accepting them for long-term care and treatment would probably be recognised as an important factor in assessing whether they should get status or exceptional leave to remain. So the proportion of our patients getting refugee status or exceptional leave to remain would certainly be significantly higher than that for the population as a whole. But that would not necessarily reflect torture survivors in the population as a whole.
<P>
Tomorrow we publish a report on survivors of torture from Turkey. We examined 78 of our Turkish cases that are progressing through the system. All those people are survivors of torture, and only two of them got refugee status first off from the Home Office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I have a brief question on the issue that you have just raised, which concerns the five-day limit for submitting further evidence. In your evidence you said that you now have a concession from the Home Office that the medical reports can go beyond the five-day limit to give you time to put them together.
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> Yes. The medical reports always could go beyond the limit, but the point is that the decision will await them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> You still express some concern. Do you still think that there should be a different time limit for the survivors of torture to produce their evidence, or do you think that they can do so within five days?
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> I do not think that anyone could do so within five days. The aim of an expeditious system must be overall expedition, not expedition at a particular stage of the process if that creates delays later on.
<P>
The intention is to advise survivors of torture or anyone else of their right to a legal representative. After the interview, they have five days to find a representative and to make an appointment. Within those five days, the representative has to get hold of an interpreter, to meet the person, to find out what evidence is needed, to collect it, and to send it to the Home Office. The representatives, of course, are solicitors with other clients and other jobs. It does not work. It will mean that evidence is sent in later. Were a decision to be made quickly after the five days, it would mean that evidence would be sent in post the decision. As you will be aware, we expressed grave doubts about whether there was any chance of those time limits being met.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It remains a concern for you?
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> Yes. In our case, as we said, we have the welcome and sensible concession that the decision would await the report. We could indicate that we can write a report in this case, but we care for some survivors of torture for many years on whom there would be no report, because there is not something that we can document in that way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Can I leave it at that now? Those Members who indicated that they wished to question the witnesses can do so later.
<P>
Thank you very much for your evidence. You will remain at the Table as witnesses and I will ask the next witnesses to join you.
<H4><center>Memorandum from the Local Government Association</center></H4>
<H4><center>Summary of LGA Views</center></H4>
<P>
This note summarises for members of the Committee the views of the LGA on the Immigration and Asylum Bill, focusing on the proposals in Part VI of the Bill (Support for Asylum-Seekers).
<P>
The LGA supports a national approach to the national responsibility towards asylum seekers imposed by the Geneva Convention. The proposals in the Bill will remove the intolerable burden currently placed upon a small number of local authorities for asylum seeker support, and allow for the development of strategic approaches to the placement, support and settlement of asylum seekers and refugees.
<P>
Whilst we support a national approach, we wish to emphasise that the fair and effective delivery of the proposals will rely upon local services, experience and knowledge&#151;it will be important to avoid the imposition of centrally determined arrangements. The Home Secretary has invited the LGA to develop and interim scheme for asylum-seeker support based on a national network of regional consortia which will operate prior to the bill's coming into force. The Association is working hard with the Association of London Government to develop this and believes that the statutory scheme should be built upon best practice developed in this way.
<P>
Determining immigration status is only the first step in responding to the needs of asylum seekers. The successful settlement of those who gain refugee status is the long-term issue which must be addressed. The LGA is therefore disappointed that the Bill does not also cover arrangements for settlement and we will press for the Bill to take this issue into account. This would be consistent with the government's emphasis upon an integrated approach to immigration matters.
<H4><center>Purpose of the Bill</center></H4>
<P>
The LGA supports the Government's stated aim: to develop a more flexible and streamlined system of immigration control and to introduce new support arrangements for asylum seekers in genuine need which minimise incentives to economic migration. Local government has a strong interest in both aims: the character and success of the new support arrangements will be heavily influenced by the efficiency with which asylum applications are processed.
<H4><center>Detailed comments on the Bill:</center></H4>
<H4><center>Part VI: Support Arrangements for Asylum Seekers</center></H4>
<H4><center>(a) Clause 74-Definition</center></H4>
<P>
The LGA will seek consultation on the definition of the categories of people for whom support may be provided. We are concerned that local authorities should not be inadvertently left to support those who do not meet the definition. This may apply in particular to those asylum seekers whose cases have been dismissed but who retain a legal right to be in the UK until arrangements are made for return to their country of origin.
<H4><center>(b) Clause 75-Ways in which this support may be provided</center></H4>
<P>
This may include accommodation provision for essential living needs and expenses associated with pursuing the asylum application. It is envisaged that support should not normally be given by way of cash payments.
<P>
The LGA will be seeking assurances that arrangements established under this clause will take into account the experience gained during the operation of the LGA/ALG interim scheme for asylum seeker support.
<P>
The critical importance of the successful delivery of service improvements at the Home Office cannot be over-emphasised. The character of the accommodation and support provided will be heavily influenced by the length of time asylum seekers will have to wait before their application is determined. In addition, the planned movement away from existing concentrations of asylum seekers will require the establishment of a regional IND service.
<P>
The LGA is very concerned about the use of vouchers, which evidence from local authorities with current problems shows can be costly, bureaucratic and stigmatising. There is also evidence that the vouchers are falling into the wrong hands. Those receiving vouchers, because of their desperate need for cash, will sell vouchers at below face value to cover essential items of expenditure. The Association feels that the Bill should allow some form of cash payment to provide items not available by non-cash means.
<H4><center>(c) Clause 76-Supplemental provisions</center></H4>
<P>
The need for accommodation under the Bill is only temporary pending determination of an asylum claim. Subclause 76(2) specifically prevents the Secretary of State from taking account of any preferences as to location which the asylum seeker may express.
<P>
The LGA will seek clarification that the new arrangements will allow strategic decisions to be made on accommodating asylum seekers consistent with the ethnicity of local population and the availability of support. We will press for the Bill to allow preference to be taken into account if it is consistent with the purposes and efficient operation of the scheme. This is necessary to save councils from the risk of judicial review.
<H4><center>(d) Clause 78-Secretary of State's scheme for providing support</center></H4>
<P>
This clause enables the Secretary of State to make regulations governing the operation of the support scheme, including circumstances under which payment should be made for anyone meeting certain criteria and procedural matters including an application for support. The LGA feels that clarity is essential in the wording of this clause.
<H4><center>(e) Clause 79&#151;Temporary provision of support</center></H4>
<P>
This clause provides for interim support to asylum seekers before the Home Office has the opportunity to make a formal assessment of entitlement, particularly relating to people arriving at a UK airport out of office hours or before the Home Office screening unit can make a normal assessment.
<P>
There is great concern amongst authorities dealing with this matter that the immigration service does not operate effectively out of office hours. With the removal of the local authority duty in this regard, it is essential that this issue is addressed by Government. This may be an area where the legislation would benefit from amendment.
<P>
Arrangements should be allowed for support to be given to people before they are able to find alternative accommodation or before return to their country of origin can be arranged.
<H4><center>(f) Clause 80&#151;Provision of support by local authorities</center></H4>
<P>
The specific functions of local authorities in relation to support for asylum seekers under housing and social services legislation are removed by the amendments contained in Clauses 96-99 of the Bill. This clause empowers local authorities to provide arrangements made by the Secretary of State under Clause 74. The support might be provided by the Secretary of State or someone with whom he has contracted. There is no power for authorities to make such provision in other circumstances.
<P>
An orderly transfer of responsibilities covering those who are supported under the existing arrangements and those who are supported by the LGA/ALG scheme will have to be put in place during the transitional period. The LGA would welcome close examination of the provisions of this clause by the Committee.
<P>
Interaction between support arrangements and the benefit system will also require detailed scrutiny to avoid gaps in provision.
<H4><center>(g) Clause 81&#151;Local authority and other assistance for the Secretary of State</center></H4>
<P>
The Home Secretary will be looking to the providers of social housing (essentially local authorities and registered social landlords) for assistance in the provision and management of housing accommodation and possibly in the provision of essential living needs where they are directly associated with the provision of accommodation. The clause also requires authorities to provide the Home Office with such information about their housing stock as he requests.
<P>
The LGA has concerns that the emphasis in the Bill is too narrowly on housing provision. Help to asylum seekers needs to be much wider than this and should include other public services such as education (including language support), access to health and dental care and the alleviation of racial tensions.
<P>
The LGA is also concerned that the Bill does not deal with the issue of settlement after a claim for refugee status has been determined. The Association would welcome debate in committee on the issue of settlement and whether this is an issue that should be tackled in the legislation.
<P>
No mention is made in the Bill of reimbursement for the reasonable rents and other charges for property made available through reception zones. It will be important to reflect existing local authority experience in these arrangements. Home Office officials have made it clear that this is anticipated and will be dealt with during the legislative process.
<H4><center>(i) Clause 82&#151;Reception zones</center></H4>
<P>
The provisions of this clause are intended as reserve powers for the Home Secretary if he is unable to secure sufficient accommodation by voluntary agreement with local authorities in an area. In such circumstances, he may make an order designating a reception zone in an area that he feels is suitable for the accommodation of asylum seekers.
<P>
This is potentially the most difficult clause for local authorities. It is accepted by all sides that the use of reserve powers should be avoided. There will be major practical difficulties with an imposed scheme. LGA will be seeking clarification of the purpose of this provision and the circumstances in which it might be used.
<P>
The LGA would welcome consideration by the Committee of possible ways of limiting the Secretary of State's discretion in using the reserve power. For example, he should be required in legislation to list the criteria to be met before the power is invoked.
<P>
Also, it would be consistent with the Secretary of State's reserve powers under this clause if he were also to have reserve powers to give special grants to authorities to cover expenditure paid out to asylum seekers.
<H4><center>Additional issues which LGW would like to see included in the legislation</center></H4>
<P>
Two important issues arise from the explanatory notes to the Bill rather than the Bill itself.
<P>
The LGA/ALG interim scheme for asylum seeker support will operate under existing legislation. However, there will be an opportunity to introduce interim provisions, which would come into force at Royal Assent, to allow local authorities to create temporary tenancies for asylum seekers in their own housing stock without the need to do so via a third party as at present.
<P>
The Bill only refers to spare housing accommodation, and not the potential to construct a sound base for the support of asylum seekers. The LGA would argue that housing stock alone is not sufficient for the safe and suitable dispersal of asylum seekers. Other local factors&#151;social, health, environmental amongst them&#151;are crucial. Consortia of local authorities as community leaders are best placed to assess this locally. It is hoped and expected that consultation will take place with the Home Office on this crucial and potentially controversial power.
<H4><center>Other issues</center></H4>
<P>
The invitation to submit evidence to the committee asked for four questions in particular to be answered:
<H4><center>1) Seriousness of problem the Bill is intended to solve</center></H4>
<P>
The LGA has agreed that the Association of London Government and Kent County Council, both of whom are giving oral evidence alongside LGA, shall lead on this question as it is in these areas where the most acute problems have arisen to date.
<H4><center>2) Extent to which provisions of the Bill implement the White Paper proposals</center></H4>
<P>
LGA considers the Bill's provisions on support for destitute asylum seekers to implement adequately the White Paper proposals. There are issues included in the Bill, such as designation of reception zones, which were not in the White Paper and with which the LGA has some concerns.
<H4><center>3) Ease of implementation of the Bill's provisions</center></H4>
<P>
There are several crucial issues on which implementation of Part VI of the Bill will rest, central to which is the success of the voluntary scheme which the LGA is establishing before the legislation is introduced:
<P>
_Settlement&#151;the LGA will continue to reiterate this point. The Government will need to address arrangements for successful settlement and the financing of additional related costs or this will undermine the achievement of a scheme based on the active participation of local agencies.
<P>
_Link with social exclusion&#151;there is a need to co-ordinate the placement of asylum seekers with local and central government policies aimed at combating social exclusion. Many areas with available housing will require additional support services in order to avoid exacerbating existing problems of social exclusion.
<P>
_Secure financial arrangements&#151;these will be essential to underpin the proposals. There are particular concerns in relation to the unaccompanied children.
<P>
_Liaison with Government agencies&#151;the Home Office will need to deliver process reforms, to develop a regional service, and to notify local authorities of decisions promptly.
<P>
_Community support&#151;the inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence has clearly affirmed the moral obligation upon British society and its public institutions to confront and combat racism. The Government will need to give full consideration to ensuring that those seeking asylum are able to reside in communities free from the threat of racism.
<H4><center>4) Human Rights Implications</center></H4>
<P>
Where delivery of support to asylum seekers is carried out by a local authority or other body, albeit acting under contract with the Home Office, the local authority or body will need to ensure that its policy decisions and actions in individual cases are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Any action by them, which is incompatible with the Convention, will be unlawful, and it seems to the LGA that there is every likelihood that legal challenges will be brought which will test the scope of relevant Convention rights. The Articles which are likely to be most relevant in informing policy and case work decisions are: Article 2 (right to life); Article 3 (prohibition on degrading treatment) Article 5 (liberty and security of person); Article 6 (fair determination of civil rights); Article 8 (respect for private and family life); Article 14 (enjoyment of Convention rights without discrimination).
<P>
Training for local authority members and officers, indeed for all public authority officials working with asylum seekers, will be essential to ensure that authorities' policies and actions in individual cases are informed by the Convention and compatible with it.
<H4><center>Memorandum from the Association of London Government</center></H4>
<H4><center>Introduction</center></H4>
<P>
The Association of London Government was formed in April 1995 following the merger of the Association of London Authorities and the London Boroughs Association. The ALG represents the 32 London boroughs, the City of London Corporation and London Fire & Civil Defence Authority. The ALG's central role is to provide member authorities with a single voice in negotiations with central government. It advises on a wide range of issues affecting London local government.
<H4><center>The ALG's opposition to the 1996 Acts</center></H4>
<P>
The ALG opposed the provisions of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 and the Housing Act 1996 during their passage through Parliament. The Association was concerned that the removal of entitlement to social security benefits would result in an intolerable additional burden on local government. In the absence at that time of a fair scheme for the reimbursement of costs the ALG believed that unacceptable financial costs would fall on the London boroughs who received the majority of asylum seekers entering the UK.
<P>
The ALG's concerns were borne out in practice. Following a court judgment it was confirmed that as a consequence of the 1996 Acts, local authorities were under a duty to support destitute asylum seekers under the National Assistance Act 1948 and the Children Act 1989.
<P>
Following the passing of the 1996 Acts the ALG published comprehensive guidance for London local authorities1 and a copy of that guidance is attached to this evidence.
<H4><center>The current levels of support to asylum seekers in London</center></H4>
<P>
The total cost of services to some 49,000 destitute asylum seekers in London in 1998-99 is an estimated &#163;160 million. In the current year, the Government has substantially improved the special grants that reimburse the cost of services and have provided an additional &#163;30 million to offset the expenditure incurred by local government.
<P>
There are currently 49,000 destitute asylum seekers supported by the London boroughs. This figure includes 9,500 families with children, 15,300 single adults, and 2,000 unaccompanied children and young people (February 1999). Because of the complexity of legislation governing this area, support has to be provided in a wide variety of different ways:
<P>
_Social services and housing departments in the London boroughs provide accommodation (usually bed and breakfast), and subsistence.
<P>
1No Place to Call Home&#151;Association of London Government October 1996.
<P>
&#151;The constraints of the National Assistance Act 1948 mean that the boroughs may not provide cash payments to single adults. The boroughs, therefore, either secure provision of meals by the hotel, provide pre-prepared meals, or issue vouchers to enable individuals to purchase food and drink. Vouchers must be designed in such a way as to minimalise fraud and to ensure that the voucher has no cash value.
<P>
&#151;Families with children are provided with cash payments as permitted by the Children Act 1989. Cash payments are generally 90 per cent. of current income support levels, in keeping with the general policy of the Department of Social Security.
<P>
&#151;Unaccompanied children and young people are generally accommodated in children's homes or with foster carers. Cash payments have been provided to young people (16 and 17 years of age) occupying semi-independent or independent accommodation; a number of boroughs have withdrawn cash payments due to fraud by persons evidently over 18 years of age.
<P>
&#151;The boroughs provide housing benefit to asylum seekers entitled to remain in the UK.
<P>
&#151;The boroughs are responsible for the provision of social care services on assessment.
<P>
&#151;The boroughs are also responsible for the education of children and assistance is given with school uniforms and meals as appropriate.
<P>
&#151;The boroughs have a responsibility for the provision of travel permits and telephone cards to enable asylum seekers to attend interviews with their solicitor or immigration adviser, the Immigration and Nationality Department of the Home Office and any other essential visits.
<H4><center>Additional effects on the boroughs</center></H4>
<P>
Additional costs are incurred by the London boroughs in the administration of the support of destitute asylum seekers. The administrative costs are in the region of 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. of the total cost for each asylum seeker, reflecting the need to secure services, conduct individual assessments, maintain the review process and the security of premises and arrange the employment of additional staff.
<P>
Opportunity costs are incurred in the provision of hostel and other public sector accommodation for asylum seekers when buildings can not be released for other purposes, including sale.
<P>
In addition, the London boroughs' effort to minimise the use of hotels for temporary accommodation has been disrupted. The number of statutory homeless households has increased by 21 per cent. since 19972. A total of 52,932 households were living in temporary accommodation at the end of September 1998, including 27,252 asylum seeker households (including 18,740 destitute asylum seekers).
<P>
2 Homelessness in London Bulletin 14&#151;London Research Centre February 1999
<P>
As at September 1998, 7,500 asylum seekers (28 per cent) were accommodated in hotels, 12,400 in the private rented sector (46 per cent) 2,500 in hostels (9 per cent) and 4,800 in other (18 per cent) forms of accommodation.
<P>
There is acute pressure on temporary accommodation in the London area. The boroughs can now incur costs of up to &#163;200 a week for single adults and &#163;300 per week for families in London. The London boroughs can be in competition for scarce accommodation and the lack of provision has forced the boroughs to seek affordable alternative supply outside of the boroughs.
<P>
Accommodation is more readily available outside London and at a lower cost for equivalent quality. The London boroughs are now placing destitute asylum seekers in hotels in Newcastle upon Tyne, Hull, Liverpool, Stoke on Trent, Derby, Birmingham, Great Yarmouth, Eastbourne, Hastings, St Leonards, Southsea, Margate, Southend, Bexhill, Lancing, Brighton and Windsor and other accommodation has been provided as far away as Liverpool and Wales.
<P>
The primary purpose of social services is the provision of children's services and social care to adults and not the support and maintenance of destitute asylum seekers. While the provision of this support is evidence of the capacity and flexibility of London social services, it has been an additional responsibility.
<H4><center>The Government's Proposals</center></H4>
<P>
The ALG believes that the current arrangements are not sustainable. The present law is inconsistent and offers a complex web of entitlement to assistance with support services, housing and employment. The boroughs have incurred legal costs in dealing with the complexity and uncertainty of the present arrangements.
<P>
The current arrangements are complex to administer. For example, many destitute asylum seekers who are not eligible for income support may claim housing benefit. Asylum seekers who are not entitled to be offered a local authority tenancy (Part VI of the Housing Act 1996) may be allocated, if eligible, temporary accommodation (Part VII of the Housing Act 1996).
<P>
In order to reclaim grant and check eligibility the London Boroughs may be required to check immigration status of asylum seekers. There is no routine system of notification of changes in refugee or immigration status.
<P>
The Government's proposals have the potential to place responsibility for all services to asylum seekers with a single Government department.
<P>
The asylum support directorate will contract with a range of providers, including local government, for the supply of accommodation and subsistence. It will be better placed to secure best value services than local authorities acting individually.
<H4><center>Detailed views on the Clauses</center></H4>
<H4><center>Clause 74: Persons for whom support may be provided</center></H4>
<P>
The ALG supports the proposal to give the Secretary of State powers to provide accommodation and subsistence to destitute asylum seekers.
<P>
The Government has indicated that asylum seekers may have access to other services provided by local government. A small number of people may seek the assistance of social services if they have mental health problems or suffer mental or physical disability. The ALG is concerned that the arrangements for the referral of asylum seekers by the proposed asylum support directorate should be robust.
<P>
Each year between 250 and 500 unaccompanied children arrive at the major airports. Immigration officers refer the majority to the London boroughs.
<P>
The ALG has requested detailed consultation on the arrangements for the support of the children.
<H4><center>Clause 75: Ways in which support may be provided</center></H4>
<P>
The ALG has advised the Home Office that it may be necessary to provide some cash payments to enable asylum seekers to cover minor incidental expenses and that it is administratively simpler to do so. The Bill makes provision for this. There should be flexibility in the arrangements to meet special circumstances such as the arrival of asylum seekers from a country with a warm climate in winter. The scheme should enable assistance with items such as school uniforms and school meals for children.
<H4><center>Clause 76: Provision of support: supplemental</center></H4>
<P>
The Home Office has announced its intention to consult local authorities and others concerning the regulations. The regulations will need to take into account specific ethnic or religious requirements and, where practical, the asylum support directorate should be empowered to locate asylum seekers close to one another where mutual support can be provided.
<H4><center>Clause 78: Secretary of State's scheme for providing support</center></H4>
<P>
The ALG welcomes the powers to make regulations setting out the support scheme. There is no framework at present and there have been instances where asylum seekers have sought assistance from a number of local authorities in succession. The publication of the arrangements will provide clarity in the terms of the scheme that will be established.
<H4><center>Clause 80 & 81: Provision of support by local authorities</center></H4>
<P>
Local government is now developing regional consortia that will assist the proposed new arrangements in enabling the supply of accommodation. Local authorities will join to provide accommodation and support services in regions throughout the country to improve the supply and quality of accommodation and support. A copy of the initial guidance to authorities produced by the ALG and Local Government Association is attached.
<P>
The arrangements will relieve the pressure on the London boroughs and are expected to lead to the use of surplus local authority and social landlord stock.
<H4><center>Clause 82: Reception zones</center></H4>
<P>
The local authorities have, since 1996, developed collaboration in the provision of accommodation to destitute asylum seekers, involving private sector providers, registered social landlords and voluntary agencies. There is a high degree of dispersal of asylum seekers at present, reflecting the scarcity of accommodation in the London area and the need to secure affordable accommodation.
<P>
The arrangements have been made to both secure accommodation and support services, and to enlist assistance in the provision of translators, legal representation and other facilities necessary for the settlement of asylum seekers.
<P>
It is not practical for the proposed asylum support directorate to provide a range of services for all asylum groups in every locality. The proposed model of reception zones is likely to provide a cost-effective solution. The development of regional consortia on a voluntary basis by local government is expected to reduce the need for the Secretary of State to exercise the proposed power.
<H4><center>Clause 91: Payments to local authorities</center></H4>
<P>
The ALG welcomes the power to make payments to local authorities for expenditure they incur providing support to asylum seekers and to those who have been asylum seekers. The ALG welcomes the Government's intention to consolidate responsibility for the provision of assistance to local councils within the Home Office and this should simplify the provision of special grants.
<P>
There should be provision for the reimbursement of the cost of local authority accommodation and the provision of services including education and social services.

<H4><center>Settlement</center></H4>
<P>
Local authorities have a strong record of supporting refugee communities. Local government has assisted successive groups through the provision of housing, education and social services. The London boroughs have provided extensive support to voluntary agencies. They aim to promote social inclusion and, often in conjunction with voluntary organisations, provide support for community activity, recreation and leisure and training for employment.
<P>
The ALG has asked the Government to consider support for local authority expenditure on the settlement of refugees. There are currently 50,000 asylum seekers already in the UK awaiting determination of their cases. In the future it is likely that 5,000 to 9,000 new applicants will be entitled to remain in the UK each year. Large numbers of these asylum seekers are likely to seek the assistance of their local councils for services such as permanent housing, language tuition or special assistance at school.
<H4><center>Conclusion</center></H4>
<P>
The ALG welcomes the new framework for the provision of services to asylum seekers introduced by the Immigration and Asylum Bill and, in particular, the establishment of a single agency with responsibility for the assessment and support of destitute asylum seekers. The current arrangements are not sustainable and the present law is contradictory, offering a complex and confusing web of entitlement which is difficult to administer.
<P>
The Association would wish to see consultation on the arrangements for referring asylum seekers to local authorities, particularly those with special needs, such as mental health problems or mental or physical disabilities. Arrangements for the support of unaccompanied children and young adults will also require detailed consultation with local government.
<P>
The Association has advised the Home Office that it may be necessary to provide some cash payments to enable asylum seekers to cover minor incidental expenses and that it is administratively simpler to do so.
<P>
The Association has asked the Government to consider support for local authority expenditure on the settlement of refugees.

<H4><center>Memorandum from Kent County Council</center></H4>
<P>
1. POSITION STATEMENT
<P>
1.1 As at March 1999, Kent County Council (KCC) is supporting, via Social Services, some 1300 asylum seekers, predominantly in the districts of Dover, Thanet and Shepway. In addition, there are resident in Kent an unknown number (estimates range from 1000 to 2000) of asylum applicants and their dependants on Income Support or self-supporting through officially-approved employment. The LEA is aware of the presence of 570 dependent children of asylum applicants or unaccompanied minors who are of statutory school age.
<P>
1.2 The County of Kent which comprises twelve district authorities and one unitary authority as well as KCC, is distinguished by the following characteristics:
<P>
_it has, in Dover, by far the largest marine passenger/road freight port of entry into the UK;
<P>
_the special circumstances of housing duties and social services responsibilities resting separately in, respectively, the district councils and the county council;
<P>
_Kent being largely a rural area, except in the north-west of the county, characterised by a dispersed rural population and small to medium-sized towns.
<P>
1.3 Largely by virtue of its `frontier' location, Kent has witnessed, perhaps more so than elsewhere, a significant number of `group arrivals' increasingly often intercepted as clandestine entrants. This has caused specific difficulties and demands in terms of providing emergency reception facilities on behalf of the Immigration Service and Migrant Helpline (without adequate facilities of their own) whilst backlogs of documentation are cleared.
<P>
1.4 KCC believes it is well-placed, therefore, to comment on key aspects of the Bill, particularly Part VI which deals with support arrangements, and is pleased to have the opportunity to give evidence before the Special Standing Committee.
<P>
2. THE FOUR KEY QUESTIONS
<P>
The invitation to submit written evidence requests that contributors address four key questions.
<P>
2.1 SERIOUSNESS OF THE PROBLEM THE BILL IS INTENDED TO RESOLVE
<P>
2.1.1 KCC believes, for the reasons set out in its position statement, it has experienced serious difficulties, for which it could not have prepared, over the last three years. Principal amongst these difficulties has been the logistical demands of becoming an alternative income maintenance and accommodation provider agency, for which it has been inadequately compensated, and the frequent `group arrivals' which disrupt day-to-day operations.
<P>
2.1.2 In the face of rapidly rising numbers, there have been additional difficulties associated with access to educational provision, access to health care and managing community tensions.
<P>
2.1.3 These difficulties, it has to be said, have been compounded by the absence of both coherent policy guidance and lack of coordination between by government departments, (e.g. the confusion over Housing Benefit) as well as inflammatory coverage in some parts of the media.
<P>
2.1.4 Having said that, it is important to keep the scale of the problem in its context. Whilst supporting significant numbers of asylum seekers has imposed great pressures on KCC's staff and resources and, at times, been temporarily disruptive of other services, this is not to say that Kent has been `swamped'. Rather, Kent, along with London, has taken a disproportionate part of a national responsibility.
<P>
2.1.5 The key point in this respect is that the greatest problems are experienced in those localities where significant numbers are concentrated, such as Dover and Thanet, due to the relatively ready availability of cheaper accommodation&#151;although not necessarily the other services upon which asylum seekers may need to call.
<P>
2.1.6 Kent strongly supports a policy of sensitive and carefully-managed dispersal. To ensure this is delivered, Kent believes this will require a comprehensive approach which, in addition to the provision of accommodation and living expenses, must take account of education and health provision. Also bearing in mind that it is likely that approximately one third of applicants (plus their dependants) will be granted some form of permission to remain, employment issues, more permanent accommodation capacity, cultural and linguistic considerations will need to be borne in mind too.
<P>
2.2 EXTENT TO WHICH PROVISIONS OF THE BILL IMPLEMENT THE WHITE PAPER PROPOSALS
<P>
2.2.1 Of particular interest to local authorities in Kent will be arrangements for the provision of accommodation and support to asylum applicants and their dependants pending decision/appeal and issues of settlement for those granted exceptional leave to remain (ELR) or full refugee status.
<P>
2.2.2 Part IV of the Bill and the Explanatory Notes lack sufficient detail about the proposed support arrangements and arrangements for gaining access to educational and health provision upon which to offer a definitive opinion. A detailed commentary on these matters is the subject of a subsequent section of this submission.
<P>
2.2.3 KCC believes that the sustainability of the proposed support arrangements is likely to be significantly dependent upon the speed with which decisions are made and appeals dealt with. It is noted that the notional operational targets of two months and four months are not referred to in the Bill or Explanatory Notes. In view of the public commitment to these targets and their importance in establishing viable support arrangements, it is suggested that timescales for decision-making and appeals processes are included in the statutory framework.
<P>
2.2.4 The time it takes currently to reach final decisions leads to a misuse of public funds and is unfair to asylum applicants. It is also suggested that monitoring of the efficiency of the decision-making process could be implemented via Regulations.
<P>
2.3 EASE OF IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THE BILL'S PROVISIONS
<P>
2.3.1 Overall, it appears that the Bill is implementable. Having said that, it is KCC's view that the Bill's provisions on support arrangements oversimplify the range of needs that will need to be met, by largely restricting provision to accommodation and support for essential living expenses. Even if the process is successfully speeded up, the failure to address educational or health issues explicitly, is a worrying omission. Kent believes these matters can and should be dealt with in the Bill and would argue that Special Grant arrangements, akin to those for Social Services, could offer a way forward.
<P>
2.3.2 It is noted that the Bill makes no reference to the longer-term circumstances of those people who are granted ELR of full refugee status. Whether or not the Bill is amended to take this issue into consideration, it seems incumbent on central government to take this issue on board urgently if a policy of national dispersal, managed by the Support Agency regime, is to prove sustainable in the longer term.
<P>
2.3.3 Great care will need to be taken to ensure, via transitional arrangements, that the transfer from the current to future support arrangements is carried through carefully and with minimal disruption for asylum seekers and providers at the point of transfer.
<P>
2.4 HUMAN RIGHTS IMPLICATIONS
<P>
2.4.1 A single `no choice' offer of accommodation, which specifically excludes expressed preferences being taken into account could, it is believed, lead to circumstances where this approach is challengeable.
<P>
3. DETAILED COMMENTARY ON PART VI&#151;SUPPORT FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS
<P>
3.1 KCC believes there is much to be commended in the principle that the Home Office retains responsibility to assist those whose applications for asylum it is considering. At a minimum, it will simplify the current confused and fragmented arangements, has the potential to relieve the burden falling disproportionately, by accidents of history or geography, on a relatively small number of local authorities and locates responsibility in the one agency which has the greatest vested interest in ensuring applications are dealt with efficiently.
<P>
3.2 Subject to further detail becoming available, KCC forsees a number of operational, logistical and resource difficulties arising from the provisions of the Bill&#151;not least for the range of providers with whom, it is proposed, the Support Agency will contract. KCC strongly encourages that consideration is given to the use of technology to enhance operational efficiency, e.g. the use of photo ID cards which double as `smart cards' for the disbursement of living expenses, whilst simultaneously precluding their use for the purchase of non-essentials.
<P>
3.3 In relation to Clause 74, it will be important to ensure that the definition of those eligible for support and the circumstances in which they become eligible for support is dovetailed carefully with the proposed legislative amendments detailed in Clauses 96-99 and Schedule 12 (pertaining to housing legislation). Failure to do so could inadvertently leave the UK at risk of being in breach of its duties under the 1951 convention if loopholes are inadvertently created.
<P>
3.4 It is clearly the intention of Clause 75 that support is limited as far as possible to the provision of accommodation and meeting essential living expenses by non-cash means. The experience of KCC in providing vouchers, rather than cash, is that it is administratively burdensome, costly and fails to take into account many items which can be reasonably deemed essential but cannot be bought with vouchers. It is also a method which is stigmatising for asylum seekers, generally unpopular with shops and supermarkets and has led to frictions between asylum seekers and other shoppers. KCC endorses the view of the Local Authority Associations that the Bill should make provision for some element of cash payment.
<P>
3.5 KCC supports strongly the policy intention which lies behind Clause 76&#151;that is to say, the policy of national dispersal aimed to relieve pressures in areas of greatest concentration such as London and Kent. Nevertheless the implementation of this Clause, as it stands, is seen as fraught with potential operational, legal and human rights difficulties. There is a case, it is believed, for tempering the provisions of this Clause (most appropriately in the regulations governing the operations of the Support Agency) to balance reasonable preferences with the needs of a sensitive, managed policy of dispersal.
<P>
3.6 The regulations which will give effect to Clause 78 are at the absolute heart of the Support Agency's operations. These&#151;coupled with the provisions concerning reception zones (Clause 82)&#151;will heavily influence the success or failure of policies of sustainable support arrangements and national dispersal. KCC, in common with the Local Authority Associations, believes that absolute clarity is needed on these issues and that detailed discussions to devise the operational framework will need to involve local authority interests, prior to regulations being brought in.
<P>
3.7 The provisions, in Clause 79, to provide temporary support pending fuller assessment are welcomed&#151;not least of all because the powers of local authorities to do so under social services and housing legislation will be removed by Clauses 96-99. KCC&#151;and partner authorities and organisations in Kent&#151;have considerable experience of such short-term reception activity and are willing to work with the Home Office to develop models of good practice for facilities adjacent to major ports of entry. From experience, Kent's view is that demands for such temporary support could be lessened by the enhancement of Immigration Service operations ``out of hours''.
<P>
3.8 It is of concern that in Clauses 81 and 82 support is, again, spoken of largely in terms of accommodation. Indeed, it is a general deficiency in Part VI of the Bill that support is perceived predominantly as accommodation and ``in kind'' provision of essential living needs. Such a narrow interpretation of ``support'' belies the realities that local authorities and other public services have experienced&#151;pressures on school places, in areas of greatest concentration, for school age children of asylum applicants; pressures on school support services (e.g. language support and pre-enrolment assessment); access to primary (and therefore, secondary or specialist) health care and dental care and, perhaps most tellingly, managing community tensions.
<P>
3.9 KCC remains unconvinced that, on its own, speeding up the decision-making and appeals process will reduce these other demands&#151;indeed, such needs are often most evident shortly after arrival. Similarly, a speeded-up process, rather than diminish such support needs&#151;for example, schooling&#151;may call for them to be met in radically different ways, for which current education legislation does not make provision.
<P>
3.10 The key&#151;and final&#151;point is that unless support needs are seen in a more comprehensive way and unless the designation of reception zones takes a comprehensive view of asylum seekers needs and also local circumstances, a policy for sustainable dispersal (i.e. effective settlement for those granted ELR or full refugee status) will not be delivered. It is feared that a Support Agency system which takes too narrow a view of need and is inflexible in the allocation of accommodation may prove self-defeating in terms of dispersal and subsequently, for those applicants granted ELR or refugee status (and their dependants), more permanent settlement.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Lord Harris, thank you for coming with your colleagues this afternoon to give evidence. I do not know whether you were here for the first part of our sitting. I am not asking for an opening statement. Will each of you briefly introduce yourselves and then we will go straight to questions.
<P>
<B>Lord Harris </B>(Association of London Government): I am Toby Harris. I am leader of the London borough of Haringey and I chair the Association of London Government. I also sit on the Local Government Association's special group considering this issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Ransford </B>(Local Government Association): I am head of social affairs, health and housing at the Local Government Association.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Gilroy </B>(Kent County Council): I am director of Kent social services and I can introduce Jan Askew, my senior manager, who has more operational experience than me about issues affecting Dover and Thanet and that part of east Kent where we have had all the difficulties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Brangwyn </B>(Association of London Government): I am social policy officer at the Association of London Government.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> You are all free to answer any of the questions put by Committee Members. However, it will take a lot of time if everyone answers every question.
<P>
<B>Ms Diane Abbott </B>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington): I have two questions. One is on the arrangements for support and dispersal, which I want to put to the local authority representative. First, I have a question specifically for the representatives of the Medical Foundation. It relates to the section of their submission headed ``Home Office decision-making: the missing chapter''. I am unhappy about the arrangements for support in any event, but Ms Harvey made the important point that they are only barely acceptable if there are to be two months for the initial decision and six months to complete the appeal. I note that you are members of the user panel at the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, so it would be helpful for my colleagues if you set out your views on the realistic nature of the proposed time limits.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> Unfortunately, we do not think that the time limits are realistic. As indicated in our submissions, that view was shared by all the officials we spoke to. The longest quote that I received from a senior Home Office official as to how long it would take to meet the time limits was centuries. Others contented themselves with raised eyebrows or something a little less unequivocal. The Public and Commercial Services Union is giving evidence on Tuesday. It indicated its scepticism in response to the White Paper and also dealt with resource issues.
<P>
We have contended and we continue to contend that the difficulty is not just operational problems, though they are enormous. The new system was not designed for what it is being asked to cope with. It cannot be the solution to all problems. We are also concerned that to make the system faster, changes will have to be made to the way in which cases are decided. In cases of torture survivors, changes have to be made to identify them earlier in the process. As much accurate information as possible is necessary in fact finding.
<P>
We showed that interviews on arrival do not do that. They throw up discrepancies which then get argued about for ever more. Representation is crucial if speed is wanted and for a swift reply to letters. That is fundamental. Asylum Directorate instructions now say, ``Do not ask the person about torture if they do not mention it'' and ``Never invite a medical report''.
<P>
We received many letters from Ministers' officials saying that they would not insist on a mandatory medical examination. That is quite right. Nor would we: consent is the issue. What we object to is an Asylum Directorate instruction that says, ``Never invite a medical report''. Procedural changes have to be made if one is to get all the facts followed by a good decision.
<P>
As our report on Turkey indicates, a Home Office decision may say, ``You claim that you were tortured'' without indicating whether or not it is accepted. The adjudicator is the judge at first instance of that matter of fact. Such a decision is not a refusal letter; but the vast majority in our survey were like that, as was confirmed by other evidence. That problem has to be addressed and made the central point. We would argue that support arrangements should not start until those time limits have been met. If the Government are confident that they can meet them, an amendment to that effect should not cause them any terrors.
<P>
Ms Abbott: That leads me naturally to Lord Harris, who is the leader of an adjoining borough. I am going to cut to the chase with you. As you might expect, I think that forced dispersals are wrong in principle. However, I also have a serious question as to whether dispersal will work. I am not familiar with the refugee committees in Kent, but I am familiar with refugee communities in north-east London. My concern is that dispersal will not work and that the pool of extended family networks, informal social support, mosques and other structures will draw destitute asylum seekers back from wherever they have been dispersed.
<P>
So, Lord Harris, can you look me in the eye and tell me that you are absolutely confident that the dispersal arrangements will work and that Haringey, Hackney, Islington and Southwark will not be faced in 12 months' time with broadly the same population of refugees, but increasingly impoverished and destitute?
<P>
Lord Harris: I cannot look you in the eye&#151;
<P>
Ms Abbott: I bet you cannot.
<P>
Lord Harris: Not on the point that you are making. I cannot look you in the eye and say with certainty that there will be more or less in terms of numbers, because I do not know what the flow will be over the next year. However, I can say that London boroughs are already using a significant number of out-of-borough placements. In the case of Haringey, about which you asked, there are 105 asylum seekers as of today&#151;mostly single adults&#151;who are placed outside the borough boundaries. We are aware of similar figures from a number of other authorities.
<P>
What is critical&#151;and what we as a London borough have sought to do at this stage in events&#151;is to ensure that we put in place and encourage the creation of adequate support arrangements in the areas where we are placing people.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I do not want to interrupt you, but that almost goes without saying. What I am asking you, almost as a colleague, is whether you believe in forced dispersal.
<P>
<B>Lord Harris:</B> In respect of what we are doing at the moment, we are not talking about enforced dispersal.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Yes, but it is what the Bill is talking about. Do you believe in forced dispersal? The people in Haringey would be interested to know.
<P>
<B>Lord Harris:</B> It is not sustainable for London boroughs to be expected to deal with far more people&#151;
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Again Toby, that goes completely without saying. I am asking you a straight question. Do you believe in forced dispersal?
<P>
<B>Lord Harris:</B> I do not believe that it is viable for London&#151;
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Can you answer the question Toby? Let me ask you one more time: do you believe in forced dispersal?
<P>
<B>Lord Harris:</B> I do not believe that it is appropriate for London boroughs&#151;
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> You cannot answer the question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): In their evidence, both the Association of London Government and the Local Government Association comment on what is happening now. You mentioned that arrangements are now being made to disperse people across the country. In the ALG evidence, commenting on clause 82 and the high degree of dispersal at present you said that ``The arrangements have been made to both secure accommodation and support services, and to enlist assistance in the provision of translators, legal representation and other facilities''. Can you give us some examples of what is happening on that? Evidence that we have been given in the last couple of days has said precisely the opposite and that the translation and legal representation support systems will not be there.
<P>
<B>Lord Harris:</B> I can certainly speak for the people who have been placed outside the borough of whom I am aware. A great deal of effort has been made to ensure that support procedures and the availability of resources for a translation system have been put in place. Contacts have been made with local community and church groups. We have also made sure that there is regular liaison with refugee groups from within my own authority. They go out and visit and make sure that support structures are satisfactory.
<P>
Having said that, and this partly deals with the question that I apparently did not answer satisfactorily a few minutes ago, it is clear that it requires a great deal of effort and a great deal of work to make sure that those support structures are adequate and satisfactory for people who are placed outside the area. It is important that appropriate arrangements are made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> At the moment they are for 105 people.
<P>
<B>Lord Harris:</B> That is the case for my authority. The figures that we have for Westminster are 180 adults in accommodation spread around Liverpool, Luton, Portsmouth, Great Yarmouth and Sussex. Other boroughs including Brent, Lambeth, Kensington and Chelsea and Newham are also placing adults out of their areas. Those are the ones of which I am aware.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> You are saying that even dealing with that number is taking a lot of effort and resources.
<P>
<B>Lord Harris:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> So what effort is needed to deal with 20,000, 30,000 or 40,000 people?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> More, and it is must be done on a planned basis. At present, the practice varies from the very best where people's future is planned with the sort of resources that Lord Harris mentioned, right down to unplanned and unco-ordinated placements of which no one is proud. Most fall in the middle. We want an infrastructure that the Local Government Association, working with local authorities, can set up. That would make sure that there was an appropriate balance between those authorities currently overwhelmed by the number of applicants, who cannot cope within their own boundaries, and support from the receiving authorities, so that during the assessment process, people would have reasonable standards of living accommodation. That is the basis of the voluntary scheme that we are trying to put together.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gilroy:</B> One of the real issues in the south east generally, but especially in Kent has been the sensitive issue of primary health care services to refugees and asylum seekers. It has been a major issue for us. At present in east Kent there are around 250 children without full-time education, all of them refugees. Unless the educational services are included and unless there is some clear direction to the health service as part of the package, local government will struggle, whatever its good intentions.
<P>
In east Kent it has been necessary to employ salaried general practitioners because ordinary general practitioners have been unwilling to offer appropriate primary health care to refugees. Our view in Kent, with which I am sure my colleagues would agree, though I know a contrary view exists, is that we shall struggle unless a way can be found of ring fencing some grant money for education&#151;this is one reason we are struggling in the consortium, with other authorities&#151;to deal with issues of subtlety of interpretation and so on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> The current system involves a voluntary scheme and local government powers&#151;even if some of those powers were not necessarily designed to be applied to asylum seekers. They include powers under the National Assistance Act 1948 and the Children Act 1989. Are you satisfied that, given the restrictions that the Bill would place on future local government action&#151;particluarly under clauses 95 onwards, which cover such matters as arrangements by local authorities for the prevention of illness&#151;you will still be allowed to do some of what you now do?
<P>
<B>Lord Harris:</B> The framework that the Government propose would be much better than the current uncertainties. Working with the existing legislation that was not designed for the purpose has been a nightmare. There is no clarity about appropriate provision or what can or cannot be done. I suspect that practice varies as a consequence of that. Clarity would help.
<P>
I would emphasise the need for some flexibility. It is difficult always to predict all the needs of individual asylum seekers and the specific support requirements that may emerge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I would like to ask Kent county council a question arising out of its submission, about preferences of asylum seekers. Kent has had to bear a very heavy share of the burden in this context and, understandably, it supports the policy of dispersing and sharing the burden more widely. However, given that background, I am struck by the fact that Kent supports the principle of allowing asylum seekers to express a preference as to where they would go. As you will know, under the Bill the Secretary of State is forbidden to take into account preference. He must not take into account asylum seekers' preferences about where they might live.
<P>
Why do you think it important that asylum seekers should be able to express a preference, even if the Secretary of State does not take it into account?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gilroy:</B> That is based on our experience of dealing with asylum seekers. There must be a degree of sensitivity to their preferences. My view is that if we make consortia arrangements, they will have to be regionally very sensitive about the locations that are considered. There must not be some ad hoc arrangement. London, of course, may be included, on occasions, as now. Probably we should like a test of reasonableness&#151;of a pragmatic, common-sense approach. We deal with human beings who have views about what they want. In Kent, we have managed to develop sensitivity to what asylum seekers say. If there are to be networks, the real issue for local government is to work together&#151;that is what we are doing in respect of London&#151;in a consortium but in partnership, so that there would be a more coherent process.
<P>
I hope that the Government will listen to our message about choice, as there are aspects of the matter that fly in the face of our experience of managing these issues.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jan Askew </B>(Kent County Council): I support a test of reasonableness. Unaccompanied minors often travel in a group of villagers. Separating them from a natural community with whom they are comfortable would be hugely problematical. My other point is that it is dangerous to assume that asylum seekers are homogenous groups. In one instance, we were approached by a London borough to move a Serb family from an Albanian setting. So, if we do not want to store up trouble for the future, we have to reconsider that, as well as to develop a sanction of some sort if people do not comply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> People in Kent are tolerant and understanding, but you have seen evidence of the tensions that can sometimes arise, have you not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gilroy:</B> Major tensions.
<P>
<B>Ms Askew:</B> One of the issues for us is that prior to about 1997, the community&#151;Dover and Thanet especially&#151;seemed to be able to cope because we have always had refugees and asylum seekers coming through Dover. What changed was the enormous numbers, which totally overwhelmed the local community. It is fair to say that we now have difficulty working closely with the district councils&#151;we are a two-tier authority&#151;on community relations. Some of these issues will be with us for some time, especially if some of these people settle there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> As you say, that is happening in a place that is used to people travelling and to asylum seekers. The sudden arrival of people in large numbers can create tensions.
<P>
<B>Ms Askew:</B> Some of our skills, knowledge and experience may well help if you move on to identify dispersal zones where people will be moved. There is a real need to work with the community there if that is the outcome of deliberations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall </B>(Bedford): On dispersal, I have two points&#151;one to Alison Harvey, which is straightforward, and the other to the local authorities. With regard to the centre of excellence, which at the moment is London, you said, Ms Harvey, that there should be some services in the rest of the country and that you are having difficulty addressing that.
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> Torture survivors will be dispersed if they are not identified early in the process. Already people are turning up in various areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> That was not my question. London is the centre of excellence. I thought you had acknowledged that there ought to be services elsewhere now, even before any new legislation. Given that fact, and given the possibility of new legislation is there not an argument for other centres of excellence being established in other cities? Are you starting to address that, and to seek contacts elsewhere in the country, to develop centres of excellence?
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> We have contacts elsewhere, although we do not exactly have consultant doctors, as the Minister's opening question suggested. Developing centres of excellence will take a long time. If, for example, we sent an experienced doctor and a case worker to Liverpool now, they would provide some primary services but, primarily, they would be providing secondary services because they would be trying to find, say, physiotherapists or counsellors, and support them in their work. Such people could cope with some cases, but not with others, so they need somewhere to refer cases on, otherwise their experience of trying to deal with cases with which they cannot cope will put them off rather than lead to the building of skills.
<P>
The establishment of the Medical Foundation as the centre of excellence has taken a long time. It goes back beyond its foundation in the mid-1980s to a group of people who had developed their skills&#151;in Ms Bamber's case from the second world war&#151;and were put in one place. When we can harness skills, we can begin to build on them. However, we can cross-refer people to specialists in other areas. That means that every time you reach out for, say, a physiotherapist, you are not reaching out to someone with no experience of torture survivors. It means having to do other work besides physiotherapy. Over the years, our physiotherapists have developed pain-free techniques and no-force techniques because torture survivors cannot deal with normal physiotherapy techniques, which involve giving something a good wrench if it is out of place.
<P>
That sort of thing can and should be done. At the moment, we are concentrating on pleas for help and we get panic-stricken calls from all over the country. We seek to offer support to those people, which means that patients normally come to us. However, people cannot spend three hours travelling to a counselling session and then spend another three hours mulling over that session on the train home.
<P>
They might be able to do that once. However, that is damage limitation: the problem is being contained. People cannot travel a long way every week if, indeed, they have the money to travel. That is neither positive nor viable.
<P>
Building a centre of excellence takes a long time, and will not be done by 2001. We have worked on that project by reaching out, finding where the problem is and listening to torture victims telling us what they cannot cope with. We take the problem back, and tell them: ``We will do this; you do that.'' In some of the most serious cases, however, people say to us: ``Please write something to get this person brought back to London&#151;we cannot cope.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Carroll:</B> Let me add one further point. Were we to establish one further centre of excellence&#151;in the north, say, or Scotland&#151;there would still be a problem. If, in the long term, we were to spend financial and administrative resources reaching outside London, there would still be the problem of cluster areas in six, eight or ten places. We cannot create centres of excellence everywhere.
<P>
Therefore, the problem is the early identification of torture survivors. The onus is on the Home Office to improve its procedures for early identification, so that torture survivors can be located in London or one or two other places. It is not financially or administratively realistic to locate good services in that particular medical field all over the country. It would not work.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hall:</B> I will resist the temptation to come back on that point, because the foundation clearly has a definite view. I accept that that is your view, although I feel that we could do something if we had to. There is a case for developing other centres of excellence.
<P>
I turn to dispersal. One of the documents circulated to the Committee contains a list of hotels outside London where London boroughs send asylum seekers. Direct dispersal also takes place through the private sector. I know a Bedford landlord who sends taxis to the point of entry at Heathrow. He meets asylum seekers at the airport and brings them straight to Bedford. That is done through the Refugee Arrivals Project.
<P>
Will the local authority representatives say something about liaison? That is pertinent to social services and housing authorities&#151;which are not represented by the representatives of Kent county council. What liaison is there between local authorities and the Refugee Arrivals Project with regard to placing people in private accommodation.?
<P>
I have learned from limited experience that some accommodation is far from satisfactory, so local authorities have a role there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brangwyn:</B> The Refugee Arrivals Project is based at Heathrow airport and receives referrals from the immigration service there. We have sought to establish a rota system whereby the Refugee Arrivals Project will allocate people to London boroughs and&#151;increasingly, as you said&#151;to authorities outside London so that accommodation can be provided.
<P>
It is not simply a matter for the Refugee Arrivals Project. Other asylum seekers refer themselves to other areas and seek their own accommodation. That may be sustainable for long or short periods, although difficulties may arise.
<P>
We will seek to consolidate agreements with the Refugee Arrivals Project to improve management of the point of entry in the interim period. We understand that there are difficulties in relation to the accommodation that is being provided. Frankly, some of the solutions will be outside London because on a price-for-price basis, accommodation tends to be better outside London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gilroy:</B> One of the dilemmas for all of the purchasing authorities who require accommodation is that they are inevitably attracted to areas of high deprivation where property prices are cheap. The coastal strips are vulnerable to that, particularly in the south-east. It is a dilemma. We have obviously suffered from that, particularly in the Thanet area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> Whatever system is developed, it is important that the issue is seen as a responsibility for the whole local authority and not a certain part of it. It is not a housing responsibility or a social services responsibility. Clearly there are important environmental health issues. There are very important education issues, as you have heard. There are also important regulation issues, in terms of the quality of accommodation.
<P>
It is important for the whole local authority to work together, and in two-tier areas for the district councils and the county authority to work together. That is why we believe that a system developed by local government, looking at the issue and managing it in a co-ordinated and developmental way is the only way to make sure that people have decent settings while they are awaiting decisions and crucially, as the system speeds up, prepare for settlement, which is an important aspect of the whole situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> May I just ask one question? To your knowledge, do the local authorities, your members and Kent approve the list of private-sector landlords to whom the Refugee Arrivals Project refers asylum seekers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gilroy:</B> No, we do not. We approve our own but no one else's.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brangwyn:</B> Where a referral is made to the local authority, every effort will be made to ensure that the accommodation is of a satisfactory standard, but as I have said, a number of people refer themselves and make their own arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> The Refugee Arrivals Project refers people directly to private-sector landlords. I am trying to find out whether there is normally a list of landlords that has been looked at by local authorities with local knowledge. The position seems uncertain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brangwyn:</B> Where there is a referral to a local authority, that system kicks in. However, the Refugee Arrivals Project places people directly in private-sector accommodation and that is outwith any arrangements that we have with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> Perhaps you should be trying to make those arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Toby, I am surprised at your refusal to answer Ms Abbott's question about forced dispersal. I should have thought that you could say quite unequivocally that you disagreed with forced dispersal, as I do. I should like to ask you whether you agree with a different policy whereby people who wish to arrange their own accommodation, but need vouchers or other forms of direct support may do so. The accommodation may be in London or elsewhere. If they seek accommodation provided by the state, they should be in the same position as homeless people in this country and be given one choice. As London has a large number of asylum seekers, it would be disproportionate or unfair to oblige London to provide that choice for the foreseeable future.
<P>
<B>Lord Harris:</B> May I just make it clear that I did not refuse to answer any question. I answered the question. People may have felt that my answer was unsatisfactory, but I answered the question. My point is that I do not believe that the problem will necessarily be solved entirely voluntarily. However, I accept and welcome the assertion that it will be important to take into account the preferences of individual refugees. That policy is followed by my own authority and, I assume, by others for placements out of their areas.
<P>
On the question as to whether someone should have a choice, the position for homeless families is that the offer that is made should be reasonable. In taking into account what is reasonable, you have to look at the individual's circumstances and other relevant factors. I should have thought that exactly the same principle needs to be applied to the placing of refugees and asylum seekers. You need to look at what is reasonable under the circumstances. For example, placing people in a hostile environment would not be reasonable.

</P>
<P>
On resuming&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Lord Harris had you finished your response to Mr. O'Brien before the suspension?
<P>
<B>Lord Harris:</B> I had finished my initial response.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If nobody wishes to add to that, I will call Mr. Allan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> As local authority representatives, you had experience of the system before 1996, when there were people on housing benefit and income support and, post-1996, of mixed groups. Some people are still completely dependent on local authorities under National Assistance Act 1948 and some are still on income support and housing benefit. Under the proposed system, everything will be provided on a cashless basis via a new agency. The London Government Association said that vouchers are costly and bureaucratic and stigmatise the recipients. Notwithstanding the dispersal issues, if 100 asylum seekers and their families were living in your area do you, as professionals, think it would be easier to deal with them by means of an income-support type payment or a voucher system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> My experience, most of which is in child care, suggests that a voucher system does not produce the desired outcome. It places an administrative burden on the system, it singles people out from the rest of the population and it is open to abuse. Examples of the voucher systems currently operating suggest that the vouchers are discounted and sold for cash and used in wrong ways. Certainly, if you want to identify people in a community as different, separate and special and to stigmatise them when they hold up queues in supermarkets, a voucher system is a good way of doing it.
<P>
There is a case for providing a total board and lodging service including accommodation, food, heating, lighting&#151;all the basic essentials&#151;and a limited amount of cash or providing vouchers which all of us use, such as travel or telephone cards. That system can work and some of the best examples are predicted on that basis.
<P>
However, the voucher in the middle could cause great problems. Whether that system is better than an income support system is a matter of judgment: everyone else lives in a cash society, but we have to accept that we are dealing with people whose status is currently different, who are destitute, who need instant and good-quality services which can often be provided in a way that equates with best practices now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gilroy:</B> To be honest, the voucher system has been a nightmare for us. It has created community tensions and black-market economies; if asked to, I could probably give you some good examples&#151;we have thoughts about all sorts of things. It is very costly in terms of unit cost per voucher. I wish the Home Office well; it will cost a fortune.
<P>
If we were to continue the system in Kent, if we were to have this responsibility permanently, we would manage some of the issues by moving into some smart card technology in partnership with a clearing bank, because of the processes involved and the audit trails that local government officers have to manage. It is absolutely horrendous. I have to support my colleague, Mr. Ransford, who passionately wants you to reflect very carefully on the operational implications of what you are proposing. We have tried it; we are doing it; but we think that there are better ways of managing it as we move post-millennium.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brangwyn:</B> In 1996 the London boroughs had to rise to the challenge of issuing vouchers. A number of boroughs have in place schemes that do work. As we indicated in our evidence, there is a price attached to that. There are additional administrative costs and some other difficulties. Overall, we have been able to establish an operational system in collaboration with a number of private companies and supermarkets. By and large, that can be made to work and to work well.
<P>
We also pointed out in our evidence that that cannot cover every single conceivable item of requirement for an individual asylum seeker. Of course, we have to find other mechanisms&#151;telephone cards, travel warrants and, I am afraid, some small amounts of cash which will effectively have to be written off&#151;to cover incidental items of expenditure which are unavoidable given the circumstances of individual asylum seekers. It can work but prices are attached to it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> To Peter Gilroy, if you have been empowered in law to make a cash payment rather than use vouchers, would you have chosen that operationally?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gilroy:</B> If it is small amounts of cash, possibly, but we have security problems with cash at the moment with our children and family services in relation to refugees. Already, there are threats to the security of holding large amounts of cash within local offices. It is giving us real problems. It is a a very difficult balancing act between Mr. Ransford's point about maintaining a realistic service on the one hand and on the other making it sensitive enough to avoid people being stigmatised.
<P>
It is clear if you look around Thanet and Dover&#151;and Ms Askew will tell you&#151;that people know who the refugees are. They need only go to Sainsbury's or other supermarkets. For us in local government, that becomes a problem because it creates community tension and makes visible racial tensions that would otherwise not be there. People believe that the refugees are getting something for nothing. It is a difficult issue for the Government as it is for us. However, we would ask that you reflect very carefully indeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Back to Lord Harris. The Association of Local Government says in its statement that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``welcomes the new framework for the provision of services to asylum seekers''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in the Bill. Let me put to you again pretty much the same question&#151;do you support the Government's proposals for the dispersal of asylum seekers? I note that you made one equivocation, which I would like to clarify. While you were not necessarily asking for the ``preference'' of asylum seekers to be taken into account, you were asking for all their ``circumstances'' to be taken into account which is a slightly different thing. Would you deal with those points?
<P>
<B>Lord Harris:</B> With respect, you have summarised the answer I gave before. We welcome the Government's proposals because they are a substantial improvement on the mess that exists at the moment. In terms of dispersal, we recognise that it is necessary and we believe that for it to be effective, the placements around the country have got to work. We therefore think that it is appropriate, in making those dispersal placements, for thought to be given to individual circumstances.
<P>
Ultimately, that remains a judgment. It is the same when a local authority allocates a property to a homeless person. As was said earlier, they are given one choice. The same ultimately will happen with these proposals, as I understand it. However, in making an offer to a homeless person, we have to act reasonably and take relevant factors into account. For example&#151;here I reduce it to an absurd position&#151;if you are re-housing someone who has left the matrimonial home because of violence, it is not reasonable to site that person in the vacant flat that happens to be next door to the person who perpetrated the violence. When you are considering where to place refugees, you need to take reasonable account of their circumstances and backgrounds.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> I want to direct my question to Ms Askew. For the sake of the Committee, I should point out that she is the senior social services manager in my constituency, so we know each other quite well.
<P>
You spoke earlier about the fact that in east Kent, we have always had a number of refugees coming through the port of Dover. Could you give me a ballpark guess as to how many eastern European refugees had chosen to settle in Thanet in 1996 and before?
<P>
<B>Ms Askew:</B> Before 1996&#151;very, very few. I have not got a number, but very few.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> How many would you estimate there are today?
<P>
<B>Ms Askew:</B> In Thanet alone, I would imagine that, counting in-country and point-of-entry applicants, there must be upwards of 1,000 individuals.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> So, in a short period of time&#151;less than two years&#151;a significant population from eastern Europe has been built up and become established. The witnesses who sat in Committee in the past few days and said that all refugees always go to places where their own community is already established presumably cannot be right, as there were no refugees two years ago and now there is an established community. Do you accept that?
<P>
<B>Ms Askew:</B> I accept that, yes.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> In other words, it is possible to manage the creation of new communities of refugees in other parts of the country, if we have a mind to do so?
<P>
<B>Ms Askew:</B> To a certain degree, Thanet and Dover are examples of what can be done. Unfortunately, it has been un-managed, and we have had to use all our creativity to make it as comfortable as it is. So my answer to that question is that it would be possible with good planning.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> You have answered my next question for me. That is fine. We have established that we have created this new community, but that it has gone too far&#151;there are too many people in a deprived community and that is creating great tension. Would you accept that as a reasonable summary of the situation today?
<P>
<B>Ms Askew:</B> Yes, I would.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Then I should like to move on to something that we have not touched on before. The Bill contains powers for dealing with unscrupulous advisers. Do you think that those powers go far enough in dealing with unscrupulous members of the private sector, in whatever industry&#151;whether it is advising asylum seekers, or providing accommodation? Does the Bill go far enough? Does it give us enough powers to deal with those people who you and I know are operating in Thanet at this moment?
<P>
<B>Ms Askew:</B> It is not my area of expertise, but I would suggest that if you were serious about using the powers in the Bill, they would be adequate to deal with some of the people who choose to prey on asylum seekers.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Would you give the Committee the benefit of your experience, by telling us what sort of things people are doing to prey on asylum seekers today?
<P>
<B>Ms Askew:</B> There are several examples. The major one would be the landlords who provide totally inadequate accommodation, and charge and process vouchers for their own use. There are other people who offer legal advice that is less than helpful to the asylum seekers themselves. Somewhat outside our control are the people who incite asylum seekers to come to this country giving them totally false information, so that their expectations can never be met.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Do you want any other Members to comment on the questions?
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> No, that is fine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley </B>(Worthing, West): May I acknowledge that people in local government service, the voluntary sector, and others, must cope with many of the emotional and other demands? Given that members of the Committee tell the Medical Foundation that we should have other centres of expertise, could you indicate how much taxpayers' money is provided for the foundation?
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> None.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> So when we talk about our need for more areas of expertise, we are telling the people who have come together, provided support and brought together a concentration of expertise that we are offering no help, but want them to be able to cope with the consequences of decisions that we have taken for other reasons.
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> Yes. The Medical Foundation's policy is to remain an independent charity rather than Home Office funded, so perhaps just to give a straight yes to that question would be to place ourselves in too prim a position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> So the Medical Foundation does not ask for Home Office or Department of Health funding; is that right&#151;does the same apply to Department of Health funding?
<P>
<B>Mr. Carroll:</B> One small correction; we accept money through the legal aid scheme. That is indirect and not, of course, from the Home Office. We do not accept money from the Home or Foreign Office. It is not inconceivable that we would accept money from the Department of Health.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> As far as our witnesses know, there has been no approach from Government as to the ways in which you would be prepared to accept funds for doing things that otherwise should have been done by public authorities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Carroll:</B> We have not been approached on that basis; that is correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Just to give us a picture of what the concentration of interest, support and expertise might be, how many full-time staff do you have, and how far do you rely on people giving their time or being paid for part of their time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Carroll:</B> I mentioned the figure of 115 clinicians, of whom, let us say, 27 are volunteer medical doctors and seven are part-time paid medical doctors. More than half of our clinicians and medical doctors are there on a voluntary basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> So there is no question of placing an advertisement, had you the cash, saying, ``Two psychiatrists wanted, two orthopaedists, three physiotherapists. Full-time employment available for two years''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Carroll:</B> The truth is that because of the nature of our organisation&#151;which is a human rights organisation providing services to torture survivors&#151;we draw in a lot of highly qualified people, such as neurologists, paediatricians and all sorts of specialists, who give their time to us and would not be available elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> This is my last question on this aspect of the matter. The nearest parallel in this country to the torture victims is probably the mutilations in Northern Ireland. Do you know whether the direct medical help to those people is scattered all over Northern Ireland, or are there areas of expertise and concentration?
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> They are coming to us, Mr. Bottomley. We have gone out to Northern Ireland to document some punishment shootings&#151;we were asked to do that. Our expertise has been called on for people who lost their children in very distressing circumstances in the Omagh bombing. There are obviously doctors in the Province who have dealt with that. They still see us as having something to offer them. There is a limit to what we can do, because of the distance, but we receive an ever-increasing number of approaches from that area.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> That is a little wide of the Bill Mr. Bottomley. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> I do not want to put a question, but a quick statement. If people from Northern Ireland must come to London, the dispersal of non-existent resources somewhere between here and other parts of the country is not an answer to the problem that exists. That is my illustration.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As an illustration that is permissible, but I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman did not pursue it too far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> May I come to the question of dispersal and children. The age of 18 is used in the Bill for some purposes. Do our local authority witnesses have anything to say about whether children are effectively provided for under the Bill, or whether the Standing Committee and the Government should be attending to any concerns in that respect?
<P>
<B>Lord Harris:</B> The first thing to say is that it would not at the moment be local authority practice to disperse unaccompanied children or families with children, except in very exceptional circumstances. The people whom we have been moving out of our authority areas have tended to be single adults.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> The issue of unaccompanied children is different from other categories of people. Those who are with their parents as part of families are distinct from unaccompanied children, for whom we need to employ a range of specialist services under the Children Act 1989 with support from education and health departments. When unaccompanied children arrive, the authorities that take responsibility for them are not part of the dispersal policy.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gilroy:</B> I just want to add something about families with children. Kent generally feels that the Bill is weak on the issue of the link between educational provision and language development, and processes of resettlement, which are subtle and quite intensive. The education authority of Kent believes that provisions should be beefed up a bit and clearer advice provided&#151;if not in this Bill, in other legislation on educational services.
<P>
That will be particularly important if the youngsters are only going to be in the country for two to four months, which would change the configuration about how children are integrated into schools for that short period of time. There may need to be reflection on what education services do when they know in the main that only a third of the children&#151;the approximate figure at the moment&#151;are going to remain permanently.
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> May I just correct something that might have been misunderstood? Unaccompanied children are being dispersed now. We are seeing increasing numbers of them in Liverpool and Birmingham. I refer you to the minutes of the Department of Health meeting on 3 March with the Children and Family from Overseas support network, where a number of authorities were present. That was confirmed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> This is more general than dispersal, but includes issues such as cash-free support. It is up to the Committee and Parliament to decide whether the Bill should include some monitoring or co-ordination arrangements at central Government level so that both voluntary organisations and local authorities can have a one-stop shop. There has been much talk about citizens, voters and residents being able to approach Governments in a unified way&#151;a joined-up Government, we are told.
<P>
Do you believe at the moment that your various responsibilities&#151;social services, education, housing and others&#151;together with those carried by the national health service and others that come back to you can be linked in with the Government in a co-ordinated way, or do you find that you have to go to the Home Office for some things and to the Department of Education and Employment for others? Would it be useful&#151;whether done statutorily or by administration&#151;to have the Government provide a place where you can come together?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Lord Harris has to vote in the House of Lords. He will be back. In the mean time, who would like to respond to that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brangwyn:</B> As we understand it, the proposal is for the Home Office to have lead responsibility for the placements of asylum seekers in the future. In developing the interim scheme, there is every intention of making sure that local authority services, where required, are put in place in a planned and organised approach&#151;in contrast to the current situation where we have not been able to plan in advance. To that extent, the new arrangements will be a substantial improvement on the current position. We welcome that.
<P>
In our evidence, we suggested that there must be detailed consultation on the arrangements for children because it is imperative that there are robust systems for the referral of people who require additional local authority service&#151;whether education, housing or whatever&#151;and that they are put in place quickly and effectively. We are in discussion with Home Office officials about how we can ensure that that happens and that there is proper and effective liaison between the new directorates and agencies that will be operating the new system and local authorities which, in some cases, will have responsibility for the settlement of individuals at the end of their period of support by the directorate and the Home Office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gilroy:</B> I just want to add that that still does not include the issues of the major health service changes now taking place, and access to health care generally. I make a plea that it is not in local government's gift to organise that and, in any debate about one-stop shops and the Home Office taking the lead, the Department of Health needs to give clear guidance now to medical and primary care services, because we are all struggling to get general practitioners to take an interest in the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gwyn Prosser </B>(Dover): May I ask Peter Gilroy from Kent county council about the education of children of asylum seekers. I know that there is concern about funding, which has in part been resolved by thorough negotiations, and that there are small elements of funding that add up to a considerable increase in it by comparison with last year. However, there is perhaps still a gap. Are concerns mainly to do with funding, or with the large number of children of asylum seekers coming into specific schools, or does the problem go wider than that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gilroy:</B> They are to do with both. For Kent, there is still a funding issue. The council would prefer some ring-fenced grant money to be given to the education service to focus attention on the issue. That is one problem, but we are struggling with another&#151;the difficult matter of social inclusion. We are expected to place youngsters in ordinary schools to be integrated, but our education colleagues often say that, given the unknown time that these youngsters will spend with us, there is a sense that they would prefer some dedicated interim position where they can give more intensive language and specialist services to them before they go into ordinary school. That is why I mentioned primary legislation: I think that that is what it would require.
<P>
The next point, which I think you were about to come to&#151;Ms Askew may wish to comment on it&#151;is that we have had local community tensions over the way that local people perceive school places being allocated. It is a similar issue to housing allocations. Perhaps Ms Askew will say something about that.
<P>
<B>Ms Askew:</B> As you know, the local authority has less control over the admission process to schools in the current system. We found some schools only too pleased to help with placements for asylum seekers and those schools developed anti-bullying and anti-harassment policies very quickly, while quite understandably, other schools have been reluctant, no doubt for good reasons. Se we tend to get an over-concentration in one school, which has inevitable consequences for the indigenous population in such schools. This is evident across the board in east Kent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prosser:</B> In one small school in Dover, Aycliffe, the ethnic minority went from zero to almost 20 per cent. of the school roll, which, with the best will in the world, will obviously cause problems. Other schools maintain a welcoming culture and are proud of the way in which they cope and handle the difficulties. Why is there that difference?
<P>
<B>Ms Askew:</B> It is very difficult for me to explain attitudes within schools, and among headmasters and governors. It is not for me to say what those attitudes are about. At the beginning, when we began to receive large numbers of children, most schools were quite frightened about the implications of admitting large numbers of ethnically different childen. It is a celebration, if you like, of our traveller service in Kent, which started to work with individual schools and teachers to facilitate the integration that legislation requires. There are a lot of skills, knowledge and expertise in the service which would help other areas if these proposals are developed.
<P>
A problem that we are still struggling with is the reverse of that created by a large influx of children. When families are returned home, large numbers of children leave the school and that destabilises its programming. We are just beginning to inherit the problems that that creates.
<P>
Welcome classes have been considered&#151;not reception centres, but a different school environment through which children could be assessed prior to their being integrated into a normal school. It would also include parents so that their attitude to schools and that of their children can be assessed. It might be the convenient, neutral environment that my colleague talked about in which to explore some of the traumatic events that may have taken place, which may not be possible within the context of a classroom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brangwyn:</B> Briefly, I draw on an association with experience in London, which developed on similar lines. There are good schools and bad schools, but most respond positively to the arrival of asylum seekers; they are an additional service to meet particular needs. Of course, a cost is involved and for that reason we welcome the provision in the Bill to support local authorities with that expenditure. I hope that the Committee will support the Local Government Association's view that the development of additional services is a necessary part of the dispersal programme.
<P>
We are clear that this is a preliminary to the settlement of some asylum seekers permanently in those neighbourhoods, so investment at an early stage may help with later issues involved in settlement such as social inclusion, which has been referred to.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Harvey:</B> I want to pick up on that comment. In London, we have specialist psychologists who work with teachers in the schools, especially with disturbed children who have been exposed to violence. We also run a consultation group for teachers to help schools manage the most difficult children. That is the sort of service that needs to be provided. As indicated, those sorts of services have to be considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prosser:</B> Mr. Gilroy, you came close to describing a situation in which children of asylum seekers might go into a separate educational establishment. You presented it to us in a way that might be half acceptable, given that some will be here for only a short time and that they face problems with communication and language; but is not the bigger problem labelling that as exclusion, segregation and apartheid?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gilroy:</B> Yes. We have struggled with that paradox, and we are seeing the results. You should bear in mind that more than 250 children in east Kent had no education&#151;they are completely excluded. The dilemma for the education service is how to balance the process of social inclusion, which we want to be passionate about, with putting youngsters in what we would call an interim protective environment so that we can assess their needs before placing them in ordinary schools. That is a real tension; we accept that it is a difficult dilemma, but we have tended to look at the matter on a practical basis. When I see so many youngsters on the streets, I know that at some point my colleagues and I will probably be criticised because we have not dealt with a group of youngsters who were disadvantaged in the first place, but who are socially excluded and without education because of the problems that Ms Askew talked about.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Some Members who have already asked questions wish to come back. Mr. Pickthall has not asked any questions so I shall call him next.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Pickthall </B>(West Lancashire): May I ask Mr. Ransford about accommodation and dispersal?
<P>
Page 2 of the Local Government Association's submission states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We will press for the Bill to allow preference to be taken into account if it is consistent with the purposes and efficient operation of the scheme.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I assume that that refers to the dispersal scheme. The submission continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This is necessary to save councils from the risk of judicial review.''
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Will you explain that? Is judicial review likely to come from the fact that there is preference in the Bill or the fact that there is not preference?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> As the Bill stands, no consideration is given to applicants' preferences. The Home Secretary is not allowed to take such preferences into account. We find that strange, for the reasons that previous witnesses spoke about.
<P>
Applicants' preferences may not be the only factor, but there are situations in which the individuals' views and their personal circumstances may be important. An example of that is family members who have settled in a particular part of the country.
<P>
Local authorities operate many assessment systems which take into account people's wishes and views. Such considerations may not be the determinants in any given situation, but they are certainly important.
<P>
We are anxious about the effective operation of the dispersal scheme. People's views should be taken into account if they are to have faith in the scheme and feel that the system is safe and fair. The operation might be considered unfair if such views are completely disregarded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickthall:</B> Hence the judicial review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> Hence the judicial review if councils are seen to be operating wrongly. Local authorities are working on implementing a voluntary scheme which, we hope, will lead to a smooth, successful transition to whatever statutory arrangements are made as a result of the Bill's passage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickthall:</B> I have no problem with that, and agree with everything that you have said. However, I am not certain how the Bill's ruling out the Secretary of State's right to use preference will lead to judicial review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> If we operate a scheme considered unfair by anyone in the system, we will certainly be at risk in the transitional period before the arrangements come into force in April 2000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickthall:</B> Thank you, I understand that.
<P>
If the section were re-worded as you suggest, and individual preferences were allowed, would not the whole dispersal policy fail?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> No, the Local Government Association does not think so. Everyone in the dispersal system accepts that it must be reasonable and helpful, if it is to work. That includes the applicants, wherever possible, as their views are important.
<P>
The dispersal system is sometimes spoken of as if it were only a way out of areas which people are coming into now. Of course, that is not the case. The two consortia that are furthest ahead in their preparations are, not surprisingly, London and the part of the south-east that includes Kent. Those consortia have to deal with today's concentrated problems.
<P>
It is possible to operate a dispersal policy in a fairly local area, as well as a widespread region, that takes people from one part of the country to another. However, by and large, such a system must have the confidence of the people with the biggest stake in it, if it is to work. Those people are the asylum seekers whose homes, livelihoods and futures are staked on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickthall:</B> I am sure that that is fair comment. We heard yesterday a great deal of insistent evidence from other groups, saying that if there were a dispersal system&#151;if people dispersed to beyond London, the north or wherever&#151;they would automatically filter back to London where the support systems are, and where there are larger cultural groups to whom they can relate. Are you saying that that would not necessarily be the case, if it were done properly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> There are two situations. If people are dispersed, and do not regard the state-funded system as adequate for their needs, they might return. There are examples in the current system of people falling back on their own resources or on the resources of friends and families, and making their own choices. That is always a possibility.
<P>
Secondly, on settlements, those asylum seekers who have their status authorised under a much quicker system will then be free to make their own decisions. Previous examples of asylum seekers in this country have shown strong trends for that to happen&#151;for people to return to other areas. At that stage, choice is important. If we build the right infrastructure in local communities to accept people&#151;we have heard examples of what must happen in terms of health and education services, and other matters&#151;they may then have a genuine choice between going to an area where there are long established communities or family patterns, or making new arrangements which work in relation to their needs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> In respect of clause 82 and the reception zones, it is obviously tough for any group of local authorities to be confronted by a Secretary of State taking on the power to dictate to them. I wonder whether you are confident that the reception zone powers would not have to be used? You also talked about limiting them. Will you clarify the ways in which you would like to see them limited in statutes, if they do come about?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> Certainly, we wish to build a system voluntarily, and we are doing so. We already have the support of over 70 local authorities up and down the country and that number is growing. With the consortiums that are now developing&#151;there are currently 11, and that number will increase over the next month&#151;and with the special project worker whom we have appointed with the full support and help of the Home Office, working together with them, we believe that robust arrangements will be built during this summer, which will make it unnecessary for the Secretary of State to use those powers.
<P>
A theme running through our evidence is that we believe that voluntary arrangements, built by local authorities and community leaders working with other partners, are better than the Secretary of State directing to reception zones. If that power remains and is to be used, we believe that there must be consulted, negotiated, sensible criteria on which those reception zones are based.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Are the consortiums that you are talking about groups of local authorities in an area? I am a Sheffield Member of Parliament. In my case, would it be a Yorkshire consortium that would agree to take a quota of asylum seekers? Would each consortium agree to a certain quota? Is that the way in which it would work?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> One of the 11 embryonic consortiums is based on west Yorkshire, and Sheffield is certainly one of the 70 authorities involved in those discussions. That consortium would build an infrastructure of the sort that we have discussed, with support and help from the centre on how to do it. A group of additional resources would be made available, for people to be settled in that area, in a voluntary scheme and in discussion with the consortiums. There would be discussion about what it is reasonable for them to provide for a sustainable community.
<P>
There could not be a quota, because the centre could not say, for example, ``200 are coming in the next month.'' It would have to be built on the resource availability in that situation. We are confident that a substantial number of placements can be built in that way very quickly&#151;in a matter of months.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Returning to settlement, which is an important issue, you rightly said that resources would be needed to achieve it. Let us assume that we have a working system in which decisions are being made within two months and six months if a case goes to appeal. That implies a rapid turnover of people because a temporary system of support is being proposed. The process manual says that when a decision is made, positive or negative, a maximum of 14 days will be given for someone to make other arrangements. Is that sufficient?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> It is very difficult. The proposed system is far more rapid than the one at the moment, as other witnesses said. The current system takes a very long time. For a system that is completed from start to finish in a period of six months, including any right of appeal, and 14 days for providing alternatives, we would need to know what the Home Office's intentions were regarding enforcement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> The process manual was quite clear that at the end of 14 days, all responsiblity under the temporary scheme ends. That may mean removal in some cases or permanent entitlement to stay in the country in others. I am simply asking whether it is a realistic time scale, not only for a local authority but for voluntary sector organisations, to make some permanent arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gilroy:</B> I do not think that 14 days is sufficient. There would have to be an on-going relationship and an intelligence between us about the whole of the population. Probably more important for all of us in the longer term is that local government, which wants to be a partner, would need to be thinking strategically about resettlement. In a way, that is not in the Bill.
<P>
The issue of resettlement and how local government responds is important. For the support agency to be ultimately effective, there would have to be a strategic approach to resettlement in local government, because local government is the place where most of this is going to have to take place. We are dubious about the 14-day period and we remain guarded about the two-month or six-month target. That is a real challenge. If it happens, it will be wonderful&#151;for the asylum seekers and for all of us&#151;but, as I say, it is a real challenge. I do not think that we will be geared up for the 14 days unless, as Mr. Ransford said, we have very close working relationships throughout the process. We must be talking all the time. We will need warnings.
<P>
Strangely enough, we are operating in that way in dealing with emergencies. The relationship with the Home Office is much better than it was three or four years ago. We do get notice periods, unless people just turn up off the back of lorries, which we have trouble with at times. To be honest, I would say that the 14-day issue is a problem for us.
<P>
<B>Ms Harvey:</B> The 14 days is a good example of an area where consultation has failed. At the first stakeholders' meeting where the issue turned up, we were told that the concern was that people would be double-paid&#151;that they would get benefits, if they had not had a chance to find a job, and would also receive support. Those consulted from local authorities, the Department of Health and the voluntary sector said, ``You don't get benefits in 14 days. These people will get their refugee status or exceptional leave to remain and will then pass into destitution because the Benefits Agency will not have paid up and people will not have found a job.''
<P>
When we came back to the next stakeholder's meeting, we were informed that a clause was being conceived to stop double payment of support and benefits. We all looked up, all of us&#151;the Department of Health, local authorities and the voluntary sector&#151;and we were told ``I knew what you were going to say, but this is the way it stays.'' The difficulty is that 14 days is too short for the other support unless, as pointed out, transitional arrangements are in place. The 14 days mentioned in the process manual is impractical. It is a practical problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> My final point, which has not yet been covered at all, is what happens when the new system begins. According to the last figures that I saw, some 27,500 refugee households in London are currently being assisted by local authorities. In addition, we have all the people who are currently entitled to benefit and are looking after themselves.
<P>
The Bill not only brings in the new system, it takes away all that is there now. How do you see that transition happening?
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brangwyn:</B> The new agency will take responsibility for new arrivals in April 2000, and will begin the process. There should also be transitional arrangements for the existing group of people who are primarily supported by social services authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Can you point me to that in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brangwyn:</B> We are still in discussions with the Home Office about how that would work. We hope that discussions will conclude quickly. There is no explicit provision; what there is&#151;and we are relying on it&#151;is the power of the Secretary of State to issue regulations giving effect to that sort of timetable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have a small question for the representatives from Kent. You expressed a strong view about the cost of administering the voucher scheme and referred to the unit cost of a voucher. Can you say a little more about it and tell us how much it costs you to provide, say, &#163;5 worth of vouchers, bearing in mind administration costs and everything else that it involves?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gilroy:</B> It is the difference between 4p and 14p in the pound in overall costs. Added to that is not only the actual cost for the administration process but the deflection of the reason for producing vouchers. It subsumes more professional time and activity&#151;even the good schemes do this. I suppose that our greatest prejudice, apart from the cost, is that in the end it defeats the essence of what we are trying to achieve, which is the best possible solution for the general public as well as for asylum seekers.
<P>
There are so many spin offs to the way the voucher scheme operates. The new support agency will have to cope with that in a big way on a national basis, and if Kent is a microcosm of London, parts of London are a microcosm of what we will have to face nationally. We are just guarded about it, and say, ``Think very carefully''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brangwyn:</B> The London boroughs have considerable experience of issuing vouchers. I do not have the figures today but I will write to the Committee if that will assist because of the savings that accrue from volume.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> You say that you are guarded about it. From your point of view and your experience, you would regard it as a big undertaking to set up a new administration for all these purposes on a national basis?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brangwyn:</B> Yes, and you will be very surprised at how much it will cost.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Any formal evidence that you wish to submit to the Committee must be submitted by the end of the day on Monday, but that does not stop you writing to each member of the Committee giving any information that they may want or you may wish them to have.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I just want to ask the local government representatives about financial arrangements. In the submission from the LGA, talking about implementation you say that secure financial arrangements will be essential, and that there are particular concerns about unaccompanied children. Can you say a little more about that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> Yes. Unaccompanied children's needs are very different from those of adults, as I have said. The same applies in some respects to children with families.
<P>
Dispersal of unaccompanied children was referred to earlier. The only departure from a non-dispersal policy that I know of is where children have links with families or communities in other parts of the country&#151;and that would be good child care practice&#151;or where the policy of a local authoritiy for dealing with its child care system includes out-of-borough placements. That is especially true of small urban boroughs.
<P>
As to financial arrangements, we think that the existing arrangements through which children's services are funded generally will be more advantageous for unaccompanied children than the arrangements in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I have a couple of questions. Mr. Ransford, do you agree that unaccompanied children are unaffected, by and large, by the Bill and do not form part of the new asylum support arrangements?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I like answers like that.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes, I like answers like that, too.
<P>
I was taken a little by surprise by the Medical Foundation's answer to the questions about funding, because I understood historically that the medical foundation did not wish to have Government funding. Do I now understand that certain types of Government funding would be acceptable to you?
<P>
<B>Mr. Carroll:</B> I do not want to speak for the trustees of the organisation, but they have made it clear that they do not wish to accept Home Office or Foreign Office funding. The position has not been considered with regard to Department of Health funding; I would say that that is a possibility and could perhaps be put to the trustees. I draw to the Minister's attention and to the attention of members of the Committee who pressed us hard on the issue of setting up centres elsewhere, that it is not impossible; but let me just point out figures for the numbers of people whom we see as a percentage of overall asylum seekers, as it may point to a different type of solution from the one that you have in mind.
<P>
In 1997, we wrote some 600 medical and counselling reports out of some 30,000 applicants. In 1998, we wrote some 924 medical and counselling reports out of some 46,000. For two years running, it has been about 2 per cent. of the overall number.
<P>
Medical reports are not the only thing that we do and we see perhaps 6 per cent. or 7 per cent. of the total asylum seeker population. These are not enormous figures, so it might point toward a different solution, which would be early identification of torture survivors and then leaving those people, that particularly vulnerable group, where a good service is already being provided, free of charge to the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Mr. Gilroy talked earlier about the need for language provision for the children of asylum seekers and suggested that it would be better for the children if, rather than being obliged to attend the ordinary schools, they were given some tuition to enable them to build up their language base and to ensure that they understood what was going on in Britain and what it was like.
<P>
Mr. Gilroy suggested that that should be enshrined in the Bill. He will, of course, realise that the Bill enshrines only the legal basis of what is needed. Some things can also be done as a result of policy; indeed, the White Paper was the basis of the policy and it says a lot more than the Bill. There are also other Government statements. Will Mr. Gilroy please expand on how he feels the children of asylum seekers might best be dealt with in the education system, remembering that I am talking about asylum seekers, not refugees?

<P>

<B>Mr. Gilroy:</B> I can only give you my experience of talking to educational colleagues in Kent. We struggled with the qualitative side of educational experience at the very early stages. It may be different in London, because London's ethnic experience is different anyway, but we struggled with the problem of putting youngsters into ordinary schools. We had long debates with educationists and decided that if, under the new arrangements, the new support agency managed to process asylum seekers more quickly, within six months there would probably be a turn around, therefore it might be in the interests of the asylum seekers and their children to have a high-quality initial intervention which would help them with language before getting into the full-bloodied social inclusion. Our view is that it may even help in terms of the geographical spread nationally. That is different from what happens today.
<P>
Everyone heard Ms Askew's evidence, that large numbers of children suddenly leaving a school can disrupt that school's whole operation. Intervention may help some of the education authorities to think through how they are going to provide the necessary resources.
<P>
Ms Askew mentioned the traveller services in Kent. If we had not had that expertise in Kent there is no doubt that education services would really have suffered. Teachers have said that. They have struggled. We are talking about language, interpreters and all the usual things. Just to dump people into an ordinary school and say, ``That's fine; we have complied with social inclusion''. has not worked for us. We have struggled and come to that view.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Does Mr. Ransford agree?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> Yes. You have to look at operational experience and remember that the new arrangements under the Bill would involve a very short period. Two things need to be taken into account: the special factors pertaining to that short period&#151;and we have heard about the experience that suggests that children sometimes benefit from special help for a short time before they go into mainstream schooling&#151;and the link between the asylum-seeking period and long-term resettlement. Those matters need to be thought out more carefully than has happened with respect to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Bill is only the legal base; this might be a matter of policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ransford:</B> Yes, we accept that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you all very much for attending this afternoon. It has been an interesting session and I am sure that all members of the Committee will bear in mind what you have said when we come to consider the Bill.
<P>
The witnesses withdrew.
<H4><center>Memorandum from British Airways</center></H4>
<H4><center>Clause 9&#151;Provision of Passenger Information by Airlines to UK Immigration</center></H4>
<P>
Clause 9 of the Bill seeks to give the Secretary of State supplementary powers to acquire information from carriers on passengers. The types of information required are not set out in the Bill but will be specified by order.
<P>
We seek assurances that:
<P>
--the Immigration Service will use its powers sparingly and not overburden airlines with requests for information;
<P>
--requests for data will not involve the carrier in discriminatory activity of any kind; and,
<P>
--the carrier will not be required to collect additional data from that held today.
<H4><center>Clause 25(5) Carriers' Liability&#151;Approved Gate Checks</center></H4>
<P>
The Immigration Service has developed an administrative procedure which offers relief from Carriers' Liability charges resulting from passengers who destroy their documents during passage to the UK.
<P>
We seek an undertaking from the Secretary of State that:
<P>
--he will upgrade these administrative arrangements and provide a formal defence under the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 25(5) Carriers' Liability&#151;Asylum Claimants</center></H4>
<P>
British Airways believes that refunds of Carriers' liability charges should be extended to cover asylum claimants who are granted `exceptional leave to remain', or `indefinite leave to remain'.
<P>
We seek an undertaking from the Secretary of State that:
<P>
--he will not maintain Carriers' Liability charges for those asylum claimants who are granted `exceptional leave to remain', or `indefinite leave to remain'.
<H4><center>Clause 25(5) Carriers' Liability&#151;Fraudulent Travel Documentation</center></H4>
<P>
Clause 25(5) of the Bill re-enacts the existing legislation and states ``For the purposes of this section [25] a document is to be regarded as what it purports to be unless its falsity is reasonably apparent''.
<P>
We seek to understand from the Secretary of State that:
<P>
--the Immigration Service will act in a reasonable manner when considering raising a &#163;2,000 charge for passengers who arrive with fraudulent documents.
<H4><center>Clause 25 Carriers' Liability&#151;Simplified Passport and Visa Documentation</center></H4>
<P>

<P>
--he will appoint a monitor to assess current passport and visa documentation and report back on how this could be simplified.
<H4><center>Clause 26(3)&#151;Transit Visas</center></H4>
<P>
The Bill enables the Secretary of State, by order, to require transit passengers to hold a transit visa, and in turn, to make exemptions to the requirement.
<P>
Clause 26(3) states that the order:
<P>
(a) may specify a description of persons by reference to nationality, citizenship, origin or other connection with any particular country or territory but not by reference to race, colour or religion;
<P>
(b) may not provide for the requirement imposed by the order to apply to any person who under the 1971 Act has the right of abode in the United Kingdom;
<P>
(c) may provide for any category of persons of a description specified in the order to be exempted from the requirement imposed by the order;
<P>
(d) may make provision about the method of application for visas required by the order.
<P>
We welcome the provisions in the Bill which empower the Secretary of State to grant exemptions from DATV requirements and seek an assurance that:
<P>
--the list of countries whose nationals will be required to obtain DATVs will not be expanded unless it is absolutely necessary;
<P>
--the current list of countries to which the DATV regime applies will be reviewed at regular intervals and countries removed from the list where possible;
<P>
--exemptions to the DATV requirement will be introduced, as specified in the EU Joint Action Paper, for nationals of Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Ghana, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia and Sri Lanka, provided they are in possession of a residence permit issued by an EU State; or a visa issued by an EU State, or by a State which is party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area; and
<P>
--exemptions to the DATV requirement will be introduced for certain nationals not included on the EU Joint List, namely, The Peoples Republic of China, Slovak Republic, Turkey, Uganda and Yugoslavia (FRY), provided they are in possession of a residence permit issued by an EU State; or a visa issued by Canada, USA, an EU State, or by a State which is party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
<H4><center>1. Introduction</center></H4>
<P>
1.1 British Airways welcomes the opportunity to make a submission to the Special Standing Committee on the Immigration and Asylum Bill. In this paper, we set out our views on five issues: passenger information, Carriers' Liability and asylum claimants, identification of fraudulent documents, simplification of passport documentation and transit visas.
<P>
1.2 The UK Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Act 1987 was introduced to prevent incorrectly documented passengers from being carried to the UK. In practice, it has resulted in airline staff becoming the front line of UK immigration control, because they are the first point of contact with passengers checking in at overseas airports for flights to the UK.
<P>
1.3 It is important to remember that airline staff are not immigration officers, although they receive significant amounts of training. They should not therefore be expected to perform immigration checks to the same standards as trained officers from the UK Immigration Service.
<P>
1.4 Many staff employed by British Airways at overseas locations do not have English as their first language. Furthermore, at some airports, British Airways does not employ its own staff as check-in agents because of local airport arrangements.
<P>
1.5 As a matter of routine, passports, and where appropriate, visas are scrutinised by check-in staff as part of the check-in procedure. On all British Airways international flights, passports are also checked again at the departure gate, although this practice is not followed by all airlines operating to the UK.
<H4><center>2. Clause 9&#151;Provision of Passenger Information by Airlines to UK Immigration</center></H4>
<P>
2.1 Under the Immigration Act 1971, the Immigration Service currently has limited powers to require an airline to provide a passenger list of names and nationality of passengers arriving in the UK. It is our understanding that this power has been used sparingly by the Immigration Service and to the best of our knowledge, nationality information has not been requested from British Airways.
<P>
2.2 Individual passenger data held in British Airways' computer systems varies, from simply a surname and itinerary to more detailed information such as full name, contact details, and method of ticket payment. Passport information, including nationality, is normally only collected from passengers travelling to and from the USA.
<P>
2.3 Passenger information in the form of a passenger name record (PNR) is accessible through the British Airways reservations system for the period that the record is live, that is, the date of a flight is today or after today. After that time, records are not accessible from computer terminals at airports, but only from central office.
<P>
2.4 Lists of passengers flown are generally stored in the British Airways departure control system. However, this is not always the case, for example, for flights from airports where handling companies use computer systems other than those owned by British Airways. Data is normally held in the British Airways departure control system for approximately 24 hours after flight departure.
<P>
2.5 Clause 9 of the Bill seeks to give the Secretary of State supplementary powers to require information from carriers on passengers. The types of information required are not set out in the Bill but will be specified by order.
<P>
2.6 British Airways recognises that providing reasonable quantities of information makes a positive and demonstrable contribution to immigration control. However, we would be most concerned if requests for information involved us collecting additional information from passengers. Such a measure would inconvenience passengers, as it will extend reservations and check-in transaction times. Furthermore, it will involve the airlines in additional cost, and possibly system developments, if data required goes beyond that currently collected from passengers.
<P>
2.7 We seek assurances that:
<P>
--the Immigration Service will use its powers sparingly and not overburden airlines with requests for information;
<P>
--requests for data will not involve the carrier in discriminatory activity of any kind; and,
<P>
--the carrier will not be required to collect additional data from that held today.
<P>
3 Clause 25(5) Carriers' Liability&#151;Approved Gate Checks
<P>
3.1 All passengers are required to possess travel documents when they board a British Airways flight to the UK. Some passengers dispose of their documents during the flight and claim asylum on arrival in the UK. On each occasion, the airline is charged &#163;2,000.
<P>
3.2 Carriers find it difficult to prove that specific passengers produced passports on embarkation even though rigorous checks for all passengers take place at departure airports. The Home Office has acknowledged the difficulty of the airline providing a defence in such cases and has developed an administrative solution. Airline passport check procedures at departure airports are examined by Immigration Officers and if they meet certain criteria are given `Approved Gate Check' status. Charges are then waived in respect of passengers who have embarked from such airports even when the passports have been disposed of during the flight.
<P>
3.3 We seek an undertaking from the Secretary of State that:
<P>
--he will upgrade these administrative arrangements and provide a formal defence under the Bill.
<H4><center>4. Clause 25(5) Carriers' Liability&#151;Asylum Claimants</center></H4>
<P>
4.1 Carriers' Liability charges are cancelled in circumstances when persons claiming asylum are successful and refugee status is granted.
<P>
4.2 Charges are not cancelled in circumstances when persons are not successful with their asylum claims, yet nevertheless are allowed to remain in the UK. It is understood that on these occasions, persons are granted `exceptional leave to remain' or `indefinite leave to remain'.
<P>
4.3 The current situation appears inequitable in that charges are cancelled for one category of person, yet not for another although both categories of person remain in the UK. British Airways believes that refunds of Carriers' Liability charges should be extended to cover asylum claimants who are granted `exceptional leave to remain', or `indefinite leave to remain'.
<P>
4.4 We seek an undertaking from the Secretary of State that:
<P>
--he will not maintain Carriers' Liability charges for those asylum claimants who are granted `exceptional leave to remain', or `indefinite leave to remain'.
<H4><center>5. Clause 25(5) Carriers' Liability&#151;Fraudulent Travel Documentation</center></H4>
<P>
5.1 Under the requirements of the UK Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Act 1987, airlines are liable to a charge of &#163;2,000 on each occasion they bring an inadequately documented passenger to the UK. This includes passengers who arrive with false travel documents, unless their falsity is not reasonably apparent.
<P>
5.2 False documentation is invariably associated with organised crime. The forgery of some passports and visas is carried out by criminals with considerable forensic skills and professionalism. As a result, many forgeries are very difficult to detect by anybody other than a skilled immigration official.
<P>
5.3 BA believes that the UK Immigration Service is interpreting this particular provision of the 1987 Carriers' Liability Act in too draconian a fashion, and is expecting check-in agents to display skills which only an immigration officer would possess. Charges are being raised for cases involving documents where we consider the falsity is not reasonably apparent. For example, airline staff are expected to know: whether a French passport issued in a particular year should have a matt or sheen laminate covering the photograph page; or, that the photograph featured in a Dutch passport must be black and white and part profile.
<P>
5.4 Clause 25(5) of the Bill re-enacts the existing legislation and states ``For the purposes of this section [25] a document is to be regarded as what it purports to be unless its falsity is reasonably apparent''.
<P>
5.5 We seek an undertaking from the Secretary of State that:
<P>
--the Immigration Service will act in a reasonable manner when considering raising a &#163;2,000 charge for passengers who arrive with fraudulent documents.
<P>
6 Simplified Passport and Visa Documentation
<P>
6.1 We estimate that about 15 per cent. of our Carriers' Liability charges result from our staff becoming confused by the complex nature of UK passport documentation. Airline staff have very little time to check passports prior to departure, and we believe simplification is key to reducing Carriers' Liability charges as fewer mistakes would be made. This must be of benefit to both Government and airline, as it would reduce casework and costs for both parties.
<P>
6.2 Present terminology may be readily understood by UK immigration officials, however, it can confuse our overseas staff whose native language is other than English. For example, the term `Leave to Enter' forms part of a passport endorsement to indicate that a person has been granted permission to enter the UK. This term is not always interpreted correctly by airline staff.
<P>
6.3 Considerable confusion also arises amongst our staff over whether or not visas are valid. Mistakes are commonplace and on each occasion, the airline is charged &#163;2,000. Around half of the Carriers' Liability charges presently incurred by British Airways result from passengers being accepted for travel without a valid visa.
<P>
6.4 Single entry visas show the date by which the visa is no longer valid, but the visa does not indicate if the holder has already used the visa, i.e. has entered the UK on a previous occasion. Airline staff must search for another stamp in the passport to establish whether or not the passenger has already entered the UK within the validity period of the visa. This task can be particularly complicated and time consuming when there is more than one visa and stamp present in the passport.
<P>
6.5 Acceptance procedures for persons with UK Residence permits in their passports can also cause confusion and lead to Carriers' Liability charges. If a person with UK residency departs the UK and stays away for more than two years, the residency status and passport vignette are no longer valid. Persons whose nationality requires them to hold a UK visa must therefore obtain a visa before travelling. But it is not always evident to airline staff that a person has been out of the UK for more than two years. Airlines must check outbound passenger ticket coupons, and correspondence from the Immigration and Nationality Directorate in an attempt to verify how long a person has been out of the UK. If a mistake is made, we face charges of &#163;2,000.
<P>
6.6 We believe that simplifying passport and visa documentation can strengthen existing legislation.
<P>
6.7 We seek a positive commitment from the Secretary of State that:
<P>
--he will appoint a monitor to assess current passport and visa documentation and report back on how this could be simplified.
<H4><center> 7 Clause 26(3)&#151;Transit Visas</center></H4>
<P>
7.1 A number of passengers have been abusing the UK Transit Without Visa (TWOV) concession. This concession permits nationals, requiring a visa to enter the UK, to make flight connections at UK airports without a visa. A minority of passengers abuse the concession by purchasing tickets for itineraries which involve a transfer between flights at London; however on their arrival at London, instead of continuing their journey to another country, they request political asylum at the UK port of entry control.
<P>
7.2 The Immigration Service has addressed TWOV abuse by imposing a Direct Airside Transit Visa (DATV) on a number of nationals. At present the DATV applies to nationals of Afghanistan, Peoples Republic of China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Slovak Republic, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Uganda, and Yugoslavia (FRY).
<P>
7.3 The DATV is having a significant effect on British Airways transfer passenger business at Heathrow and Gatwick, in which the airline has invested so heavily, and which is so vital to future competitiveness. On some services inbound to the UK, as many as 70 per cent of passengers are transferring to another flight.
<P>
7.4 The DATV results in many bona-fide passengers, who have no intention of claiming asylum, no longer travelling with British Airways by way of London. The cost and inconvenience associated with obtaining the visa deters them from doing so; instead they travel with other airlines by way of other European cities where a transit visa is not required, or where transit visa regulations are enforced less rigorously.
<P>
7.5 The European Union (EU) has a Joint Action Paper on Airport Transit Arrangements. This includes a list of ten countries, whose nationals are subject to the DATV throughout the EU. The countries are Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia and Sri Lanka. Article 4 of the current EU Joint Action Paper, dated 13 January 1999, states that each Member State shall decide whether it is necessary to demand an airport transit visa from the nationals from those countries not mentioned on the joint list (the ten countries). Furthermore, Article 6 of the Paper confirms that a Member State may provide for exceptions to the obligation to carry an airport transit visa for certain categories of person including those holding a visa issued by a Member State. Article 7 goes further by indicating that Member States do not require any airport transit visa from certain categories of person including those holding a residence permit issued by a Member State.
<P>
7.6 Under Clause 26 of the Bill, the Secretary of State may by order require transit passengers to hold a transit visa; and, the order may provide for any category of persons of a description specified in the order to be exempted from the requirement imposed by the order.
<P>
7.7 We welcome the provisions in the Bill which empower the Secretary of State to grant exemptions from DATV requirements and seek an assurance that:
<P>
--the list of countries whose nationals will be required to obtain DATVs will not be expanded unless it is absolutely necessary;
<P>
--the current list of countries to which the DATV regime applies will be reviewed at regular intervals and countries removed from the list where possible;
<P>
--exemptions to the DATV requirement will be introduced, as specified in the EU Joint Action Paper, for nationals of Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Ghana, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, Somalia and Sri Lanka, provided they are in possession of a residence permit issued by an EU State; or a visa issued by an EU state, or by a State which is party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area; and, 
<P>
--exemptions to the DATV requirement will be introduced for certain nationals not included on the EU Joint List, namely, The Peoples Republic of China, Slovak Republic, Turkey, Uganda and Yugoslavia (FRY), provided they are in possession of a residence permit issued by an EU State; or a visa issued by Canada, USA, an EU State, or by a State which is party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.

<H4><center>AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY BRITISH AIRWAYS</center></H4>
<H4><center>Clause 9 (Passenger information)</center></H4>
<P>
Clause 9, page 7, line 8 leave out ``as the Secretary of State may direct'' and insert ``as may be specified''.
<H4><center>Reasons for the amendment</center></H4>
<P>
Under Clause 27B(6) of the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended by the Bill) it is proposed that passenger information must be provided by airline carriers ``in such form or manner as the Secretary of State may direct''.
<P>
This amendment would ensure that such form and manner would be specified in an Order made by Statutory Instrument.
<H4><center>Commentary</center></H4>
<P>
Power already exists for the Immigration Service to require carriers to give the names and nationality of their passengers but it has been sparingly used. Nobody at BA can remember a specific instance of a request for nationality being made.
<P>
At present passenger data held by airlines varies from a surname and itinerary to more detailed information such as contact details and fare information. No information is currently put in the computer about nationality (except for US flights) and in many cases the only contact information is that of the passenger's travel agent telephone number.
<P>
It is airline policy to keep the computer data held on passengers to the minimum.
<P>
The provision of new information to immigration officers will involve substantial changes in airline procedures. There will be extra cost and inconvenience to both passengers and airlines. The information will have to be collected from passengers at the time of reservation or at check-in when passports are produced to check-in staff. This process must be implemented in a sensitive non-discriminatory way as many passengers are unhappy about the storage of personal information on airline computers.
<P>
The form and manner in which the information is required should be decided by Parliament and not left to the discretion of officials within the Home Office.
<H4><center>Clause 9 (Passenger Information)</center></H4>
<P>
Clause 9, page 7, line 10 at end add&#151;
<P>
``(6A) In making a request under subsection (2) the Immigration Officer must have regard to the need&#151;
<P>
(a) to request the minimum amount of information necessary for the purpose for which it is required and
<P>
(b) to avoid complaints that the carrier in requiring the information has discriminated against passengers on the grounds of race, colour or religion.''
<H4><center>Reason for the amendment</center></H4>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Home Office requests only the minimum amount of information under section 27B(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 and that the airlines are not burdened with collecting unnecessary information which might lead to discrimination claims.
<H4><center>Commentary</center></H4>
<P>
At many airports the check-in process is a stressful procedure where check in and boarding have to be completed under challenging time constraints.
<P>
In some national cultures the status of passports and the information contained in them is viewed in a different light when compared to the UK. Many passengers do not like information from their passports being copied or computerised and some ethnic groups are suspicious of discrimination where such information is being recorded.
<P>
The amendment therefore seeks to limit such requests to the absolute minimum and to protect the airlines against being required to engage in discriminatory conduct.
<H4><center>Clause 25 (Charges in respect of passengers without proper documents)</center></H4>
<P>
Clause 25, page 18, line 21 at end add
<P>
(4A) No charge is payable in respect of a person who fails on arrival in the United Kingdom to produce the documents required under subsection (1) if the owner or train operator of the ship aircraft or train in which that person arrived can show that before that person embarked for the United Kingdom the following procedures had been applied:&#151;
<P>
(a) a full document check of all passengers had been conducted immediately prior to boarding and
<P>
(b) in the case of an aircraft the check had taken place at the departure gate and each passengers documents had been reconciled with their boarding card and
<P>
(c) that reasonable security arrangements approved in advance by an immigration officer (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) had been used at the point of embarkation to ensure that passengers could not circumvent the document checks.
<P>
(4B) In approving arrangements under subsection (4A)(c) the immigration officer must impose only the minimum arrangements consistent with effective document checks.
<H4><center>Reason for the amendment</center></H4>
<P>
 Some asylum seekers destroy their passports in-flight and therefore have no documents to show to immigration officers when they arrive in the UK to claim asylum. This puts the carrier in breach of clause 25(1) of the Bill. A defence is provided by clause 25(4) but it has proved in practice to be of problematical value. The amendment proposes a more robust defence for carriers who have acted responsibly in checking all documents of all passengers at overseas stations.
<H4><center>Commentary</center></H4>
<P>
The destruction of documents in flight has grown considerably since the introduction of the Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Act 1987. Some groups of asylum seekers are backed by organised crime. Criminals often advise such groups to destroy their passport in flight or hand it to a courier who is also on board the aircraft.
<P>
Carriers find it difficult to prove that specific passengers have produced their passports on embarkation even though rigourous checks of all passengers had taken place at the departure airport. It would be possible to construct an unassailable defence by photocopying passports. However, every passengers passport would need to be copied (including the passports of UK and other EU nationals who are not in fact caught by the legislation) if the airlines were not to be open to charges of discrimination. The photocopying of all passports of all passengers would lead to unacceptable operational delays.
<P>
The Home Office has already acknowledged the difficulty of proving the defence available under section 25(4). As a result they have developed an administrative solution. Overseas airports known to be used by passengers likely to destroy documents are inspected by Immigration Officers and given ``Approved Gate Check Status'' as set out in the attached extract from the Immigration Service Booklet ``Charging Procedures&#151;A Guide For Carriers''.
<P>
Charges are then waived in respect of passengers who have embarked frm such airports even when the passports have been destroyed in flight.
<P>
The amendment seeks to upgrade administrative arrangements and provide a formal defence under the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 25 (Charges in respect of passengers without proper documents)</center></H4>
<P>
Clause 25, page 18, line 19, at end add:
<P>
``(4A) No charge is payable in respect of any person&#151;

<P>
(b) has appealed against removal on the grounds set out in paragraph (a) above and has been granted either indefinite or limited leave to remain.''
<H4><center>Reason for the amendment</center></H4>
<P>
Currently charges paid by carriers under the Carrier's Liability Act are, by the exercise of the Secretary of State's administrative discretion are refunded to the carrier if the passenger is subsequently granted asylum. However, no such refunds are given if the passenger claims asylum but is only granted leave to remain.
<H4><center>Commentary</center></H4>
<P>
BA believes that it is inequitable for charges to be levied for either of these categories of passengers. The present system of refunds for successful asylum claims should be put on a proper statutory basis so that the airlines are entitled to claim them. Charges levied on the arrival of asylum seekers subsequently granted leave to remain should be put on the same basis.
<H4><center>Clause 25 (Charges in respect of passengers without proper documents)</center></H4>
<P>
Clause 25, page 18, line 20, leave out lines 20 and 21 and insert:
<P>

<P>
(a) a document is what it purports to be unless its falsity is reasonably apparent and
<P>
(b) in deciding whether the falsity of a document is reasonably apparent it shall be assumed that the person making the appropriate judgement is not an immigration officer.
<H4><center>Reason for the amendment</center></H4>
<P>
Immigration Officers expect airline check-in agents to apply unrealistically ambitious forgery recognition skills. As a result too many charges are levied on carriers in forgery cases and the relief contemplated by the Act is not being given in all appropriate cases.
<H4><center>Commentary</center></H4>
<P>
Immigration Officers tend to assume that check-in agents have the same level of skills and training as themselves when dealing with the detection of forgeries. For example, airline staff are expected to know that older passports issued by the Netherlands feature:
<P>
(a) guilloches at the bottom of page 2 and at the top of page 3; and
<P>
(b) photographs which are black and white and part profile.
<H4><center>Clause 25 (Charges in respect of passengers without proper documents)</center></H4>
<P>
Clause 25, page 18, line 43 at end add:
<P>
``(11) The Secretary of State must appoint a person to monitor the complexity and effectiveness of visas and stamps required in passports.
<P>
(12) The monitor must make an annual report on the discharge of his functions to the Secretary of State and must include in the report any recommendations for the simplification of visas and stamps and the introduction of new technology.''
<H4><center>Reason for the amendment</center></H4>
<P>
Many charges are incurred by airlines because of the confusing nature of UK entry stamps in the passports of non EU nationals. This amendment seeks to impose formal requirements on the Home Office to review the effectiveness of entry and visa stamps and to embrace modern technology.
<H4><center>Commentary</center></H4>
<P>
The airlines have for many years been urging the Home Office and the Foreign Office to do something about the unnecessarily complex nature of visa and entry stamps for admission to the UK. There is an inexplicable reluctance on the part of the Home Office to initiate change despite the fact that this would benefit all participants in the process. The Government would benefit from a simpler regime because the airlines would find the stamps easier to interpret correctly and fewer inadequately documented passengers would then reach the UK. Airlines would benefit by paying fewer charges. Passengers would benefit by greater clarity at check in thus avoiding the humiliations visited on them by incorrect documentation.
<H4><center>Example</center></H4>
<P>
Single entry visas issued by the UK authorities show the date by which the visa is no longer valid, but the visa does not indicate if the holder has already used the visa. Airline staff must search for another stamp in the passport to establish whether the passenger has entered the UK during the validity period of the visa. We have suggested that a `USED' stamp be placed against the visa when the passenger arrives in the UK.
<H4><center>Clause 26 (Visas for transit passengers)</center></H4>
<H4><center>Clause 26 page 19 line 16 at end add:&#151;</center></H4>
<P>
``(e) must provide that persons holding either a permit to reside in or a visa to enter a state of the European Union shall be exempted from the requirement imposed by the order.''
<H4><center>Reason for the amendment</center></H4>
<P>
Some nationals (such as citizens of the Republic of Slovakia) who arrive in the UK merely to pick up a connecting flight to a third country nonetheless need visas to transit the UK even if they are staying air side. The amendment seeks to exempt them from this requirement if they already hold a residence permit for an EU country or an entry visa for an EU country.
<H4><center>Commentary</center></H4>
<P>
Nationals of the following countries require a visa to transit the UK even though they stay air side: Afghanistan, China, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Slovalzia, Somalia, Sri-Lanka, Turkey, Uganda, Yugoslavia, and Democratic Republic of Congo.
<P>
These arrangements work to the disadvantage of UK aviation because similar provisions do not always apply at competitor airports such as Schipol or Frankfurt. Thus a Chinese national travelling from Beijing to Paris via Heathrow would not need to go land side at Heathrow. However, such a passenger would still need apply for a transit visa prior to travel even though fully entitled to enter another EU state by possession of a residence permit or visa.
<P>
The airlines do not dispute the need for such transit visas as part of the armoury of immigration control. However the impositions of transit visas needs to be carried out in a more selective and less heavy handed manner. One of the unintended consequences is that benefits accrue to other European hubs such as Brussels, where such controls are dealt with more flexibly to the significant benefit of their transfer traffic of those airports.
<H4><center>Memorandum from the Freight Transport Association and the Road Haulage Association</center></H4>
<H4><center>Background</center></H4>
<P>
This submission is made to the Committee jointly by the Freight Transport Association and the Road Haulage Association. The two Associations represent the interests of over 20,000 businesses. Their membership includes road haulage and logistics companies, own-account vehicle operators and manufacturing companies and exporters as users of freight transport. Between them the Associations' members operate over 250,000 vehicles which is about two-thirds of the total number of heavy goods vehicles registered in the UK.
<P>
In view of the above, this Memorandum relates specifically to the Carriers Liability clauses of the Immigration and Asylum Bill (part ii, clauses 18-28).
<H4><center>Introduction</center></H4>
<P>
The two Associations have, in recent months, had numerous meetings with both Ministers and officials from the Home Office and other Government Departments in order to explain fully the distribution industry's perspective on this issue. Throughout our discussions, the associations have given full support for severe penalties against those found guilty of deliberately and knowingly bringing clandestine immigrants into the UK. The current maximum penalty available under the 1971 Immigration Act is seven years imprisonment.
<P>
However, the industry believes that the proposals contained in this Bill to introduce financial penalties for operators or drivers found to be carrying illegal immigrants, will put too many innocent people at risk and will do nothing to improve the situation. Following an early meeting with Home Office Minister Mike O'Brien, the FTA and RHA submitted a paper which detailed these concerns and offered suggestions for alternative arrangements that would be more effective in addressing the problem whilst offering protection to the innocent&#151;a copy of this paper is attached for the Committee's attention. As a result, the Government has acknowledged the practical difficulties faced by operators and drivers.
<P>
Nevertheless, we remain of the opinion that the Bill will actually achieve very little for the following reasons:
<P>
--The primary reason why illegal immigrants target the UK as their final destination is that the welfare and benefit system is particularly attractive to them;
<P>
--The chances of illegal immigrants being detected by the authorities are very small. Statistics show that over 90 per cent. of illegal immigrants detected in vehicles are detained as a result of voluntary actions by the driver/operator. Only 3 per cent. are detected by foreign authorities and a further 3 per cent. by UK authorities. Introducing fines will remove any incentive a driver has to report his unwanted cargo to the relevant authorities;
<P>
--The Bill contains no commitment from the Government to encourage greater co-operation from Foreign (particularly French) Port authorities to improve security and detection in and around ports;
<P>
--The Bill contains no commitment to increase enforcement activity in the UK in order to improve detection rates;
<P>
--Once detected, very few illegal immigrants are actually deported.
<H4><center>Providing adequate safeguards within the Bill</center></H4>
<P>
The FTA and the RHA believe that the Bill as currently drafted does not contain adequate safeguards from the proposed penalties for conscientious operators and drivers who are themselves the victims of organised criminal activities. To achieve a fairer and more equitable balance the associations would like to see a number of amendments to the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 18&#151;Penalty for carrying clandestines</center></H4>
<P>
The two associations believe that difficulties will arise as a result of the definition of a ``responsible person''.
<P>
Subsection (5)(b) states that if it is a vehicle (but not a detached trailer), the owner, hirer or driver of the vehicle will be considered to be a responsible person on whom a penalty may be levied. Unless the owner/hirer is also the driver at the time the clandestines are discovered, we believe it would be unreasonable to apply the penalty to them. Even if the driver is involved in some way, the owner (unless he is also the driver) will be an innocent third party.
<P>
Similar problems exists with subsection (5)(c) which states that in the case of a detached trailer, the owner or hirer of the trailer will be considered to be a responsible person. The nature of the unaccompanied freight (i.e. trailers transported without a permanent driver) means that frequently, the person hiring or owning the trailer has no physical contact with the trailer nor direct control over its utilisation. Thus we believe it would be unreasonable to impose a fine in such circumstances.
<H4><center>Clause 19&#151;Code of Practice</center></H4>
<P>
The Code of Practice described in this clause has a key role to play in these proposals, particularly in ensuring that innocent parties (whether or not they are the drivers of the vehicles) are not unfairly penalised. In order that the Code of Practice is seen to be workable and realistic, and thus accepted by the industry, it is essential that industry representatives who understand the freight market play an integral role in drawing up the Code.
<P>
In addition, we would like to see a commitment from Government to the introduction of a linked Code of Practice before any clauses enacting penalties are brought into force.
<H4><center>Clause 20&#151;Defences</center></H4>
<P>
Subsections (3)(b) and (3)(c) provide for a defence where a person can show that an effective system for preventing the carriage of clandestine entrants was in operation and that on the occasion in question the person or persons responsible for operating that system did so properly. We believe that it will be impossible in practice for drivers to benefit from the defences set out in 3(c). Most drivers are the sole occupants of a vehicle and therefore would not have a third party available to substantiate their claim that they properly operated an effective system on the occasion in question. There is a danger that without independent witnesses the simple fact that illegal immigrants have been found on the vehicle will be taken automatically as conclusive evidence that any system has not been operated properly by the driver.
<P>
The two associations also believe there is a case for a third, automatic, defence where there has been voluntary action by the driver or operator leading to the apprehension of illegal immigrants.
<H4><center>Clause 22&#151;Vehicle detention</center></H4>
<P>
The industry is strongly opposed to the prospect of vehicles being detained under these conditions particularly because the driver of the vehicle is generally not the owner of the vehicle. Confiscating the property of an innocent third party, particularly when the property is actually his businesses, is wholly unreasonable. If the Government is determined to acquire this power, there must be very strict rules about its use.
<P>
The two associations believe that the following safeguards will be necessary:
<P>
--detention should only be possible where the driver can be shown also to be the owner of the vehicle;
<P>
--compensation (for loss of trade) should be available for owners of vehicles that are wrongly detained;
<P>
--provision of a fast and effective appeal procedure against the decision of the senior office concerned to detain a vehicle.
<H4><center>Conclusions</center></H4>
<P>
The grounds for these amendments and commitments are that FTA and RHA have gathered significant evidence demonstrating the difficulties that even the most vigilant of drivers and operators face in preventing illegal immigrants gaining access to vehicles or detecting persons already concealed in the load compartment. A recent survey indicated that although the vast majority of drivers carry out checks on their vehicles, the problem continues to be experienced across the whole spectrum of international operations.
<P>
There are a number of reasons why operators and drivers cannot alone implement measures which guarantee protection against the unintentional carriage of clandestines. Many containers or trailers are collected at an intermediate point in transit to the UK and frequently these have already been loaded and sealed. Even where there are no legal impediments to the driver attempting to search a fully loaded vehicle he faces huge practical difficulties coupled with physical risk if illegal immigrants are discovered.
<P>
Equally, the highly organised nature of the illegal immigrant trade means that access to the vehicle is often obtained with the aid of external accomplices who then camouflage what would otherwise have been detectable evidence of entry. And because of the lack of security at continental ports, vehicles remain vulnerable to infiltration right up to the moment of embarkation. Once on board the driver is helpless to prevent illegal immigrants accessing the unsupervised vehicle during the voyage.
<P>
The Government stance of seeing all carriers contributing to the problem by design or default fails to recognise the crucial detection role played by operators and drivers in the apprehension of illegal immigrants.
<H4><center>INDUSTRY PROPOSALS ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</center></H4>
<H4><center>Introduction</center></H4>
<P>
Following a meeting between the Road Haulage Association (RHA), the Freight Transport Association (FTA), and Home Office Minister Mike O'Brien, this paper outlines the industry's proposals for tackling the problem of illegal immigrants entering the UK aboard lorries.
<H4><center>Background</center></H4>
<P>
The problem of clandestine illegal immigrants entering the UK has been increasing rapidly in recent years: in 1997 the total clandestine entrants numbered only 4,000 (representing 28 per cent. of total illegal immigrants). In 1998, it has risen to nearly 7,000 between January and October alone, and clandestine entrants now account for 50 per cent. of the total. Of course all this traffic is one way&#151;no clandestine immigrant is an EU citizen. Thus they have to travel through ports in mainland Europe to get to the UK. And for whatever reason, the UK remains a more attractive destination than many of our EU neighbours.
<H4><center>Industry's concerns</center></H4>
<P>
The primary concern of the UK distribution industry is that too many innocent people within the industry are being exposed to potential danger. For example, there are an increasing number of cases where the tractor unit and vehicle driver have long since departed and the trailer is opened up by a warehouseman who is then unexpectedly confronted by illegal immigrants who frequently are in possession of Stanley knives used to gain access to the vehicle and, on occasions, more serious weapons. This can present a very serious threat to personal security since those on board are confused, do not know where they are and are prepared to take desperate measures to get what they set out to achieve.
<P>
The ambition of the industry therefore is help secure measures which `prevent and protect'&#151;ie prevent the problem from happening in the first place but then protect those who are vulnerable where it does happen. The vast majority of professional drivers are becoming increasingly concerned at the extent to which they are being `exposed' to the organised crime gangs that frequently are involved in this trade.
<P>
In general the distribution industry has a very good record of co-operating with Government to stamp out illegal trades using transport&#151;indeed the RHA and the FTA are members of the Government's Anti-Drugs Alliance. The industry frequently provides information, for example on irregular vehicle movements, inexplicable destinations, tampering with cargoes etc, providing information about our own members and drivers if needed. This is a clear demonstration of the industry's acceptance of its role in stamping out illegality and criminality where it exists.
<H4><center>Prospects of Legislation</center></H4>
<P>
Against this background both the two trade associations and other industry partners are concerned about statements made by Ministers that the answer to this traffic in human misery is to use the criminal law and impose large fines on hauliers found to be involved&#151;similar to the notion of carriers liability in relation to airlines and passenger shipping. The industry believes that further legislation simply is not the answer in this case and there are a number of reasons for this belief.
<P>
Firstly there is a fundamental difference between passenger carriers and their relationship to illegal immigrants (dealt with by the Carriers Liability Act) and a haulier pulling a trailer or semi-trailer with no provision for human occupancy and who can make no legal contract with any passenger who is either knowingly or unknowlingly carried.
<P>
The Carriers Liability Act (CLA) was introduced when visa requirements allowed Government to insist that those entering the UK were in possession of apropriate permissions (i.e. visas) that were obtained before embarkation. The CLA put the obligation on the carrier to check the legitimacy of the documentation before completing a contract for commercial passenger carriage. Most parties agree that this is reasonable.
<P>
By contrast, if we assume the driver is involved in some way (and we do not believe this is true in the vast majority of cases) what we have is a situation where one person is endeavouring to smuggle illegal immigrants into the UK, evading controls, utilising the fact that currently there are no external checks and taking certain sums once they arrive. It is important to remember that if a driver is involved, the only way that the trade can be picked up effectively is if we introduce a system of independent verification that is not reliant solely on the driver, but involves the Immigration Service or the Police.
<P>
In addition the relationship between a lorry driver and his employer is very different to that between a Captain or a Pilot and his, particularly in terms of his responsibility in law for the safe carriage of passengers and the extent to which a Captain (or Pilot) will only accept passengers on the authority of his employer. Nor will a Captain personally pay a fine or be deemed to have committed an offence&#151;the provisions relate solely to the airline. In many operations, trailers are sent unaccompanied initially and then `picked up' by a driver at a later stage of the journey, or the journey involves a `change over'. In both cases, the driver who potentially faces a fine may have been no where near the vehicle. It makes no sense to hold a driver liable under such circumstances.
<P>
As referred to later in this paper, the industry is not suggesting that drivers who participate in criminal activity should not face severe penalties. The existing law, however, provides such penaties today.
<H4><center>Preventative measures</center></H4>
<P>
There are, of course a number of practical measures we believe can and should be taken to help prevent the current situation continuing:
<P>
--Both Trade Associations have in the recent past issued guidelines to international haulage companies on measures they should employ to avoid illegal immigrants gaining access to vehicles. These will be re-issued to all parties involved;
<P>
--Guidance can be issued by the industry (and perhaps also through Government, CBI or other international business representatives) to remind consignors of the need for them to check their containers before they are sealed prior to departure. There is evidence of a number of cases (e.g. Ford & Vauxhall motor companies) where containers that were sealed by factory staff prior to departure were then found to have contained illegal immigrants;
<P>
--An analysis of the key locations where immigrants are boarding vehicles (which would require co-operation between Member States) should be undertaken as this would allow proper targeting of enforcement activity and advice;
<P>
--Enforcement (and guidance) must also target those vehicles and operations that are known to be most at risk. Refrigerated vehicles generally are not a high risk, for obvious reasons. However, driver accompanied groupage services are highly attractive because they offer in effect, a guaranteed timetable. Organised crime gangs get to know both the routes being operated and the times so they can specify drop off points and times. Curtain sided tilt trailers are the most vulnerable vehicles because they offer relatively easy access. They can, for example, be accessed through the roof without the seals being distrubed and where the curtain is cut, they can be repaired very easily so that any tampering is difficult to detect.
<H4><center>Why not just instruct drivers to open every vehicle?</center></H4>
<P>
It has been suggested that the most obvious and simple solution to this problem would be to instruct every driver to inspect his load fully before departure, then impose strict liability on those subsequently caught carrying illegal immigrants.
<P>
However, there are a number of problems with this suggestion:
<P>
--The logistics of requiring each trailer to be opened and searched would be seriously impractical&#151;because of the dimensions of the trailer and its cargo, simply opening up the back would not be sufficient to allow the driver to detect whether he had people on board. A thorough internal search would need to be undertaken and this would take time and inevitably cause congestion. [HM Customs & Excise do not currently inspect every vehicle precisely because they accept that it is impractical to do so];
<P>
--International transport frequently involves the sealing of containers by agents of the consignee so that when the goods are received with the seal intact, he has proof of consignment and the consignor has effective proof of delivery. Requiring drivers to open a sealed container without supervision would thus impose a significant additional burden on industry and for many consignments (e.g. foodstuffs, medical equipment etc.) would be undesirable on health, safety and other grounds. For a system of routine seal breaking, a Customs (or other enforcement agency) official would need to authorise and record the opening on the transit note carried by the driver. This clearly has resource implications in terms of the presence of an official at each inspection site.
<P>
We are thus obliged to reject the proposition that internal inspection is the most desirable option.
<H4><center>Technology</center></H4>
<P>
There remains the issue of a technological solution. The industry has had the benefit of seeing a paper produced by the Immigration Service entitled ``Enclosed Space Detection: A Review of Available Technology''. This paper examines the pros and cons of available techniques including: X-ray, Carbon Dioxide samplers, heartbeat detectors, thermal imaging, endoscopes and, of course, search dogs.
<P>
In summary what the paper finds is that of the solutions available, only sniffer dogs and Carbon Dioxide samplers are considered successful methods. Heartbeat detectors and thermal imaging cameras are considered potentially adaptable but not practically viable at present, X-ray systems are inapplicable on grounds of cost and health and endoscopes are simply impractical.
<P>
This paper has already supported the concept of using sniffer (or search) dogs and we believe that the use of Carbon Dioxide samplers would certainly obviate the need to conduct an internal search with all the problems associated with that option. However, the industry does believe that new technologies should continue to be sought and examined carefully for their potential in this area. Of course, the key issue relevant to consideration of any such solution, is where it takes place.
<H4><center>Location is the key</center></H4>
<P>
From the moment an immigrant is aboard a vessel sailing to the UK, even if that is where they are discovered, that person becomes the responsibility of the UK Government. Indeed it is well known that many tactics are used to ensure this including passports being thrown away once on board and immigrants being tutored in how to claim asylum in the UK. Therefore the key to success of any measures must be to ensure that they take place at the point of embarkation and thus do not make the potential illegal immigrant a burden on the UK economy.
<P>
It is clear that the attitudes of the French and Belgian Governments, and even between different Port Authorities in France, differ widely. For example, at Zeebrugge sniffer dogs are routinely allowed to roam through the vehicle park. This acts as a significant deterrent&#151;it is generally accepted that very little traffic (in illegal immigrants) passes through this Port. [Another similar example is in Cherbourg where dogs are sent into the back of suspect vehicles with spectacular results].
<P>
However, in Calais&#151;the main focus of concern and the principal port of passage for goods vehicles entering the UK&#151;there is virtually no security within the port. The perimeter itself is not secure, there is very little practical security and there is no method of confining vehicles to specific routes on approach.
<P>
There are two conclusions to be drawn from this:
<P>
--The first is that if utilised correctly, sniffer dogs may prove to be a very cost-effective and simple screening device; and
<P>
--second, that there is a need for the UK Government to add to the pressure already being exerted by the Ferry companies on the newly appointed Sub-prefect in Calais aimed at improving the security of the port itself.
<P>
If ports are secure, an efficient screening system (for example Carbon Dioxide samplers or simply use of dogs) is employed before embarkation, haulage operators themselves conduct regular checks wherever possible and consignees check loads whilst they are being sealed or loaded, we believe an effective method will exist for preventing and deterring illegal immigrants from entering the UK. This will clearly need the active involvement of FCO, Home Office, Customs & Excise etc if this action by French, and specifically Calais authorities is to be initiated. The industry will certainly support any such moves, but they are essentially inter-governmental.
<H4><center>Need for additional legislation?</center></H4>
<P>
The RHA and the FTA believe that the provision in the 1971 Immigration Act which allows the conviction of those who ``knowingly facilitate illegal entry''&#151;for which the maximum sentence is 7 years' imprisonment&#151;is sufficient to allow action to be taken in any circumstances where it is suspected that the driver is colluding. Where that is evident, both trade associations agree that such strong penalties should apply.
<P>
In addition we believe that the British Government needs to strengthen efforts within the EU to ensure that EU external borders are made more secure. Traffic in illegal immigrants does not arise from among EU nationals&#151;travellers generally enter into the EU by land from Eastern Europe and the Balkans.
<H4><center>Conclusions and recommendations</center></H4>
<P>
The industry believes that there are a number of actions that, if taken, will help to address this issue. These can be summarised as follows:
<P>
--Industry to issue guidelines to operators on checking vehicles;
<P>
--Industry (and Government and business organisations) to issue guidance to consignors;
<P>
--Analysis to be undertaken on locations which represent the highest risk;
<P>
--Enforcement activity to be targeted at vehicles/locations found to be most at risk;
<P>
--Further investigation of the potential for the use of Carbon Dioxide samplers and other technological solutions as they become available, including the possibility of their use abroad and/or by haulage operators themselves;
<P>
--Investigation of practicability of conducting routine checks (utilising CO2 samplers and search dogs) at points of embarkation;
<P>
--Government to exert pressure within the EU to ensure security of EU external borders;
<P>
--Government to negotiate with French/Calais authorities concerning security of Port of Calais.
<P>
A system which incorporates all of these elements will, we believe, prove to be very effective in preventing illegal immigrants from entering the UK.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Good afternoon gentlemen. It is the first time that there has not been a lady present as a witness.
<P>
Thank you all very much for agreeing to act together as witnesses. This session must finish at 6.10 pm on the dot. Obviously if members run out of questions and you run out of answers, we can finish early. We are not asking for opening statements, but perhaps each of you could explain who you are and who you represent, for the record.
<P>
<B>Geoff Dossetter </B>(Freight Transport Association): Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am head of external affairs at the Freight Transport Association. Our members operate about 200,000 vehicles, including a large number on international business.
<P>
<B>Steven Norris </B>(Road Haulage Association): I am the director-general of the Road Haulage Association. We operate in the hire and reward sector. Our members also are involved in international traffic. We have abour 10,000 companies in membership operating around 100,000 vehicles.
<P>
<B>Mervyn Walker </B>(British Airways): Good afternoon. I am director of human resources at British Airways.
<P>
<B>Jim Forster </B>(British Airways): Good afternoon. I am from British Airways Government affairs. My responsibilities include managing immigration matters for the airline.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> May I begin with Mr. Dossetter? The number of clandestine, undocumented people coming into the United Kingdom is increasing&#151;particularly those entering in the back of lorries. Does not that suggest to you that drivers are currently not taking adequate steps to ensure the security of their vehicles?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> We start from the premise that the lorry driver is the guy straight in the firing line, who bears the first element of responsibility for endeavouring to ensure that his vehicle is not penetrated by illegal immigrants and that he is not bringing them into the country. That simple statement, however, clouds the fact that such penetration of vehicles if often a matter of criminal activity by cohorts on the other side of the English channel. However much the drivers make strenuous efforts and the operators instruct drivers to try to ensure that the vehicles are not penetrated, experience shows time and again that they are so penetrated.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> But you would not argue that drivers are now taking adequate steps.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> We have conducted surveys of operators and drivers. The Committee should note that, in the first instance, the driver is the initial victim of the problem of illegal immigrants. Unfortunately, in the recent past, drivers have been portrayed as idiots or as being criminally inclined. That may be the case at both ends of the scale, but the vast majority of drivers regard clandestine entry as a serious problem. They are the first victims of that problem and first in the firing line.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> So why are increasing numbers of illegal immigrants coming here in the backs of lorries? Last year, 8,000 of them came in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> Indeed. There is, I suspect, criminal activity on the other side of the water and there are all sorts of goings-on on cross-channel vehicles. Immigration authorities on this side of the water and in France and Belgium are unable to trace illegal immigrants. There is a growing armada of illegal immigrants seeking to get into the country. Frankly, they are penetrating our members' vehicles unbeknown to the drivers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> I will add to that. Once it becomes clear that there are no substantial controls on entry in lorries, the number of people seeking to use that method of entry is likely to increase. It is worth examining the evidence that suggests that 90 per cent. of those entering the country in lorries subsequently present themselves to the authorities. They were not detected on the vehicle at the point of embarkation or disembarkation.
<P>
Those people went through the whole process without being detected because there is effectively no official scrutiny of lorries' loads. In my experience, when it is clear that an activity can take place without detection, it does indeed take place. Penalties for criminal activity do not deter those who recognise that there is no proper supervision of lorries.
<P>
The driver simply cannot give his lorry the thorough check that is required. He, the driver may be asked to check his vehicle in a lay-by on a rainy night. On such an occasion, he cannot possibly see whether anyone has got in through the roof of the vehicle, which is commonplace, and he cannot check that numbers on seals are consistent with the numbers that were originally given.
<P>
The idea that drivers are complicit, ignorant or indolent is wide of the mark and reveals a failure to understand the market. We do not condone traffic in illegal immigrants. However, given the total absence of supervision at the ports, it is not surprising that it takes place.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does British Airways want to comment on this matter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Walker:</B> No, we do not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Mr. Dossetter, members of your association are drivers and hauliers. You have a lot of experience of co-operating with the authorities and the police on crime in other areas, such as drugs. I imagine that your members would wish to co-operate and stem the tide of illegal immigrants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> I return to the point that I mentioned a moment ago. We start from the position that the driver and the operator are the first victims of the problem. We are looking here at time delays, damage to the vehicle, damage to the load and the cost of all that, schedules being put out and the physical safety of the driver himself. Taking all that into account, you can well see that drivers regard the situation extremely seriously and do everything in their control to avoid carrying illegal immigrants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This is a new form of carriers' liability. It is not like taking passengers on a train or aeroplane. If the driver is found to have a clandestine entrant on the vehicle, under the Bill as it stands, the driver or haulier will face a stiff penalty unless he can show that he has taken all reasonable precautions. Is that right, or will it be in the code of practice, although we do not know what that will cover?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> As expressed in the Bill, the question is ``Have you stopped beating in your wife?'' If the driver could show that he had taken all due precautions, he would not have an illegal on board, would he?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the provision put the driver in a difficult position if he discovers a clandestine entrant? What incentive will it create, with the best will in the world, for responsible drivers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> Clearly the possibility of a &#163;2,000 fine concentrates the minds of the driver, and his boss, the operator and owner of the vehicle, but it does not stop there. I return to the points I made earlier about the inconvenience and the delays and all the filth and mess that is involved when there have been illegals on board a vehicle for a day or two.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Are you confident that in every case a driver diligently undertaking checks will be able to discover a clandestine entrant?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> I am afraid that that is not the case. It is not always possible to find illegal immigrants on board. We are not looking here at someone crouching behind the back seat of a Ford Fiesta, but a 40ft trailer full of goods. It is difficult to search throughout. What is the driver to do? Is he to unload the vehicle by the roadside and face up to all the problems that that would entail? We have seen time and again instances of drivers taking all due checks, but being unable to find illegal immigrants on board. Their action is repeated, as Mr. Norris said, by embarkation and immigration officials and the police this side of the water who are still unable to find these people. Down the road when they are away, there is a knock on the back of the vehicle and there we are&#151;we have some illegals on board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I would find it helpful if you could take us through the security controls that the vehicle passes through on its journey from the continent to Britain. Are you satisfied with the level of protection and security at each of the cross-channel ports? Is there a variation in them at the moment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> Most certainly there is not adequate security. The primary bad player here is the port of Calais, where we have all seen recently the extent of the lack of security. The authorities in Calais suggest that they will improve matters later in the year, but by that time we may face &#163;2,000 bills for operators and drivers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> What about the security controls as the vehicle makes its way across the channel and through disembarkation in this country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> Again, there is much evidence to suggest that illegals are able to board UK vehicles on the ferry trip across the channel. There is plenty of evidence of that. Again, at the port of Dover and the checks by the immigration authorities, because of the difficulty created by the size of the vehicle and the load on board, checks are sometimes cursory or even non-existent. As a result, the vehicle moves out of the port complete with illegals on board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I can imagine that there are times when your members are in a difficult position because much of this has a background of criminal activity. Are there sometimes physical risks to the drivers themselves?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> Let us talk about the happy situation of a driver discovering illegals on board, perhaps in the middle of the night. There may be half a dozen hungry, desperate illegal immigrants who have it in mind to settle in the United Kingdom come what may. It is a matter of great concern to our members and their drivers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I know that Mr. Norris is suffering from a cold, by the sound of it. I wonder whether he has anything to add to any of those points.
<P>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Norris:</B> I want to add just one or two points. You spoke of the co-operation that we, as an industry, extend to the Government, for example, in relation to the detection of drugs. One feature of that is the existence of a hotline that hauliers can use when they suspect that there may be something amiss with their load. That gives them instant access to the authorities in this country, and makes sure that the co-operation that is often necessary&#151;surveillance co-operation, and so on&#151;can take place.
<P>
The extraordinary proposition in the Bill is that any haulier who detects an illegal immigrant in his truck, especially once the truck has arrived in the United Kingdom, is under a massive disincentive to co-operate with the authorities. Hauliers would immediately face a completely unacceptable choice between doing their civic duty by declaring the existence of these clandestines to the police and then facing the propspect of a fine, or simply releasing them in some lay-by in the middle of nowhere. Surely that would only add to the problem, and it is why we regard the situation as unacceptable.
<P>
It is also worth understanding that at Dover heavy commercial vehicles pass through the port at the rate of hundreds an hour. It would be physically impossible for each one to be stopped and checked. It is therefore crucial that much more effort is made to detect the presence of clandestine passengers at the point of embarkation. We believe that the Home Office, together with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, ought to make much more effort to put tracing equipment into the ports of embarkations, where it would be extremely effective.
<P>
I and my colleagues in the Freight Transport Association have had recent discussions with the chamber of commerce in Calais, which showed willingness not only to locate the equipment, but to part-fund it. We are therefore looking to the British Government not to criminalise drivers, and certainly not to criminalise owners who may be hundreds of miles away, in the way that the Bill attempts to do, but rather to address the problem, which is detection at the point of embarkation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> On the very point that you have made about disincentives and the burdens being put on your members, when a clandestine entrant is discovered on a vehicle, the burden is on your members to show that they are not guilty of anything. It is the Secretary of State whom you have to satisfy, and in the meantime there is a possibility that the vehicle may be impounded. Do you regard that as a just arrangement?
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> First, you are right in that the defence offered under clause 20(3) refers to the proposition that it is a defence for the carrier to show first that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``he did not know, and had no reasonable grounds for suspecting, that a clandestine entrant was, or might be, concealed''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and secondly, that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an effective system for preventing the carriage of clandestine entrants was in operation'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and, thirdly,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that on the occasion in question the person or persons responsible for operating that system did so properly.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The problem with that provision is, as my colleague suggested, that once an illegal immigrant is detected, it would appear axiomatic that the driver has failed to observe one of those three principles. It offers, therefore, no reasonable defence.
<P>
We need to spell out in much more detail in the code of practice what it is reasonable to expect a driver in charge of a very large vehicle and trailer to do. We would then heartily endorse the proposition that any driver who, through complicity or indolence, fails to take reasonable steps should be charged with a penalty. Indeed, we should point out to the Committee that it is an offence under the Immigration Act 1971 to conspire to avoid immigration controls&#151;an offence, incidentally, giving rise to a maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment. We know of cases where people are currently imprisoned on that basis. Our view is that a penalty in that respect already exists.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): You talked about the number of your operators but that excludes all those containers and unaccompanied lorries that are circulating the country, does it not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> Yes, indeed. You will probably appreciate, Mr. Henderson, that unaccompanied trailers are just that&#151;they are unaccompanied. Yet clause 18(5)(c) stipulates that if we are talking about a detached trailer,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the owner or hirer of the trailer''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is liable. Now the owner or hirer of the trailer is likely to be hundreds of miles away and will have no precise idea of what the particular container is doing at the time, because it is essentially a financial transaction which simply gives the carrier a means of transporting the trailer. So in our view that is even more unjust than the proposition as it relates to drivers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> Would you say that the majority of clandestines have been found in unaccompanied trailers rather than in accompanied units?
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> There was a very famous case involving 100 people who were detected at Chatham. It was much talked about. I heard the Minister say that it was preposterous that any person could drive a truck with 100 people in it and not know that they were there. In fact, that was exactly the point: they were in an unaccompanied trailer, which would have been delivered to the dock by one driver, taken by a tug driver from the dock to the boat, taken by another tug driver from the boat to the dock on the disembarkation side and would then have been collected by a subsequent driver who would take it on to its destination. Those people were in an unaccompanied trailer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> You talk about a procedure for checking the vehicle. Having worked in the industry, I understand that it is impossible on some occasions to check all over a trailer, but it does happen. Drivers and companies&#151;on account of damage procedures and claims&#151;do check trailers when they are picked up. Many drivers carry their own seals. They refer to them in their shipping notes, which then follow the vehicle to its destination, so the seal number can be checked at the port of entry. That does happen. If a similar procedure were laid down which made it necessary for paper work to follow on to the destination of the vehicle, would that not be proof in defence of a driver who said that he did not know that anyone was on board?
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> We would hope so. The explanatory notes to the Bill make reference to the idea, and state that it would be a defence, if,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for example, there was no evidence that the seals on the load had been tampered with''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Minister were able to confirm that that is indeed the basis on which a defence could be mounted, that would clearly address some of our concerns. As you know, Mr. Henderson, these seals are often commerically available. They are not customs seals as such. They are not issued only by an issuing authority; they are actually purchasable as a normal commercial commodity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> If a driver put the seal on and then entered the number on the paper work which followed the trailer with the ship to its destination, that would be proof that the same seal was still on the vehicle after the driver left it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> We would say so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> On the detention side, if a driver&#151;accompanied or unaccompanied&#151;were found with a unit that contained something illegal, customs would, at the moment, detain the vehicle, search for evidence and use it as proof. Is that correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> Yes, but in that case we would be dealing with a criminal offence, whereas we are talking here about a civil penalty. We regard it as unreasonable to detain any vehicle because the driver does not have immediate access to the sort of civil penalties which, first, we regard as unjust and, secondly, make it impossible to reimburse a driver in the event of being stopped. So we welcome the Bill's provisions on impounding. It appears that if a haulier can show, for example, that he or she represents an established firm in the United Kingdom, the vehicle can be released. That is not to say that subsequent charges will not be levied. We have no problem with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> I just want to add a small point about the reimbursement of drivers. That presents a tricky situation in itself. If a driver is found to have a large amount of folding money about his person, the authorities will probably accuse him of taking money to ship illegal immigrants. So he has a problem anyway.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I will ask Mr. O'Brien to put a question to British Airways, and then I will return to other matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> You might have felt left out from our questioning, Mr. Walker and Mr. Forster, so let me include you in it.
<P>
What is the approximate total of charges incurred by British Airways under the Immigration (Carriers Liability) Act 1987? Can you estimate what has been refunded because the passengers concerned were granted asylum?
<P>
<B>Mr. Walker:</B> If we take 1998 as our example, charges totalling &#163;4.8 million were levied on us by the immigration service. Following our challenges and discussions with the immigration service, the net total was reduced to about &#163;2.5 million. Mr Forster will speak about asylum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forster:</B> Our records indicate that refunds of about &#163;250,000 have been received as a result of passengers being granted refugee status.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Let me continue with that. You say that you wish to bring in extended leave to remain and indefinite leave to remain as additional categories for which you receive a refund. Do you have estimates of the sums involved?
<P>
<B>Mr. Walker:</B> We cannot estimate what that would add to the total because our current dealings with the immigration service do not indicate how significant the matter is.
<P>
The end result of applications for asylum or other forms of leave to remain is that a decision is made that the individual concerned should be allowed to remain in this country. The same consequence should ensue for the carrier in relation to carriers' liability.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> So it is an issue of principle, rather than money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Yes, it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> What is your view on the general operation of carriers' liability? You have given us a figure for 1998. Is there a general trend over the period in which the 1987 Act has been in force? Have the figures been going up or down, or are they steady?
<P>
<B>Mr. Walker:</B> In general, the total is rising for that period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> How great a problem are passengers who destroy their documents in transit?
<P>
<B>Mr. Walker:</B> It is a significant problem. We estimate that 50 per cent. of our charges relate to passengers with destroyed documents.
<P>
The immigration services provide administrative action for that. They have entered into arrangements with us that ameliorate the problem of destroyed documents. We think that it is right that those arrangements are embodied in legislation, rather than dealt with administratively. One of our proposals relates to that.
<P>
We still believe that our customer service staff are expected to have too high a standard of skill. In effect, they are expected to have the same skill level as immigration officers, and that is too onerous a burden.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I have two questions on that point. Have you done anything about challenging the standard of skill? Do you have any means of challenging that standard of skill? What has been your experience with airline liaison officers? Have they been generally helpful?
<P>
<B>Mr. Walker:</B> We found that the immigration service was willing to discuss those issues with us. The systems for approved gate control that have been put in place in about half of the overseas locations in which we operate are a good example of arrangements that both help to deal with the problem and relieve the burden on us in sensible ways. However, more could be done.
<P>
Apart from the general issue of the standard of skill that is required, we would also like to see more help provided by the immigration service in helping us on specific occasions to spot and deal with issues. There is a helpline service but our experience is that that service could be improved in terms of both responsiveness and the type of advice that is given to help our staff.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> And the airline liaison officers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forster:</B> We obviously welcome the airline officers' role but at the end of the day, although they provide advice to our overseas airports, it is the airline that decides whether to accept a passenger, not the airline liaison officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> So you still carry the liability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forster:</B> We do indeed and it is our decision at the end of the day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsha Singh (Bradford, West):</B> My questions are for the Road Haulage Association. The Minister said that the level of illegal entrants coming in by lorries has risen to 8,000 a year and is probably climbing. In your response to questions, you seemed to say that everyone else had some sort of resonsibility for that except the drivers. Is that the position that you are putting forward?
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> Unsurprisingly, that is not the position we take. The position we take is that it is certainly the duty of any responsible haulier to take all steps available to check that the load is intact, including the measures that Mr. Henderson mentioned. Checking seals where appropriate, and making all the normal checks to ensure that curtain sides and ring curtain sides are intact and so on are all part of elementary security procedures. Our submission is that in the vast majority of cases, the procedure is followed.
<P>
We know that a great many of these clandestines board the truck at the point when the trailer is loaded, in other words in the factory. The moment the truck leaves the factory, properly sealed, the illegal immigrants are already in the container or on the trailer. Yes, we do believe that we should be taking and do take proper responsibility for the section of the journey that we are covering, but our subsmission is that the complete absence of any external check and the inability of a driver in the best of circumstances to make a comprehensive check has clearly made this a more attractive means of entering the United Kingdom than would otherwise be the case.
<P>
If there were a known system of checking it would be an immediate deterrent. Indeed it is quite significant that in Zeebrugge where the port authorities appear to take fairly stringent action to check lorries leaving the port we see almost no evidence of clandestine arrivals, yet we see a constant stream through Calais.
<P>
<B>Mr. Singh:</B> You are saying that the primary responsibility does not lie with the owner or driver of the vehicle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> The responsibility with the driver is absolutely enormous. Let us not make light of the fact that the driver is driving a vehicle that is probably worth &#163;100,000 by itself. The load on board the vehicle, if it is the wrong sort of load could be around a &#163;1 million. It could contain computers or electrical equipment or whatever. The driver has this responsibility anyway, notwithstanding the problem we are discussing this afternoon. The driver takes that responsibility seriously. This is a highly skilled and highly responsible job and not one that drivers or their employers take lightly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Singh:</B> I do not think that anyone suggests that drivers on the whole are not responsible people. Are you advocating that, faced with these figures, the Government should do nothing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> No, on the contrary. We are suggesting that it is about time that the Government did something. We are saying that the problem is that they are doing nothing now to check vehicles when they disembark and nothing to encourage the continental authorities to check at the point of embarkation, which would be the sensible thing to do. That is much more effective than simply putting hauliers individually under such duress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Singh:</B> With respect, that is the point I opened with. You seem to be putting the responsibility on everyone else, except the hauliers, drivers or your members.
<P>
<H5>5.45.pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> It depends on whether we want to play semantics or solve the problem. If you want to solve the problem, you make sure that there are proper checks in place. For example there is equipment in place which can check for the presence of human beings either on the basis of CO2 concentrations or heat or movement. All those devices are fairly standard in security terms. Their existence in the port of Dover would almost certainly remove the clandestine traffic immediately, whether or not the driver were indolent or complicit.
<P>
In our view that sort of equipment is what is needed. It does not even have to be a cost to the public purse as there is no evidence that it could not be financed by the industry itself together with the co-operation of both Governments. That would solve the problem. As it is, Mr. Singh, if you are accusing us of passing the buck and we in turn are accusing the Government of passing the buck that is perhaps a reflection on the fact that at the moment no one is taking any responsibility.
<P>
When one of our drivers reported the suspected presence of clandestine arrivals in the back of his vehicle, he asked the police to meet him. The Thames Valley police did so and when the vehicle was opened and 13 people emerged they gave them a &#163;5 note each and the address of the Immigration Advisory Service in London. When the BBC checked that story independently the police said, ``Of course that is what we do. We cannot possibly take responsibility for these people ourselves. It is far too expensive.'' It is about time the buck was no longer passed and we had a proper system of inspection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Singh:</B> I agree with measures to improve the detection of people aboard. I am surprised that those things have not been done. I am surprised that you are suggesting them now when the measures in the Bill are proposed. I am surprised that you said once again that nobody seems to be taking responsibility. In fact, the Government are taking responsibility now and saying that it lies fairly and squarely with the drivers and owners of those vehicles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> But that is called passing the buck and it is not acceptable. There is of course a responsibility which drivers take and as my colleague has suggested, they are extremely responsible people, often in charge of extremely expensive loads. They do not take their duties lightly. However, there is a responsibility for Government here too. There is the responsibility for a proper system of supervising these vehicles so that this problem can be addressed instantly and at source.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> Just for the record, I am a member of the Transport and General Workers Union. The airlines and the road hauliers have different problems. Airlines know that they are carrying people. The question is whether they have destroyed papers or are not who they say they are. The road hauliers do not know that they are carrying people. Virtually all the British Airways people, or airline people, if I can put that more generally, get stopped by the immigration service. Some are detected later on but most are caught before they can get into the country. Do we know roughly how many lorry passengers are caught at the port of entry and how many are caught elsewhere?
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> Such figures as we have show that over 90 per cent. of illegal immigrants detected in vehicles are detained as a result of voluntary actions by the driver or operator. Only 3 per cent. were detected by foreign authorities and a further 3 per cent. by the UK authorities. As I said, the vast majority simply indicate that they arrived here by lorry when they present themselves to the various UK authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> With the exception of those cases where there was thought to be complicit criminal activity, am I right in believing that it is unlikely that the Home Office would come back to a driver and say, ``Someone told us that they came on this lorry a week ago and they think the registration number is such and such and will you please pay &#163;2,000 now?'' Is it nearly always the case that a driver or a haulier has said to the authorities, ``We have someone in the United Kingdom. They should not be here and we are reporting them.''

<P>

<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> The question here is the driver wanting to offload the problem as quickly as possible. As soon as he discovers that he has illegal immigrants on board he knows that he has a problem. It is a problem that he wants to divest himself of as soon as possible. In his normal practice as a good citizen he will deliver those illegals to the nearest authority, be it the police, immigration bodies or whatever. He wants rid of the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> That may be interesting, but I asked whether our witnesses believe that when someone who is not known to the driver is at large in the country, then goes to the authorities and is asked how he got into the country, and says that he was on Steve Norris's lorry but he cannot prove that he was, the Home Office merely accepts the word of someone who says that he was on a particular lorry at a particular time, or does he have to prove that he was on that lorry?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> We have no experience of that sort of incident.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> On the presumption, then, that it is less likely to happen, the only time that people are likely to say, ``We believe that you should pay this &#163;2,000'' is when they stop a lorry at the point of entry and find someone, or when a lorry driver or haulier says, ``We want to declare that we have someone here who should not be here.'' Is that so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> Yes. The way the Bill is framed is a little like finding a burglar in your front room, ringing the police, and the police arresting you, not the burglar. The driver is innocent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> If they suggest complicity, that is a criminal offence that can be dealt with through the courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> If the driver is complicit, and current legislation can put him away for seven years, we say, ``Good luck, put him away for seven years.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> So &#163;2,000 can only be a penalty for good behaviour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> On the face of it, that would seem to be it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> May I add that it is important to remember that all the traffic is not United Kingdom traffic? Mr. Singh made a point about the responsibility of drivers. We should remember that more than half the vehicles arriving in the UK are not UK vehicles. They come from all over Europe&#151;and many come from outside the European Union&#151;and are equally likely to be carrying this kind of traffic. Our associations already offer codes of guidance to our members on how they should check their vehicles. We make it clear that we demand high professional standards, but we cannot be responsible, for example, for more than half the traffic through Dover. It is impracticable to throw the problem into the lap of the responsible haulier in the UK while ignoring the fact that at least half the problem is out with the aegis of either Mr. Dossetter's organisation or mine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> May I just ask one airline question? There was a representation about airside transit visas. How are the Government responding on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Walker:</B> We have had discussions with the Minister about that and we are both happy to take the matter forward. That is where it stands at the moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickthall:</B> Mr. Norris and Mr. Dossetter, you have made a robust and proper defence of your drivers, as we would expect, and a robust defence of owners and hirers, as we would also expect. What worries me is that, after that, it becomes incoherent. I knew that somehow we would end up blaming the French, and we did. It was said that the port of Calais has to do something itself, and that the British Government must be involved. There are many other ports: how many would have to be involved in that way?
<P>
You, Mr. Norris, mentioned Zeebrugge. Shortly afterwards, you began saying that the bulk of clandestines get into the trailers at the factories, which are further back in the chain. Sooner or later we shall be looking at where these people are born. Later, you came back to Dover, and I understood you to say that detection methods could be put in place in Dover which would do the job. So, if they were infallible, the other places would become irrelevant. How many other ports of reception would we have to look at?
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> Okay. Let me make one thing clear. We are not here just to defend drivers. The two associations have made it absolutely clear from the outset that if drivers are involved in this traffic, they deserve not only to be fined, but to be prosecuted under immigration law, and we would have the overwhelming support of our membership in saying that.
<P>
Also, just to be clear, we are not simply passing the buck to the French. If the traffic were from the United Kingdom to the Continent, the responsibility would be ours. Incidentally, that is not confined in any event to the French authorities. It applies equally to the French and Dutch authorities, but those are the short-sea countries, where the vast majority of the traffic coming to the United Kingdom emanates from.
<P>
We are suggesting that the British Government ought to build on the co-operation that we have had from the Calais port authority, which now recognises that by allowing the door to be opened to the United Kingdom, it has created a problem for itself. Calais is now a place where these people congregate before they find a suitable vehicle to jump aboard. The French authorities might be changing. Originally, in Calais, they were rather cynical about waving these people through and leaving them to be a problem for the British Government. Now they recognise that if they co-operate, they might be able to do something about the problem.
<P>
The only point about doing something at the port of embarkation is that the speed at which lorries are forced to disperse at the point of disembarkation makes checking every unit impractical. That is as true for traffic coming from the United Kingdom to the French side as it is for that coming from the European side to us.
<P>
The point about the different ports is that, even within France, for example, we know that there are differences between the way that Cherbourg is policed, where we see very little evidence of clandestines&#151;and Zeebrugge, outside France, where there is almost no evidence of clandestines&#151;and Calais, where security is acknowledged to be extremely weak in the lorry area, and it is almost impossible to police properly. That is the only point that we are making, and I do not think, with the greatest respect, that it is incoherent. If we did not make it clear the first time, I hope that this is helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickthall:</B> Are we talking about just the one port?
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> No, it is not going to be just one port. However, it is fair to say that the majority of the problem does pass through one port, as far as we can tell.
<P>
Incidentally, I said that there is evidence of the problem arising further back. Yes, indeed, that is the case. We know of lorry parks in Belgium that are especially vulnerable. Some of my members have also noticed that clandestines were arriving on every vehicle that came from a particular factory in Germany. It was obvious that what was happening was that the vehicle backed into the delivery bay, the doors were opened behind the usual heavy plastic curtain and people were put on the vehicle there. The vehicle was subsequently sealed and the seals were not interfered with all the way through to the United Kingdom, but the traffic was on there.
<P>
This was not, as I am sure Mr. Singh will appreciate, something that the driver could do anything about. Nothing at all had gone wrong with the vehicle. The clandestines had been inserted when the truck was loaded, and they emerged when the driver was probably long gone and the trailer had been left in a warehouse. The warehouseman quite unsuspectingly opened the trailer to find people jumping out. That has actually happened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickthall:</B> In the case of the factory in Germany, what did you do?
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> The member concerned went back to his customer and said that he had evidence that the traffic was happening, because it could not be a coincidence that on each of the last three occasions that he had opened a container from that customer, clandestines had been aboard. He insisted that the factory itself took steps to check the way in which its vehicles were loaded. In doing so, he acted completely responsibly, although, naturally, not every haulier has the opportunity to trace traffic in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickthall:</B> Indeed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have three other Members wishing to ask questions. Are any of them to British Airways, rather than to the road hauliers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): I have one short question to British Airways. In respect of passengers, whether it applies to shipping or airlines, Customs shares its information and intelligence. Do you get the same co-operation with the immigration services at airports as you do with the Customs services?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forster:</B> Can you clarify that question, please?
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> I know for a fact that in the shipping industry, shipping companies and Customs and Excise share certain intelligence information on travelling passengers. You obviously have the same kind of co-operation with Customs at airports. Do you have the same co-operation that you have with Customs, with the immigration service&#151;or is it different?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forster:</B> The immigration service provides us with intelligence from time to time, via the International Air Transport Association. The immigration service will notify IATA of trends in passenger movement, and IATA will notify airlines accordingly. That is the principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson:</B> Could there be better co-operation with Customs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forster:</B> We have an arrangement with Customs whereby they have access to passenger data. We have in place measures to protect us from contravening the data protection legislation. We do not have similar arrangements with the immigration service, although we have discussed the matter with them on several occasions.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Dr. Ladyman, I believe that you had a question for British Airways?
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> No, my question has been asked.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I am aware, because individuals have approached me in the past, of black British passport holders who have taken enormous offence when their passport has been subject to special scrutiny, photocopied and so on. That has caused problems in the past because people feel that although they have a British passport, they are being singled out because of the colour of their skin. Do you think that the Bill will result in an increase in that type of incident?
<P>
<B>Mr. Walker:</B> We think that the whole question of discrimination is important. In our view it needs to be dealt with explicitly in the Bill. That is why it is right that in clause 9, which relates to the ability to require information to be provided, it should be explicit that nothing can be required of carriers that would involve, or could raise any issue of, racial discrimination. What is proposed in clause 26(3)(a) in relation to transit visas is the type of provision that should also be included in clause 9. Our position is that we do not wish to do anything that could discriminate or could lead to perceptions of discrimination. We think that the more clearly that matter is dealt with in the Bill, the greater will be the assurance that carriers cannot be subject to improper requirements or to misunderstanding and accusation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> Are you saying that if the carrier is protected, the passengers are protected, and therefore people who are identified with ethnic minority or black groups are protected&#151;that it is indirect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Walker:</B> We believe that as a matter of policy it is inappropriate for any of the carriers' liability issues to be dealt with in a way that could, in fact or in perception, discriminate between people on the basis of race, colour or religion. We are satisfied, because this is a matter about which we are greatly concerned, that our policies and our actions at present do not raise any such issues, but we think the matter is of such importance that it should be dealt with explicitly in the Bill.
<P>
We think that the fact that a provision of this nature is proposed in clause 26 creates a strong argument that a similar provision should be included in clause 9, so that explicitly in the legislation it is clear to everyone that no requirement will be placed on us that could lead to actual or perceived discrimination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Bottomley; I will come back to you if there is time later. Mr. Hall and Mr. Prosser have indicated that they wanted to ask questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall:</B> I want to address my comments to the representatives of the Road Haulage Association and the Freight Transport Association. What ever is said now, and has been said in the submissions, we must move forward and make the measure work. May I ask you gentlemen if you see the code of practice proposed in clause 9 as offering an opportunity to address most of the concerns of your members?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> It would be extremely helpful, and we would very much like to be involved in the construction of the code of practice. Indeed, the Minister indicated that that would be the case. It is appropriate to mention now that we hope that if the Bill goes ahead and the fines come about, there will be a delay in enforcement until the code of practice is up and running and in shape. Clearly, the code of practice will bring together a collection of best practice activities, which I come back to. As an industry, that is what we are, in any event, endeavouring to achieve anyway, to protect drivers, vehicles and the security of the loads that our members carry. We have an identity of interest in producing all-round best practice. There is no doubt about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall:</B> I do not know whether it would be part of a code of practice, but in terms of best practice, could you tell me what the industry has done with regard to research into technology? Your submission refers, for example, to carbon dioxide samplers. What can you tell me about that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> We have seen so far that one of the most effective forms of technology in solving the problem can be found in the ports of Zeebrugge and Cherbourg&#151;very nasty dogs, but very effective nasty dogs, detecting the presence of illegal immigrants and bringing a halt to the problem. Further to that, there are the usual technological gizmos that we have come to see lately&#151;CO2 detection, heartbeat detection and other equipment of that sort. We would like to see the installation of that sort of equipment certainly at the port of Calais, but elsewhere, in Cherbourg and Zeebrugge. In that way the problem can be contained on the other side of the channel rather than in the UK.
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> A device is already located at the French side of the channel tunnel which is used to detect explosives and other elements of loads. It is not suitable for the detection of individuals. We have been concerned not just that the technology should exist, but that it is practicable. The CO2 technology works on the basis that within a short time of an individual being confined in the space of a container, the CO2 component of atmosphere changes significantly enough for it to be identifiable. What is less clear is how each vehicle could be checked for the appropriate level of CO2 without some kind of manual insertion of a probe.
<P>
The second type of technology available relies on heat seeking. As you probably know, there is a lot of equipment in that area. It started off in military applications and has been used by the fire service. The question there is whether or not it can be installed in a form that will allow a lorry to stop or pass through it very slowly and still get a reliable read-out.
<P>
The third type of technology relies on detecting movement even, as Mr. Dossetter says, very slight movement. There, the technology is less likely to be practicable because the vehicle itself would have to have the driver emerge, the fuel would have to stabilise in the tanks, and the wind and other external conditions would have to be absolutely perfect for there to be no outside movement affecting the vehicle, particularly if it has curtain sides which are not solid. Our understanding is, as I say, that that is not particularly practicable.
<P>
However, we are both receiving a number of invitations from commercial enterprises to look at and validate equipment which we believe, from the source of those invitations, ought to be available now. They are looking for some evidence that there is a market for such pieces of equipment to be installed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dossetter:</B> The one problem with the techno-fix is difficulty in the ports of embarkation or immigration. If the checking processes take too long, there would be a strong possibility of congestion within the ports, which brings a lot of problems. Dover is probably concerned about a whole lot of vehicles holding up the port for an inordinate time. That would be a problem, as I say, but I suppose that it could be overcome.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I should like to give the hon. Member for Dover the opportunity to ask the last question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prosser:</B> One of the problems is that that is totally impracticable and will not happen.
<P>
I should like to deal with accompanied rather than unaccompanied vehicles because I have some sympathy with them. You told us that a fair proportion of the ingress comes at the actual point of loading and that the bulk of the problem in transit happens in Calais. Does not the driver's responsibility for seeing the seals closed and his responsibility for what is inside the cargo at the point of loading effectively require a similar responsibility to ensure that there are no illegals present in the lorry? Are you not undermining your basic security in talking about a &#163;1 million load&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> Very quickly, the answer is that often the driver is told, ``There is the container; go and take it.'' In those circumstances, he has no ability to check what was done to load that container.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prosser:</B> That shows a basic lack of security whether it be illegal immigrants or &#163;1 million worth of computers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Norris:</B> Not within the purview of the driver. That is our point.
