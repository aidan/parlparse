<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 68, in page 107, line 43, leave out from `paragraph' to end of line 45.—[Mr. Grieve.]
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping):</B> I was about to explain in detail the purpose of paragraph 2(1)(b). Before I do so, I reiterate that the regulations that are to be made by the Secretary of State after consulting the commission are very narrow. They relate solely to the additional information about the donor that must be included in a donation report. During this morning's sitting, I was concerned that the Committee was being given the impression that there were hidden ulterior motives which gave the Secretary of State wide-ranging powers. If that were so, members of the Committee would be right to be concerned. However, it is not the case, as I shall spell out.
<P>
The purpose of the provision is that where a recordable donation is made by an individual, paragraph 2(2)(a) of schedule 5 requires that the donation must include the address of the person as shown on the electoral register. However, under regulation 49(2) of the Representation of the People Regulations 1986, the addresses of certain service voters, voluntary mental patients and overseas electors are not included in the register.
<P>
The purpose of the regulation that makes the power that we are discussing is to enable the provisions to be made in respect of the addresses of such donors. It would be unwise to put those provisions in the Bill, given that they are, to some extent, dependent on other provisions set out in subordinate legislation. If the Secretary of State wants to change the situation, this enabling power allows him or her to do so. On that small, narrow and precise point, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): The Minister's explanation is cogent, and I understand what is intended. I would normally say that it would have been desirable, as he himself acknowledged, to identify the precise legislation to which reference was made, because that would confine any subsequent interference by the Secretary of State to those precise matters. I accept that it may be impossible because of the number of pieces of subordinate legislation. Nevertheless, will the Minister consult his officials to find out whether it would be difficult to encapsulate the precise areas of legislation that the measure is designed to address? Sometimes that turns out to be easier than people realise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> There has already been one area of improvement in the Bill today as a result of inquiries from the Opposition. If we can make it better, we will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 69, in page 108, line 48, leave out `accepted' and insert `received'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 65, in page 109, line 7, leave out `received' and insert `accepted'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Again, these are probing amendments in the interests of clarification.
<P>
The submission of the circumstances in which the donation was made and the submission of accounts places an onerous burden on those who are making the returns—although it is not so crushing that it should not be imposed. Under paragraph 4 of the schedule, in the case of a quarterly report the relevant date for the donation is the date on which the donation was accepted by the party or the accounting unit. I have no quarrel with that. However, paragraph 4(3) makes it clear that, in respect of weekly reports made during elections, the relevant date will be not the date on which a donation was accepted but the date on which it was received.
<P>
I can see the underlying purpose of that provision. By waiting until the date on which the donation is accepted, the election will have long been finished. Nevertheless, I question the reasonableness and usefulness of a weekly report during a general election campaign, because it will present a potentially misleading picture. The return will state that the party has received X amount of money, but it will not have been possible to scrutinise that. A correction might be included in the subsequent quarterly report, showing which sums have been rejected, but in the meantime the party will believe that it is receiving certain amounts of money, even though it has been unable to put them to use. That is the crucial issue. The party may have money in the kitty, but it will be unable to use it until it is satisfied that it can accept it.
<P>
I should be grateful for the Minister's views on this matter. What is wrong with saying that even the weekly reports should declare only sums that were accepted, and which the party can therefore use for general election campaigning purposes? What is the point in a party providing a weekly report of sums received if it is prohibited from using that money until it has decided whether it can accept it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): In responding, will the Minister say whether the Government intended to distinguish between sums ``accepted'' and ``received''? If they intended to set a different standard for the weekly election report, they should consider two possibilities that will be beyond the receiving party's control.
<P>
Reference was made during a previous sitting to a bedsit Conservative—someone who might be up to no good inside one's own party, assuming that the party in question is not the Conservative party.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): I believe that that was a reference to me. For the record, I should point out that the Labour party benefited greatly from my actions. As a result, it was forced to change its rules and clean up its act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I have absolutely no knowledge of what happened, and I certainly did not intend to impugn anyone's reputation.
<P>
It has been claimed that, in a number of cases, media provocateurs, as one might describe them, have persuaded third parties—I am not using that term with reference to the Bill—to make allegations about political parties or individuals in political parties, or to take action. Of course, the media sometimes approach third parties in respect of celebrities and other such people, and if they are lucky, they can get a very good story.
<P>
Let us suppose that a mischief-making media organ were to say to a third party such as a perfectly respectable American business man, ``Here is a cheque for £10,000. We would like you to pay it into the Conservative party's election campaign account,'' or the Labour party's election campaign account. That would be entirely beyond the control of the relevant party or its spokesman. The cheque will have been received and nothing that the treasurer does subsequently could take away the slur of having received the donation. If my third-party provocation was real, one could be certain that the trap would close six hours later in the evening editions in the middle of an election campaign.
<P>
I could take the argument further, but it is straightforward. I support the view that ``accepted'' should be in the Bill instead of ``received''. ``Accepted'' could create a damaging impression that is entirely beyond the control of the relevant political party and its officers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Davidson </B>(Glasgow, Pollok): I seek clarification from my hon. Friend the Minister on the words ``received'' and ``accepted''. There seems to be an assumption that if something is received, it is subsequently accepted, but it is possible, in an effort to evade scrutiny, for that to happen the other way round. If I, as agent provocateur, approached the Conservative party's treasurer, or any other party's treasurer, and suggested that a substantial donation was on the way, that would allow the party to incur expenditure knowing that it would be covered at a later stage, even though the money had not yet been received. The money would have been accepted and operations would have taken place on the basis that it was coming but before it had been received. That would be a way of avoiding the intention of the seven-day reporting rule for general election periods. It would be possible for political parties to incur an enormous amount of expenditure without having the cash in the kitty to meet it, but knowing that the money had been promised. If the money had not been received, no declaration would have to be made until later, when the benefits would have been gained and any opprobrium avoided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and am trying to follow his argument. The amount of expenditure allowed during a general election campaign is regulated, so the amount that it receives during that campaign is irrelevant. It could receive £100 million, but it could not spend it. It is limited in its spending to its general election level.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> I am assuming that the parties that we are discussing are as large and prosperous as the Conservative party, but smaller parties might not be in such a happy position and might have put up spoiler candidates or paper candidates who would be able to spend sums that they did not declare, provided their credit was upheld by those making the offer. They would not have received those chunks of money and the purpose of weekly submissions of election expenditure would be circumvented. My hon. Friend the Minister should provide some clarity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The purpose of the amendment has been set out well and I have no argument with the way in which it has been presented. There is a difference between quarterly and weekly reports. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said, the notion of a seven-day period in election time is to enable the action to keep up with the timetable of the election. It would not be appropriate to have a reporting period of 30 days during an election period. The public would not know and the force of the provisions—the hon. Member for Beaconsfield referred to their usefulness—stems from the fact that disclosure is involved. The restraint is that matters can be put up in lights for electors to see. That is why the seven-day period is important.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) asked about the difference between receiving and accepting. Earlier today, we discussed the precise meaning of ``receiving''. It might involve posting an item through the front door of central office or new technology could be used to show that it had been received. Acceptance marks the point at which a party has established that a donation is legitimate. However, if that cannot be done within 30 days the money has to be returned.
<P>
Parties, businesses and other organisations spend money that they do not have; that is how they are run—they plan their expenditure and income. A donation can be received and spent before it is accepted and before the seven-day period has elapsed. The requirement that donations that are received during a campaign period be reported is an important restraint. Such information will have to be made public to electors.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) asked us to consider a scam or other such mischief making. He gave the example of a newspaper that set up an American business man who made a donation to a political party. He said that the donation was publicised and, in a circular manner, news of the donation appeared in the newspaper. That is certainly possible. However, I remind the hon. Gentleman that other parts of the Bill make such deceptions a criminal offence. The business man would be liable—he is a third party and he is involved in the deception. I also suspect—I shall check on this and write to him—that the newspaper's editor and proprietor would be liable. That mechanism would stop such a scam.
<P>
The situation is complicated but the balance is right. I believe that Committee members agree that it is important to have a different regime—quarterly rather than weekly—during general elections. Small parties may, in effect, run their campaign on promises, which may not materialise. The restraint to use in those cases is the fact that such parties would face civil law prosecution—they would have debts that they would have to pay. That mechanism would stop small parties from carrying out such unprincipled spending.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> I seek clarification from my hon. Friend the Minister. He said that some small parties will be able to spend money that they do not have. Presumably, that provision will also apply to large parties. Leaving aside the question of deception for a moment, I am not clear about the pre-receiving stage. Promises would be made and expenditure incurred on the grounds that the cheque was in the post. However, until such time as the post arrives, no declaration would need to be made by the party involved, which means that no one will know from whom that party was drawing the money. That money will arrive but it may not do so during the election campaign. Does the Minister accept that that seems to drive a coach and horses through the principle, which I accept, that general election expenditure should be open and above board?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> There are two ideas here. The first is that an important measure in the Bill is the introduction of a cap on expenditure limits. Parties must not spend more than the expenditure cap.
<P>
The second idea, put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Pollok, is that it would be possible for any party to spend up to the level of the cap on the basis of promises made, of cheques in the post and cheques that have not yet been put in the post. That might be a possibility. I shall look into the matter and get back to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I understand the position that the Minister has outlined. However, I hope that he will forgive me for saying that he has not clarified the matter quite as fully as he has in some earlier cases.
<P>
I understand that there must be a weekly report. The idea behind it is that there should be openness about funds received during the course of an election campaign. However, if funds received could not be used until their origins had been traced, they would be of no use to the party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Let me clarify that point by going through the sequence. A cheque will be received; the party treasurer will believe that he has money to spend; the party will be able to spend that money. There will be no problem about the party spending the money. However, if it were an illegitimate donation, it would have to be repaid within 30 days of the date on which it had been accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister has clarified that point.
<P>
May I also clarify that there were provisions in the Bill for what should happen to money that had been received, before it had reached a state of acceptance? I understood that such money was to be put to one side and not used. Am I to understand that, during an election campaign, that would not apply?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I believe that there is a clear difference between receiving money and accepting that money. ``Accepted'', in this context, is a technical term describing the process that the party has gone through to establish whether the donation is legitimate and permissible, or has to be returned.
<P>
I am fairly confident on this question, but I shall look at the matter further. In the interim, I believe that parties will be permitted to spend money that they believe they have received legitimately, even if subsequently, at the point of acceptance, it turns out not to be legitimate and they have to return it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. That is now much clearer.
<P>
When we were examining clause 49—from which I remember these details—it had not crossed my mind that the party could use the money while going through the paraphernalia that the clause requires to verify its provenance. However, the Minister may be right. If he is, I wonder whether that is the correct approach to adopt. In reality, where one is dealing with small sums it might not matter too much.
<P>
However, in the case of a large sum it would be unwise of a party to start spending money that it might subsequently have to return to the donor—and then have to declare had been wrongly received.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> That is precisely the point—under the Bill, parties will have onerous responsibilities. It is easier to control the parties than the donors, as the hon. Member for Hazel Grove said, because of the scams that could come into play.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for explaining that aspect of the Bill so clearly that I now understand it. I had not intended to press the amendment in any case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> A thought has been provoked in me. Parties have to make their own arrangements, and—as I pointed out on Second Reading and during the Committee's proceedings—they should be getting on with their preparations now. A wise treasurer or set of party officials will have different accounts—suspension accounts, for example—in which to place donations that they believe might be risky. That reinforces my earlier point—ultimately, it is a matter for the parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I thank the Minister, and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this Schedule be the Fifth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): During our discussion of clause 48(1)(b), Opposition Members raised a legitimate point about the incorporation of companies inside the European Union. After discussing the matter with my hon. Friend the Minister, I instigated some inquiries as to how the problem might best be resolved. I have yet to find an example of a European country that explicitly includes or excludes the matter in its legislation. Given current events in Germany, I made some inquiries as to whether Mr. Mitterand's alleged donation would have been proper under German legislation.
<P>
Following this morning's debate about electronic transfers of money, I suggest to members of the Committee that before we consider the Bill on Report, we must take care to satisfy ourselves in respect of the fears about privacy, security and cryptography in financial transactions that were identified, as long ago as 1994, in the Organisation for Economic Co-„operation and Development. Such matters are being dealt with by the House in respect of electronic commerce, and arose today during Department of Trade and Industry, questions in the course of an exchange about the interface between the roles of the DTI and the Home Office. The Home Office should carefully consider its intention, in the context of future legislation, to ensure that the principles that are embodied in this very good schedule can be upheld and adhered to in the spirit of our debates. I ask my hon. Friend to give the Committee that assurance.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) for raising those points. Earlier in the Committee, I promised that I would write to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield and send him legal advice on the position of European companies. The Committee was dissatisfied about that matter, and I challenged it to come forward with suggestions. My hon. Friend clearly rose to that. If he can help to find a way forward, I shall be grateful.
<P>
My hon. Friend's second point was on the electronic transfer of money. I confess that I began to wax lyrical on that, and talked about a new industrial revolution, and the ways in which it might change our lives, which we cannot yet perceive. That relates to my earlier point, which the hon. Member for Beaconsfield acknowledged, that the law has difficulty keeping up with the rapid change in technology. We shall look again at schedule 5, and the whole Bill, to try to ensure that the Bill is pitched so that it reflects the new electronic age.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 5 agreed to.
<P>
Clauses 57 to 59 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 60</center></H4>
<H4><center>Weekly donation reports in connection with elections other than general elections</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Walter </B>(North Dorset): I beg to move amendment No. 64, in page 38, line 29, leave out `after consulting' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`on the recommendation of'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> with this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 66, in page 39, line 2, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) The Secretary of State shall not make any order under subsection (1) above unless a draft of the order has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, both Houses of Parliament'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> In this debate, we shall revisit a topic that we discussed this morning. We shall debate it with more force, however, unless we are comforted by the Minister's response.
<P>
Amendment No. 64 is fundamental. It hinges on the philosophical discussion of part I, which I am sure will take place on the Floor of the House, on what kind of body the Electoral Commission should be. The wording in clause 60(1) is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State may, after consulting the Commission''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We feel that if the commission is to have force, the Secretary of State should not merely consult the commission but should be required to act on its recommendations. If commissioners are to be wise men, good men and true, who will look dispassionately at our electoral system—and in whom we can have confidence—the Secretary of State should not have the power simply to override them. If that were the case, amendment No. 66 would relate to the Secretary of State's powers. The amendment stipulates that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State shall not make any order under subsection (1) above unless a draft of the order has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of both Houses of Parliament.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are considering matters that might constitute significant alterations to the implementation of our electoral law as it relates to this place, the European Parliament, the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. One could argue, although I do not want to do so in relation to the amendment, that such orders should be laid before the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. However, I hesitate to suggest that any orders that the Secretary of State comes up with should be laid before the European Parliament because, in this context, we are dealing with domestic electoral matters.
<P>
The Bill is designed to establish an electoral system in which we—Members in this place, the Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly and the electorate—have confidence. The Electoral Commission will be an important body, and it should be powerful, independent and above the political fray. Orders that the Secretary of State makes about our electoral procedures should have the commission's recommendations. They should be given when Parliament has approved the orders that were laid before it. However, I hesitate to agree to a clause that will give the Secretary of State the power to take action without having sought the approval of the Electoral Commission or of both Houses of Parliament.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I want to discuss important issues that arise in particular in relation to amendment No. 64, although I do not want to detain the Committee for long.
<P>
We shall probably consider the role of the commission on the Floor of the House. Until we have done so, it is difficult to discuss the amendments and to know exactly what their consequences would be. We should have an independent commission. It will clearly be under a degree of political control through the Speaker's Committee, but it should produce recommendations. The commission's make-up, which we have not yet discussed, will affect whether it is widely accepted as being impartial. I do not understand why the Secretary of State should make changes in reporting requirements if the commission has not recommended him to do so. It would, however, be open to the Secretary of State not to follow the recommendation. Why does the Minister feel that the Secretary of State's discretion needs to be as wide as the Bill proposes?
<P>
In this context, we come to that wonderful old topic, the Henry VIII clauses, which involve the extent to which Parliament should have powers of scrutiny. The two matters may go together in the sense that the greater the discretion that the Secretary of State has, the more desirable it is for Parliament to have a say. I do not wish to repeat arguments that we have heard, but I hope that the Minister will give this important issue the consideration that it deserves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Let me deal quickly with amendment No. 66, which would apply the affirmative resolution procedure to an order under the clause—a principle with which I agree. The hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) may have yet to examine clause 142(4), which, I should point out, makes such provision. We have therefore anticipated and, I hope, dealt with the hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 64 requires a little more attention, and I shall begin by answering the points that were made about the Electoral Commission. As was noted, the Committee has yet to consider the commission. However, it is in the interests of all parties to establish an independent and non-partisan commission that commands respect and authority, and I do not believe that it will be difficult to do so. Clearly, the amendment would require any order under the clause to be made on the recommendation of, rather than merely after consultation with, the Electoral Commission. In other words, no order would be made without the commission's recommendation.
<P>
The intention underlying the clause is to establish Parliament's clear expectation that special provisions for a frequent donation report should apply to the range of elections specified in the clause, as well as the general election. Only the general election is called in the traditional way through the firing of a starting pistol; the other elections, as hon. Gentlemen will note, are fixed-term elections. Although we will need to consult the commission and take its advice, the parliamentary expectation is that an order will be made, so it will not be necessary to ask for the commission's response. We and the Secretary of State know that that will happen, so it is necessary only to consult the commission. What is important is Parliament, not the commission.
<P>
I hope that I have explained the provision, which is not designed to put down the commission in any way. As I have said, we know precisely when elections other than the general election will be called, so the need is for consultation rather than recommendation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I thank the Minister for his explanation, and I apologise to him and the Committee for tabling an amendment to a matter that is dealt with elsewhere in the Bill. I should have read the Bill more diligently, but we did not anticipate that it would reach Committee quite so quickly, given the agreement to consider it in part on the Floor of the House. Having heard what the Minister said about amendment No. 64, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> I seek clarification from the Minister on one point. Clause 60(2)(b), which lists relevant elections, makes no provision for the creation of any assembly in north-east or south-west England, or an expansion of the powers of the Greater London Authority. In future, other parts of the United Kingdom may achieve a degree of devolution that gives them powers that are equivalent to those of the National Assembly for Wales, or even those of the Scottish Parliament. Surely the Minister intends that such bodies should be covered by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> My hon. Friend makes a strong case for regional government, to which I know that he is committed. I agree with him, and I hope that in the fullness of time we will have some democratic accountability in respect of bodies such as regional development agencies. However, I do not want to anticipate future Bills. Legislation would be required to establish bodies of the kind that my hon. Friend advocates, and the passage of follow-on enabling legislation would be the appropriate point at which to address his concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> I understand the Minister's response in terms of bodies that are not yet established. However, why is the new London authority not covered by the Bill? That could result in all sorts of jiggery-pokery in the London elections. Given that London is the media capital of the United Kingdom, why should businessmen give donations to strange parties in Yorkshire or elsewhere if they can do it in London with less travelling? London should be included in the Bill, and I hope that I have given the Minister enough time to address that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Perish the thought that there could be any jiggery-pokery involved in the election of a mayor from a party on either side of the Room. My impression is that the election procedure is going smoothly, and that there have been no difficulties whatsoever. Jiggery-pokery, indeed!
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> If the Minister turns around quickly, he will see a flying pig above the river.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Candidates will do anything to be elected, flying pigs included.
<P>
We should soon be in a position to say something about election expenses in respect of the mayoral elections, and I hope that my hon. Friend is happy to wait for that. The London Assembly is not included, simply because Neill did not recommend it. I confess to my hon. Friend that I had missed that point. It is a matter of some concern. Although we cannot table an amendment to change the situation at this stage, I intend to refresh my memory about the whole issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Can the Minister take that point a little further? Various provisions for the London mayoral elections are obviously designed to play a part in placing limits on future internal party election campaigns.

<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Will the Minister reflect on the absence of references to the London mayoral contest and the London Assembly in the clause, bearing in mind that there are references to them elsewhere and to the internal party campaigning arrangements that may lead up to the mayoral contests, not just in London, but elsewhere? There is some—I hesitate to say it—inconsistency of treatment between the inclusion and exclusion of London in particular. Perhaps the Minister will refer to that in his response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The clause deals with national and European elections. The London elections are important and I had forgotten, but have now been reminded, that they are deemed to be akin to local government elections, despite the scale of the spending.
<P>
Important points have been made by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove and my hon. Friend the Member for Pollok. I was asked to reflect on the matter and I shall do so.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 60 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 61</center></H4>
<H4><center>Reporting of multiple small donations</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 45, in page 39, leave out lines 25 to 32.
<P>
This is a probing amendment which raises an issue of concern. That concern will increase when we come to schedule 6, which contains a similar provision in relation to the payment of smaller sums to associations of political parties. I am flagging the less important issue, but I thought that we should consider it now as well as later.
<P>
A donor who gives small donations, with an aggregate value exceeding £5,000, must make a declaration at the end of the year and report those donations to the commission. When someone is obliged to make a tax return, that obligation may be firmly implanted in his mind by his accountant. I am concerned that, unlike having to make a tax return, the person who is required to make a declaration of donations will not necessarily have that knowledge unless the issue is widely publicised, yet a failure on his part could attract draconian penalties.
<P>
I appreciate that the issue will vary according to the sorts of donations that are made, but when we discussed the matter at a previous sitting, there was some laughter, perhaps at the expense of my constituency association, about the largesse with which people may sometimes engage. We were interested to discover from a recent libel action that the owner of a large department store took out £120,000 a week in petty cash for his own use. That may be an extreme example, but it is surprising how people with wealth and means sometimes distribute, legitimately, money in cash—for example, putting £500 in a bucket when it circulates at a charity concert—without keeping an audited record of what they have done. There may not be many people who make small donations to a political party with an aggregate value of not less than £5,000, but I shall return to the matter when we come to schedule 6 because a limit of £1,000 could present a problem.
<P>
I want to raise the issue of principle. I accept that we should be concerned to ensure that we do not introduce a loophole behind which people may start to make substantial aggregate donations of well over £5,000 and forget about them. However, we should bear it in mind that those aggregate donations ought—unless they were less than £200—to have been picked up by the donee at the time that they were received.
<P>
Is it reasonable to place such a burden on an individual donor, with the penalties attached to a failure to comply with it? Granted, there is a clause that will protect him if he unknowingly makes a false declaration. However, it will not occur to some people to make a declaration at all. The sort of person likely to be caught by the provisions does not have lunch with the party treasurer and write out a cheque for £10,000 as a result. Rather, they are the sort of people who have quite a lot of money and who are content, when the occasion arises at a fundraising gathering of the association, to pay either by cheque or by cash. They would not necessarily carry out such an audit of their expenditure at the end of the year.
<P>
It is noteworthy that clause 61(3) reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The report must be delivered to the Commission by 31 January in the year following that in which the donations were made.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How will that tie in with individuals' financial years, when they make their tax returns? A regular donor to a party of small sums paid by cheque is likely to work out his aggregate donation when he goes through his accounts to fill in his tax return at the end of the year. What publicity or educational mechanisms does the Minister envisage to alert people to their duty under the provision?
<P>
The Minister may not have answers to all those questions, but we must have a moment's pause for thought on the issue. We are dealing here not with £100,000 donors—often individual donations negotiated with the party that the individual will always remember having made. It will be easy to remind such people of their duty in this respect. We are dealing instead with wealthy people who are in the habit of dipping into their pockets for a whole variety of things, and who could easily exceed that aggregate total by, perhaps, half a dozen donations a year.
<P>
We shall return to the matter when we discuss schedule 6. I accept the need to maintain transparency, and I accept the logic that there may be a duty on donors. However, I am anxious about how this will work in practice and how, if it is implemented, individuals will be reminded of their obligations, so that they do not fall foul of the criminal law.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am anxious about the onerous task to be placed on small donors. In supporting my hon. Friend on clause stand part, I shall seek reassurance that those donors will not be placed in a position in which the full weight of the law comes down on them in a disproportionate and inappropriate manner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I rise not to support the Conservative amendment but to draw a couple of significant points to the Minister's attention. First, if there is any difficulty in getting people to remember that they made the donations, a non-penal way of encouraging them to do so is to grant some sort of tax exemption. That would make it much easier to remember. That is a light-hearted point, but not without merit.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Secondly, will the Minister consider the amendments that I tabled to clause 65, which relate to the definition of market value? We are considering not only cash donations—which, in many ways, are easier to keep track of—but donations in kind. When my amendments to clause 65 are discussed, I shall draw the Minister's attention to one or two examples. I do not know anything at all about the Beaconsfield Conservative association—
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Linton </B>(Battersea): It is very rich.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Evidently, it is very rich, and could probably fit all the Liberal Democrats in the garden shed of one of its members' houses. If it were to hold a summer fete in the grounds of one of those houses—in Beaconsfield, Conservatives have grounds attached to their houses, not patios, which, of course, is what Liberal Democrats have—what would be the value of the use of that house for that purpose? Clearly, when such factors are built in to cumulative totals, it raises many issues.
<P>
I do not have much sympathy with the amendment, although some of the issues that surround it should be examined carefully, if we are to deal fairly and properly with the political process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> I am minded to seek clarification on what exactly a patio is, and on whether Liberal Democrats have them. If they do, they are lucky. In my constituency, if there is concrete in someone's back garden, it is because the occupant has buried his wife—or, of course, her husband.
<P>
Will the Minister clarify a couple of points? First, if amounts of more than £200 are to be declared, why will the aggregate value of multiple small donations be deemed to be reportable at a figure as high as £5,000? If people are seeking to avoid declaring donations of £200, should not the multiple or aggregate donations be valued at £200, in order to be declarable? Otherwise, the figure should at least be closer to £200, as £5,000 seems to be too far away.
<P>
Secondly, it is intended that individual donors who give sums of up to £5,000 to more than one political party will be required to declare them? We have already agreed that political parties can donate money to each other. In the fortunate case of the Co-operative party, where people had given donations to the Co-operative party and the Labour party, and then pressed the Co-operative party to pass those donations on to the Labour party, such donations would only be listed as donations from the party and not from the individual involved. I presume that the Minister has thought of all that, but perhaps he will share the logic with us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for implying that I have thought of all the questions that might arise in the Bill, which runs to ten parts and goodness knows how many schedules. I receive a great deal of advice, and have many questions resolved by the end of each sitting of the Committee. The piles of letters that I have promised to write to hon. Members are rapidly growing.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield raised an important point. I assume that this is a probing amendment. The hon. Gentleman said that he would return to the matter when we discuss schedule 6.
<P>
I remind Committee members that reports can be made in two ways. A donation of more than £5,000 has to be reported by the national party, and a donation of more than £1,000 to a sub-organisation has to be reported to the party. The de minimis figure—the figure at which no report has to be made—has been set at £200. My hon. Friend the Member for Pollok asked about that figure. I remind him that in the Neill report it was set at £50. However, following discussions with parties and in an effort to minimise the work for the parties and for the Electoral Commission, it was raised to £200. There is nothing magical about that figure or the associated judgment, and both could be changed.
<P>
Responsibilities will be placed on donors rather than on parties. Before discussing that in greater detail, I should acknowledge that we have not examined the Electoral Commission's work—we shall rightly do so on the Floor of the House. I want the Electoral Commission to be important, authoritative and partisan. I do not expect that anyone who works for it will crawl around measuring the floors of patios or examining the contents of options. It will have bigger and more important things to do.
<P>
The clause attempts to close the loopholes that were discussed by my hon. Friend the Member for Pollok, who asked about the de minimis figure of £200. People will be able to make donations to party units across the country. There is no way by which the party will be able to regulate and to control that process. The relevant responsibility will be taken from the party and given to the donor. Other hon. Members are better at their sums than I am, but I calculate that it would take 26 donations of £200 to exceed the £5,000 figure. People might travel the country paying in £199.99 every fortnight, but that would be eccentric and unusual behaviour. I want to avoid possible difficulties.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield made a fair point when he asked how people would know about the proposals. People will only know about them if they are publicised; but if they are publicised, people may take advantage of the loophole. In a sense, the hon. Gentleman was right. However, the amendment would take away the deterrent—deleting lines 25 to 32 would delete those provisions relating to a person who ``commits an offence''. The notion of an offence—the fact that someone can be criminally prosecuted—is designed to remove the loophole.
<P>
I acknowledge that hon. Members have expressed anxieties on the matter, and I look forward to returning to the theme when we debate schedule 6.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments, and especially for his acknowledgment of the potential for problems.
<P>
I accept that the problem is likely to be much less serious in relation to donations to the central party organisation than it is in relation to the schedule 6 issue. When we debate that, I shall give the Minister some graphic descriptions of just how easily that provision could cause real chaos. That possibility troubles me, but I shall confine myself to discussion of this clause. However, the two issues must be considered together, because if one were to tinker with schedule 6, one would soon wonder whether one should bring this clause into line with whatever changes one had made to the schedule.
<P>
Having said that—and in the hope that, by the time we reach schedule 6, the Minister may have had further discussions with his officials, so that we may benefit from their input on the comments made today—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> In pursuing the debate, I seek some clarification from the Minister.
<P>
Clause 61 deals with reports to be made by donors of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``small donations to a registered party whose aggregate value is not less than £5,000.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 64, which we have not yet debated, and which specifies schedule 6, deals with the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Control of donations to individuals and members associations.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Elsewhere in the Bill, a £5,000 limit has been placed on donations before they become reportable in relation to the central organisations of parties. There will be a £1,000 limit for individuals and members' associations. We have also discussed accounting units of political parties, which will have a £1,000 donation limit in relation to the reporting of such donations.
<P>
It would appear, from my reading of the Bill and of clause 61, that someone making multiple small donations to an accounting unit need not report them until they reached a level of £5,000, whereas the treasurer of that accounting unit might have knowledge that the aggregate of those donations exceeded £1,000. Will the Minister tell us whether either the treasurer of the accounting unit or the donor might inadvertently have committed an offence if the aggregate of the donations were between £1,000 and £5,000 for that accounting unit?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> I seek further clarification from the Minister on the point that I raised about why the figure of £5,000 had been selected. I did not feel that he responded quite as fully as he might have done.
<P>
There appears to be an enormous discrepancy in the measure, if the Bill's intention is to clarify matters. It will be possible to make 25 donations of £199.99 to different accounting units without their coming to public view. However, a single donation of £201 to an accounting unit would appear. If the intention is to make matters clear and above board, surely the multiple of individual units that I have identified should be about £201. I cannot understand why such a discrepancy between £5,000 and £200 exists. I am also unclear as to the Minister's response to the question of different parties and the circumstances in which parties may transfer funds from one to another.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Clearly, I have not persuaded my hon. Friend the Member for Pollok, so let me try again to deal with the point that he made about limits. It is the duty of the person with responsibility at a local level to declare donations of £1,000, and of the person with responsibility at a national level to declare donations of more than £5,000. Those figures, which reflect the judgment that a large party is different in scale from a small ward or constituency party, are included in the Bill because all political parties want clarity and transparency. As I said, they emerged during discussions, and may or may not be right—I have no firm views on them. The £200 limit was raised from £50 on the recommendation of Neill, so that work will be taken away from parties and the commission.
<P>
My hon. Friend asked why there are different limits. A judgment was reached on the basis of discussions with agents and officials of political parties. As he rightly said, there will always be donations that fall above or below the limit, wherever it is set.
<P>
My hon. Friend also asked about the question of donations between parties, and whether a donor must declare donations of more than £5,000 to different political parties. That will be a matter for the person in question. There is no reason why donations cannot be made to different political parties; people back different horses for a variety of reasons. Each £5,000 donated to each political party will have to be declared. Parties are registered separately, and separate accountancy rules will apply. A donor will be able to contribute more than £5,000 to any political party—the issue is not that, but accounting for donations. Large donations will be accounted for by the party. Donors will report smaller donations where the multiple figure exceeds £5,000.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset asked about smaller units up to £1,000, and the making of de minimis donations to a treasurer of an accounting unit. To reach £1,000, six de minimis donations would have to be made, and the donor would not be obliged to declare them. The hon. Gentleman also asked whether the treasurer would then be obliged to disclose the donations that were higher than £1,000 in any year. The answer, clearly, is yes, because that would transgress the amount.
<P>
I have a feeling that the hon. Gentleman made a second point that I may not have picked up. If so, I shall respond to it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Clause 61 deals with aggregate de minimis donations to parties. Clause 64 and schedule 6 deal with aggregate donations to individuals and members' associations. Nowhere in the Bill can I see anything dealing with aggregate de minimis donations to accounting units, other than in clause 61, which refers to a limit of £5,000, when the accounting unit otherwise would have a £1,000 limit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> My visit to the Lobby must have shaken me, because I am still not entirely clear what the hon. Gentleman's point is. The treasurer of an accounting unit will be obliged to report donations of more than £1,000. If one person makes a number of donations within one year that total more than £1,000, the treasurer will be responsible for reporting that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> That is partial clarification, but there is a second point. The accounting unit has a £1,000 limit for known aggregate de minimis donations. However, if the donor were to make those donations in various forms to that accounting unit and if the treasurer of the accounting unit did not identify them as multiple donations, the donor could make multiple donations up to the £5,000 limit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Clearly, it is possible to put in the Bill obligations on the donor in relation to the treasurer of an individual accounting unit. We could amend the Bill to state that there is a responsibility on the donor to disclose sums of more than £1,000 made in small amounts. We chose not to do that but to stick with the £5,000 limit in the clause. As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Pollok, at the end of the day it is a matter of judgment. I have no strong views on the figures, as long as everyone knows what the rules are. The importance of the rules is to introduce openness and transparency. It is not the sums that are important, but the fact that the donations eventually come to the attention of the public eye.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> I seek clarification from my hon. Friend the Minister. He may be aware that some football fans in my constituency have named their offspring after the entire team that they support. When those youngsters grow to maturity, they will be easily identifiable under subsection (4) simply by the strangeness of their name. However, while Bernie Ecclestone is a fairly distinctive name, many names are not immediately identifiable with one particular individual. If there is no clarification of the donor's address, considerable confusion could arise as to which John Smith, David Brown, lan Davidson or Paddy Tipping was the donor. Presumably, a degree of openness and clarity is intended. However, that will not be achieved unless there is some way of distinguishing between John Smiths and David Browns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. We are seeking to achieve openness and clarity—that is important—but it is necessary to balance that with a degree of confidentiality. I remind my hon. Friend that donations in excess of the prescribed limits have to be reported to the commission, which will keep a record of names, amounts, dates and addresses. However, in order to give people a degree of anonymity, addresses will not be published. That is the right balance. The information that then becomes available in the public domain may be enough to set the hounds running and allow people such as the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) to make inquiries aimed at identifying donors and checking their legitimacy. It is possible that the public register could contain two John Smiths who had donated similar amounts on the same date, but it would not give their addresses. We are trying to strike a balance between putting the information in the public domain—as a constraint on the party and the donor—with giving confidentiality to the person who makes the payment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I am following the Minister's argument. He is right to consider the issue of confidentiality. If I were running a major charity, I would try to get hold of the list of donors as soon as it was published. In my experience, people who support political parties are not trying to cheat the system, but to take an active role in citizenship. Being a member of a political party may play only a small part in that—they will probably also send money to organisations such as the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. They equate contributing to political parties with contributing to civic society. If I were running a major charity—or even a major charity scam—I would want the list of donors so that I could send my literature to them. It is therefore right that the material should be treated with a degree of confidentiality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Gentleman's point is well made. We all have personal experience of fundraising by political parties. I know to my cost—literally—that my wife gets many telephone calls from a certain political party asking for even more money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> While my hon. Friend is right to require a degree of balance in respect of donors' privacy, the Bill goes too far in the direction of anonymity. In future, candidates in one part of the country—for example, Scotland—may be questioned about whether they are being funded from up there. They may be able to receive contributions—we have already discussed the question of tax exiles—but it would be of some political significance to discover whether candidates in one part of the country are being supported largely by donors from another, especially if paper candidates eventually come forward. The Minister should consider whether it is possible to have the donor's constituency listed. That would have political significance if the Yorkshire independence party were to be funded only by people from Yorkshire, as distinct from people from all other parts of the country. I appreciate that that was a long intervention, but it is an interesting point.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It was a good speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Indeed, and my hon. Friend makes an interesting point. As some hon. Members have mentioned, the fact that donations are registered might lead to a greater interest, for a variety of reasons, in the location and the identification of the pattern and style of donations. It would be interesting, for example, if donations to a party in Scotland were coming from Yorkshire. I suspect that some people will attempt to make such studies, partly out of academic interest, and partly out of political interest. I am increasingly concerned about the issue, because one of the things that Neill wanted—and certainly one of the things that the Government, the Labour party and, I assume, all parties want—is more and smaller contributions from more people. We need a democracy with parties that excite people. It is a matter of judgment, but I believe that the more regulations and qualifications that are included in the Bill, the greater disincentive there is for people to contribute. That is not what we want.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> In support of what the Minister is saying, I am sure that I am not alone in having had trouble, since I became more of a public figure, from people who are political opponents—but not, I like to think, members of respectable political parties—doing things like filling in one's name and address in mail order offers to cause grief, embarrassment and nuisance. I am sure that all hon. Members have experienced that. Although we have broad shoulders and thick skins and can shrug it off, it is not something to which we want to expose small donors, if, as the Minister says, we are trying to change the pattern of donations from big, tough, large donors to a more democratic and wider spread of people making small donations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I agree with that. That thought, and the need for confidentiality, led the Home Office to conduct a review of electoral registration and the issue of making registers available to commercial organisations. I am not sure what status that discussion has reached, but the proposition is that there should be two registers—one available for electoral and political reasons, and a second available to commercial organisations. Individuals could be excluded from the list for commercial organisations in the hope of avoiding the knocks on the door, mail shots and the other nuisances that the hon. Gentleman has experienced.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I was not planning to intervene again, but as the Minister has raised that point, I have considerable doubts about the practicability and effectiveness of that different kind of register in the age of the internet. If one person were to get hold of one of the more confidential versions of the register, which included all the data, it could be posted on the internet. That would remove the protection.
<P>
The classic example is that of e-mail addresses of parliamentarians. Often, we do not like to use them too openly, because e-mail from people who are constituents might become intermixed with and swamped by e-mail from people who are not. That would lead to inefficiency in the handling of constituents' requests. Nevertheless, those of us who use e-mail are already finding that, even if we are not exactly being swamped, we are starting to get a considerable number of communications that get in the way of relevant communication.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> We are moving a long way from the scope of clause 62. We will have the opportunity at a later date to discuss issues relating to data collection and e-mail. I hope that we can now accept clause 62.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> This is an important group of amendments. Amendment No. 47, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and me, has rightly not been selected because a decision on it would have had the same effect as that on clause stand part.
<P>
The basic premise of the amendment is that we do not believe that there should be special provisions for Northern Ireland. In Lord Neill's report, he suggested that such provisions should exist, because there were special circumstances there. I am not sure that I accept all his arguments on that issue. The Neill report reached us in October 1998, and the game has moved on since then. It reached us before the Good Friday agreement, and before the creation and election of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Northern Ireland Executive. It also reached us before Sinn Fein—to name just one of the Northern Ireland political parties—became part of the political process there.
<P>
If Great Britain is to be subject to the requirements for financial propriety and transparency embodied in the Bill, it will be unacceptable that the area of the United Kingdom with the most vivid history of political corruption is excluded from the provisions of the Neill report, I do not wish to go over the political history of Northern Ireland, but it would be wrong effectively to turn a blind eye to practices that we have declared unacceptable in the rest of the United Kingdom.
<P>
I hope that, as result of what has happened during the past year, there will be an end to the violence that has been used in the furtherance of political causes in Northern Ireland. I believe and hope—as, I hope, do most Members of the House—that the arms that have been used by terrorists will be handed in and decommissioned. I wonder when that will happen, although that is an argument for another time and place. A great deal of intimidation has been used in Northern Ireland over the years. We must not, in passing this clause, create an environment in which that could be perpetuated.
<P>
I propose that we seek greater financial propriety throughout the United Kingdom, and a case can be made relating to the need for greater financial propriety in Northern Ireland, where it has been lacking for many years. In their response to the White Paper, the Northern Ireland Unionist parties adopted a fairly unanimous view. They declared:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is not acceptable to argue that Northern Ireland must be treated differently because Sinn Fein are organised on an all-island basis. The same law should apply to all parties which stand for election in the United Kingdom. This should not be dismissed as a political point. The fact it is difficult to police donations to the Republican Movement is no excuse for not trying.''<P>

I wholeheartedly agree with that view—there is no excuse for not trying to police donations, although that will be difficult to do, partly because some donations for the Northern Ireland parties and the nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales come from foreign sources. If contributions from the Scottish and Welsh diasporas are from impermissible sources, they will be rejected by the treasuries of those parties. There is no reason why the treasurer of a Northern Ireland party should not similarly reject donations that come from people who are not permissible donors. If Northern Ireland is to be regarded as an integral part of the United Kingdom, it should be subject to those rules that apply to the rest of the United Kingdom, including those relating to donations to political parties.
<P>
That brings me to the substance of the amendments. My first option relating to the clause is that it should be deleted completely, but we shall discuss that further during the clause stand part debate. However, if it cannot be rejected completely, parts of it need serious alteration. If amendment No. 46 were agreed to, the clause would state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State may by order make provision . . . for extending . . . in relation to Northern Ireland parties''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not want the Secretary of State to have the power to make orders that relate to only one Northern Ireland party. It might be politically expedient to suggest that Sinn Fein—that is the party that immediately comes to mind—should be exempted from various provisions or that regulations that apply to other parties in Northern Ireland should not apply to it, but we cannot have one rule for one party because that is politically expedient and another rule for the other parties. The same rules must apply to all parties in Northern Ireland.
<P>
Clause 63(1)(a)(ii) will give the Secretary of State the power to make an order
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for such period as is specified''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a pretty open-ended basis for a provision that we hope will be implemented temporarily, if it is implemented at all. If amendment No. 48 were agreed to, subparagraph (ii) would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for such period not greater than 12 months''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is entirely consistent with—to pick an example from Northern Ireland—the approach that was adopted in the prevention of terrorism Act, whose provisions are renewed every 12 months.
<P>

</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 49 is probably the most important in the group. During a previous sitting, I referred to paragraph 5.33 of the Neill report, which deals with the definition of the Republic of Ireland. It quotes section 2(1) of the Ireland Act 1949, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is hereby declared that, notwithstanding that the Republic of Ireland is not part of His Majesty's dominions, the Republic of Ireland is not a foreign country for the purposes of any law in force in any part of the United Kingdom or in any colony''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our electoral law recognises that the Republic of Ireland is not a foreign country and that its citizens are not foreigners by giving those citizens the right to vote in all United Kingdom elections, and—at the moment—to stand for election in the United Kingdom, provided that they are not members of the Dail in Eire. That was a matter of some debate on the Floor of the House yesterday, or perhaps it was the day before. I know that today is Thursday—
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> It was Tuesday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Yes, the day that stretched into Wednesday.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> The long day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Indeed. I do not want to discuss the merits of the Bill that gave rise to that debate. The point is that, for electoral purposes, citizens of the Republic are treated in this country as if they were citizens of the United Kingdom. If they were resident here, they would be entitled under the Bill to make a contribution.
<P>
The amendment would establish a restriction in line 20. After the words ``section 48(2)'', it would insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to include citizens of the Republic of Ireland resident in the Republic (subject to compliance with the Republic's Electoral Act 1997) only''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In effect, that Act is the Republic's equivalent of the Representation of the People Act 1983. We should note the amendment's use of the word ``only''. Under it, the only people outside the United Kingdom who could contribute to a Northern Ireland political party—other than categories with which we have dealt in respect of the United Kingdom, such as those on an electoral register who are resident abroad—would be citizens of the Republic of Ireland who are registered to vote in the Republic. The significant reference is to citizens of the Republic of Ireland.
<P>
There is a further argument in favour of the amendment, which I have checked in the Library. Although the legislation that was discussed on the Floor of the House yesterday or the day before does not include reciprocity, it certainly permits a citizen of the United Kingdom to contribute to a political party in the Republic of Ireland. Therefore, we would not be setting a major precedent by recognising the interrelationship between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom—particularly Northern Ireland—as a whole, or by recognising that the Republic's citizens might wish to contribute British political parties in the same way that citizens of the United Kingdom—especially residents of Northern Ireland—might wish to contribute to political parties in the Republic.
<P>
The amendment would be a neat way of solving the problem. It would prevent any Northern Ireland political party—although I am thinking particularly of Sinn Fein—from taking political donations from the United States or elsewhere. It is unacceptable to enshrine in our legislation the possibility that exemptions may be granted to allow any political party to take donations from citizens of another country who have no allegiance to, and no interest in, this country and offer no reciprocal rights to its citizens.
<P>
I know from the Minister's earlier comments about companies incorporated in the European Union that he would like to find ways of tightening up the provisions in the Bill. The Irish Republic represents a special case. It is not an ideal situation—it would be better if we could simply close the door and have a watertight political system, but we cannot do that because of the historical connection between the Republic and the United Kingdom.
<P>
I tabled the amendment because I want treasurers of political parties to be able to receive donations from citizens of the Irish Republic who are registered to vote in the Republic—that can be checked from the Irish electoral registers—and who wish to make such contributions. If the Electoral Commission suspected that Mrs. Smith from Donegal, who had donated £5 million to Sinn Fein, had received that money from somebody from the United States, I am sure that the Irish authorities could be persuaded, under the Bill or other legislation, to be co-operative in any investigation to fund out from where the money had originated.
<P>
We would have the comfort of transparency and would know where such donations came from, because the treasurer of the party would have to know the name and address of the person concerned. I know that there is the question of anonymity in relation to Northern Ireland, but it would still be possible for checks to be made on names and addresses. If the treasurer of the party was suspicious that the money was not from a permissible donor, he could send it back. The onus would be on the party to determine whether the donation was permissible. If it came from a citizen of the Irish Republic—as from a citizen of anywhere else in the United Kingdom—it would be incumbent on the treasurer to ensure that no one had tried to flout the law by having the money provided by somebody outside the United Kingdom. I commend the amendment to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Martin Linton </B>(Battersea): I shall do my best to distinguish between the matters raised by the Opposition amendments and the problems of evasion that are addressed by amendment No. 33, but it will be difficult to untangle the different issues involved.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset quoted from the Ireland Act 1949. However, it may be more relevant to quote from the Good Friday agreement, because the proposal is much more a consequence of the agreement. It refers to the right of Northern Ireland people to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and to hold both British and Irish citizenship.
<P>
We should proceed with care, because a relatively minor proposal to change the rules of candidacy caused us to stay up all night on Tuesday. We are dealing with issues in the same area that are part of the same process, and I would not want anything we say here to be blown up and cause another wasted night.
<P>
It is important to understand that the reason for the clause derives directly from the Good Friday agreement. There are people in Northern Ireland who are both British and Irish, and it is difficult to escape making some provision for them. They cannot be compared directly with the Scottish or Welsh diaspora, which involved people who moved from the United Kingdom to another part of the world, but retained a link with their old country and wanted to send money to political parties here. We are discussing people who have not moved—for example, people in Dublin who are Irish citizens consider themselves as having a right to contribute to parties that also operate in Northern Ireland. That is a different proposition from parties that operate in the island of Ireland without distinction. We are discussing people from Northern Ireland who may have moved to Dublin, but not necessarily people who consider themselves to be in a country where they can hold both British and Irish citizenship or whichever they choose.
<P>
It is interesting that the proposal of the hon. Member for North Dorset in amendment No. 49 uses the same formulation that I proposed earlier when discussing tax evasion—that people should be registered and resident in the Republic of Ireland. I argued that ``registered and resident'' should be the test of ability for British citizens to give money to British political parties. That arises in another guise and I agree that the test should be that people must be resident in the Republic of Ireland if they want to give money to parties in Northern Ireland and that they should be resident in the United Kingdom if they wish to give money to political parties in this country. That raises the re-routing problem, which was clearly foreshadowed in the Neill report. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there would exist the possibility of overseas donations reaching the Republic of Ireland'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
where there is no ban on overseas donations,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and then being re-routed to the North by an individual or via one of the parties' offices in Dublin or elsewhere in the Republic. We have not been able to devise anything that would prevent this other than statutory provisions which would arguably be inconsistent with . . . the Good Friday Agreement.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Neill committee considered the matter and came up with no answer, so, it is not surprising that it will be difficult for this Committee to find an answer to the problem.
<P>
There is an additional problem with British political parties that operate in Northern Ireland. At the moment, all the Northern Ireland parties that are represented at Westminster are uniquely Northern Ireland parties, but that may not be so in future. The Conservative party came within a few thousand votes of winning a Northern Ireland seat at Westminster in 1992. I would not want that to happen and I would regret it if it did happen, but it would be wrong to create legislation on the basis that that would never happen. We might have a Conservative and Unionist party of Northern Ireland, with representation in the Assembly or in Westminster, which would have the right to receive money from residents of the Republic of Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. As he agreed, the current drafting of the clause implies that the Secretary of State could discriminate between political parties in Northern Ireland in deciding which of them should receive funding. That could lead to an extraordinary situation in which it was acceptable for a resident of Dublin to give money to Sinn Fein, but not to the Ulster Unionists or the Conservative party. In the case of the Conservative party, it could be argued that it did not have one or more Members, at that time, elected for constituencies in Northern Ireland. We shall discuss that point on the next set of amendments. The issue should be considered as a totality.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> The hon. Gentleman may say that, but one of the amendments, which we shall discuss later, refers to registered parties with headquarters in Northern Ireland. Clearly, the question of British parties in Northern Ireland raises the issue of bamboo walls, glass ceilings, fire walls or whatever way one chooses to distinguish a party in Northern Ireland, in financial terms, from its sister party in the rest of the United Kingdom. The Neil committee considered that question in relation to parties that have branches in Dublin and Belfast. The Neill report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it would be virtually impossible to halt the flow of funds from the Dublin offices of the SDLP or Sinn Féin to their Belfast offices.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would also be difficult to ensure that one could halt the flow of funds from a Belfast office of the Conservative and Unionist party to its London office. If one could not do so, the exemption in clause 63 would open a huge loophole. Funds could go, for instance, from a donor in the United States to a resident of the Republic in Dublin, who would not be subject to clause 54 of the Bill. It would not be illegal for such a person to pass on a donation to the Unionist and Conservative party in Northern Ireland, which could give it to its London office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's quote from the Neill report, according to which it would be impossible to halt the flow of funds from the Dublin office to the Belfast office of a particular political party. In tabling the amendments, we were not suggesting that the flow of funds could, or, necessarily, should be halted. The tenor of the Bill is that, because of the accounting requirements, the flow of funds could be identified. If such a flow can be identified, it is incumbent on the treasurer of the accounting unit in Northern Ireland, or the treasurer of the central organisation, to ensure that it has come from a permissible source.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I take that point, but, as this stage, all parties are seeking ways of solving the problem. Most people would agree that it is fundamental that we accept the fact that people in Northern Ireland have the right to consider themselves as either Irish or British. That is a fundamental part of the Good Friday agreement. The corollary of that is that the right to give money to parties in Northern Ireland cannot be distinguished simply by citizenship. Ireland must be treated as a whole. That is related to the problem of re-routing, which will be extremely difficult to resolve.
<P>
I look forward to hearing what my hon. Friend the Minister says on that. It is not merely an Irish problem—it raises the issue of the extent to which parties in Ireland should be able to raise money from the Republic, and the extent to which that might allow them to continue to raise money from the United States or elsewhere. Could people who were totally unconnected to Ireland use that exemption to frustrate the Bill's objective of banning overseas funding?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am mindful of the fact that there are different ways to approach this issue. It is difficult not to get dragged into general considerations when one pays attention to the particular.
<P>
These are probing amendments. We accept that there are several ways to approach the subject and that one cannot simply shut off the Republic of Ireland from involvement in what I call United Kingdom politics. Developments over the past few weeks and in particular over the past two days have recognised that—they have emphasised common links and tried to ensure that the relevant structures will encourage participation in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. That is the correct approach. I become anxious when I hear people suggest that Northern Ireland should be ring-fenced from the rest of the United Kingdom and that it should have a special regime. That raises the possibility that the United Kingdom parties that do not have members in Northern Ireland could be disadvantaged with regard to the way in which they seek funding in the Irish Republic. In this context, are we considering the involvement of the Republic of Ireland or, because of the Republic of Ireland's laws, the involvement of the rest of the world through the loophole, including, in particular, the United States?
<P>
I listened carefully to the speech of the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton). However, he went well beyond the point of credibility when he suggested that it was necessary to allow funding from the United States to enter into Northern Ireland in order to fulfil the terms of the provision that he quoted from the Good Friday agreement, which, we have pointed out on previous occasions, is drafted in vague terms. His suggestion was simply not credible. That is why we tabled various amendments.
<P>
I want to make three points in this context. First, if there is to be discrimination in favour of Northern Ireland, it cannot involve discrimination in favour of a particular Northern Ireland party. There could not be more of a red rag to a bull. Secondly, the clause is limited. Thirdly, I draw amendment No. 49 in particular to the Minister's attention. It is designed to crystallise and to identify what we are trying to achieve.
<P>
The amendments are closely related to the next group of amendments, which I hope that we shall debate not later today but on Tuesday, when we may be feeling fresher I hope that our comments convey to the Minister one message—that we should accommodate the right of citizens of the Irish Republic to fund United Kingdom politics generally. That would fulfil our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement. Scrutinising individuals in the Irish Republic will make the work of the United Kingdom Electoral Commission more difficult, but that could be raised on an intergovernmental level at the Council of the Isles. As part of our efforts towards international cooperation, we could insist that there should be a degree of conformity, sit back and—dare I say it—stop worrying about the matter.
<P>
The clause provides the Secretary of State with powers but does not state exactly what he will be able to do. The clause seems to be going in the wrong direction—it seeks exceptions for Northern Ireland and does not look at the matter in the context of the United Kingdom, and it raises the risk of separating the politics of Northern Ireland from that of the United Kingdom in an unacceptable manner. That is the basic message.
<P>
Each of the amendments is a pointer to the direction in which we should go, but obviously does not set out precisely what should happen. The issue should be addressed by completely reworking clause 63, or by getting rid of it completely and reverting to our earlier proposal that would have made citizens of the Republic of Ireland an allowable category of donor. That proposal appeared to excite the Minister or, at least, to suggest to him that there might be a way out of this intractable labyrinth, which seems to get worse as we go through each line of clause 63.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I think that this is the beginning of a debate, and that the Committee will want to spend some time on the matter.
<P>
All the amendments link together and it is difficult to differentiate between them. It is unfortunate that we cannot start with a general discussion on clause 63. Before we address the clause, I shall say a few words about it. There are clear deficiencies in it, and we intend to improve it. We intend to use this discussion on the amendments to help us to draw up amendments that we shall table on Report. This issue is by no means cut and dried, in the eyes of the Government. We shall table our own amendments, but we are not clear at present how they should be drawn up. We may ultimately have to come back to one of the amendments that I am about to invite the Committee to reject—amendment No. 49. That is perhaps the most significant amendment in the group and, although I ask the Committee to reject it now, it may offer possibilities for a later stage.
<P>
As well as these discussions in Committee, meetings are to be held next week between my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth), Under-Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office, and all the Northern Ireland parties. Our proposals will be drawn up in conjunction with those discussions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> As discussions are taking place with the Northern Ireland parties, will it also be borne in mind that other organisations not currently represented may also put up candidates for election? I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that Pro Life has put up candidates in Glasgow and other parts of the country, and that Precious Life is extremely active in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and has expressed an intention to put up candidates in those areas. It would be possible to siphon money through them to the United Kingdom quite easily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> My hon. Friend makes a fair point; we need to have wider discussions on those matters. One of the issues in clause 63 is that the present definition of a political party in Northern Ireland is unacceptable, and will have to be reworked. That links in with amendment No. 46.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset talked about the changing situation in Northern Ireland and about the Belfast agreement, the Good Friday agreement, the Neill report and how matters move on. I should remind him that the Belfast agreement was reached in April 1998, the elections to the Assembly were held in June 1998 and the Neill report was published in October 1998, so the Neill recommendations are not as old as one might think. As Committee members have pointed out, the Neill report quotes from the Good Friday agreement.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On the amendments, I should say that, when we return refreshed on Tuesday, another opportunity may arise to discuss similar ideas. Amendment No. 46, which would replace the phrase ``a Northern Ireland party'' with ``Northern Ireland parties'', is an easy one with which to deal. The language used is that of draftsmen. In fact, we are talking not about a specific party but about the generality of Northern Ireland parties, and we do not intend to give an advantage to any one party. We shall table an amendment that recognises the substance of amendment No. 46, but its scope must be wider. In the Bill, a Northern Ireland party is a party in which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``one or more members are members of the Northern Ireland Assembly; or . . . a registered party of which one or more members are Members of the House of Commons''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Pollok said, some parties fall outside that definition. Our amendment will acknowledge that fact and develop the thinking behind amendment No. 46.
<P>
Amendment No. 48 would restrict any exemption made by the Secretary of State to a period of not more than 12 months. I was encouraged by the Neill committee's recognition that circumstances on the island of Ireland might never be entirely normal, and that such a provision might need to be made for some time. The White Paper makes reference to a period of five years. In preparing the Bill, a period of three years was discussed. It is no secret that the suggestion was recently made that the Under-Secretary canvass with Northern Ireland parties for the establishment of a two-year period. This is a fluid situation and I do not discount the period suggested in the amendment, but I ask the Committee to reject it at this stage, so that we may see what emerges from the discussions.
<P>
That leads me to the final amendment—I have got the message that I should finish. So accommodating am I that I shall shortly begin discussions outside the Committee to try to get the Bill into shape. I know that the hon. Friends of the hon. Member for Hazel Grove are waiting, and I shall try to finish quickly. Although amendment No. 49 is the most interesting of this group, I shall, as I said at the outset, ask the Committee to reject it. However, depending on our discussions, and depending on the conclusions that we draw from the Committee, it may be necessary to fall back on it, or on a similar amendment.
<P>
Although amendment No. 49 has advantages, it has one clear disadvantage—it requires UK legislation to rely on legislation in another country. I am uncomfortable with that, because, ultimately, we are responsible for our own laws. We can enforce our own laws, and influence our own laws. It is perilous to rely on laws that do not belong to us. Neill indicated that such a route might be possible. Clearly, the hon. Member for North Dorset thinks that it might be possible, and that it might be the route forward. There are other routes forward, and I shall outline a possible replacement for clause 49. When I mentioned it earlier in the Committee's proceedings, it was a starter for 10, not a firm proposal. Perhaps, during our discussion, my parliamentary colleagues—I nearly said comrades—might like to return to the issue.
<P>
The current notion is to have a separate register for parties in Northern Ireland that can take donations from across the island. Clearly, that does not cover the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, because Northern Ireland parties of all persuasions receive money from the United States and Canada. Such money could be sent to registered Northern Ireland parties. However, we are trying to devise an amendment that would create a wall—a fire break—between the Northern Ireland party and the UK party. I do not want to crawl outside the scope of the amendment, but it impinges on clause 49.
<P>
I hope that I have made it clear to the Committee that this is an important discussion. I do not want to detain the Committee any longer, but I look forward to comments and responses from parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the Committee. That will allow us to devise a new clause 63 that meets all our expectations, given the rapidly changing situation in Northern Ireland.
