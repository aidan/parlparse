<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Security on grant of entry clearance</center></H4>
<H4><center>10.30 am</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move amendment No. 87, in page 5, line 13, after first "clearance", insert "as a visitor".
<P>
We now come to the provision of security for visitors. The amendment was suggested by the Immigration Law Practitioners Association, which wishes to clarify whether security relates to entry clearance as a visitor. It says that the explanatory notes to the Bill focuses on visitors, but the clause refers to people applying for entry clearance or to extend leave to enter or leave to remain for a limited period. Thus the provision could also apply to students, working holidaymakers or those needing medical treatment, in which case money could be deposited with the Secretary of State for substantial periods and accrue significant interest. Whose would it be? If the Government intend to apply the bonds only to visitors, the Bill should say so. The amendment gives the Minister an opportunity to clarify that.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> I am happy to confirm that our current intention is that the power to require financial securities will be used only in respect of visitors and, moreover, only for family visits--a particular class of visitor that causes problems for applicants and visa officers over the assessment of an applicant's intention to leave the UK at the end of their visit. The majority of visit applications are straightforward and will not require the exercise of the provision.
<P>
Under the Immigration Act 1971, the Secretary of State is empowered to make rules setting out the practice for regulating entry into and stay in the United Kingdom. That is the appropriate place to set out how the power will be used.
<P>
The initial pilot will probably apply to one or two countries and perhaps to a certain group of visitors. We will then assess whether it is successful. If it is, we intend to see how it can be applied to people on family visits, in the same way as we are introducing the appeal system for visas. We would therefore consider expanding it in that way for those making family visits from a variety of countries.
<P>
However, if the scheme proved in due course to be a popular and successful means of ensuring effective immigration control as well as facilitating appropriate and proper entry, we would not want to restrict ourselves at this stage to preventing students or others from benefiting from the provision. However, it would be some years before we considered going down that route. Our current intention is that the provision should apply to family visits only, although if the pilot were successful we would want the power to extend it. However, if it became clear that the pilot scheme was not operating successfully, we might not expand it to family visits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Again I heard the words "current intention". However, I listened to what the Minister said--
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley </B>(Worthing, West): Can the Minister give the Committee some idea about the current numbers of visitors? If the pilot scheme is successful, how many people would come within the provision? The Minister will probably say that it is a way of giving people permission to come as an alternative to refusing them. If it allows more people to come rather than fewer, there must be a proper purpose for the public good and for the benefit of those who are applying.
<P>
Will the Minister also give the Committee an indication of the country or countries that would be most appropriate for the pilot scheme?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> From memory, there were about 8.3 million visitors to the United Kingdom last year. Our aim is to apply the provision to family visitors only, but I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a figure for the number of people who merely came to visit their families. At present, there is no need to identify that group, so we do not count them separately.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked me how many people the provision would affect. I cannot give him a definite answer, but it will certainly be in the millions because many millions visit their families in this country.
<P>
I have considered which countries would be involved, but we have not yet made a decision on that. The initial suggestion was that India and Pakistan might be useful areas in which to run a possible pilot scheme, but, if we were to run one, we would have to run it in both countries. The difficulties primarily present themselves in respect of those countries and particularly for elderly people visiting from those countries.
<P>
I have had initial thoughts, but I do want to describe my views as anything other than that because I do not want to tie myself down. Elderly people have faced difficulties obtaining consent to visit the UK because many of them, especially those from the Indian sub-continent, do not return. Therefore, the applications of elderly people from that of the world are carefully assessed. That has resulted in concern among ethnic minorities that grandmothers and grandfathers cannot properly visit their grandchildren.
<P>
We may consider whether it is appropriate to introduce the initial pilot in that area, but I do not want to tie myself down or give a definite view at present. We might use Bangladesh, Jamaica or another country for the pilot, and we shall consider the matter next year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 136, in Clause 7, page 5, line 27, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"( ) In determining the amount of security to be required or accepted under this section, the Secretary of State shall have regard to the means of the person who will provide such security.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 149, in page 5, line 44, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Provided that such security may not be more that 10 per cent. of the income by the sponsor, or of the visitor's income declared by, the sponsor in supporting a visit if required from the sponsor, or of the visitor's income as declared to the British post, if required from the visitor.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 148, in Clause 8, page 6, line 13, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provided that such security may not be more than 10 per cent. of the income declared by the sponsor, or of the visitor's income declared by the sponsor in supporting a visit if required from the sponsor, or of the visitor's income as declared to the British post, if required from the visitor.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Some more general points could have arisen under the previous amendment, but they are better reserved for the clause stand part debate.
<P>
I do not hide the fact that, in tabling the amendment, I have received encouragement from the United Kingdom Council for Overseas Student Affairs, which represents those involved in the education in this country of people from overseas. It believes that an approach that may be right for other visitors may be inappropriate for students.
<P>
I am aware that it is possible for people to misuse the provisions for students. Some people come to this country with the intention of staying way beyond a period of possible study. They may be recruited to an education college that has little recognition and that is not particularly concerned about whether its students gain any benefits from studying. I do not intend to defend the misuse of the student route to this country.
<P>
Furthermore, I do not wish to argue that recognised further and higher education institutions in this country should fill courses that cannot be filled with home students with students from overseas who have been misled into believing that such courses are especially good. Before universities started to take their accreditation seriously, they were able to advertise overseas a course that did not offer many attractions to home students. Its places would be filled with students from overseas even though they should not have been filled because the course was not good enough for students from overseas or from home.
<P>
My concern is for those who properly come to this country for undergraduate and postgraduate study and for specialisms that are not available in their home countries. This country both provides and gains advantage from their presence. It is well known that not just the English language medium of teaching, but the specialist courses that polytechnics and older established universities offer are attractive to overseas students. We do not want to make such courses available only to people who have bags of money. Many people who come to this country even for short courses are extremely poor. I recently provided research help--not financial help--to a student from the western cape of South Africa who exists in this country on virtually nothing. The amendment, rightly, gives the Minister the opportunity to explain how his Department and others will approach students and, I hope, ensure that students' means are taken into account; that there is full consultation with recognised bodies representing organisations that provide education to overseas students; that the provision will not be a disincentive and that students will be allowed to enter and will not be barred for financial reasons alone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I share many of the anxieties about students that the hon. Member for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley) expressed, and shall try to tackle them in a later group of amendments. I was worried by the Minister's initial response to amendment No. 136, which suggested that the provision might be extended to students, as I had hoped that it would apply only to visitors.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 149 and 148 relate to the means of people who take advantage of the provision. I do not want family reunion to be governed entirely on a mercenary basis: I am uncomfortable with any proposals that would mean that people who are less well off may not be able to attend family reunions while people who are better off may.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 149 and 148 are designed to introduce some sort of equity. They propose what amounts to almost a means-testing process, suggesting that the bond should be set at such a level that the pain of its loss would be equivalent in relation to people's absolute means. In other words, someone who earned £5,000 or £10,000 whose bond was set at a lower rate would feel equal pain to someone who earned £50,000 or £100,000 whose bond was set at a higher rate.
<P>
We hope that the Government will design a bond scheme that recognises the disparity in people's income and that people who want visitors frequently come from poorer sections of society. That does not mean that under the clause poorer people should not have to lodge bonds if they want to have a family visit, but that such recognition would give them an achievable means of doing so. Otherwise, if a high level of bond is set for people who cannot afford it, we are worried that they will take out inappropriate loans from, for example, loan sharks. They will be drawn into unnecessary debt to try to achieve a genuine family reunion, when a different level of bond could have been equally effective in ensuring that they kept to the provision of the visa, without driving them into dire circumstances. I hope that the Minister will recognise that in his response to the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> We do not intend the clause to apply to students, but we want to keep our options open. As I suggested, any possibility of its doing so would be some years hence. Initially, we would analyse a pilot scheme that would not be completed until the year after next, and would subsequently consider extending it to visitors' visas. It would therefore be two or three years before we would even consider whether it would be applicable to students.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West and I recognise the great importance of the education industry to Britain. We want to do everything that we can to encourage its proper operation. However, as he rightly says, some people pose as students and attend colleges that do not provide substantial education. Their primary objective is to breach immigration controls. It is a well known and well established route to do so.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman will recognise, it is always difficult, as in many asylum matters, to distinguish people who are genuine from people who are not. It is much easier to identify the colleges involved, especially if they are reputable, but people also allegedly attend reputable colleges only for the purpose of evading immigration controls.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary. Our aim is not to provide a disincentive, but to encourage the operation of proper educational institutions and the proper attendance students at United Kingdom colleges.
<P>
Amendment No. 136 would require the Secretary of State to take account of the means of the person concerned in setting the amount of bond. Amendments Nos. 148 and 149 would prescribe the maximum level at which financial securities may be set, namely no more than 10 per cent. of the sponsor's or applicant's declared income.
<P>
The amendments are not acceptable for a number of reasons. First, the Bill is not the proper place for setting out detailed provisions on the amount of a financial security. That will be done in the immigration rules, for which provision is made in clause 7(6).
<P>
Secondly, amendment No. 136 is unnecessary, as the clause does not prevent consideration of the means of the person concerned in setting the level of the security. That is subject to the overall ceiling in the immigration rules, as envisaged in subsection 6(a). There are, indeed, arguments for the means of the person concerned to be considered. For example, security of a few pounds would clearly be inappropriate in the case of a multi-millionaire.
<P>
Thirdly, amendments Nos. 148 and 149 are incomplete. Do they refer to gross or net income? What are the criteria for deciding whether a security is set at the maximum amount or a lesser one? What supporting evidence will be required, and how will it be assessed? How will disputes be resolved? The amendments do not address those serious issues.
<P>
The principle underlying amendments Nos. 148 and 149 is that of a mechanical matching of the maximum level of a financial security to an assessment of an individual's ability to pay. We are not persuaded that that is necessarily the right approach.
<P>
I understand concerns that any financial security under our scheme must be affordable. It would certainly not serve our purpose to set security so high that a substantial number of those who might benefit would effectively be excluded. Equally, it is right to take account of means, otherwise the security would not serve its purpose. Small sums of money deposited would be unlikely to be substantial enough to make their prospective loss an 
effective deterrent against abusing a bond system simply to secure entry to the United Kingdom. Low deposits would also be unlikely to reflect the substantial cost to the taxpayer of enforcing the departure of those who overstay their leave.
<P>
The figure of 10 per cent. proposed in Liberal Democrat amendment would merely be a fee which would allow a breach of immigration controls. There must be a proper penalty which would make someone think seriously before breaching it.
<P>
Fourthly, the mechanical matching of the maximum level of the bond to the sponsor's or visitor's ability to pay, as proposed in amendments Nos. 148 and 149, does not work. Such matching would detailed evidence of the sponsor's or visitor's ability to pay. It would need to be assessed and verified by the visa officer through a means test, would offer scope for disagreement and dispute about the right level of bond in individual case and would generally lengthen and complicate the entire process, making it more expensive to run. If a bond scheme is to work, it must be quick and simple to understand and its administrative costs should not be too high for applicants.
<P>
We do not intend to take decisions about the maximum level of financial security or how it will be calculated in individual cases until we take account of views expressed in the consultation exercise that will take place later this year. We will then set out in the immigration rules the arrangements on which next year's pilot scheme will be based. Should we feel that there is a need to change those arrangement in light of the experience of the pilot scheme, the immigration rules will give us the flexibility to do so swiftly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> On behalf of Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members, I thank the Minister for his response. For the sake of those reading our debates, I should make clear that he was referring to clause 7(6), as opposed to clause 76, which deals with provisions for support arrangements.
<P>
I am satisfied with the Minister's assurance that clause 7(6)(d) will, as stated, make fit
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provision for different cases or descriptions of"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
cases. That means that people's means may be taken into account, and that students may be regarded as a class to be dealt with.
<P>
Students may come under the provision in two years' time. From the Minister's answer, I assume that he will tell educational institutions and associations which Departments they should deal with, not only when there is a confrontation on rules that might apply to students, but also in the year or two before such rules come into force. For example, does the Home Office alone deal with the matter, as it is connected with immigration? Does the Department for Education and Employment have regard to it as well, and in terms of invisible earnings does the Department of Trade and Industry? Does it involve the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which deals with overseas visitors to this country and our overseas earnings?
<P>
A range of Departments has an interest. I suspect that the people involved would like to know where the main contact point is and whether the interests of different Departments will come together for what I think is now called joined-up government.
<P>
There are more general issues that arise from the Minister's reply, but I think that it would be more appropriate to take them in the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I repeat that we do not intend currently or in two years' time to apply the clause to students. That is an important point to make. However, we are keeping options open for the longer term, looking at several years hence. If we ever took that view, it would be only as a result of the way that we applied the clause to visitors being seen to be successful, and there would certainly be full consultation. The Department for Education and Employment and the Home Office would work together properly to consult student and other organisations that might be affected. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Having heard that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 83, in page 5, line 31, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4A) The Secretary of State shall not realise the security, and shall repay any security deposited, if the applicant is recognised as a refugee or is granted exceptional leave or leave to remain under the immigration rules.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 88, in page 5, line 31, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4B) No security under this section may be realised of an applicant seeking to visit a family member who has been recognised as a refugee or granted exceptional leave to remain on asylum grounds in the United Kingdom.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
No. 150, in Clause 8, page 6, line 17, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3A) The Secretary of State will not realise the security, and will repay any security deposited, if the application is recognised as a refugee or is granted exceptional leave to remain under the immigration rules.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The subjects for my amendments have been suggested by outside bodies interested in our proceedings. They need to be briefly explored.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> It might be useful if the Committee knew which outside bodies had suggested the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The subject of amendment. No 83 was suggested by the Immigration Law Practitioners Association. It is designed to explore the position of a person for whom a security has been given who claims asylum and is recognised as a refugee. Will the Minister tell us what happens to the security in such a case?
<P>
I think that the subject of amendment No. 88 was suggested by the Refugee Council, but I am not entirely sure. It concerns applicants coming from overseas to visit family members who have been granted asylum in this country. In such a case, it would be difficult if not impossible in the eyes of the Refugee Council for the family member to visit the applicant himself, especially if the applicant came from the country in question. Perhaps the Minister will respond to that issue as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Liberal Democrat members of the Committee have added our names to the two amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) . In much the same spirit, we have tabled amendment No. 150, which is about repaying security when someone has been granted acceptable leave to remain in this country as a refugee. We are dealing with a small category of people when set against the total of visitors to the United Kingdom, but a category who frequently, due to the nature of their refugee status, have difficult financial circumstances. We believe that there are also some issues of fundamental moral principle as to whether, once someone has been recognised as a refugee, withholding any kind of bond would be contrary to the spirit of giving them refugee status in the first place.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall deal first with amendment No. 83. The United Kingdom has international obligations under the 1951 UN convention and the European convention on human rights. In line with those obligations, where a visitor who was admitted to the UK after the provision of a financial security is subsequently recognised as a refugee here or is recognised as having a right under the ECHR not to be removed, it is proposed that no security should be realised and any security previously deposited or realised will be repaid. Where a visitor is admitted after provision of a financial security and subsequently applies for and is granted leave in another capacity, including exceptional leave to remain, that would nevertheless break the condition of the agreement that the applicant would visit the UK and leave the country. In certain circumstances, clause 8 will be used to continue security where further limited leave is granted. However, generally it will be appropriate to realise the security in such cases.
<P>
Although a number of the bond scheme's elements are subject to consultation, if it is to be a success, the terms of the provision are best kept simple and clear. The essence is that the applicant should visit the United Kingdom and leave on or before the expiry of his allotted leave, as agreed in the original undertaking. The bond is a contract which effectively states, "We will let you visit, but you have to leave because you promised Britain that you will go home."
<P>
The implication of the amendment is that the bond scheme for visitors will be used as a stepping-stone for another status under immigration rules. Any such impression would damage, perhaps fatally, the purpose, which is to facilitate entry of people wishing only to visit the UK.
<P>
On amendment No. 88, it would be undesirable to provide an enhanced sponsorship scheme for sponsors with refugee status or those granted exceptional leave to remain, although my fear is not so much that that would happen, but that the proposal misunderstands entirely the basis on which the bond scheme is presented. There seems to be a fear among the people who suggested the amendment to the hon. Member for Hertsmere that the bond scheme will be used to restrict access, whereas its purpose is to provide the extra reassurance that an entry clearance officer may require in circumstances where he might otherwise not be prepared to grant a visa. So, if I accepted the hon. Gentleman's amendment, far from being of benefit to a refugee, it would act to his detriment in that it is possible that a security might be used to enhance the likelihood of obtaining a visa.
<P>
It is important that hon. Members understand how the provision is intended to operate; I fear that it is not understood by some of the organisations that prompted the amendments. What will happen is that the entry clearance officer will look at an application for a visa and consider whether he is disposed to grant it. In some cases it is clear that he should not grant a visa, so he will not. At other times it will be clear that he should grant a visa, and, as now, it will be granted. There should be no circumstances in which a visa now being granted ceases to be granted or be made conditional upon the provision of a financial security.
<P>
The other category is that group of people about whom an ECO is a little doubtful in that he does not accept that they have shown that they are likely to leave the UK, but none the less feels that they have a genuine reason for the visit, and that his doubt can be assuaged by the provision of a financial security. We do not anticipate there being a great number of people in that category. The provision will enable an ECO to enable people in that marginal category, from whom a little more reassurance is required, to visit provided there is a bond or security which gives ECO the assurance that he needs to grant the visa.
<P>
If the amendment were accepted, refugees would be barred from using the option of that security to enable members of their family to visit. So, far from being detrimental to refugees, the bond system might be helpful in allowing their entry. I accept the point from the hon. Member for Hertsmere that some refugees may have financial difficulties, but the alternative to having a bond is essentially that a family member does not visit. That has to be understood. We are giving the ECO that extra reassurance that effective immigration controls will be maintained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> The Minister has made the intention clear. One truth about the Standing Committee stage of legisation is that we need to be sure about what power is being given as well as probing what a Minister has in mind. The Minister made a sensible point that if the power of a security allows more people to come, that is an extra option, but it raises the question whether the extra cost to the entry clearance procedure is to be borne by those required to provide the security, who effectively would get a double whammy because they have to pay the extra cost of processing assured securities. The Minister may say that that is not covered by the amendment, but it is provoked by his response to previous amendments.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is important to recognise the concerns of those who advise would-be visitors to those in this country. It would be appropriate to return to the method that I suggested to the Minister. Some of the groups that are briefing members of the Committee--I make no point about the fact that only one side of the Committee is responding because we all know how Committees generally work--and some of the experts in touch with the Home Office and its officers should be able to establish what method of monitoring would be best to assess how the Minister's intentions turn out in practice.
<P>
The Minister has the power under the Bill to make changes to procedures. As experience is gained when the provision comes into effect, I hope that some of the fears that have been ably expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere will, if realised, pass directly to the Home Office and that the Minister will be open to joint review with groups that advise people and their family members in this country to ensure that the provisions work as the Minister suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West makes an entirely reasonable point. The Minister referred to consultations with outside bodies and I have no doubt that they can be informed by the content of our debate. In those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 145, in page 5, line 31, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4A) No security under this section may be required of an applicant seeking to visit to attend the graduation ceremony of a family member at a recognised institution of higher or further education.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 137, in page 5, line 44, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"( ) This section shall not apply to those granted leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom as students or otherwise under Part 3 of the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (HC 395) as amended or to family members seeking to visit them.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The amendment was tabled in order to probe the impact of the provisions on students. I hope that the Minister will not take it too literally because it is, as I said, intended to raise issues about the possible impact of bonds on students. It is framed in the context of a particular event in a student's life. The Minister has already recognised the value of the university and other UK educational institutions in bringing international students here, both for international relations and for our balance of payments. A key event in that process is the graduation ceremony and university organisations said that they would be worried if family members were impeded from attending graduation ceremonies. The amendment was tabled in that spirit.
<P>
The Minister's comments, while reassuring on student visas generally, raised further concerns. He referred to imposing bonds on a class of visitors such as elderly people from India and Pakistan, though I accept that that was an example rather than a specific proposal. Those are precisely the sort of visitors who may want to attend the university of Sheffield's ceremonies to see Indian and Pakistani nationals graduate. Many family members will be elderly and I would not wish a bond scheme to work against them.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will provide some reassurance. I recognise that the matter will be dealt with in the detail of immigration rules, but I want him to give a commitment that the pilot scheme will take into account the issue of family members visiting students. Those involved in setting up and running the pilot scheme should look carefully into that matter. If possible, a report on the pilot scheme, which should be drawn up before the Government decide to proceed, should cover that issue. We will then be able to see whether the impact has been negative or positive in terms of our ability to attract foreign students to the country as a result of the provision of visas for key events in students' lives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I also have an amendment grouped with the one that was moved by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam. Graduations are not the only relevant consideration. It is worth giving some thought to the experiences that people have enjoyed and would like others to share and the undesirable experiences that they would like others to avoid.
<P>
I know of many people in my constituency and in my family who have gone abroad to see their children at universities in other countries, but not only for graduation. Let us consider someone who is at a business school at Fontainebleau, a common travel area within the European Union. Visiting a student at a university course is perfectly natural. Parents' desire to visit the children they have brought up is universal, and applies if one is black, white, rich or poor. It is not only parents or grandparents who want to visit their relatives. In some families, cousins are seen as the equivalent of brothers and sisters, and aunts and uncles as the equivalent of parents.
<P>
It is also worth stating explicitly that a visit to attend a graduation ceremony is not a matter of staying for two or three days and leaving. It is often used as an opportunity of staying several weeks, if not months, in a country. The Minister will rightly want to consider whether people will overstay and whether there will be a cost to the public purse. He may tell the Committee, or the House at a later stage in our proceedings, the sort of monitoring that will be used, and the sort of problems that might arise.
<P>
The Minister will not be able to guarantee that there will never be a problem--that is too tight a guarantee to seek. However, monitoring should ascertain whether the categories of people who want to visit family members who are students here have a bad record of overstaying, disappearing or being a cost to the public purse.
<P>
If we know the sort of monitoring and information that is available, it will be easier to determine whether the primary legislation or the secondary rules of the application of both is appropriate to the problems as well as the opportunities that should be taken into account.
<P>
I do not believe that the Minister and his officials will automatically suspect people from poor countries, or those who might be regarded as being visibly from ethnic minority groups. If the monitoring turns out to mean that only black or Asian people are suspected of offending, that is as bad as the police occasionally saying that they will stop only black people and then claiming as a justification that the only people found committing offences were the black people that they had stopped.
<P>
What sort of overall monitoring exists? How will the Minister develop the confidence to allow people to visit those in educational institutions with the minimum of fuss, and approve the applications in time?
<P>
Let us not concentrate today on the problem with processing documents. I would not expect to have to apply six months in advance to visit one of my children who was studying overseas. It would provide comfort if people knew that they could apply three months in advance and that, with minor exceptions, the applications would be processed and approved in that time. People's plans change, and it is more difficult for the conditions to be varied if applications have to be made so far in advance. Those matters are important to families, and the Minister should provide a response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) said that it would be regrettable if the provision applied to elderly people who wanted to attend graduation ceremonies, but the provision can facilitate those people's entry. The hon. Gentleman misunderstands the way in which the clause will operate. If such a scheme did not apply to elderly people, they would be deprived of an opportunity to turn a possible refusal of a visit visa into a grant of a visit that was supported by a bond. People from ethnic minorities suggested the scheme to us to facilitate entry within the immigration rules. The scheme will maintain effective control while ensuring that unnecessary restrictions do not apply to people who want to enter the country.
<P>
We do not intend to apply the scheme to students. It is also intended that the sponsor will be a British citizen or a foreign national who has indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom.
<P>
A foreign student in a British university who does not have indefinite leave to remain would not be able to make use of the scheme as we intend to operate it. However, if the student was a British citizen, or a foreign national with indefinite leave to remain, who wanted a relative from abroad to attend his graduation ceremony, he might well be able to make use of it. The hon. Gentleman seems to have misunderstood the purpose of this; he must grasp that we are dealing with borderline cases where it will reassure the entry clearance officers so that a visa might be provided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I understand the basis of the scheme and welcome the principle if it means that people who otherwise would not be able to visit now can. The Minister talked earlier about a category of people and I was worried that entry clearance officers might leak the financial bond scheme over to people who may be getting entry clearance without it. They might apply it to all elderly people coming from India and Pakistan whereas previously such people may have been able to get their visas without a financial bond.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will try to prevent our ECOs from leaking all over the place.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West asked me about monitoring how the scheme operates. He quite rightly identified the concern which he and I and, I hope, all members of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and the Foreign Office would share, which is that none of these measures must be used in a racially discriminatory way. One way to provide that reassurance is to ensure that the race relations legislation applies to immigration control. We have already given a commitment to extend the Race Relations Act 1976 to cover the way that immigration controls operate.
<P>
One of the areas where we are currently having some difficulty with control is eastern Europe, rather than the traditional areas where people have thought that there were problems in the past. That does not, on the face of it, involve black or Asian people. However, wherever it is, we must ensure that these things are done in a way that is non-discriminatory and of which we can be proud.
<P>
We will collect data on those to whom entry clearance is granted and those with bonds. That will be done publicly in the sense that MPs will be able to get access to this information by asking parliamentary questions. When we are deciding whether to expand this after the pilot scheme, we will make sure that any data that we have is openly available during the consultation period so that an assessment can be made about the way that this operates. There is no reason why we should not be as open as possible about how visitors visas or the bond scheme operate.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In the long term I hope that it will prove successful and popular and can be expanded. That is an issue that another Parliament will probably have to look at. Our current intention is to apply this not to students but only to family visits. The area where we intend to apply this is fairly restricted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Is there any kind of bond, security or guaranteed system in operation at present?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> None.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We have had a useful debate. It has a drawn-out point, which will be of great interest to those concerned with the welfare of international students, that it will not apply to a family member visiting an international student who is not a UK national--the vast majority of them. Although it has been useful in providing information, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 146, in page 5, line 35, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(5A) Where an application for entry clearance as a family visitor has been refused grounds for refusal include a statement that no, or insufficient, financial security was provided, those grounds may be challenged on appeal to an adjudicator or the Tribunal.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 147, in Clause 8, page 6, line 17, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3A) Where an application made under subsection (1) has been refused, and the grounds of refusal include a statement that no, or insufficient, financial security was provided, those grounds may be challenged on an appeal to the adjudicator or the tribunal.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> These, too, are probing amendments. How will people will be able to appeal if the ground for refusal is the inability to provide financial security? I hope that individuals could challenge such decisions, which would then be reviewed. Will the Minister please comment on the process?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The aim is that persons who would have been granted a visa should not be implicated in the bond scheme. Persons who might otherwise have been refused, but on a borderline decision, may be able to take advantage of a bond scheme. Persons who are refused a visa for a family visit will be able to appeal under other provisions in the Bill. Whether a bond is appropriate will be a matter for that appeal. The operation of the visa system would be appealable where a visa, which may or may not have included a bond, had been refused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> If someone is granted the visa subject to his providing a bond and he either cannot or will not do so, can he still go to appeal?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> He will not be provided with a visa unless he agrees to provide the bond. In such circumstances he will simply be refused a visa. He will be asked if he can provide a bond and if he says, "No, I will not provide that bond," he will be refused a visa.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> With that clarification, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<H4><center>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 6, line 1, leave out from beginning to end of line 2.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 57 and 58.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> These are technical amendments, but I shall answer any questions that hon. Members may have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> For the sake of those who try to follow our proceedings, will the Minister confirm that Government amendments Nos. 57 and 58 appear on pages 238 and 239 of the amendment paper? The amendments give a new list of definitions of expressions with the same meanings as those in the 1971 Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The amendments are connected with the linked amendments in clause 135 which define certain terms for the purposes of the Bill by reference to the Immigration Act 1971. Clause 135 is the logical place for the reader to look for a definition of common terms such as "entry clearance"; as a consequence, clause 7(7) is redundant.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 6, line 5, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "after the deduction of any expenses incurred by, and refunded to, other parties as a result of Directions given under Schedule 2, paragraphs 8, 9 or 19 of the 1971 Act, in connection with removal, custody, accommodation or maintenance of the person in respect of whom the security is provided.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 90, in Clause 8, page 6, line 25, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"after the deduction of any expenses incurred by, and refunded to, other parties as a result of Directions given under Schedule 2 paragraphs 8, 9 or 19 of the 1971 Act, in connection with removal, custody, accommodation or maintenance of the person in respect of whom the security is provided.".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendment was suggested by, and represents the views of, the British Chamber of Shipping. Clause 7(9) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any security forfeited or otherwise realised by the Secretary of State . . . must be paid into the Consolidated Fund.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The British Chamber of Shipping is concerned about a case in which directions are given by the Secretary of State to carriers to remove a person from the country. It wants the cost of that removal to be deducted from the security before it is paid into the Consolidated Fund. It wants to use the forfeited securities to pay the cost of transporting someone abroad.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Under schedule 2, paragraph (8) of the 1971 Act the carrier is liable for the costs of removing a passenger who is refused entry. Under paragraph (9) a carrier who brings an illegal entrant to this country can be required to meet the cost of removal, but as, in the context of the clause, we are talking about people arriving with an entry clearance, the question of illegal entry arises only if material deception was used to gain entry. The amendments also refer to detention costs incurred under paragraph 19 in respect of those refused leave to enter. However, as those costs are not recoverable when someone has arrived with an entry clearance, as in the clause, that is not an issue here. Paragraph 20, which relates to the costs of detaining illegal entrants, is not referred to. However, again there is no issue, as generally that paragraph does not require carriers to meet the costs of detaining those who obtain leave to enter by deception.
<P>
The amendments might apply in cases where someone has been issued with an entry clearance, having paid a security, and is either refused entry on arrival or found to be an illegal entrant because they used deception. The number of such cases is unlikely to be large and may become smaller if the provisions of clause 1 are applied to the categories of entry clearance applicants to whom the clause relates.
<P>
I cannot therefore invite the Committee to accept the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I am not sure, but it sounded to me as if the Minister was suggesting that the amendment was out of order. I doubt whether we would be considering it if that were the case, so I must have misunderstood what he said.
<P>
Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act is about administrative provisions at control and entry and contains a large number of provisions that I shall not go into. If the Minister is saying that the carrier would be unlikely to have a liability if someone was granted entry clearance because fraudulent information was supplied, the illustrative point referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere may have been directed to the wrong part of the Bill.
<P>
If, on the other hand, somone arrives here with entry clearance that should not have been given and a carrier is liable to return them to where they were picked up, there should be a provision stating that any security should go to the Consolidated Fund, after paying the carrier for returning the person who may, in the Minister's words, have obtained their clearance wrongly. In that case the British Chamber of Shipping has a valid point. Whether it is properly met by the amendment is a technical matter, but I think that the Committee will expect the Minister to respond to the underlying issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend has made a valuable point. In the absence of any response from another quarter, the British Chamber of Shipping may wish to discuss the matter further with the Minister. However, I shall not detain the Committee with it any further this morning and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Bottomley.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> If the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) wishes to go first, I am happy to allow her to.
<P>
<B>Ms Diane Abbott </B>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington): The hon. member for Worthing, West is always the gentleman.
<P>
The question of visas for family visits is one of the most vexed issues in immigration control. Most members of the Committee who have experience of relatives trying to get into the country for weddings, funerals, christenings and illness have been met by obstacles in the legal system. That is why I welcome the Government's reintroduction of appeals for visitors' visas.
<P>
The proposal in the clause to introduce an element of financial surety is a least worst option. The problems inherent in it are obvious. Once one asks for financial surety, one inevitably discriminates against the poorest members of the community. However, it has a great deal of support from the ethnic minorities. I am glad, however, that the Government have chosen to pilot the scheme rather than introduce it without any tests. However, I am not as sanguine about our entry clearance officers as the Minister and there is a danger that, far from the number of people who will obtain entry visas being maximised, the entry clearance officers will adopt a belt-and-braces approach, and people who might otherwise have got through without any financial surety will find that is an additional burden. Will the Minister be more explicit about how he will ensure that financial sureties are applied only to marginal cases?
<P>
With that caveat, I feel that I must support the proposal. Once it is introduced, I suspect that, whatever the problems, there will be pressures from all parts of the community to be allowed to place a bond. I understand that it is possible that the provision might be initially restricted in the pilot stage to people from the Indian sub-continent. However, when they hear that people from the Indian sub-continent are able to place a bond to get their grannies into this country, my Nigerian and Jamaican constituents will queue up for the same privilege, if it can be described as such. That is why I am anxious that the pilot stage acts to maximise the number of people who can genuinely visit this country and does not act as an additional burden.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I agree with the hon. Lady. I suspect that there will be creep. The provision may start as a means of extending the opportunity to come here to people who would otherwise be denied it, but it will then overlap the arrangements made for those who already obtain permission. That may not always be a bad thing if some of the people who already receive entry clearance significantly overstay, become a burden on the public purse or disappear so that we do not know whether they will be here for ever. Although such behaviour confirms the attractions of this country, I hope that the Minister or one of his successors will say that we should consider a surety or bond system for certain identifiable categories.
<P>
The provision should not apply only to family visits. it contains no definition of a family visit; it is a general power that is available to entry clearance officers. We should pay tribute to them as well as to those who serve the Minister in the formulation of policy. Entry clearance officers do not have an easy job. They may believe that their work is not appreciated by Members of Parliament, by the general public or by those applying for permission to come to this country. However, they perform a necessary function and almost all of them almost all of the time do it to the best of their ability and within the rules. The issue is what the rules should be.
<P>
In determining the rules, we should be clear as to what we are trying to allow. We should carry on the tradition of these islands in which things that are not forbidden are allowed. The desire to move, to travel and to visit is common to everyone. That is why so many people from this country go abroad for holidays and to work. Travel is part of our nature and others will want to do what we do. Just as we want to go to other people's countries, they will want to come to ours.
<P>
Sometimes we are too restrictive. We have had the idea that this country had an indigenous population and that, except at the margins, it should not change. However, 20,000 years ago the population of this country was nil because of the effect of the ice age. To some extent, our ancestors all came here.
<P>
When people talk about the elderly parent problem, I often ask what the elderly parent or grandparent problem is. If my children lived abroad--say, in Canada or Nigeria--I would regard it as natural to want to go and live with them as I approached the end of my useful life, be that in retirement or otherwise. The authorities in the country in which I wanted to live might ask who would pay for my medical and social care. However, my family might be willing to provide a guarantee that, subject to emergencies such as being knocked down by a bus--and the common understanding is that host Governments carry the cost of them--they will meet the cost of my living there. If that were the case, there would be no reason why I should not go there.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that British people wish to travel. However, I make the further point that people from an ethnic minority background are more passionate about attending weddings, funerals and christenings than a more stoic British person. I have travelled to Canada to attend weddings of cousins whom I have seen only once in 30 years. Had I been asked to explain myself to an entry clearance officer or even give my cousins' proper names, I should have been at a loss, but I knew that it was important to members of my family that I put in an appearance. I agree that entry clearance officers have a difficult task, but I think that sometimes they do not quite appreciate the significance for different cultures of coming together, even after 30 years, for important family and cultural events.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady. Hon. Members have spoken about ethnic minorities but, whatever the colour of my skin, eyes or hair, it is natural for families to want to get together. I tried to say that as a person living in this country--this applies to equally to a non-white person--I want to be able to travel, and if others have the same desire, they should have the same opportunity. So, effectively, we should be asking how we would feel if we were required to apply six months in advance to go to India to visit a child studying at an Indian university, or how we would feel about having to go through very many hoops to spend six weeks in retirement with a child who lived and worked in India, regardless of whether he or she had full nationality or residence permission.
<P>
I had been developing a point about elderly people. I hope that people here will recognise that the desire of many to care for their elderly relatives should be fulfilled in this country, even if their parents or grandparents have lived somewhere else for most of their life, particularly if they would otherwise be a burden on this country, and their children or grandchildren wish to care for them. I regard that as a perfectly legitimate reason for such people to have permanent residency here. For example, if an 86-year-old great aunt, who is American, wanted to come to live with me for the rest of her life, I would regard that as normal, and feel that she should not be required to jump through too many hoops if I could show that she could support herself or that we could support her.
<P>
A second separate topic rightly arises on clause stand part. We know that people can come to this country and have residence if they have large amounts of money. I forget the test--it may be having £1 million or some large sum to invest--but it does not cover enormous numbers of people. If the bond system were set at a far lower level--which, in practice, it has to be--the Minister might rightly ask, "What guarantee is there that people will not look on the bond as effectively a fee or charge?" That is where we need to rely on procedures, and on the judgment of entry clearance officers to conclude not that a bond or security will be a guarantee that a person will not overstay, disappear or fail to go home when he has agreed to, but that the person would not have been given permission to stay without that bond or guarantee. It is an area where we need to trust the system. It would be easy to make a two-hour speech about the Minister being unable to guarantee that the system will work. We must be far more open than that, saying that at the margin there are a number of cases which ECOs, families or persons trying to visit them would regard as suitable for a bond or security. It is not merely a matter of requiring a return ticket; to some extent a degree of trust and assurance is also required. On that ground we should welcome clause 7, with all the worries that the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) mentioned. It will increase the opportunities for people to travel and, to that limited extent, I welcome it. The real test will be in its operation, which is why a pilot scheme provides some extra reassurance to the House and, I hope, to those whom it will affect.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Patrick Hall </B>(Bedford): I have some concern about the proposal for a financial security scheme which I raised when we took evidence from the public. I shall not go over that ground again as I received a full and constructive answer from my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. I wish to acknowledge in Committee the support for the proposal that has come from the ethnic minority community. However, the expectation of some constituents to whom I have spoken is that it would allow in some of their family members who are outside the rules. I want my hon. Friend the Minister to recognise that.
<P>
My hon. Friend said this morning that the bond as proposed will apply very narrowly and specifically--to borderline cases only. That is important. It will apply to those on the borderline of being granted entry clearance within the rules. So people who now get entry clearance--and I acknowledge that the majority do--will continue to do so without any question of having to offer a security or bond, and those who are clearly outside the rules will continue be refused, without an offer of a sweetener by the application of the bond. Those who are refused will now have the additional and welcomefacility of appeal.
<P>
Does my hon. Friend the Minister recognise that there is a danger that offering a bond could be seen as a standard requirement, either by our officials who are applying it--although I accept that there will be training to avoid it--or, and more likely, by potential applicants, in the same way as sponsors in this country regard the making of a declaration to receive their family members from abroad before entry and pay a fee for that? The rules make it clear that they do not have to do that. I say again and again in my advice surgeries, "There is no need for you to pay the fee to the solicitor. You can write a letter for me and I shall copy it on." However, no matter what I say, they feel better about paying the fee, going to a solicitor and obtaining the declaration: it seems to carry more weight. There is therefore some evidence to suggest that people in the community, and their relatives abroad as they hear about it, will see it as a standard requirement, an unwritten rule, for every application.
<P>
At the risk of repeating myself--perhaps the point has already been made by others this morning--will my hon. Friend the Minister assure me that the training of entry clearance officers in the pilot scheme emphasises the narrowness of the application of a bond, along the lines to which he referred? Can he assure me that the monitoring will focus on that and that any extension of the pilot scheme after a few years will be preceded by full consultation, with hon. Members having an opportunity to debate it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Let me outline the way in which the scheme will work. Someone who wishes to go to a high commission or a British embassy to apply for entry clearance to visit a member of their family in the United Kingdom will apply for their visa in the normal way. If, as is the case today, the majority of them are granted visas because they are genuine and proper visitors, no bond or security system should apply. If they are clearly refusal cases, they will be refused as they are now, and there will be no question of a bond applying.
<P>
However, in a narrow group of borderline cases the provision of security will be a demonstration of intent and will help the entry clearance officer come to a balanced and well-informed decision on the application in that limited category. There is no intention to shift the balance and make the bond scheme standard. The instructions to entry clearance officers will be clear on that point.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West was concerned about the system creeping into other cases. We want to ensure that that does not happen. My hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall) was concerned that it would be a standard requirement, but we shall ensure that it is not. We must also ensure that clear instructions as to how it will apply are set out in the immigration rules.
<P>
I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington that as well as having the benefit of immigration rules for guidance, ECOs will have guidance from the IND. My hon. Friend will know that under the previous Government advice to immigration officers was secret and confidential, but that is no longer the case because we have published it on the internet. It is now available to Members of Parliament and to anyone else who wants to know how the guidance operates. Our aims are open and clear.
<P>
ECOs have difficult decisions to make and I join the hon. Member for Worthing, West in paying tribute to their work. It is not an easy job for them or for my officials, to whom I also pay tribute. The job is essential to this country. It requires the exercise of judgment and it is easy for people to be critical of those who make the decisions. The job is difficult: it must be done properly, fairly and in a non-discriminatory way.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington referred to her constituents who had relatives in Nigeria and Jamaica. We have not yet definitely decided whether the pilot will be based in the Indian sub-continent. If the hon. Lady wishes to make representations for other countries, we will take them into account.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West wanted reassurance that the system will not become a fee for entry. We want to ensure that too. It is a declaration of intent, not an extra fee paid to evade immigration controls, which would be unacceptable. We are talking about a demonstration of intent for people to return to their own country.
<P>
Our current thinking on the definition of "family" is that it is a group related by blood, marriage or relevant adoption process; it also incorporates partners in common law, and long-term homosexual or unmarried relationships. Certainly elderly people wishing to visit grandchildren would fall within that category. If they are intending to visit this country, the bond system would quite properly apply to them, but if they are coming to stay it should not. The hon. Member for Worthing, West saw no problem with it applying in such cases, but others might disagree. Those who come to stay should apply to stay in the proper way and should not seek to come merely as a visitor.
<P>
Coming for a visit and paying a bond, if necessary, is an exception. The provision will apply only to visitors and only in borderline cases. The extra security provided should enable those who currently cannot secure a visa because they are in the narrow borderline category to do so. I hope that the provision will be welcomed by ethnic minorities. It has certainly been requested by them for some time and I hope that the pilot study will enable us to expand the system to deal with family visitors. I hope that it will in due course become successful and popular.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> Can the Minister confirm that the system does not apply only to family visitors? Will the countries for the pilot scheme be specified under statutory instruments or will the Minister have the power, exceptionally, to allow someone from a country outside the pilot area to be considered?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The aim is to have a narrow pilot study so that we can see how the system will operate. I anticipate that it will apply to a single or a limited number of countries, but I do not want to tie myself too tightly to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will just let me answer the question. We want to make sure that the pilot scheme operates in a way that gives us a balanced view of its possible expansion to include all countries or a large number of countries from which there are family visits. The current intention is that the system should apply only to family visits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> I understand the intention. My question was about what the law will say. I was seeking confirmation that the expression "family visit" does not appear in the primary legislation. Will the secondary legislation specify the categories that the Minister listed or the countries in the pilot scheme? Will it exceptionally allow the Minister to accept a bond or a security from someone outside those countries?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The secondary legislation will specify that the system is for a limited category of visits. When the broader scheme is in operation it is likely that it will apply only to family visits. It is also likely that we will specify the single country or the countries to which the pilot scheme will apply. It is intended in due course that the system should apply to all countries from which we are likely to receive visits, but initially we will apply it to particular countries or groups of countries while we are rolling out the programme. The eventual aim is that it should apply to people from all visa countries who want to come for family visits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In a minute, but I must finish dealing with the point that the hon. Member for Wothing, West raised. The secondary legislation will be very specific and I do not intend that Ministers should exceptionally be able to apply the scheme to a country other than those specified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> My hon. Friend has just answered the point. It would be extremely messy and confusing to start applying exceptions. It would simply generate a queue of people from all over the world rather than allowing us to run a controlled pilot. As this is an experiment the Minister is right to approach it cautiously. The rules for the pilot must be clear from the beginning.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. People often come to my surgeries saying that they would like to put down some money. I do not intend that during the pilot study Ministers should have the discretion to extend it all over the place as there would be a long queue of Members of Parliament with particular cases of people wanting to put down securities. That would not be helpful. It should be clear to whom the secondary legislation applies and there should not be a broad ministerial discretion to apply it to areas other than those intended by Parliament.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Events will demonstrate whether the Minister is right. Would a Ugandan citizen who applied from India be treated as applying from India and therefore come within the proposed pilot or would he be excluded? I do not suggest that as a joke as I know plenty of people from east Africa who went to the Indian sub-continent. I leave that as a thought. Should the Minister change his mind, perhaps he could write to Committee members.
<P>
I will not raise the general question of what happens to bogus business people. At the moment we are talking about people who come as visitors. The Minister said that his intention is that provision should be made for family visitors. However, would categories of bogus business people appear? Would someone refused entry for a family visit be able to do a little trading here, applying to come as a business visitor, to which lesser restrictions may apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman has raised a serious, difficult matter. I have explained how the family relationship will apply. It is hard to say categorically that there will not be people wishing to come for business purposes who happen to have relatives in the United Kingdom. Such people may say that they are visiting relatives, but in fact they are doing business. Indeed, we do not intend to place restrictions on people doing business if they happen to be visiting family relatives.
<P>
We will see how the matter develops, ensuring that it unfolds in a proper and sensible way. We intend that people wishing to make a family visit should be able to demonstrate a family relationship with a British citizen or with a foreign national who has indefinite leave to remain. We will ensure that such visits are for family purposes by asking about such purposes.
<P>
<P>
I cannot guarantee that some people will not practise deception in order to make visits for business purposes. However, we intend that visits should be made only for family purposes.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Can the amount of security be varied under the clause? I have not tabled an amendment on this matter, but the Minister may be able to provide a straightforward answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Securities may vary in amount. We will consult on whether to have a number of levels of security or to link security to the individual, giving broader discretion to ECOs. I will consult ethnic minorities and those who may be affected by the measure so as to take account of their views before final decisions are made.

<H4><center>Passenger information</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 7, line 4 after "writing", insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"( ) must state the date on which it ceases to have effect;".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 12 to 17.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I will outline the purpose of these amendments, which relate mainly to the drafting of the Bill.
<P>
As originally drafted, the Bill provides for a written request for passenger information under new paragraph 27B to be inserted into schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971, or for information relating to the arrival of non-European economic area nationals under new paragraph 27C. Both requests were to continue to be in force until withdrawn in writing by an appropriate officer.
<P>
However, the Government did not intend that requests for that information should be open-ended. In the course of consultation with the Data Protection Registrar, it was suggested the Bill should make provision for imposing a limit on the duration of requests for such information. The amendments achieve that, and their purpose is make notice under clauses 9 and 10 subject to a set lifespan, so 
that standing notices under those clauses will be subject to review and renewal at least every six months. That safeguards the rights of carriers, when it is proper and reasonable to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> As the Minister said, clause 9 empowers immigration officers to require carriers to provide passenger information in relation to ships or aircraft leaving or arriving in the United Kingdom. That provision is an extension of the Immigration Act 1971.
<P>
I am pleased that the Minister said that the requests would not be open-ended because many carriers such as British Airways have expressed anxiety about the amount of information that will be required of them. Will the Minister assure the Committee that immigration officers will try to keep the amount of information to a reasonable minimum that is in line with need? The Minister's comments may enable me to withdraw some amendments later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I do not completely understand the purpose of the amendment or the clause. I am not sure whether to speak now or wait until the clause stand part debate. If I am out of order, I may have to return to the subject later.
<P>
Will the Minister specify a particular flight or a regular ferry? I assume that the provision does not apply to cross-channel ferries, but perhaps I am wrong.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman was right when he suggested that his remarks might be more suitable in a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Perhaps I can respond to the point of the hon. Member for Hertsmere. Requests for information will be reasonable and will be kept to the minimum necessary. We shall not request a large amount of unnecessary information. Our objective is to obtain the information that carriers already possess, so that we can target our immigration resources more effectively.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>

No. 14, in page 7, line 10, leave out "set out" and insert "stated". [Mr. Mike O'Brien.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Maxton.
<P>
How often are the powers in schedule 2(27) of the 1971 Act, especially those in sub-paragraph (2), used? The sub-paragraph states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State may by order made by statutory instrument make provision for requiring captains of ships or aircraft . . . to furnish . . .
<P>
(a) a passenger list . . .
<P>
(b) particulars of members of the crew of the ship or aircraft".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How often is the provision used, and how successfully does it tackle the problem?
<P>
Will the Minister kindly go beyond paragraphs 54 and 55 of the explanatory notes? They provide some information on clause 9, which supplements paragraph 27(2) of schedule 2 to the 1971 Act by introducing new paragraph 27B. What sort of new information is not currently available? How can a ship or aircraft be identified? I presume that the captain of a specific aircraft will supply information.
<P>
There will be a limit of six months on providing information. Does that mean that the carrier must keep the information for six months? That flight may come in every day or three times a week for six months. What does the Minister have in mind in that respect? Will he say why what applies to ships, aircraft and hovercraft does not apply to trains?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend made some fair points, which will prompt a useful clarification. I understand that existing legislation already empowers an immigration officer to require information from the captain of a ship or aircraft arriving in the United Kingdom. The Bill will also empower an immigration officer to require information about a ship or aircraft expected to arrive in or leave the United Kingdom, thus involving a wider range of ships and aircraft.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West said, the proposal does not apply to trains, a matter that also worries the British Chamber of Shipping, for reasons that the Committee will understand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The clause extends the current powers to require information from carriers. At present, under an order made in schedule 2, paragraph 27(2) of the Immigration Act 1971, the Secretary of State may require the captain of a ship or aircraft arriving in the United Kingdom to provide, on request, the names and nationality of passengers. That power has been extended by order to trains and shuttle trains arriving in the United Kingdom. That answers the hon. Gentleman's question; the measure does apply to trains arriving in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> By order under which legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Under secondary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Under the 1971 Act or some other provision?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> May I return to the hon. Gentleman on precisely how the secondary legislation operates? My understanding is that it is an extension of the 1971 Act. Although the powers were provisionally extended only to ships and aircraft, they have been extended to trains travelling through the channel tunnel by virtue of the Channel Tunnel (International Arrangements) Order 1993 and the Channel Tunnel (Miscellaneous Provisions) Order 1994, both of which were made under the Channel Tunnel Act 1987. Clause 9, which amends paragraph 27, would also be extendable by order to trains under the 1987 Act. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
The clause, with other provisions in the Bill, extends the existing power to enable an immigration officer to require certain information held relating to passengers expected, as the hon. Gentleman said, to be carried on ships or aircraft of the carrier, both arriving and departing from the United Kingdom. The type of information that will be required shall be specified by order. Although not mentioned specifically in the legislation, the statutory framework means that it would be lawful only to request information required for immigration purposes. The enhanced powers to acquire additional information on passengers are necessary to enable the immigration service to develop its intelligence-gathering role, with a view to more effective targeting of facilitators, racketeers and others who seek to abuse the immigration laws. They will also facilitate an inspectable approach to the management of arrivals control and the more effective use of resources.
<P>
In the coming months, officials of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, in consultation with the industry, will examine the means whereby information may be provided. We aim to minimise, as far as possible, the administrative burden on carriers and to pay due regard to the implications for carriers of any particular system.
<P>
I shall give an example of the sort of information that may be useful, which goes beyond the names and nationalities in the current provisions. Often, people take bizarre routes and are involved in plane exchanges to evade immigration controls. Their aim is to appear to have come from one place when they have really come from another. If the information is in the hands of the carriers and readily accessible, it may be good intelligence and of use to the immigration service in determining how to receive a particular group of passengers. That is an example of the sort of information that may be useful, which, at present, is usually held by the carriers. If it is, the immigration service might want to have that information.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> It would help to know two things. I ask lightly whether the Security Service, or for that matter the Secret Intelligence Service, would need to use this legislation, and whether any information that they want could be obtained in other ways. That is not an issue for the Minister to answer straight away, but I think that it is a relevant question. If he does not know the answer and it is not a relevant question, I do not mind being told that it does not matter.
<P>
My other question is a more direct one about whether the Bill might require carriers to obtain information that they would otherwise not need. It is solely a question of their disclosing information that they would reasonably be expected to have, or would there be a power under the order? The Minister reminds me to read the last sentence of the explanatory notes on clause 9, which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The types of information which can be required shall specified by order."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<P>
I am not asking the Minister to give total assurance that carriers would never be asked to obtain information that they would otherwise not have, but is the reasonable expectation that the information covered by that order shall probably be information that, as he said, they are likely to have anyway?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We intend that we would seek information that the reasonable carrier would currently have in the vast majority of cases. I would be wary of giving the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that we will never ask carriers to provide information that they do not have, so I shall not give that reassurance. Some carriers may decide deliberately to not have certain information, and we want to be able to require them to have it, provided that it is reasonable. Given the way in which the immigration service operates with most carriers, especially British carriers, most of our relationships are good and getting ever better. Our aim throughout is to create a spirit of co-operation rather than to put unnecessary obligations on carriers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Just for clarification, although no doubt the power in schedule 2 to the 1971 Act as amended basically applies to commercial carriers, by law it does not exclude general aviation or private vessels.
<P>
Tied to that is the point that the Home Office has responsibility for general policing. Presumably the police have the power to ask a carrier whether a person whom they suspect of drug-related crime has frequently been on multi-leg journeys to areas associated with drugs. Is that information available to the police, at least on request if not by order?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It is intended that general aviation will be covered by the provisions, otherwise people might be able to come into the country without being subject to reasonable control.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the information available to the police about drug trafficking. We want to be able to provide information relating to immigration purposes, but obviously some of that information may become relevant in relation to drug trafficking and combating facilitators. Clauses 11 and 12 provide statutory gateways for such exchanges of information, which we would be prepared to use. The answer to the question is in effect yes, but we would do it through the statutory gateway.

</UL></FONT><P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> It might be for the convenience of the Committee and those who follow our proceedings if the Minister chose to explain what clause 10 was about. There is something in the explanatory notes, but for others listening to our proceedings it would be useful for the Minister to read out a note if he has one.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The clause provides that an immigration officer not below the rank of chief immigration officer may require a carrier to inform him of the expected arrival in the United Kingdom of any ship or aircraft of which he is the owner or agent that is expected to carry a person who is not a European economic area national. That information must be provided before the ship or aircraft departs from its final port of embarkation for the United Kingdom. We anticipate that immigration service managers who are responsible for ports with no permanent immigration presence will use that power, which will assist in the more efficient deployment of resources. Clause 10 will achieve that by inserting a new paragraph 27C into schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Supply of information to Secretary of State</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</B>  I beg to move Government amendment No. 18, in page 8, line 10, leave out "a member" and insert "the Director General".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 19, 21 and 22.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Clause 11 creates a clear and specific statutory gateway for information to be supplied to the Secretary of State by the police, the National Criminal Intelligence Service, the National Crime Squad and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise, for defined immigration purposes as set out in the White Paper. Assisted by the complementary provision in clause 12, it will enable closer interagency co-operation in gathering intelligence material and tackling abuse of immigration control, racketeering and other immigration-related offences. It will also enable resources to be targeted more effectively.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 18, 19, 21 and 22 are essentially technical. They will ensure a consistent approach between the various descriptions of the police, the NCIS and the NCS in clauses 11(1)(b) and (c) and 12(2)(b) and (c). The Bill contains several references to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a chief officer of police"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Commissioners of Customs and Excise".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
There is no reason for such distinctions. It is appropriate that the officers in charge of the NCIS and the NCS--in both cases, the director general--be designated the appropriate information-exchanging authority for those bodies. The amendments will achieve that.
<P>
<B>Mr Bottomley:</B> Perhaps the Minister would like to answer the question that I asked the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department: will the security and intelligence services be covered by the arrangements or by different legislation? He might also care to say whether the data registrar will have entry, assuming that the information will be kept on computer--although the point also applies to card records--and whether someone suspected of a criminal offence may tick a box to say that he does not want to go on someone else's mailing list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I shall be guided by you, Mr. Maxton, but the amendments do not strictly cover either of those matters. Perhaps we could return to those Questions in a clause stand part debate.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 151, in page 8, line 12, leave out from "Excise" to the end of line l3.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 153, in clause 12, page 8, line 38, leave out from "Excise" to end of line 39.
<P>
No. 155, in clause 12, page 9, leave out lines 22 and 23.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It is worth having a brief debate on the amendments to elicit some clarification from the Minister. The general principle of an intelligence-led approach is generally. welcome, as long as the right targets are hit. However, it raises profound issues of privacy and, in particular, of compliance with the Human Rights Act 1998, which contains a provision for privacy.
<P>
In the spirit of our approach to previous Government amendments, we welcome the amendments, because they clarify the fact that the director general of the NCIS and the NCS will be responsible. However, we notice that the chief officer of police is also responsible. We are therefore probing why, under the provision for the commissioners of Customs and Excise, the Government feel it necessary to go beyond specifying merely that the commissioners of Customs and Excise will be comparable to the other senior officers being held responsible and to make them the responsible authorities for the exchange of information. Why do the Government feel it necessary to extend the provision more generally to cover a person providing services to them, as in clause 11, or a person doing so for customs purposes, as in clause 12? What categories of person might be included if we pass the clauses unamended?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Amendments Nos. 151 and 153 would restrict the persons through whom information could be exchanged with Her Majesty's customs under clauses 11 and 12 to the commissioners of Customs and Excise only. Excluding "persons providing services to" commissioners would be to ignore the relationship between the commissioners and customs staff as set out in the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979. The wording in clause 11(1)(d) and clause 12(2)(d) also reflects that used in relation to the disclosure of information by the Department of Social Security to customs in section 110 of the Finance Act 1997. In those circumstances the Government do not believe that the amendments are justified.
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 155, the definition of "Customs purposes" set out in clause 12(6) is derived from section 110(3) of the Finance Act 1997. As I have said, that provides the purposes for which the DSS may disclose information to customs.
<P>
I am not persuaded that removing subsection (6)(e) is justified, especially in view of the recent statutory background. In particular, that paragraph allows customs to use information disclosed to it in connection with the processing of information of the type described in subsection (6)(d). Removing subsection (6)(e) would introduce an unworkable restriction on that use.
<P>
The aim of clauses 11 and 12 is to facilitate the exchange of information between Government Departments, in particular in relation to the prevention of immigration and immigration-related crime. Including such restrictions in the Bill would prevent that easy exchange of information.

<P>

<B>Mr Allan:</B> If I understand the Minister correctly, the phrasing in respect of Customs and Excise reflects its constitutionally different arrangement, but I hope that the Minister can also assure us that the commissioners will be ultimately responsible for the use of that information. In respect of the others it is entirely appropriate that it should be the director-general or, in the case of two of the organisations, the chief officer of police. Our principal concern was that people at a lower level than the commissioners would be responsible for that information. If any problem arose, issues of accountability could lead us into difficulty in complying with our human rights obligations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Clearly most of the information will flow towards the commissioners rather than in the other direction. This exchange of information across Government Departments is related to immigration matters. Indeed, there is a specific restriction in the Bill. The likelihood is that it will flow in one direction, instead of the more general problem to which the hon. Gentleman refers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I shall not press the amendment further, as we shall return to a similar subject in the next group of amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> The Minister is not the first Minister to use the expression "exchange of information". I presume that by that he means the effect of clauses 11 and 12 together, because my understanding of clause 11 is that it refers only to the supply of information to the Secretary of State or one of his agents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I do not want to quibble with the hon. Gentleman over words, but we are dealing here with a situation in which different Government Departments may hold information relevant to the person under investigation. It is important that that information should then be communicated to those responsible for investigating offences or potential offences.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In any case which is deemed necessary".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall be brief, because we support the Government's objective--to facilitate the exchange of information between Government Departments, which serves the important purpose of preventing illegal immigration offences.
<P>
We must ensure that the width of the powers in the clause does not cause problems. Concerns have been expressed by organisations making representations to the Committee. One of those is Justice, which proposed the amendment in this form to ensure that the disclosure and exchange of personal information can be carried out only on a case-by-case basis in order to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1984 and with article 8 of the European convention on human rights. Will the Minister respond to those concerns?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman to the extent that it is important that the powers should be exercised in a controlled manner and that they should relate to the legal constraints.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman gave the impression that he did not want to press the amendments terribly vigorously, however the Government accept that the restraints will be ensured by adherence to data protection legislation, to various common law duties and to the Human Rights Act 1998 when it comes into force. It will require agencies that can exchange information under the clauses to act in accordance with the rights set out in the European convention on human rights, most notably the right to respect for private life contained in article 8.
<P>
Limiting exchanges of information in the way that the amendments suggest would unfortunately add nothing to the restraints. Indeed, it might be inappropriate to repeat in the Bill all the legal constraints to the exercise of the powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> May I refer to my experience as a Minister in Northern Ireland where many people made compensation claims because they said that they had tripped over a kerb or claimed that they had injured themselves in an incident related to the water service? If we had had to examine those claims on a case-by-case  basis and had needed to suspect that someone was making a false claim before we could check the records of other Government Departments, we would have caught many fewer false claims.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere will not mind if I say that the Secretary of State should have the power to overlap the information on categories held by various bodies to see whether some people's names reappear in a way that suggests that they deserve greater attention. I am not sure that I agree with my hon. Friend's amendment. It would be reasonable for Government agencies to be able to share knowledge and to examine the matrices of their information in order to find whether certain hot spots suggest that particular people should receive special attention.
<P>
I have described my experience, and I do not know what the Minister exactly has in mind. However, it is not frightfully important for my hon. Friend to press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend always makes important points. I shall not press the amendment because I have established the point that I wished to make. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<H4><center>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The Opposition decided not to move amendment No. 105 but grouped with that is Government amendment No. 55.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That comes later in the Bill and will be moved formally at the appropriate point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 20 in page 8, line 30 at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"( ) This section does not limit the circumstances in which information may be supplied apart from this section.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 24.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The main purpose of clauses 11 and 12 is to establish a clear statutory basis for the exchange of information between IND and other agencies for specified purposes. However, it is equally important that the new provisions should not cut across exchanges lawfully made for other purposes.
<P>
The amendments will ensure that nothing in the clauses will prevent any other information exchanges that currently take place to or from the Secretary of State. Such exchanges are either provided for under existing statute, such as the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997, or have been pursued, subject to relevant safeguards on public policy grounds. The wording used is the same as that in section 122B(5) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, as inserted by the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I am sure that the reason for the amendments is obvious to the Minister, but I am not sure that it is obvious to everyone else. Amendment No. 20 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This section does not limit the circumstances in which information may be supplied apart from this section."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The phrase "apart from this section" may be held to apply to clause 11(2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The information may be supplied to the Secretary of State for use for immigration purposes."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
One presumes that that means only for immigration purposes. There is also the question of what is meant in the amendment by "apart from this section". I may be misinterpreting the meaning, but the Minister may not have the law, as expressed in the amendment, saying what the Government intend it to say. I suggest a review to consider whether there is an ambiguity, which could be cleared up during later stages of the Bill's passage through the House and another place. If it is perfectly clear and the ambiguity does not exist, I am prepared to be convinced, but if re-examination could improve the provisions it would be advantageous to carry it out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his offer of assistance. We constantly review the provisions to ensure that there is no ambiguity. At first sight, I am not convinced that there is. The Bill refers to other lawful circumstances in which information might be exchanged. The purpose of the amendments is the avoidance of doubt--to ensure that the provisions are not interpreted in such a way as to restrain earlier statutory provisions that allow information to be exchanged. We will nevertheless look into it again to ensure that we are not piling ambiguity on doubt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Blizzard </B>(Waveney): On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. I have sat here for nearly two hours and find the temperature no warmer than it was when I entered the Room. Is it possible to increase the heat? I am surely not the only member of the Committee who feels that it is too cold to ensure the quality and level of debate that we are witnessing.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The first comment that I made on walking into the Room at 10.20 this morning was exactly the same. I was informed that the heat of the debate would warm up the Room but that has obviously not happened. The Clerk informs me that we will make every effort to ensure that the Room is warm enough for this afternoon.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> There are a couple of key points but I cannot guarantee that they will raise the heat of the debate. The first is compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998. I sat in the Committee considering that scintillating Bill and was nearly frozen by the coolness of the debate. We should at least ensure that the Bill complies with the 1998 Act. I hope that the Government will give at least one commitment--to publish the advice on clauses that they receive from the data protection registrar.
<P>
I understand that the registrar was not formally consulted when the clause was drafted, but she has some concerns and has made or is soon to make a report to the Government. I hope that, in the spirit of open government, the Government will be prepared to publish the data protection registrar's advice so that we can evaluate it in connection with the clauses that we are debating.
<P>
Another important concern that must be flagged up is the width of the powers that are granted under the clause. In paragraphs (a), (b) , (c) and (d) of subsection (1) we see the Government limiting their ability to have information supplied to the Secretary of State; yet paragraph (e) broadens the Government's powers to require information from absolutely anybody.
<P>
In subsection (a) (b) and (c) again the Government are apparently limiting their ability to require information but again broadening it out under paragraph (d) to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"such other purposes as may be specified".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The concern remains, despite Government assurances that they will use the powers responsibly, that the Bill confers very broad powers on the Government and we do not yet know how exactly they will be used in future. That throws up questions for the data protection registrar and anyone else interested in human rights legislation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> What the hon. Member for Hallam said also applies to the amendment relating to clause 12(2)(e), which was not moved. I am tempted to ask what the original Henry VIII clause said, but it might not be in order.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It might help anyone who was wondering what happened to Government amendment No. 55 to know that it turns up again on page 238 of the Amendment Paper. It is a technical, light amendment which we will not need to discuss. The question about data protection and the Data Protection Registrar is interesting. Is advice from the Data Protection Registrar treated as legal advice to Government, which therefore cannot be disclosed to others, or is it treated as though it is from the director of the Office for National Statistics and therefore a perfectly open issue where there is a genuine public interest and no reason why it should be hidden from the Committee or the House?
<P>
Did the Data Protection Registrar raise issues and if so have the Government received the all clear or been told to reshape their provisions? It would also be useful if Ministers could remind the Committee whether the Data Protection Act applies to all Government-held records in these categories. There is a perfectly decent argument that some information held by Government should be treated in the same way as information held by newspapers. Each person covered by the data cannot necessarily be allowed to know what information is held because some of it may be rumour and unsubstantiated and some may be known to be untrue, but people are not sure which bit is untrue and which is not. It would be useful if Ministers could spell out how they believe the Data Protection Act and data protection procedures, if they are different from the Act, apply in these circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am extremely disappointed that the hon. Member for Hallam did not enjoy my exciting explanation of the provisions of the Data Protection Act. He never mentioned it at the time and I am just a little bothered that he has been harbouring this resentment for the many months since we dealt with it. He has now got it off his chest and will doubtless feel a lot better for it, even if he does not feel any warmer.
<P>
<P>
I have already emphasised that the practical operation of the statutory gateways created by the clause will be subject to the relevant requirements both of the European convention and data protection legislation. Agencies with similar objectives should be able in certain circumstances to share information to assist in the fight against crime and for other specified purposes, but that has to be on a proper statutory basis and with the appropriate safeguards. That is what the clause provides.
<P>
Draft clauses and explanatory notes were sent to the Data Protection Registrar. A meeting was held involving one of her assistants. There was a helpful discussion and a number of the points that were made have been taken on board. They are now reflected in the Government amendments. In particular, in the light of comments made by the assistant to the Data Protection Registrar, the Government intend to make all the order-making powers under clauses 11 and 12 subject to an affirmative resolution. There are appropriate safeguards and I hope that the hon. Member for Hallam is satisfied by that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West will know that the Data Protection Act is based on a European directive. Therefore, although strictly speaking the Bill comes after that Act, the Government are bound not only by its provisions, but by the underlying directive. We would not wish in any sense to avoid its obligations. That provides an appropriate protection to members of the public concerned about the extent of the powers to exchange information set out in the clause and other similar provisions across Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> The Minister knows that he has not answered the direct question about whether information or communications from the Data Protection Registrar to his or another Department could be disclosed to Parliament. There are occasions during a preliminary exchange of views where it could be regarded as on all fours with advice from legal officers. When the Government reach the stage of saying to the registrar, "Please tell us whether in your view we are fully compliant" the registrar may reply, "In some areas, clearly yes, in others clearly no, and in others there is an element of doubt." When the answer is no, the Government will automatically change the legislation--there is no doubt about that--and when it is yes, there is no problem. It is in the area of doubt--which may be over interpretation, or depend on how something is done--that the question arises whether Ministers will allow it to be shared with, for example, the House of Commons. It is an interesting question. If guidance or directives on that are available to Ministers, it would be useful know what they are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Gentleman will know well from his experience in a similar position to that which I now occupy that I will not bind other Ministers by making pronoucements today. However, there was a helpful discussion to which the Government responded with the amendments that the Committee has approved. There was no formal advice as such from the Data Protection Registrar; the hon. Gentleman may feel that, broadly speaking, that reflects that, the DPR was content with the provisions and with their compatibility with data protections rules. However, the degrees of response set out by the hon. Gentlleman tend to reflect the extent to which specific provisions are consistent with those rules. I can only comment on the circumstances in this case; no response has been published because there has been no formal response.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> May I make two comments before we make further progress? The first relates to Mr. Blizzard's point of order. I am informed that the thermostat in the Committee Room is not working and cannot be fixed until we leave because it needs a bigger repair than can be done while we are present. The second--perhaps I am straying slightly further than I should as Chairman--is that Mr. Bottomley raised a point about amendments that were not moved. It is fair to point out to the hon. Member for Hallam that where amendments are not moved and others are grouped with them, it is in order for an hon. Gentleman to move an amendment at the appropriate point if he so wishes. It is right to say that as a matter of ensuring proper debate, but it is usual for an hon. Gentleman to spot that rather than for the Chairman to tell him.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"amendment No. 23, in page 8, line 37, leave out "a member" and insert 'the Director General'."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Clause 12 enables information held by the Secretary of State relative to the exercise of functions under immigration legislation to be supplied to the police, NCIS, NCS and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise, in each case for specific purposes. Government amendment No. 23 is a minor modification of the definition of the term "customs purposes" in subsection (6). The amendment reflects the fact that although some functions of the commissioners of Customs and Excise are under their care and management, others are assigned to them. An example is the investigation of money laundering offences. It will ensure that the Secretary of State may also provide information to assist with the performanc of those functions.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 24, in page 9, line 29, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"() This section does not limit the circumstances in which information may be supplied apart from this section.".--[Mr. Hoon
.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> This is a major clause, which, as far as I can see, has nothing to do with immigration, except that the information may have been obtained for immigration purposes. If I have missed a subsection, I should be grateful if it could be pointed out to me.
<P>
My reading of the clause suggests that there is no equivalent to clause 11(2), which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The information may be supplied to the Secretary of State for use for immigration purposes."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Clause 12 relates to the supply of information by the Secretary of State, or by the various agencies and services for which he is responsible. Subsection (2) spells out quite properly that the information may be supplied to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a chief officer of police, for use for police purposes",<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
and so on, through the National Criminal Intelligence Service, the National Crime Squad, Customs and Excise and the Henry VIII bit in paragraph (e):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any specified person, for use for purposes specified in relation to that person."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Does "specified" here mean specified by order or simply by the Secretary of State, in which case most people will not necessarily know about it? The other definitions do not raise any points of principle.
<P>
I want to ask a question that is not answered in note 59 of the explanatory notes. What powers has the Secretary of State used up to now in supplying information or has the supply of information simply codified custom and practice? I would find it difficult to believe that the information held by the Secretary of State has not up to now been supplied to a chief officer of police for police purposes and so on through the other agencies. Is the Bill being used in effect to provide formal cover for what has been happening up to now or does it provide some limitation? These are matters of general interest, although not of controversy, because most people will have assumed that the information could lawfully be supplied by the Secretary of State up to now. Therefore, the question is: what is going on?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> What is going on is the general principle that I set out at the start of our debate on clause 11. The Government are creating gateways for the provision and exchange of information. Clause 12 is the corresponding provision in a technical sense that allows information already held by the Secretary of State to be communicated to those organisations, specifically--this deals with the hon. Gentleman's rather general observation--in connection with the exercise of functions under the immigration Acts. Therefore, it is limited and constrained by that over-arching requirement.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will see that the Bill, like other recent legislation, reflects the overriding concern of not only the Government but society that, if information is held by different Government agencies about individuals who may be involved in the commission of criminal offences, it flies in the face of common sense to prevent its exchange. For example, if one Government Department has a name and address that another Department requires in investigating an offence, it is right and proper that that information should be exchanged, subject to the overriding protection afforded by the European convention and other relevant statutes such as data protection rules.
<P>
The word "specified" is defined in subsection 7 by reference to clause 11(5), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"'Specified' means specified in an order made by the Secretary of State."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
I think that I have dealt with virtually all the hon. Gentleman's points. He asked: what is going on? I suspect that there have been occasions when this information has been exchanged informally. The purpose of clauses 11 and 12, if I may deal with them together, is to ensure that those exchanges are put on a proper, statutory basis, subject to the law, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman is most concerned they should be.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 12, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Restrictions on employment: code of practice</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 169, in page 9, line 32, leave out "must" and insert "may".
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We move on from the collection and supply of information, provision for which is made in clauses 11 and 12, to a new subject, which may raise the temperature a little, not among Opposition Members, but among Government Members, who may take a special interest in clause 13 and may wish to make a contribution.
<P>
We are now discussing section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. Clause 13 requires the Secretary to introduce a code of practice for employers on the measures that they may be expected to take to avoid unlawful discrimination.
<P>
Committee members may recall that section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 made it an offence for an employer to employ people--including illegal entrants--who were in breach of immigration law. Section 8 of that Act also provided a defence for employers who had been shown proper documentation in advance.
<P>
Amendment No. 169 would remove the duty on the Secretary of State to introduce a code of practice for employers, and instead would give the Secretary of State a power to introduce such a code. That reflects our doubts about clause 13, the inclusion of which in the Bill comes as a surprise to those who listened to what the Labour party said about section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996.
<P>
We are not arguing for repeal of that measure. However, those who have heard what the Labour party said in the past may have expected such a repeal. Let us be clear. It is as plain as a pikestaff that, in opposition, the Labour party argued for the repeal of section 8 of the 1996 Act. It did not say that that the provision would be left in place with a code of practice tacked on, but that it would repeal it.
<P>
We are therefore dubious about the course of action that the Labour party has taken. The Government are obviously concerned about alleged illegal discrimination arising as a result of the matter. However, on 29
 March I asked a written question about what research the Government had commissioned and evaluated into such discrimination. It turned out that they had not commissioned any such research and were relying on representations that they had received from others.
<P>
The Government told me that their proposals appeared in the White Paper "Fairer, Faster and Firmer--A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum" which was issued last July. I was told that comments from business organisations and others were invited at the time of publication. In a written answer, the Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No business organisations have been directly consulted, but consultations on the proposal have taken place with the Commission for Racial Equality, the Trades Union Congress and other interested organisations."--[Official Report, 29 March 1999; Vol. 328, c.
 550.]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
I do not know what the Trades Union Congress said. However, representations from the Commission for Racial Equality do not bolster the Government's case. To be fair, the Commission said that there have been cases of unlawful discrimination under the 1996 Act. However, it is not satisfied with the Government's proposed course of action. Its submission to the Committee states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Commission is not persuaded that translating guidance into a statutory Code of Practice, as proposed, will significantly affect discriminatory recruitment practices adopted to avoid conviction under Section 8."--[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, Other Memoranda and Letters Submitted to the Committee; c. 386.]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Commission sets out in detail the reasons for taking that view and why a code of practice is inadequate. I shall not go into detail about that.
<P>
When Labour was in opposition, Labour Members did not confine their criticisms to section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 or to alleging unlawful discrimination. They criticised the measure for placing a burden on businesses--that may appear to be a new Labour criticism. I have a copy of a letter that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury wrote about section 8 when she was Opposition spokesman for small businesses. She sent the letter to The Daily Telegraph--a very new Labour thing to do. The letter stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Yet once again it is British small firms--who don't have extensive personnel and legal departments--who will be hardest hit . . . Labour believes the Asylum Bill adds to burdens on small firms and turns them into unpaid immigration officers. We opposed the measures during the passage of the Bill through Parliament and Jack Straw has made it clear that we would not operate them in government.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
I do not know how many votes that pledge won from the readers of The Daily Telegraph. Anyone who voted Labour on the strength of it will be disappointed by the Bill.
<P>
Instead of removing burdensome regulations from small business proprietors, the Bill heaps more regulations on them through the code of practice. Businesses will not only be expected to avoid unlawful discrimination, they will also have to comply with the code of practice. They will have to do that as well as ensuring that they do not employ illegal entrants, for which section 8 of the 1996 Act provides.
<P>
It is interesting to note how much store the Government have set by business in the consultations that have taken place so far The Government announced the measure in their White Paper, "Fairer, Firmer and Faster", without any consultation with business. We are told that comments from businesses, organisations and others were invited when the White Paper was published. In a Parliamentary answer, the Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No business organisations have been directly consulted since then but consultations on the proposal have taken place with the Commission for Racial Equality, (CRE) the Trades Union Congress and other interested organisations."--[Official Report, 29 March 1999; Vol. 328, c. 550.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So much for listening to business, large or small.
<P>
We are debating a code of practice that we have not seen. Once again, we are in the dark. The Government propose to hold consultations after the Bill is passed, to draw up the code of practice and introduce it through negative resolution. Doubtless, they wish to avoid debate on the code--it must be an embarrassing subject for them.
<P>
<B>Mr Allan:</B> The stand part debate will be interesting. I have read the Official Report of the proceedings on section 8 of the 1996 Act. The debate lasted for about a week. I am sure that those who organise the business will be pleased to know that we are considering a subject that will take a week to debate fully.
<P>
I shall reserve the bulk of my comments for our solution, which is simply to delete the clause. We shall not support the amendment that we are currently considering because outside organisations criticise the provision for not going far enough in attempting to remove discriminatory practices. We share the anxieties of the hon. Member for Hertsmere that a code of practice is not good enough. However, if a code is not enough, it is nonsense to make it optional rather than compulsory. A code of practice is better than nothing for reforming the 1996 Act, but we would wish the Government to go much further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Gentleman speaks about the code of practice, but I was saying that anyone who believed what Labour said before the election will be disappointed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman says; I cast myself in the role of those who believe what Labour said before the election. I certainly have the same view about section 8 of the 1996 Act as they seemed to hold so stridently at the time. However, although I do not support the amendment, it is a useful peg for our concerns about the efficacy of a code of practice, a code that has been severely questioned by the CRE, the front-line organisation that deals with employers on questions of race relations and discrimination.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> We shall have the opportunity to debate the wider issues relating to section 8 of the 1996 Act in the stand part debate. I shall direct my comments to the amendment.
<P>
Our proposal for a statutory code of practice is intended to re-emphasise to employers their duty to avoid racial discrimination in recruitment practices. The present guidance, though useful for the generality of employers, is not perceived as being sufficiently effective, especially as some employers may be making more checks than required by legislation or making checks on individuals that are not applied to other individuals--that is, discriminating between persons, which is clearly contrary to race relations legislation. Hence the proposal for a statutory code, which will give added force to our efforts to guard against discriminatory practices.
<P>
The provision places the Secretary of State under a statutory duty to issue a code of practice. The Government place great importance on avoiding all forms of racist discrimination. We would not wish to detract from that commitment by removing the statutory duty to issue further guidance to employers. It follows that we cannot support the watering down of the proposal to guard against racial discrimination that is proposed in the amendment.
<P>
It is regrettable that Conservative Members should propose such an amendment, because it would undermine the strength of our commitment to racial equality, which I had hoped they would share. It is important that the Government should ensure that discrimination is tackled. We have looked at how the provisions of section 8 of the 1996 Act operate, and we clearly need to strengthen the current guidance, which is what we now propose.
<P>
If we are serious about tackling racial discrimination, we must do so, not "may" do so. Making it optional, as the Opposition propose, is not to be serious about dealing with it. We clearly have a growing problem, with racketeers breaching section 8 and employers employing persons unlawfully. Those problems must be addressed. However, we must also be serious about ensuring that the way in which those problems are addressed is not itself discriminatory. That is why we want to place a clear 
Parliamentary obligation on the Secretary of State do ensure that a code of practice is in place.
<P>
The present guidance is too weak. We want to be seen to be dealing with the difficulties that have resulted, but it seems that the Opposition do not wish to be serious about tackling the problems of racial discrimination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister was wise to leave certain remarks until later. He appears to be more relaxed now, but I admired the indignation that he was able to summon up about the wicked views of the Conservative party.
<P>
Notwithstanding the Minister's reply, if the Government believe that that provision was a cause of racial discrimination, why did they leave it in place? That is the view that the Government take; it is not my view. I cannot understand it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lock (Wyre Forest) rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B> Mr. Clappison:</B> I think that the hon. Member for Hallam rose first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made an important observation. The fact that the Government believe that a code of practice is necessary is an admission of the fact that section 8 operates in a discriminatory way. As the hon. Gentleman said, the obvious solution would be to repeal it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly reasonable point. The fact that the Government are leaving section 8 in place is an admission that they are wrong about it. Why has their view of section 8 changed? Why was it bad then but good now? Perhaps the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Lock) will tell us.
<P>
