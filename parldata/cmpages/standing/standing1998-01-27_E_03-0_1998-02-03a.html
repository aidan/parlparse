<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we resume debate, I have an announcement for the Committee's convenience. Two groups of amendments are listed in the wrong order on the selection list. The group led by amendment No. 39 should precede the group led by amendment No. 54.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Constitution</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [29 January]: No. 29, in page 1, line 17, at the end to insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1C) At least one member appointed under subsection (i) shall have direct experience in rural matters.'--[Mrs. Ballard.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 9, in page 2, line 4, after `area,' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ca) such persons as appear to him to represent rural interests in the agency's area,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Angela Eagle):</B> Thank you, Dr. Clark. I was not sure whether the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) had finished speaking to the amendment at our last sitting, so I am sorry for hesitating slightly just now.
<P>
Hon. Members made several points when we debated the amendments last Thursday. We are all agreed that getting the board membership of the Regional Development Agencies right will be crucial to their success. We will chose people who are committed to the values of public service and who have experience relevant to the work of the RDAs. I can reassure the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon that all board appointments will be made on merit and will be of high calibre.
<P>
The White Paper stated our intention to avoid a fixed compensation of sectoral interests. We will look for candidates who can bring a range of experience to a board, especially those who combine experience across a number of sectoral interests within a region. We do not intend that board members should be seen as delegates of individual organisations. With 12 members on a board--or 15 as a maximum--that would be impossible.
<P>
However, the White Paper made it clear that RDAs would have a specific remit to serve the rural areas of their regions. Outside London, each RDA board will include at least one member who can contribute a strong rural perspective and there will be more in regions with larger rural areas.
<P>
Amendment No. 29 would place the Secretary of State under a statutory obligation to appoint one member with direct experience in rural matters. I do not think it appropriate to place that requirement in the text of the Bill, not least because it would require the London RDA to have a board member with a strong rural perspective, which is not our intention.
<P>
We should avoid giving the impression that individual board members represent specific sectoral interests. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon commented on how that would have the effect of marginalising those interests. Our White Paper makes it clear that members should not consider themselves to be the delegates of a particular group or body, but should take into account the interests of the whole region.
<P>
The Government's aim is to reflect an appropriate balance of regional interests in the composition of the boards. Many members may have experience in more than one field. Assigning members to particular sectors may shift attention from getting the overall composition of the board right to merely ensuring that the statutory requirements are met. That could result in a lack of experience in areas not provided for in the Bill or the provision of token candidates for particular groups. We do not believe that including a list in the Bill of who ought to be on the board would work well or give the necessary flexibility to make decisions from region to region and across regions.
<P>
I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that we will consider the need for experience in rural matters when we make appointments. I can also assure him that RDA board members will represent the whole of the RDA area, as we have made clear in the White Paper and in debates in the Committee. That will be made clear to candidates and to those appointed. Clause 4(2) specifies that the RDA's purposes apply equally to rural and non-rural areas.
<P>
I asssure the hon. Members for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) and for Cheadle (Mr. Day), who tabled amendment No. 9, that we will consult those representing rural interests about nominations for board membership.
<P>
Subsection (3) offers a general guide to the type of organisations to be consulted. I do not think that it would improve the Bill to attempt to list each and every sector that had an interest in the work of the RDA in order that it be consulted. The only thing that that would ensure is that some sector would be left out. If things are listed in legislation, inevitably some people are left out who believe that they should be included. Ensuring that there is a general duty to consult is a much more flexible way to operate. I hope that hon. Members accept my assurance that we intend to consult as widely as possible before appointments are made.
<P>
During the debate, hon. Members have raised more general anxieties about the protection of rural interests, an issue to which we shall return. We said in our White Paper that local regeneration initiatives of the kind promoted by the Rural Development Commission would be an equally high priority for RDAs and that the Government's strong commitment to rural regeneration would continue to be reflected in the RDAs' funding for rural areas. We intend to make a separate allocation of funds to RDAs for the purposes of rural regeneration. The Bill provides the Government with sufficient powers of direction and control to ensure that RDAs do not neglect rural areas, even though I do not believe that there is any real danger of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): The Under-Secretary said that the Government would make a separate allocation of funds to RDAs for rural regeneration. A significant part of the Rural Development Commission's function will go to the new RDAs. The regeneration programme that is currently under review will be the responsibility of the RDAs. Will she at some stage explain how that regeneration funding will operate? Who will have responsibility for which budgets? How will those people be expected to discharge it? It would be helpful if the Government spelt that out.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I hope that in the debates on a more appropriate clause we shall be able to deal with that. The right hon. Gentleman must remember that, within broad guidelines from national Government, we expect the RDAs to take decisions that are appropriate to their areas. We do not want to be over-prescriptive about how they do their job. We must get the balance right. I hope that we shall return to the matter and have a good debate about it at an appropriate time in our proceedings.
<P>
I hope that Opposition Members will accept my assurances that, outside London, at least one RDA board member will have experience in rural matters and that before making appointments, we will consult those who represent rural interests in the area of the RDA.
<P>
I therefore urge the hon. Member for Taunton (Mrs. Ballard) to withdraw amendment No. 29. The hon. Member for South Suffolk has already signalled his intention to press amendment No. 9.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): My hon. Friend the Member for Taunton told me that she intended to seek leave to withdraw the amendment. Unfortunately, she cannot be with us this morning. I understand that that means that the amendment cannot be withdrawn. However, that was her intention.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I have read the Hansard report on the Committee's previous sitting, which, unfortunately, I missed. I hope that I do not duplicate any points that have already been made.
<P>
I should like to return to the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon about rural representation, which illustrates how difficult it is to provide an assurance on the acute question of rural representation in the future West Midlands RDA. Although the Under-Secretary assured the Committee that one of the board members would have special knowledge of rural interests, I am worried that through statistical representation of 1 in 12, it will be difficult adequately to defend rural interests.
<P>
There is a practical, logistical problem. If the Government tried, through appointments, to reflect democratically rural and urban populations in a board of 12, it is likely that there would be only one member--or one and a half members--to represent the rural population. That would not be the case if the representation were calculated on geographical distribution. The rural population covered by the future West Midlands RDA are worried that their voice will be lost if they are represented by only 1 of 12 members.
<P>
A deprived area in the Solihull borough is currently in receipt of substantial funding from the single regeneration budget. If that area were absorbed by the wider west midlands region--which contains the deprived inner-city areas of Birmingham, Coventry and the surrounding conglomeration--and the single regeneration budget were allocated on a needs basis, a small pocket of deprivation within an otherwise rural area might lose out when it came to voting at board level on where such funds should be allocated. I am worried about how rural interests can be reassured that they will be adequately represented by only 1/12th of the board.
<P>
Each RDA has a different composition in terms of the blend of urban and rural interests. The London region is different again. A rural voice on the London region's board would not be insignificant because, although the countryside is at a further remove, London as a region has an impact on the surrounding rural areas.
<P>
It is important to assure the electorate that the protection of rural interests is being given careful thought. As soon as we take decisions at a regional level, a serious danger exists that small pockets of need and deprivation will be overlooked and subsumed in decision-making by the concerns of the majority of the RDA board's members.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tim Yeo </B>(South Suffolk): I welcome the Under-Secretary's assurance that at least one member of RDA boards outside Greater London will have demonstrable expertise in rural matters, and her helpful assurance that the boards of RDAs that represent the more rural areas will include more than one such member.
<P>
As for the Under-Secretary's reply to the points made in respect of amendment No. 9, I am bewildered by her argument that the Bill should not mention those people who should be consulted about board appointments. Subsection 3(b) and (c) state that the Minister shall consult people who represent employers and employees in the agency's areas. Will the Under-Secretary explain whom she thinks the Secretary of State would regard as representing employers and employees? I fear that we are getting close to the heart of the matter. We are returning to the old corporatist approach whereby the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress are called in for consultations with the Secretary of State, and that will be seen as adequately fulfilling the Bill's commitment.
<P>
In rural areas, neither the Confederation of British Industry nor the Trades Union Congress are immediately or necessarily seen as the only, the most effective, or even the most relevant organisations to be consulted. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection 3 are what make my amendment important. If the Bill includes such references, it must also include references to rural areas. A large number of organisations expressed the view that rural interests should be consulted, and the Government must have regarded those views as important because they quoted them at length in the White Paper. The Under-Secretary has not given any convincing reason for the comprehensive rejection of those organisations' advice in this respect. Will the Minister explain who will be consulted in fulfilment of paragraphs (b) and (c)?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I welcome the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) to the Committee. She inherited a seat that for many years was represented by an hon. Member of whom we all have fond memories, especially on my part because he was my pair. I welcome the hon. Lady to her place and hope that she enjoys the remainder of the Committee's proceedings.
<P>
The hon. Lady seemed to be trying to turn RDAs into democratic legislative bodies instead of executive bodies. They will not be made up of delegates and those who are appointed to serve on them will not be expected to act as delegates--as Members of Parliament are--with sectional interests. We want them to represent the comprehensive interests of their whole area. I do not accept the hon. Lady's assumption that simply because someone comes from a particular area within an RDA he will be unable to represent other areas. I hope that she has been reassured by my comments today on what we shall expect from appointed members.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The other part of what the hon. Member for Meriden said applies more to shadow chambers, which will be larger bodies with a delegate-style function and will check on the activities of the executive part of the RDAs. I suspect that that covers most of the hon. Lady's points. We are aware that we must ensure that RDAs are seen as legitimate and fair in their dealings with the whole area. They will have no future if they seem to give more attention to one area, to the detriment of other areas. It is for the agencies to forge their own legitimacy and to demonstrate that they represent everyone in their area and are trying to create regional economic strategies in everyone's interests. That will be their job when they are up and running and I hope that if they appear to be leaving the straight and narrow, the regional chambers will be snapping at their heels and making the point very strongly to the RDA boards.
<P>
If the hon. Lady has the names of people who would be suitable for nomination to RDA boards, she should let me have them so that they can go into the pot with other names. We are anxious to obtain as much of the available talent as possible for the RDA boards. I look forward to receiving a letter from the hon. Lady with some suggested names of people whom she believes can do the job that the Bill specifies for the executive of the regional agencies.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk seems intent on turning the Bill into a long list of people who should be consulted when decisions are made by the Government on the appointment of RDA boards. As a Minister in the previous Administration, the hon. Gentleman probably stood up in Committee Rooms such as this and, with his usual effectiveness, fended off many an amendment that would have had a similar effect. My reply is similar to what his would have been to me then--that the Government will consult as widely as possible. We do not believe that it is helpful to include in primary legislation an exhaustive list of those who will be consulted, simply because that would restrict the Government and, without such lists, we can consult more widely. It is not appropriate for the Bill to contain lists of who has a right to be consulted because people tend to be left off them. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance, given now for about the third time, that we will consult as widely as possible. I know that he intends to press his amendment to a vote, but I hope that he will accept the assurances that I have given the Committee today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am sorry that we have to pursue this point a little further. The list that the Under-Secretary does not wish to have in the Bill is a list which she herself put in the Bill. It is because the Bill refers to consulting representatives of employers and employees that Opposition Members believe that it is important that the list should be extended. If the list had not been started by the Government, we would not have thought of tabling the amendment.
<P>
To return to my previous point, will the Under-Secretary tell the Committee whom she believes she should consult, in the eastern region for example, to satisfy the requirement to consult representatives of employers and employees?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> There have already been wide-ranging consultations with all regional stakeholders in all the regions. We want to go as wide as possible. We are also asking Members of Parliament to tell us if they know of people who would be willing to serve, and could offer something to RDA boards, especially in RDAs' early periods of development. I do not intend to go into a list of people in the eastern region whom we may or may not consult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give some examples?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The consultations have already taken place with organisations in all regional areas. We do not need to get into lists. I know that it is hard for the hon. Gentleman to demonstrate any trust in the Government, but he must trust my assurances that we will consult the appropriate people in all regions. I ask him to accept that assurance in the open spirit in which it is given, but I shall not stand here reeling off lists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> That is an interesting answer from the Under-Secretary. She cannot name a single organisation which she believes would satisfy the Government's consultation requirements in the Bill. I think that it will be viewed with great interest outside the House that she cannot name a single one.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It is a pity that it has taken this amount of time to get to this level of debate. If the hon. Gentleman wants to look at individual lists, he has only to look at the list of consultees on the principle of the Bill, which he quotes readily in many of his arguments. That would be a pretty good place to start.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> At least we have made a little progress. The sad part is that it is the very people whom I have quoted in relation to the clause and the amendment whose views the Government have so publicly rejected, but we have probably carried the debate as far as it can usefully go this morning.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have been debating amendments Nos. 29 and 9. The formal vote on amendment No. 9 will be taken in its proper place, but we are now considering amendment No. 29. I note the comments of Mr. Breed on behalf of Mrs. Ballard, but we have to go through the formal procedure.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 1, line 17, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(1D) At least one member appointed under subsection (1) shall have direct experience in environmental matters.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 33, in page 2, line 4, after ``area'', insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(ca) such persons as appear to him to represent environmental interests in the agency's area,''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> To some extent, this debate carries on from the previous debate, because we believe that it is important that we are seen to pay proper attention to environmental matters, particularly when RDAs are pursuing their economic development goals. As I am sure members of the Committee are aware, there is continuing tension and conflict between economic activity and environmental concern. Almost all industrial development has an environmental impact, so it is important that environmental interests are properly represented.
<P>
I agree that members should not be specifically delegated to the board and I accept that if there were a long list, there would inevitably be difficulties in blending a board with the right composition. Consultation with employers and employees is important--whatever the Under-Secretary says, that is the beginning of a list of interests, albeit a list of only two--but members of a board could easily represent more than one interest and wear more than one hat. Such members would have experience in more than one area that would be helpful to the board. However, it is important that those interests are made clear, so that members of the public and those who deal with the RDA board know precisely which members represent which interests, including environmental interests. The amendments would ensure that members of the board with appropriate experience represented environmental interests and that organisations that represented those environmental interests were consulted.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The answer is the same as the answer to the previous question, which, on the whole, is the right answer; namely, that it is important that the development agency should be seized of the need to be aware of environmental issues. The trouble is that there are so many environmental organisations and they do not all agree with each other.
<P>
I have been jotting down some of the organisations that might claim to be concerned about the environment. They include the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Country Landowners Association--which has produced remarkably good packages on environmental protection for farmers--English Nature, the Countryside Commission, the Groundwork Trust and--not to forget the cities--the Urban Regeneration Agency; the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the World Wide Fund for Nature, the British Field Sports Society--I hope that that organisation in particular will be consulted, as it is especially concerned with conservation--the Game Conservancy Trust and the Forestry Commission. There are dozens more because more green organisations pop out of the woodwork every minute, so we need to define what we mean by environmental considerations.
<P>
I disagree with the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall. He should not postulate a permanent conflict between the environment and development because one does not exist. One of the main focuses of regeneration work in inner-city areas has been to improve the environment and try to give local people a better environment in the city centre. That has worked remarkably well. In broad terms, one may postulate the conflict between emissions, global warming and development, but on a more local level--I hope that the RDA will get down to the nitty gritty--the two are prerequisites of each other rather than opposites.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will acknowledge that at the heart of the agency's work should be a concern that if its work does not improve the overall environment over time, it will be failing in its task. I hope that the Under-Secretary will ensure that, whether the chairman happens to like them or not, those who are consulted have genuine nous about the environment. I hope that a little common sense will be employed in relation to the agencies because otherwise, we shall be deluged with expertise and advice, but the one thing lacking will be straight political nous. I hope that, in making the appointments, nous will be No. 1 on the list of prerequisites.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Clark </B>(Gillingham): I have every sympathy with the idea behind the amendment, but rather than strengthening the environmental case it would, for one simple reason, weaken it. I would hate to leave environmental issues to one supposed specialist on the RDA. I would prefer the boards to carry out tests whenever they want on any issue that they raise, as local authorities do with decisions that have financial or environmental implications.
<P>
The Bill clearly states that one of the specific objectives of the RDAs will be to further sustainable development. The White Paper makes it clear that RDAs will be expected to work widely and closely in conjunction with local and national agencies, such as Groundwork Trust. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon listed other examples, and described the range of expertise that could easily be embodied in one person serving on the RDA By placing the responsibility on one person, we might weaken some of the options open to RDAs.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I would prefer RDAs to call on expertise in a local area to reflect on local issues. In addition, the RDA may want to establish a strategy group within an area. Although that has been suggested in the White Paper, it might be precluded. The danger is that the amendment would weaken the environmental case, which I am sure hon. Members on both sides of the Committee wholeheartedly support. I am delighted that environmental issues have moved up the political agenda. We have the strength and the wherewithal to push them forward. The RDA as can best do that by consulting as widely as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am in no way discouraged by the Under-Secretary's response to the previous group of amendments. I accept, however, that the arguments advanced in that debate against amendment No. 29, which did not have my support, are relevant to amendment No. 30. Amendment No. 33, raises another important issue. I am sure that when the Government talk about development they really mean sustainable development, which is environmentally sensitive. Consultation with environmental interest groups is central to the achievement of sustainable development.
<P>
I must refer again to the responses to the Government's consultation process, on which I place much emphasis, as I know the Government do. The Minister referred to the consultation process at the beginning of his speech on Second Reading, and has referred to it more than once since we started our proceedings. I share his view of the importance of those responses. However, I do not know whether his conviction is weakening as he is reminded of some of them. Sections of the responses were not included in the White Paper, but I assure him that we shall have plenty of opportunity to explore them, and his claim that respondents were wholeheartedly supportive may be slightly open to question.
<P>
Let us start with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. It boasts more than 1 million members, many of whom, I am glad to say, are resident in my constituency. It was quoted with approval on page 41 of the White Paper. The RSPB said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Among our key recommendations is that RDAs should have an environmental duty, which should be included in the Bill.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We shall have a chance when we discuss clause 4 to see whether that recommendation has been accepted. In its document, the RSPB said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``At least one senior RDA board member, for example the chair or vice-chair, should have an environmental responsibility and expertise.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We also have the benefit of the almost glowing comments of English Nature which, on page 40 of the White Paper, is quoted as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``RDAs provide an unparalleled opportunity to promote the principles of sustainable development at a strategic level''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That view clearly commands the Minister's enthusiastic support. I hope that he will make full use of his unparalleled opportunity.
<P>
However, the Committee should also know what else English Nature had to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``we propose that RDA boards have on them full appointees with environmental expertise and responsibilities from within the Region. As the Government's statutory adviser on nature conservation in England, we look forward to advising the Secretary of State over such appointments.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I, too, look forward to that. I know that the Minister takes English Nature's views seriously. He made that clear during our first sitting, when he proudly cited clause 4 of the Bill as a demonstration of his responsiveness to English Nature's views. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``That shows that we take seriously the results of our consultations. When serious matters are raised we consider them''.--[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 27 January 1998; c. 9.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am glad to have his assurance and hope that it will apply to appointments to the boards in respect of environmental considerations.
<P>
If RDA boards are to have appointees with environmental expertise, my amendment should be acceptable. I realise that the Minister considers rural interests to be sectional in some way. However, I find it hard to see how the Government can seriously argue that environmental interests are sectional, as representatives of those interests have a role to play in both urban and rural areas. If the Government reject my amendment, it will prove that they are determined to ignore the advice of the body that has statutory responsibility for advising them on nature conservation and for promoting wildlife and the natural features of Britain. That would be a serious step, even for this Government.
<P>
The Government already enjoy a growing reputation for ignoring advice. They did so recently in West Sussex where they ignored all three parties on the county council--including Labour--and their own appointed panel of experts. The Minister quoted and approved of English Nature some days ago, so it would be interesting to know whether he will take its advice.
<P>
The Environment Agency was also quoted in the White Paper, on page 23. I shall not read out the quotation, but what the agency said about RDA boards was not included in the White Paper. The agency recommended that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the board should be balanced with members from varying backgrounds and interests, including the Environment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Friends of the Earth--which the Minister has quoted from time to time, though not in the White Paper--said that two places on the RDA boards should be allocated to environmental experts. The CPRE said that it strongly
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``support(s) the amendment''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to clause 2--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which would require the Secretary of State to consult with environmental interests before appointing Board members.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree with that view.
<P>
All that boils down to whether the Government wish to place the environment at the heart of their decision-making process. Perhaps those words were just words, uttered because the spin doctors thought it right to try to appease the green lobby. Perhaps those words did not signify the Government's real intentions. Perhaps they hoped that those words would soon be forgotten.
<P>
Well, here is the Government's chance to prove that their words had any meaning. It is perhaps their first chance during the Bill's proceedings to reflect the commitments made so freely and enthusiastically at the time of Earth summit 2 in New York last June.
<P>
I have one more remark to make on the points made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon. The fact that there are widely diverging views among organisations that represent the environment does not preclude a requirement to consult them. There will be widely diverse views among required-to-be-consulted organisations that represent employers and employees. Indeed, that diversity might make the consultation process more interesting and productive.
<P>
I look forward, therefore, to the Under-Secretary's reply and I hope that on this occasion, given that this amendment cannot possibly be called a sectional amendment, she will be able to accept it.
<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> That was yet another lecture from the hon. Member for South Suffolk about the joys of consultation. It is a pity that when his party was in power for 18 years it did not adopt some of its own lessons about consultation. If the hon. Gentleman is as interested in the basic principle as he suggests, he could have tabled an amendment on it as well--but we are discussing Liberal Democrat amendments. Clearly he did no think the principle important enough to table his own amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I share the view that was expressed, though I am not sure that it has yet been acted on, by the Liberal Democrats on the Committee that we should be constructive in our approach. If I see a Liberal Democrat amendent with which I agree, I shall speak in favour of it and I am prepared to vote in favour of it. It is not a matter of pride as to whose name comes first on the amendment paper. This is a sensible amendment, and I wish to hear the Under-Secretary's answer to it--not some cheap point.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I suppose it takes one to known one. Being admonished by the hon. Gentleman for making cheap points takes the biscuit.
<P>
In my response to the debate I want to re-emphasise some of the points made in the previous debate, which was similar, as many of the hon. Members who have spoken have said: many of the arguments move across. I agreed with what my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Clark) said about how we can best ensure that sustainable development is at the heart of the programmes for economic development that the RDAs will be asked to take forward.
<P>
As my hon. Friend said, we believe that we should place regional development and sustainable development together at the core of the RDAs' work. Like the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, I did not share the pessimistic view of the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall of the way in which development interacts with sustainability. I believe that we are approaching an era when they are not as mutually exclusive as he thinks. In many areas the interests of those seeking to develop industrially or in other ways coincide, making econmic sense as well as environmental sense, with the interests of those who are trying to achieve more sustainable ways of production or of living. I am not such a pessimist as the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall in that regard.
<P>
Because of the way in which things are changing now, especially after Kyoto and the follow-ups to the Rio earth summit, I would have added, perhaps surprisingly, to the lists of environmental organisations suggested by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon. Large companes are increasingly recognising the desirability of moving their businesses forward on a much more sustainable basis, not only because there may be regulations in future but because the realise that it is in their own economic interests to behave in that way. There is beginning to be more of a consensus than the remarks of the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall would suggest.
<P>
The points on this amendment are similar to those on previous amendments. The Government believe that it is more robust to place sustainable development at the heart of all programmes than to have it as an extra box at the side that everyone must think about perfunctorily. We hope that the provisions in the Bill will integrate development more seriously. I certainly want to give the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall some assurances about the importance that the Government attach to sustainability. We do not believe that in the coming century there can be reasonable economic development if sustainability is not at its heart. We want all members of all the RDA boards to think in that way. We do not want just one or two members to remind others and to nag from the side.
<P>
Listing the sectors from which members may be drawn would take us into the lists and numbers game again and create less flexibility in appointments. I hope that my arguments for not putting those requirements in the Bill, and my assurance that those factors will be taken into account and are central to what we hope to achieve with the change, will satisfy the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall and persuade him to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
The Government's aim is to reflect an appropriate balance of regional interests on the boards. It will be for Ministers to make the appointments when they have consulted widely. We come back to the point that there will be widespread consultation, especially on the subject raised by the hon. Member for South Suffolk concerning the RSPB, English Nature, the environment agency and other people who responded to initial consultations on the Bill. We want them to provide names of people, including experts, whom they want us to consider for appointment to the boards. We hope that they will do so.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
English Nature is our statutory advisor in some matters, but we do not always and everywhere agree with its views on how legislation should be changed. We have listened, we have given assurances that we shall consult and we want the names of people whom such organisations may want to be considered for appointment. If we do not agree with the amendment to primary legislation that English Nature may want to pursue, that does not mean that we are not listening or not treating it with the respect that it deserves. With the assurances that I have given today, I hope that the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am disappointed by the Under-Secretary's response. There is a distinction between amendment No. 33 and amendment No. 9 in the previous group--I shall press amendment No. 9 to a vote at the appropriate time. From what the Government have said, many people might have concluded that the environment would be given particular consideration in the making of decisions. The Under-Secretary has not explained why, if representatives of employers and of employees are so important that they should be named in the Bill as people who must be consulted, representatives of environmental interests should not be included in the same way.
<P>
The only conclusion that an outside observer could draw is that the Government, for all their rhetoric, believe that employers and employees deserve priority consideration over the environment. That is an interesting conclusion and the only one that can be drawn. I am sorry about that because I had believed that there was some substance to the Government's rhetoric around the time of the New York summit in June and on other occasions. They have blown the lid off that today. Will the Under-Secretary explain why employers' and employees' representatives have been referred to in the Bill but no such reference is to be made to representatives of environmental interests?
<P>
<B>Mr Curry:</B> I am intrigued by what the Under-Secretary said, and I want to explore some of the practicalities. If what she said is true, she will be surrounded by a mountain of application forms, as will the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning. Everyone--including Members of Parliament--is being invited to put forward names. I have a short list and I shall let the Minister share it. How will those applications be sifted through to make selections? The Minister is not going to sit down and read every application form. He might think that he is, but he is not, and there is no point pretending that he is. There are far too many other things to do in the day. Will he ask his civil servants to do it? Will his civil servants in London make recommendations, or will that job go to the regional office? My suspicion is that regional offices will do the sift and will send him a bundle of papers with their recommendations.
<P>
What information will the Minister require? With whom will he check applicants? Will there be referees, seconders and proposers? What will he look for? He says that he wants people with expertise across a range of subjects. How will he ensure that they are good at something rather than have general knowledge of lots of things but no expertise? The Minister may well have to run names past a Cabinet Committee. The Prime Minister is usually consulted on major appointments. When we get to the day when the Minister announces his choices, what will happen? Will he spell out the trail of what happens up the point when someone, hey presto and hallelujah, becomes chairman?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> On the comments of the hon. Member for South Suffolk, I cannot agree with his view that we must behave in a certain way or all our commitments to the environment, to Kyoto and to the entire process after the Earth summit is somehow null and void, just because we have not agreed to an amendment that he likes. The hon. Gentleman should regain his sense of proportion and stop arguing by reductio ad absurdum. My only response is that we will consult. Environment is at the heart of the RDAs. Economic development increasingly needs to be sustainable if it is to last. It must be sustainable if this country is to meet the commitments that it signed up to in Kyoto. The Government are looking at how best, in concert with our European partners, we can meet European Union commitments made at Kyoto. That is the fact of the matter and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept it.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, with his experience of government, has some idea of how appointments are made. I suspect that he made rather a lot of them when he was a Minister. Appointments will certainly be made in accordance with requirements stipulated by the Nolan committee on standards in public life. Candidates will go through the usual processes. Appointments will be open and based on merit. Clearly, we must decide how to sift through applications and deal with appointments. Notice will obviously be taken of what regional offices and those in the regions say about appropriate candidates, but it will be for my right hon. Friend the Minister to demonstrate the wisdom of Solomon in making the appointments when the time comes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I was interested by the words used by the Under-Secretary at the beginning of her response. She seemed to suggest that the Bill falls outside the Government's requirement to fulfil their commitments made at Kyoto and elsewhere, and that somehow the Bill does not matter because we can sneak it through. People will study the Bill, in particular those matters debated in detail by the Committee, where amendments to improve it were rejected by the Government. They will see what signals those clauses send. They will also see the message that Ministers are conveying.
<P>
The Government cannot pick and choose. They cannot say, ``Well, we'll reflect our commitments in this bit of legislation but not in that bit.'' It is clear that they believe that employers and employees have priority and that the environment has a lower priority. This is all that I wanted to establish.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The Bill states that the environment and sustainable development are among the core reasons for establishing RDAs. Anyone who reads the proceedings of our Committee will note that the amendments tabled by the hon. Gentleman and others would change the Bill, and that I have given assurances on how the Government will proceed.
<P>
It is not always appropriate to include matters that are more administrative in nature in primary legislation. I assure the Committee that the Government will put sustainable development at the core of RDA activities. We shall, for the first time, combine economic development with sustainability. That did not happen when the Welsh and Scottish Development Agencies were created because the crucial importance to economic planning of sustainable development had not then been realised. We have realised it now, and I assure the Committee that we will take it into account. I am sorry that the hon. Member for South Suffolk cannot find it in his heart to accept my assurances.
<P>
We do not want to include matters in primary legislation that do not fit there. We are dealing with the spirit of the amendment in a more flexible way. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham said, sustainable development will be an integral part of all RDA decision making. Sustainable development and environmental protection will be at the heart of the RDAs' activities.
<P>
I cannot give the hon. Member for South Suffolk any more assurances. If he cannot accept what I have said, I am sorry, but the Government are dealing with an extremely important issue in the most appropriate way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I hope that the hon. Lady made a slip of the tongue when she said that it was not appropriate to include in primary legislation matters that are ``more administrative in nature''. Hansard will confirm that she used that phrase. I do not believe that even she would argue that the environment was some kind of administrative inconvenience too detailed to be included in the Bill. Did she mean to categorise the environment as merely administrative?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I suggest that the hon. Gentleman reads clause 4.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We are not debating clause 4. I have tabled amendments to clause 4 to make clear my view that it is seriously defective. Many of the assurances that the Minister has offered during the past half hour will be used again when we debate that clause. Once again I ask her to say whether she regards the environment as an administrative matter. Was that a slip of the tongue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I am sorry that some hon. Members feel that my approach to the potential conflict between economic and environmental matters is slightly pessimistic. I strongly support sustainable development, which must be our long-term goal.
<P>
I am usually considered to be one of life's optimists, but I am perhaps a realist on this matter. From day one, the first decision taken by an RDA will, whether it is on rural or urban issue--even if it goes in favour of sustainable development--give rise to a potential conflict between environmental and economic matters. I would be delighted if economic and environmental considerations could be brought together to benefit everyone. However, in the real world--at least after April 1999--some decisions will result in compromise.
<P>
The Under-Secretary has argued that sustainable development and the environment lie at the heart of the work of the RDAs. It would be invidious to expect one specific board member to have direct experience in those areas; it would be better to have a number of members with such experience. For that reason, I shall seek leave to withdraw amendment No. 30.
<P>
However, I am not persuaded that employers and employees have priority over those who represent environmental issues, as the hon. Member for South Suffolk suggested. As Opposition Members have said several times, a list has been started and is evidence that some interests take priority over others. If we are to strike a balance between economic and environmental matters, the Bill must demonstrate that the interests of those connected with economic developments--in the true sense of being employed or employing people--are balanced by those with environmental interests and knowledge. It is not unreasonable to include that specific interest in the Bill. I therefore intend to press amendment No. 33 to a vote, but in relation to amendment No. 30, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Under clause 2(4), the chairman and deputy chairman of the RDA are to be appointed by the Secretary of State. Under amendment No. 34, the chairman and deputy chairman would be appointed by the Secretary of State only after the approval of the majority of the board. The reason behind the amendment is that the chairman and deputy chairman should have the full confidence of other members of the board in discharging their duties. The Minister might say that that is only reasonable and will be taken into account. It would be as well, however, to clarify the matter.
<P>
Amendment No. 35 allows for a situation in which the approval of a majority of the board cannot be obtained. In such circumstances, the member receiving the most support from other members of the board would become the chairman, and the member receiving the next greatest support would become the deputy chairman.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 36 and 37 allow for a vote of no confidence from the board to remove the chairman or his deputy. That reflects the need to ensure that the chairman and deputy chairman of the board have the full confidence of other members of the board in discharging their duties. The chairman and deputy chairman will inevitably represent the whole of the board on a considerable number of important issues, which makes it vital that they have the full support of the board's membership.
<P>
The Bill allows the chairman not to have the confidence of the board. The board could do nothing to remove him or her unless such a provision was written into the terms of his appointment. The Bill allows for the chairman to be removed by the Secretary of State only under conditions specified in paragraph (1)(3) of schedule 2, which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State may remove a member of a regional development agency from that office if he is satisfied . . . that the member is unable or unfit to carry out the functions of a member.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendments are designed to prevent any deadlock and to promote real accountability for the board. They would also create a greater degree of collective responsibility.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning (Mr. Richard Caborn):</B> I thank the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall for moving the amendment, which gives a clear indication of how we intend the boards to operate. In relation to the last debate, and the point made by the hon. Member for South Suffolk about the environment, no one can question the Government's credibility on the environment during the nine months that we have been in power. Many people say that the Deputy Prime Minister's role in securing the agreement at Kyoto was, and I hope that that goes on the record.
<P>
The amendments taken together effectively take the choice of board chairman and deputy chairman away from the Secretary of State and would require the board to appoint its own chairman and deputy on the basis of a majority vote.
<P>
I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendments. Our intention was to put the chairmen and deputies in place quickly--indeed, the adverts have already been sent out--and we hope that they will be in place towards the third quarter of this year to ensure that they can also be consulted when the other members of the board are appointed. As RDAs are non-departmental public bodies, it is right and proper that the Secretary of State appoints the chairperson. The process of appointing--
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister has mentioned the urgency of the timetable for appointing the chairman and the deputy chairman. Will he assure the Committee that the wide consultation, to which the Under-Secretary referred in answer to previous debates, will take place not only with employers and employees, but among other organisations, especially in regions that have substantial rural areas, before the first appointments are made?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Absolutely. If such organisations want to propose nominations to the Department or through the government regional office, I am more than willing to accept, and to give serious consideration to them. I have made it clear that I was very worried about how the previous Administration had arrived at some of the lists presented to Ministers. This Government will not accept such a narrow base. We are undertaking a rigorous appraisal of procedures and of how Ministers arrive at a shortlist. The previous Administration was remiss.
<P>
I invite those who believe that they can propose nominees for the chairperson, his deputy or other board members to do so. Subject to the criteria in the White Paper, we are more than willing to give serious consideration to such nominations.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon asked about procedures. We shall use the normal procedures for that evaluation, through government regional offices and wider consultation. It is in the Government's interests to ensure that we find the best people and that members of the board command the repect of their peer groups in the regions, whether they are chairpeople or not. Without that, consensus and partnerships cannot emerge. It would be ridiculous to have turf wars--or wars of any kind--within the boards.
<P>
It is therefore ludicrous to suggest the approach that the hon. Member for South Suffolk has. Indeed, I am starting to wish that I had never advised the inclusion in the White Paper of what we thought were illuminating clippings from the consultation: they comprise 75 per cent. of the contributions made by the hon. Member for South Suffolk. They have evidently guided him in the Committee's progress--or lack thereof.
<P>
The process of making appointments that is suggested in the amendments takes us back to the jobs-for-the-boys, smoke-filled-rooms approach of yesteryear. I am sure that the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall does not advocate such a process. Such a process no longer occurs. Following wide consultation and as a result of the Government's desire to find the best people to do the job that is outlined in the White Paper, candidates will ultimately have to endure the normal procedure anyway. I hope that that will provide safeguards, not only in this case, but for other appointments.
<P>
I assure those Liberal Democrats who are worried that the Secretary of State will impose a chairman on board members that we are looking for people of the highest standard in their field, with a proven track record of success and with sound leadership skills. Indeed, one consequence of the amendments will be to remove one of the major incentives of the Secretary of State to attract high-calibre people to the chair, because he will not be able to guarantee them the post. The appointments process that we advocate in the Bill will take full account of guidance issued by the commissioner for public appointments, which incorporates the recommendations of the Nolan committee.
<P>
There are several practical problems with the procedure suggested in the amendments. What would happen if the board did not approve of the Secretary of State's proposed nomination for chairman? There might be a rather odd situation, in which board members decide their own leader, with a rather sorry member designated chairman by the Secretary of State, but rejected by his or her colleagues. What would happen if two members received the same number of votes? Would they have fight it out, with pistols drawn, 10 paces apart, to see who wins?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Toss a coin?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Indeed.
<P>
There is a problem in that, as with other NDPBs, the chairman may be contracted to give a greater time commitment than the other members. That would be awkward if the board chose its own chairman, who might not expect to work longer hours.
<P>
This is a recipe for divisiveness, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not intend that. Factions could be created within a board if some of its members had not voted for the chairman or the deputy. All of us in political parties know about that. That could lead to instability and jealousy. It certainly would not be conducive to an effective and efficient operation. In addition, that would happen at a time when the RDAs need stability as they set about the task of reversing decline in their regions.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I accept that the chairman and deputy chairman need the support of other members of the board, but the cumbersome voting procedure suggested by the amendment is not the way to achieve that. The chairman will gain the support of members of the board by doing a good job and involving all members in the agency's activity by using the board's broad base of knowledge. To have the support of some, but not all, board members could make that task more arduous. For those reasons, I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister has insisted several times that appointments will be made on merit. It would, for example, be possible to have a board composed entirely of middle-aged white ladies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> With a blue rinse?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Their hairstyles are a matter of indifference to me. The knowledge that they have below their hairstyles is more important.
<P>
I am anxious that the Minister may set up boards that contain all the great and good of a region. The way he is talking, we will end up with a sort of commercial House of Lords, all aged about 93 if they are to have all the experience and concern for their peer groups that he keeps on about. I hope that the boards will contain one or two young people with a bit of oomph. I hope that we do not end up with some marvellous set of establishment figures lining up for their knighthoods. If we do, we will not get much initiative out of the boards.
<P>
A lot of talent is available among people who have some track record. However, errors of appointment were sometimes made in the urban development corporations. Too often, the old commercial leaders of a city were appointed when we could have done with younger people from the industrial sector who are more geared to modern technology. The Minister should take account of that.
<P>
Many people are heavily involved in regeneration partnerships. They have learnt the skill of dealing with people from different sections of the community. In drawing up shortlists, the Minister should remember that people with that sort of background have served an extremely useful apprenticeship. The RDAs are essentially a large version of the regeneration partnerships.
<P>
Can the Minister assure us that the boards need not be so eminently respectable that they will not deliver much? Will he look for a mix of ages, backgrounds and ideas? If the boards cannot have arguments, they will not do their job. Will he ensure that people who bring different sorts of baggage to the board will be able to sit down and hammer out differences? That is how we will get results.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I welcome those constructive remarks and the right hon. Gentleman's self-criticism of the Administration in which he was a very good Minister. I congratulate him, too, on getting into tune with the Opposition. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition championed the countryside yesterday and I must commend the right hon. Gentleman's tie, which is covered in pigs. Is that part of the Opposition uniform now? Do they have to wear something green or to symbolise the countryside, such as a tie with pigs on?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister may be aware that the National Farmers Union annual general meeting takes place today and tomorrow and he is no doubt aware of the crisis in the intensive livestock sector. It may be that our only memory of pigs--except for those that escape--will be the ones we wear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We will take those remarks with the joviality with which they were made. I suppose that the new NFU tie will show pigs that fly in the night.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right: we do not want only the great and the good on the boards; membership must be balanced. I have been extremely impressed by some of the young people who have been seconded to the regional offices of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, especially from the utilities. They are very bright people, who do a tremendous job in Government regional offices. It is all those qualities that we want to factor into appointments to the board, but it does not end there; we shall be looking for a dynamic approach from those who are employed by or seconded to the board. Only the other day, I was talking to Sir Richard Greenbury, and I have recently spoken to other people from the utilities and asked whether they would consider putting some of their younger people, potential high-flyers, into seconded positions within the regional development agencies.
<P>
What the structures will be and how to address the structural weaknesses of the competitive and wealth-creating base in each region will be a job for the RDAs, but I hope that they will accept the need to use seconded people who will bring a certain freshness to the organisation and ensure that we can cross-fertilise the cultures of the private and public sectors to get the very best out of the agencies. If the right hon. Gentleman knows of people in Yorkshire and Humberside with oomph, as I believe he described them, then we look forward to seeing a list of nominees with oomph.

The Secretary of State will make the initial appointments, but will those who are designated to be chairman and deputy chairman be involved in the future selection of board members? If they are, we could end up with the same faces and the same collection of the great and good that we have seen in other spheres, as the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon said. Is there not at least a chance that other members could be selected on the basis of their reputation or by being known to the chairman and deputy chairman to ensure that there is a cohesive team? We might end up with twelve Spillers flourmen, all looking the same and saying the same thing.
<P>
Will members appointed to the board have to indicate that they support the two people who have already been appointed? If that is the case, we could exclude valuable and experienced voices that may not always agree. It is often the dynamic of debate that produces the best results. To use a cricket analogy, the captain is often selected before the team, but the captain is not necessarily able to play to the best of his ability while he is also captain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> And the pitch may be difficult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Yes, the pitch may be very difficult, and the other players may not support all that the captain attempts to do.
<P>
It is extremely important that the board represent a wide range of interests and is dynamic. Will the Minister explain whether it is his intention that the chairman and deputy chairman should be involved in the further selection of members, or are they to be put to one side and the other appointments made in isolation? That would ensure a broad representation and diversity of opinion on the board, which would give it a dynamic approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Absolutely, but it would be ludicrous to appoint a chairperson and a deputy chairperson to the RDAs and not to consult them on the rest of the board. Board members will be appointed from a wide range of interests. It will be fine for people to make nominations. Board members will be the first major appointments to be made under Nolan to a new and significant organisation. Capable people have served on the boards of the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, which have tried to put together teams.
<P>
The problems of addressing our requirements in the White Paper will vary from region to region because regions differ. It is extremely important to get responsiveness into the appointments process. It is in our interests to ensure that board members work as a team, command the widest possible respect of people within the regions, develop a partnership on a bottom up process--there will be no imposition from the centre--and, indeed, deliver the agenda laid out in the White Paper which is incorporated in the Bill.
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall that we will consult widely. We will try to put together the best teams in the best possible way so that we can deliver what is in the White Paper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his assurance. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call Mr. Yeo, may I point out that I have the power to prevent further debate on clause 2 because it has been adequately debated? Although I shall not exercise that power, I hope that the Committee might respect my decision by keeping speeches short.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I want to raise a matter that has not been covered. I am disappointed--I think that people outside the Committee will also be disappointed--that the Government have not accepted any amendments. They were tabled in a constructive spirit designed to improve the Bill. We have not rejected the principles of RDAs. We intend not to weaken RDAs but to strengthen them by ensuring that the boards, which are crucial to their ultimate success, are appointed in the best possible way.
<P>
I have searched almost in vain for any hint from the Government that they are sympathetic or even willing to acknowledge the concerns on which the amendments are based. The real reason for their attitude lies in the principle behind clause 2. Indeed, that principle underlies much of the Bill and we shall have to return to it in later debates.
<P>
The Bill is not about giving power to the regions. It is not about decentralising, as the Government have claimed. Clause 2, like many others in the Bill, will give more power to the Secretary of State. The Government are aggregating power at the centre; it is ``Whitehall knows best''. As we examine the Bill, the Committee will find time and again that the Secretary of State's roles and powers are being statutorily enhanced.
<P>
I believe that members of the Committee will have it on their conscience for years, indeed for ever, if they do not attempt to make fundamental changes to the Bill. They will have on their conscience the fact that they were party to one of the greatest extensions of central power ever undertaken in statute. Amazingly, it has been supported by the claim that it is a decentralising measure, but that is a smokescreen. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will reflect on that matter and listen to the views of local authorities and other bodies.
<P>
I recognise that other Committee members are more convinced than I am about the merits of the universal imposition of RDAs. Surely those Committee members who are convinced about the potential contribution of RDAs should also seek to maximise their chances of success. One way to do so is to allow RDAs to act in some ways independently of central Government--to allow them to do things that have not been dictated to them in their entirety by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
On board appointments, which are dealt with in clause 2, the Minister steadfastly refused to envisage any extension of the consultation process that is required before an appointment. I can only conclude, sadly, that he refused to do so because the Secretary of State's power to appoint whomever he chooses to a board must remain as unfettered as possible. The bodies that are designed to remove powers from democratically elected local authorities should be subject to more checks and balances than the Bill provides.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cabon:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman tell me which of the Bill's proposals will remove powers from local authorities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I wish to remain in order, but the clauses relating to planning will remove local authorities' planning role, which is very important. My concern about that matter has been enormously enhanced over the past few weeks, because the Secretary of State has overruled the three political parties on West Sussex county council. Those parties were in agreement, and their view was examined by an independent panel of experts who were appointed for that purpose. I am glad to say that the decision is now being challenged in the courts. We shall in due course discuss clauses that mean that the Secretary of State will not suffer the inconvenience of being told by his colleagues on a county council that he is wrong--they will not have the power to do so.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. You said, Mr. Yeo, that we shall discuss various clauses in due course. It is in order for us to debate clause 2, but it is not in order to discuss what we might discuss later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I agree entirely, Dr. Clark. The Opposition have typically deployed scaremongering and smokescreens. The hon. Gentleman talked about removing powers from local authorities and the powers of English Partnerships and he moved on to regional planning conferences in West Sussex. The way that he moved across the spectrum was very good--but get the tanks off my lawn, for goodness' sake. Our discussion should be about taking powers from local authorities, but the hon. Member for South Suffolk did not discuss that at all. He discussed the powers that a Conservative Administration gave to English Partnerships and he moved on to discuss regional planning conferences, which are of absolutely no relevance to the Bill. The hon. Gentleman read from a text that was prepared before he had heard our response, and he said that the Bill will take powers from local authorities. Which powers will be taken from local authorities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful, Dr. Clark, for your guidance on the importance of remaining in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Wonderful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> If you examine the record, Dr. Clark, you will see that my reference to later clauses was necessitated entirely by the Minister's challenge to me to give examples of where the Bill removed powers. I do not want to pursue the matter now because I shall have an opportunity of doing so later in our proceedings.
<P>
My concern is that, because of those later clauses, the procedure for appointing the boards, which will exercise the powers removed from local authorities, becomes extremely important. Everything that has been said and many things that have been done recently greatly reinforce my concern, and it has been further reinforced during the past few minutes. At this stage, I merely wish to register that concern.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that the method of appointment of RDA boards reflects the overall philosophy behind the Bill, which is a centralising measure that will reduce democratic accountability?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We have heard some claptrap, but the way in which this stand part debate--
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Deal with the points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I shall deal with all the points, from those about local authorities to those on the powers of English Partnerships and regional planning conferences in west Sussex. We have given an absolute commitment that we will consult widely with partners in the regions before any appointments are made, including those of chairmen, deputy chairmen and members of the board. We have a very good record on that. The Scottish Development Agency and the Welsh Development Agency were put on the statute book back in 1975 by a Labour Government. They have stood the test of time and the Administrations of which the hon. Gentleman has been a member have made nominations to those boards. We are taking forward a similar practice of consultation, but in a wider context.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk says that we are centralising powers, but after 18 years of Tory rule we have more centralised powers than any other country in western Europe. The Tories removed powers from local authorities, trade unions, democratically elected organisations, the Church and so on. They have centralised powers as no other country in western Europe has done. They are now lecturing us when we are genuinely trying to devolve powers.
<P>
I made it clear when we started our consideration of the Bill that it was part of a transition to modernisation of the constitution and the way in which we governed ourselves in the United Kingdom. The steps taken by the Government, including referendums in Scotland and Wales, a referendum in London in the first week of May, and the setting up of regional development agencies to consult with regional chambers, represent a move towards devolution. As we stated in our 1 May manifesto, we want devolution. We will manage the transition for England and give the people of the English regions the right to determine whether they want directly elected regional assemblies. We said that in our manifesto; it was overwhelmingly endorsed, and this is part of that transition. To interpret that as an attempt at greater centralisation is as far from the facts as it is possible to get.
<P>
I again give a clear undertaking that we shall consult as widely as possible on the appointment of the chairman, deputy chairman and board members to ensure that they operate the agenda that we set out in the White Paper.

<P>

<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I am disappointed that the Minister has been unable to support any of our amendments to clause 2. He has said on a number of occasions that the purpose of the RDAs is to address the economic deficit in some parts of the country. To do so, they must consider how they organise themselves. The Liberal Democrats support the principle of regional development agencies, but believe that such agencies should be demonstrably and clearly democratic in the way in which they organise themselves. They must be accountable to different interests at all stages of their operation, and must be as open as possible to ensure the participation in the appointments that the Minister has said he wants.
<P>
It is disappointing that none of our amendments has found favour, but, nevertheless, we support clause 2.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Constitution of agencies</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 24, line 12, after `(1)', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `Subject to subparagraph (1A) below'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 17, in page 24, line 14, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) No regional development agency shall make payments under this paragraph which exceed &#163;200,000 in any one calendar year.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 18, in page 24, leave out lines 15 to 26.
<P>
No. 19, in page 24, leave out lines 27 to 31.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We have not had to wait long for another provision--a schedule in this case--that gives huge and unfettered powers to the Secretary of State. Paragraph 3 of schedule 2 allows the Secretary of State to pay whatever salary he chooses to members of the regional development agencies. It allows him to pay whatever expenses he chooses, with no limit, to members of RDAs. It allows him to pay whatever pensions he chooses to former members of RDAs. It allows him to make, again with no limit, whatever pay-offs he thinks fit when he decides that a board member's services are no longer required. Those unfettered powers will be in the hands of the Secretary of State.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 17 is to impose a ceiling on the potentially unlimited cost to the taxpayer. In the spirit of reasonableness that informs my approach to all our debates in the Committee, I have deliberately set quite a high financial ceiling in my amendment. A ceiling of &#163;200,000 would allow even a board with the maximum of 15 members to be paid generously. For example, it would allow the Secretary of State to pay the chairman &#163;25,000 and other board members &#163;12,500.
<P>
You will not be surprised, Dr. Clark, that this is a probing amendment. I am willing not to press it to a Division if the Minister will assure me that pay will remain within the range specified in my amendment. Clause 2 has been accepted and allows the Secretary of State to give the posts to whomever he chooses, regardless of the wishes of outside interests, which may or may not have an opportunity to give their views, and, if given, may or may not be heeded. Against that background, it is all the more important to impose some limit on the amount of pay, pension and pay-offs that can be given.
<P>
I am not sure whether the amendment would prevent members of the RDAs, if they were so determined, from dipping their hands into the public purse. There have been plenty of recent examples of how that can be done by members of the new Government, but, unless provoked, I shall not list them. Happily, the opportunity to choose new wallpaper may not be extended to members of RDA boards.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 were tabled because members of RDA boards will be non-executives; they will be in some respects analogous to non-executive members of the board of a plc. I am not sure that it is appropriate for people in such a non-executive role to receive pensions at the taxpayer's expense. After all, there is nothing to prevent them from making their own pension contributions out of the payments that will be made to them, quite properly, as board members. I should perhaps say that there is nothing at the moment to prevent them from doing so. Given that in the Government's only Budget so far the tax position of pensions was severely hit by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, by the time that the Bill has passed into law, the opportunity to make pension contributions tax-efficiently may have been removed. For the time being, however, that opportunity exists.
<P>
I shall therefore be interested to hear the Minister tell us what the Government have in mind about paying pensions to members of RDA boards. Perhaps he could give us some clues about the precedents that the Government intend to follow. What other quango board members receive pensions that are paid for by the taxpayer? Are the Government considering paying pensions to former members of other quango boards who are not currently receiving them?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
What about board members who leave office? The Secretary of State apparently wants to have the power to compensate them. Under what circumstances does the Minister envisage that power being used? When a Minister decides that he does not like the view expressed by an RDA board member, will that member be sacked? Will the taxpayer then have to pay the cost of compensation? I realise that there is a recent precedent for such behaviour in the Foreign Office, but I had not realised that the intention was to extend it to RDAs.
<P>
As it stands, the clause creates the opportunity for a gravy train. There is no limit on salary; there is the possibility of pensions and the chance of a pay-off. I should think that there will be plenty of nominations for board members against such a background. Is it now Government policy to consider that people who are in a non-executive role should be eligible for compensation of this kind?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> My hon. Friend has raised an important issue, The White Paper merely states that people will be paid, and that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the rate of pay will reflect what is required of board members in terms of the nature of the job and the time commitment required.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We know that to be the leader of a major local authority is now a full-time job, to all intents and purposes. Indeed, it is an enormous time commitment. It seems that the board will have so much power and authority that the chairman's role will have to be quite hands-on. It is all very well to say that the chief executive will do most of the day-to-day work, but the chairman will have to be confident that he is keeping an eye on a wide range of activities. Therefore, it is fair to ask what sort of salaries would be appropriate--a word with which the Minister is familiar--to the functions of the RDAs.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk has been too modest. The Minister has talked about wanting dynamic top people. He ain't going to get that for &#163;25,000 a year. They will want more than that. He will also know that business has produced guidance on the level of non-executive salaries and what is appropriate in the business community. There is a range of ideas about the right salary for such a position. It is reasonable for the Committee to probe what the Minister thinks is the right sort of ball-park figure.
<P>
Moreover, we are looking for people of high calibre. Presumably, board members who are local authority representatives will expect the same remuneration as others, even though they may be heavily engaged in their local government business, as will business representatives be in their businesses. I am anxious to know what we are talking about in terms of salaries. The Minister has invited me to make some nominations. If I approach people about nominations, the first question that they will ask is ``What sort of commitment is it, what does it involve and what is the money?''. It is like those occasions when I talk to schools on the rather boring subject of a day in the life of a Member of Parliament; the first question asked is, ``How much are you paid?''. It is an important point. Will the Minister tell us what range of payments would be necessary to attract the talent that he wants? Does he intend to relate those payments to any scale--for example those that have been established in the private sector? Does he have an objective hook for his proposals or will it just be the price that is necessary to get a particular person to do the job?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The hon. Member for South Suffolk has a vivid imagination. His interpretation of the amendments is wonderful. He brings a new dimension to them. I should like to give him some careers guidance. He would be far better at writing books, like Lord Archer, than at being a shadow Minister and trying to take the mantle of Lord Tebbit--the polecat of the Commons--although I regret to say that he does not have the finesse of Lord Tebbit. He should deploy his skills in writing books, which I am sure that he would find more financially rewarding. His imaginative remarks bear no resemblance to the truth; they are pure fiction.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 would put an arbitrary limit of &#163;200,000 per year on the amount that RDA board members can be paid. It is not clear whether the limits proposed in the amendment would be on individual members or on the whole board. The amendment would restrict the ability of the Secretary of State to pay what he believed to be the appropriate rate for the job. The responses to the consultation supported the need to pay board members so that we could appoint people of the highest quality. The Government therefore propose that all board members should be paid, as a first principle. We have not yet taken decisions on the remuneration rates for board members. However, we believe that the rates should reflect what is required of board members in terms of the nature of the job and of the time commitment. Remuneration will be in line with payments made for service on similar bodies. Hon. Members have been involved in making appointments to such bodies for a considerable time and have tremendous experience in doing so.
<P>
As honourable Members know, it is not usual to set limits in the way proposed in the amendment. In addition, the amendment--which is not well drafted--fails to include provision for alterations; in five, 10 or 20 years' time the Government would have to resort to primary legislation to increase salaries. Opposition Members might have been trying to lull us into a false sense of security through these proposals, but we have rumbled them.
<P>
Amendment No. 18 would prevent board members from being paid pensions. Pensions are part of a standard remuneration package--as I am sure that Conservative Members will know, as they must have given out hundreds, if not thousands, of such packages in the past 18 years. Those are standard provisions, which were set by the previous Administration.
<P>
Amendment No. 19 would seek to prevent the payment of compensation to members. The Bill states that such compensation would be paid only in special circumstances, and again that is a standard provision.
<P>
The provisions relating to remuneration, pensions and compensation in paragraph 3 of schedule 2 are nothing new. They are standard provisions and are included in most legislation to set up NDPBs. I was asked to give broad guidance; my guidance is that those NDPBs include English Partnerships, Scottish Enterprise and the Welsh Development Agency, all of which have proved flexible in their payments to board members. I am sure that Conservative Members have more experience in such matters than we do, as they made many appointments to such boards, until there was some disturbance in the House and we had to bring in the Nolan Committee. Nolan gave us a clearer framework than previously. We shall make appointments based on the status quo. Standards were set by the previous Administration and were to some extent clarified by Nolan. We shall work to them.
<P>
It is difficult to say much about the remuneration of chairmen. I have been strongly counselled that, if the time that people have to spend on the boards is a burden, one restricts the number of people from whom one can select. We want the top people on them, and I have accepted the advice given to me. Chairmen may have to serve on the boards for one day a week, and no more. They will not be able to give any more time because of their other activities.
<P>
We have yet to strike a balance, but we shall. I am sure that Conservative Members know how that can be done, and they will tell me how they did it over the past 18 years.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I suppose that I should draw some comfort from the Minister's reply. Earlier, he berated what he termed the centralising actions of the previous Government; now he is saying that provisions in the Bill are okay because similar ones appeared in the previous Government's legislation. Suddenly, what we did has become a justification for the Minister's proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> May I make it clear that we are taking past practices that have been drawn together by Lord Nolan? The procedures that we shall introduce are those laid down by Lord Nolan. They were accepted by the whole House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister also took refuge in the oldest of all arguments against Opposition amendments. He said that the drafting was defective. I would be happy if the Minister said that he accepted the principle behind the amendment, that he would consult his officials and that he would come back with wording that did not suffer from the deficiencies that he had pointed out.
<P>
I was perturbed to hear that no decision had yet been taken on how much board members of regional development agencies would be paid. The Minister said that steps were being taken quickly to appoint the chairmen and deputy chairmen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I did not say ``quickly''. I said that an advertisement had appeared in the press and that we would be looking to have chairmen and deputy chairmen in place by the third quarter of this year. We are in month two of the year, and the third quarter runs from month nine to month 12. I know that quick is a relative term, but, even by the hon. Gentleman's own standards and imagination, he has twisted the position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> It is not twisting--the Minister is in a serious muddle. He said that the third quarter ran from months nine to 12, so did he mean the third quarter or the fourth quarter? Should he not have said months seven to nine?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> He meant the third quarter. Therefore, we expect the posts to be filled within six months.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon pointed out, when a job is advertised and it is discussed with the applicants, it is likely that the question of salary will be raised. That might not happen immediately, but the matter will certainly be raised before anyone accepts an appointment. If advertisements are being placed in the press, the Minister must soon say what the pay will be. If not, his discussions with potential appointees will be fruitless.
<P>
If the Minister cannot tell us today what the pay levels are likely to be for those important posts, when will he make that decision? If the Committee is not sitting by then, when will we be able to table a parliamentary question that will lead to the disclosure of that important information to the public? How soon will decisions about pay levels be made?
<P>
The Minister referred to several other bodies, one of which was English Partnerships. I understand that its outgoing chairman, the noble Lord Walker, gave his services without any remuneration. I am not sure whether the Minister expects that precedent to be followed.
<P>
Which of the bodies that the Minister mentioned pays pensions to its former members? All the bodies? Some, and if so, which? Where pensions are paid, are they paid to all former board members? Are they paid when they leave the board or when they reach retirement age? If my questions are too detailed to be answered this morning, will the Minister give us at least the general principles that the Government follow on these matters? Will he provide the Committee with detailed written answers? It is relevant to know what we are letting the taxpayer in for.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is the question of pay-offs for those who fall out with the Secretary of State, perhaps after disagreeing with a strategy dictated by him. Will the Minister tell us--one example would do--of the sort of special circumstances in which a pay-off should be given?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We will write to the hon. Gentleman and members of the Committee. I do not have to hand all the information relating to English Partnerships, Scottish Enterprise, the Welsh Development Agency or indeed, the Environment Agency for England and Wales. In broad terms, pensions will be available for chairmen and possibly their deputies when they operate for two or more days. That is a broad rule of thumb. I will ensure that members of the Committee are fully informed.
<P>
I should also like to put on record the fact that Lord Walker, with whom I have had dealings in my current position, not only waived remuneration but brought his considerable skills to English Partnerships. He did a first-rate job and I am thankful that he remained in office until we were able to replace him. He has been extremely helpful in ensuring a seamless transition and has provided valuable assistance and advice to my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> This is important, because of the operation of RDAs, and attendant costs, have to be contained within current budgets applicable in the region. It is vital that we do not burden RDAs with more costs than necessary, which would deplete moneys going out to frontline services. We do not want to spend more money on being than on doing.
<P>
I accept that some people give their services free. I hope that people of high calibre will be appointed and that they will want to provide their services to the public not necessarily for payment alone. There is a difference between chairmen, deputy chairmen and members. I am concerned about ordinary members of the board receiving pensions. They should be paid appropriate fees and expenses but nothing more. I am also concerned about continuing payments to members who leave the board. I hope that we shall not perpetuate the practice of those public company boards that swiftly dismiss, with huge pay-outs, members who have made an absolute mess of the job. I hope that there will not be payment for bad performance or non-attendance, with people who do not fulfil their function being paid off to remove them from the board.
<P>
I also hope that details such as the emoluments provided will be detailed in a public record--perhaps the company's annual report. Again, it is extremely important that annual reports provide openness and accountability. Finally, I hope that standard conditions or standard contracts will apply to all RDA appointments and that we do not have, for example, a south-west region version, an eastern version or a northern version, and that regional differences are not perpetuated. I hope that the employment conditions will apply equally to members of the south-west board or the London board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> May I remind the Minister that he has not responded to some of my questions, particularly on when he will decide what salaries are to be paid to board members. Will he tell the Committee how he proposes to make that information available to Members of Parliament? As my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon pointed out, that may even help us in responding to his generous invitation to recommend people to serve on RDA boards. It would also be helpful if he gave us an example of the special circumstances in which a pay-off to a non-executive member would be justifiable? The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall alluded to the size of some recent pay-offs in the private sector, which are open to criticism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> New Opposition policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> On the contrary, the former Prime Minister made clear, on more than one occasion his concern about that issue on the Floor of the House. The Minister has obviously been an infrequent attender at Question Time. Can he give an example of such circumstances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We were out campaigning to win the election--which we did quite successfully on 1 May--and that is why we did not spend much time in the House. I advise the hon. Gentleman to start doing the same to enable him to get back into government.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall that it is vital that we keep people informed through an annual report. To give people confidence in the work of the RDAs, it is important not only that they communicate through an annual report, but that they ensure that there are proper communications between their board and the people on whose behalf they are acting.
<P>
As for the points raised by the hon. Member for South Suffolk, we might need to have a balance of skills on the board, to take account of new developments inside the region. The Secretary of State might want to intervene at that stage to ask people to stand down so that others could be brought onto the board to reflect the necessary mix of skills. One could imagine that happening in several areas and that is why we included the provision; we think that to do so now is good, prudent management and means that we will not have to introduce primary legislation on salaries. We shall keep salaries within the broad context of the Welsh Development Agency, the Scottish Development Agency and the Environment Agency for England and Wales. We are taking counsel on how much time should be spent on the board, which will also be reflected in the remuneration. When we have all that information, we shall inform the House in the usual way.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I want to pick up briefly on the idea from my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall of a fixed financial envelope within which the regional development agencies operate in terms of operational costs. The Minister spoke of circumstances in which a member of an agency might depart, and the manner of dealing with that. We are talking about remunerating the work of nominees. Will there be a performance review, or some setting of criteria, by which a board member's performance will be judged? If public money is to be used, it is not unreasonable, in today's terms, to have some measurement against which to ascertain whether a member is pulling his weight. This is likely to be one of the questions asked by people who approach me with an interest in serving on the board; another will be about remuneration.
<P>
I seek clarification of another point. For illustrative purposes, the Minister talked about conditions attached to serving perhaps two-plus days a week. I may well find myself speaking to potential nominees. Perhaps the Minister can tell me what he believes to be a reasonable period for each category of board member to serve. A chairman will serve for longer than a deputy chairman, who may serve for longer than an ordinary board member. Guidance of that nature would be extremely useful.
<P>
I make a final plea to the Minister on the general concept of the financial envelope within which the idea operates. Frequently it is the chief executive who carries quite a lot of the burden of responsibility in such a body. Given that there is a financial envelope, perhaps when the Minister considers the amount of remuneration for board members, he will give some thought to leaving sufficient funds for the remuneration of staff of suitable calibre, to ensure that the board is adequately served by its staff.
<P>
I beg to differ slightly from the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall in that I think that some regional variation in remuneration is perfectly realistic. After all, regional variations in pay are certainly reflected in the private sector. This is all part of making sensible use of public money when remunerating people who agree to serve on these boards.

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's clarification of the type of bodies that may be used for the purposes of comparison. He mentioned the Scottish Development Agency, the Welsh Development Agency and the Environment Agency, among others. It is helpful to know that payments to members of those boards will be within the range that RDA members may expect. It would, however, help the Committee to know when decisions about RDA pay are to be finalised.
<P>
I return briefly to the circumstances under which the pay-off will be made. The Minister said that the skills mix on an RDA board might have to be changed--presumably to reflect new thinking about the board's role and function. I recall from earlier debates that the term that an RDA member might serve was usually envisaged to be about three years. I gleaned from that that the skills mix requirements could change some time within the three-year period, and that a person appointed by the Secretary of State might find himself dis-appointed, or removed from the board, because of changed needs. May we conclude that with, say, a year and a half to go--half way through the term--a person so removed could expect compensation reflecting the amount that he would have earned had he served the full term? Is that the outcome that the Minister has in mind?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I think that the envelope referred to by the hon. Member for Meriden, which encapsulates the position, is English Partnerships, the Scottish Development Agency, the Welsh Development Agency and the Environment Agency for England and Wales. If those referred to in the hon. Lady's contribution want to put their names forward, perhaps they should examine the time and work commitments of those bodies, which would give them a fairly good feel for what is expected from the regional development agencies. Those are all non-departmental public bodies that operate on the same style that we expect for RDAs.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk explained the position on three-year appointments adequately. I think that it would be exceptional for a board person to move over. In that sense, we have included the provision in the Bill only as a safeguard, as any good Government would do. It would be wrong not to include that safeguard, so that it is available if necessary. I agree entirely with the hon. Member for South Suffolk. His analysis of the matter and his wish to probe our position is understandable. I can assure him that we would use the option sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances, so it would not place such a heavy burder to the public purse and we need not worry too much about the British taxpayer.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> That is very helpful. Perhaps the Minister can tell us when he thinks the salary decisions will be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We are taking counsel on a range of issues, not just salaries, but on the positions that chairmen and deputy chairmen will be holding. The more important question that I want to consider is how much time will be involved for the chairmen and deputy chairmen, and how many people will be applying to join the boards. I shall let the hon. Member for South Suffolk and members of the Committee know when we have some answers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I agree with the Minister that before salaries are settled, it is important to know what commitment is expected of the people who will fill the posts. The time commitment is perhaps the single most important aspect of the process.
<P>
In the light of the Minister's assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 43, in page 24, line 34, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and subject to an overall limit of 50''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 44, in page 25, line 5, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(5) Payments made to officers and employees appointed under sub-paragraph (1) shall not exceed &#163;1 million annually.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> As the Committee will guess, these are probing amendments. The operations of RDAs are of great interest to the Committee, the House and to others outside, and there are a great many unanswered questions. If we are only a matter of months away from appointing chairmen and deputy chairmen, it is right to start to address some of those detailed questions. I should like the Minister to give the Committee at least an outline of the Government's thinking about the staff levels that RDAs are likely to require. Following from that, perhaps he could explain where the staff who will work for RDAs are likely to come from. Will a substantial proportion of staff be newly recruited, or will they simply be brought from existing agencies?
<P>
In the latter case, will the relevant posts be advertised or will staff literally be transferred? What agencies are likely to transfer staff to RDAs? What will the costs be? What are the likely parameters of the total salary bill for RDAs?
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall expressed concern about costs, and that concern is widely shared, given that the Government have not yet identified--not clearly enough for me anyway--where the running costs of RDAs will come from. There is anxiety, of course, that, if they are to have substantial staff establishments and high costs, it might be at the expense of some local authority funding.
<P>
The House has not previously had a chance to focus on the issues that I have raised. This seems to be the right opportunity, particularly as the White Paper gives no relevant guidance. I hope that the Minister will now enlighten us about some of these important matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The amendments would place statutory limits on the number of staff that an RDA could employ and on the total salary budget for staff, although I understand that they are probing amendments. In each RDA, staff numbers would be limited to 50, and total payments made to staff would be limited to &#163;1 million annually.
<P>
The amendments were no doubt tabled with the intention of securing controls to prevent RDAs from spending unjustifiably large sums on staff, either by overstaffing or by paying generous salaries. Of course public funds should be properly spent, and systems should be in place for ensuring this. Such systems will be in place for RDAs, just as for all non-departmental public bodies. As with all non-departmental public bodies whose administration expenditure is predominantly funded by public resources, the pay and grading of RDA staff will be controlled by the Government. Hence, paragraphs 3(2) and 4(3) of schedule 2 to the Bill provide that the pay and pensions of the RDA chairman, the board and the staff would be subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.
<P>
Through those well-established arrangements for non-departmental public bodies, the Government will ensure that the pay costs for RDAs are adequate but not excessive.
<P>
Another important point that we must not overlook is that RDAs will inherit certain functions from Government offices, English Partnerships and the Rural Development Commission. They will also take on staff who have been working on those functions. Staff who are transferred will transfer on their existing terms and conditions. Regional Development Agencies must, therefore, be in a position to honour those contracts of employment, which reflect the staffing levels currently required to carry out the relevant functions. After all, the existing staff costs for English Partnerships are almost &#163;12 million. Amendment No. 44 could prevent RDAs from paying all their staff, bringing them to a grinding halt by 1 April 1999.
<P>
Finally, the amendments would introduce an unhelpful degree of rigidity. Regional development agencies will not necessarily all be the same in terms of size and staffing structures. They must, if they are to be effective, have sufficient flexibility to organise themselves as they see fit. They will, in addition, evolve over time. They may take on additional functions as part of that evolution. The rigidity imposed by statutory constraint such as proposed by the amendments, would make such evolution impossible. The Bill has been drafted to be flexible, to allow for changing circumstances and a developing regional agenda, as can be seen from the White Paper. We do not want to undermine that by a rigid ceiling on budgets. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister has just said that people transferred to the agency from existing employment will carry over their terms and conditions of employment. Does that mean that someone who came to the agency from English Partnerships, and someone who came from a Government Department or the Rural Development Commission could do a job of the same status on different terms and conditions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I said that employees would bring their terms with them. That is not new. Those who worked for English Partnerships were civil servants who went to a NDPB and will go to another. That applies to the RDC. There will be differences for civil servants who transfer to NDPBs from Government offices. We will examine that, and consult the trade unions. The NDPB will employ people on different conditions, and different grades and methods of payment will exist within the organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> But that means that people might do the same job for different pay and conditions. Is the RDA expected to produce internal pay structures so that everyone is within the same system? If employees bring different pay and conditions to the new job, joint deputy chief executives from different backgrounds could have different bits of paper for the same job.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's point. He is experienced in such matters. When we set up English Partnerships, we employed people from different backgrounds. They brought their pay and conditions with them. As the NDPB evolves and proper negotiations take place, different pay and career structures develop. When we discussed returning to civil service pay and conditions with English Partnerships staff, they refused.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): I have a genuine query. Will the pension and other rights of people from the Department who transfer to the agency be in question?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Not at all. We are talking not about something that has dropped from Mars but about establishing a non-departmental public body. The previous Administration had much expertise in that. People from English Partnerships, the Rural Development Commission and Government offices will join the agency with their terms and conditions. They may join on secondment and wish to return to their organisations; they may wish to transfer. That is a normal procedure that has been used in setting up several non-departmental public bodies. As the NDPB evolves, it will begin to negotiate its own pay and conditions.
<P>
Let us consider the establishment of English Partnerships, which recruited people from several walks of life, including the civil service. They brought their conditions with them. As English Partnerships evolved, it created its own pay structures. However, evolution takes time. The process involves consultation, and it works. It gets the best out of people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Further to my point about pensions, are civil servants in the Department being told that they must move to the RDA? Have they been named? Are they being given a choice in the matter? The Minister has confirmed that their terms and conditions are in a state of flux.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> As I understand it, some people will be seconded to the agency, and their salaries will be paid by the organisation that seconds them. How may people will be seconded? Others will be employed by the agency, so there will be two cadres of people. However, is the objective for all of them to become agency employees in time?
