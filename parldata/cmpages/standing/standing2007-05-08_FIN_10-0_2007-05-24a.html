								The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):
						</b> On a point
of order, Mr. Illsley. Following exchanges in the Committee
on Tuesday about the circulation of courtesy letters concerning
amendments, the Treasury has looked into the matter and the shadow
Chief Secretary has received a letter from the Chief Secretary on this
matter. Our investigations show that in recent years it has not been
our practice to circulate courtesy letters giving advance notice of the
tabling of amendments to all members of the Committee. However,
following your guidance, Mr. Illsley, we will do so in
future and we have circulated all such letters for this Bill to hon.
Members, both electronically and in hard copy. I regret any
inconvenience that the confusion has caused you or any member of the
Committee.</div>
					
					<a name="07052469000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07052469000287"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Francois</b> (Rayleigh) (Con): Further to that point of
order, and very briefly, Mr. Illsley. I am grateful to the
Economic Secretary for having looked into the matter. He has dealt with
it correctly, we are grateful for what he has said and we need not
detain the Committee any longer on that point. Perhaps we can now crack
on and concentrate on the Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="07052469000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052469000288"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> I think that draws a line under that
episode.</div>
					
					<a name="07052469000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07052469000289"></a>
							<b class="B">Mrs.
Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con): It is a pleasure
to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Illsley, on this sunny
morning for our last sitting before the Whitsun recess.</div>
					<a name="07052469000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome clause 58 and the
extension of the provisions of the Finance Act 2005, which enables
securitisation companies to continue to use UK
generally accepted accounting practice to draw up their accounts on an
interim and temporary basis. Were they to shift to international
financial reporting standards, as required by European Union
regulation, their trading securities would have to be accounted for on
a market-to-market basis. That would lead to significant volatility,
which could undermine their credit ratings, which are so critical for
such companies.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 366</div>
					<a name="07052469000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not propose to repeat the
remarks that I made last year on the
extension&#151;very similar to this one&#151;provided by the
Finance Act 2006, save to reiterate that we are talking about a
business that is worth trillions of pounds. The health of the
securitisation sector is vital in maintaining a competitive edge for
the City of London. It is also critical for securing financial market
liquidity and keeping down the cost of business borrowing and finance.
Therefore it is vital that the Committee takes care of this clause and
gets the issue right. The measure extends a temporary regime, pending
the adoption of a permanent framework for the taxation and accounting
systems to be used by securitisation companies.</div>
					<a name="07052469000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last year, I asked the
Paymaster General when she expected that long-term regime to be in
place. Her response was that that was expected by January of this year.
I was, therefore, pleased to note that the Taxation of Securitisation
Companies Regulations 2006 were adopted by the House in December.
However, the extension of the temporary regime features in the Bill
because not all securitisation companies are covered by the 2006
regulations. Given the critical importance of securitisation and, in
particular, of its international mobility&#151;it could easily head
offshore&#151;I urge the Economic Secy, as I did last year, to
complete the job of establishing a full regime for the accounting and
taxation of securitisation companies. It would be useful if he could
update the Committee on progress. How extensive is the coverage of the
regulations that put in place a permanent regime for certain
securitisation companies? What proportion of the securitisation market
is still outside the scope of the permanent regime and thus covered by
the clause?</div>
					<a name="07052469000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations seem only to cover companies with exclusively financial
assets. When will the Government deal with other types of
securitisation companies that include rental streams in their
portfolios and other non-financial assets? Are the Government looking
at plans to meet the needs of the insurance industry whose
securitisation vehicles certainly fall outside the December
regulations? I am not even sure that they are inside the temporary
regulations. Will the Economic Secretary confirm the current status of
insurance-related securitisation
vehicles?</div>
					<a name="07052469000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Proposed
new subsection (7B) permits the Government to take a different approach
to various types of securitisation companies. Given the importance of
the issue, it would be useful if the Economic Secretary could explain
how the Government propose to deal with the different types of company
and how they will be divided up for the purposes of both the temporary
rules and hopefully the new permanent ones? Will he set out the
rationale for the differential treatment of the various types of
securitisation company and explain the operation of the payments
condition that determines whether a company can qualify to use the
regime provided for in the December 2006
regulations?</div>
					
					<a name="07052469000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052469000290"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> The hon. Lady is right. We are discussing an
important sector of our financial services industry. It is also part of
the industry that is exposed to international competition and
developments, so it is important that we get the provision right and do
so in a way that is flexible and meets the needs of particular parts of
the industry, given their different needs and concerns.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 367</div>
					<a name="07052469000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Lady said, the
regulations that we introduced for companies in December 2006 apply to
the securitisation of financial assets. Those regulations were warmly
welcomed by the capital markets industry. A further set of regulations
will be needed for particular types of securitisation, such as
insurance and property. Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs is in
discussion with interested parties in the insurance and other sectors
and, subject to satisfactorily identifying the issues that need to be
addressed in each case, we expect to lay regulations for those sectors
by the end of the
year.</div>
					<a name="07052469000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact is that
different types of securitisation present particular issues. With the
securitisation of financial assets, the volatility is caused by
accounting standards. With insurance securitisation, there is the
interaction between the tax rules and life insurance companies, and
with the special regulatory regime for insurance companies. They are
relatively complicated matters and it is appropriate that, in some
cases, rules are dedicated to particular types of securitisation.
Indeed, that is what the industry asked us to do in the
consultations.</div>
					<a name="07052469000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
hon. Lady knows, the Finance Act 2005 was necessarily widely drawn to
ensure that companies that had entered into securitisations were not
affected adversely by changes to accounting standards. It remains our
intention to devise appropriate permanent rules for companies engaged
in securitisations. However, some companies need special rules and have
particular group structures or other characteristics, which made it
difficult for them to fit into the first set of regulations that were
introduced in December and widely
welcomed.</div>
					<a name="07052469000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						When
the first set of regulations was laid in December, the Government gave
an undertaking that the interim regime would continue as long as
necessary. That is the case and that is what the industry is asking us
to do. The interim regime expires on 1 January 2008 and regulations
made under the clause will allow the regime to be extended for those
companies for which it is necessary. As with all the work on such types
of companies, the regulations will be developed in consultation with
the capital markets sector. The consultation is ongoing, so while we
have moved where we can on the timetable set by the Paymaster General
last year, we are responding to the concerns of the industry in the
particular areas where we need to do more work. We hope to lay
regulations for those areas by the end of the year. In the meantime, we
shall be extending the temporary regime in response to
requests.</div>
					<a name="07052469000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">To allow the
work to continue, the powers under which the regulations are made need
to be amended to cater for a wider range of incidental and
consequential amendments. We might need to reconsider the interaction
of capital gains tax laws in the case of securitisation involving real
estate, for example. In addition, the interim regime under which
securitisation companies are taxed in accordance with former accounting
standards will need to be continued for companies for which permanent
regulations have not been made, in a manner that is tailored to the
needs of those companies. The clause allows for the extension of that
interim regime. They are small, technical changes, but as the hon. Lady
said, they are of particular importance to the industry.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div>
					<a name="07052469000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady asked how the
payments condition will work. All cash must be paid out within 18
months, which is similar to the rules for accounts under UK GAAP, to
ensure that companies are not cash money boxes. Extensive HMRC guidance
will be placed in the public domain to help people through that
technical area. I hope that she and the Committee are satisfied that
our consultation will be sensitive to the needs of particular sectors
and with the differential way in which we will try to move to a
permanent regime, and that we are working in full consultation with the
industry.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052469000291"></a>Mr.
Francois:
						</b> I welcome you to the Chair this morning,
Mr. Illsley. Last year, we discussed in some detail the
application of gift aid to museums and properties that give to their
supporters free or discounted access to their facilities. This year, we
find ourselves discussing the application of gift aid to charities that
give their donors other benefits in recognition of their
support.</div>
					<a name="07052469000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Gift aid was
introduced by the then Chancellor John Major in his 1990 Budget to
encourage gifts to charities. It has been successful. According to a
recent written answer from the Secretary, Cabinet Office, the hon.
Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband), it is worth &#163;750
million per annum to the approximately 300,000 charities in the United
Kingdom. The clause is designed further to encourage charitable giving
by allowing charities to increase the benefits that they give to their
supporters while remaining in the gift aid scheme.</div>
					<a name="07052469000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC&#146;s guidance on gift
aid includes the following
explanation:</div>
					<a name="07052469000224"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
benefit is: any item or service provided by the charity or a third
party to the donor or a person connected with the donor in consequence
of making of the
donation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052469000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guidance
goes on to give generic examples of a theatrical charity giving its
supporters a ticket discount, and a medical charity giving its
supporters a magazine, a pen and even a dinner for two. In essence,
those charities wish to give to their supporters incentives to continue
their support. Under clause 59(1)(a), the allowed fringe benefit to the
donor as a result of his gift to charity will increase from 2.5 per
cent. to 5 per cent. of the value of the donation. That will mean that
someone who gives &#163;10,000 will be able to receive a &#163;500
incentive, instead of the original &#163;250, without jeopardising
gift aid status.</div>
					<a name="07052469000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
its reaction to the Budget, the law firm Harbottle and Lewis
explained:</div>
					<a name="07052469000225"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is often difficult to quantify a benefit received by a donor from a
charity so the increased limit will give charities more room for
manoeuvre without jeopardising the availability of Gift
Aid.&#148;</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 369</div>
					<a name="07052469000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, we welcome that. The Chartered
Institute of Taxation has also welcomed the changes. According to its
evaluation, they might be of particular help to amateur sports clubs.
It has a query about thresholds, however, which I should like to raise
with the Economic Secretary. The institute has highlighted the fact
that although the upper limit has been extended, that extension applies
only to those who donate &#163;1,000 or more a year. For donations
below &#163;1,000, the limit remains at 2.5 per cent. As the
CIOT has pointed
out:</div>
					<a name="07052469000226"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It seems
strange that only some of the limits, originally set in 1990, have been
altered, and that smaller donors are still subject to 1990 values. The
effect of the proposed change will be to allow a donor who makes a
donation of &#163;1,001 to receive a benefit of &#163;50.05 yet a
donor who makes a donation of &#163;1,000 may only receive a benefit
of &#163;25.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052469000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems strange indeed. That bias against small donors seems to echo the
bias against small companies in the Budget. I should therefore be
interested to hear the Economic Secretary&#146;s rationale for the
decision to raise the higher bracket but leave the basic threshold
unchanged.</div>
					<a name="07052469000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
also a practical point on the operation of gift aid. The Royal
Aeronautical Society has written to me with a suggestion. The letter
came from its chief executive, Keith Mans. As I am sure you will
recall, Mr. Illsley, he is also a former Member of this
place. His letter highlights the problem of gift aid donations as they
relate to second-hand goods and charity shops. To summarise the problem
succinctly, if an individual donates a gift to a charity shop, the
charity can claim gift aid on the article only after it has been sold
and after it has subsequently contacted the donor to ask if the donor
is happy for gift aid to
apply.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07052469000244"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div>
					<a name="07052469000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Mans
comments:</div>
					<a name="07052469000227"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
practice, of course, it is almost impossible to do this as it would
mean that when any article is sold the donor has to be
contacted.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052469000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">His
suggested solution is quite straightforward. He
says:</div>
					<a name="07052469000228"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;My
suggestion is this rule is modified so that there is a presumption at
the time the goods are donated (provided that at that point the donor
signs a gift aid form) that when the goods are sold the donor wishes
the proceeds of the sale to remain with the charity and not to be
returned to the
donor.</div>
					<a name="07052469000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">This would mean
in practice that, provided an inventory is kept by the Charity Shop of
the names of the donors and the goods they have donated, it would be a
simple matter when articles are sold, for gift aid to be claimed
back.</div>
					<a name="07052469000230"></a><div class="hs_brev">In my view, this
does not constitute a change in the law but is simply a
re-interpretation of the rules, to ensure that the original intention
of the Treasury to allow the recovery of gift aid, on articles
donated to Charities, can be done in a practical
way.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052469000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look forward to
hearing the Minister&#146;s response to that suggestion in his
winding-up remarks.</div>
					
					<a name="07052469000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07052469000292"></a>
							<b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): I very much
sympathise with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. Is it not the
case, however, that people who make charitable donations must
record those
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div>donations in their tax returns? Consent might be given in the charity
shop, but there must still be a way of informing individuals so that
they can include the relevant information in their tax
returns.</div>
					
					<a name="07052469000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052469000293"></a>Mr.
Francois:
						</b> I take the hon. Lady&#146;s point. It would
depend on whether the individual was determined to include the
information in their tax return at year end. I suspect that in most
cases they would not necessarily be highly motivated to do that, but
that they would be more concerned that the charity should get the gift
aid. The suggestion is a practical one that comes from another source
and I hope that the Minister will consider it. The hon. Lady is
technically correct, but the Government might want to consider the
proposal from the practical point of
view.</div>
					<a name="07052469000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, Budget
changes to the gift aid rules might have a further effect on charities
that the clause will go only a little way to addressing. There has now
been wide press comment that buried in the detail of the Budget is a
likely knock-on effect whereby the Chancellor&#146;s proposed changes
in the basic rate of income tax will cost charities up to &#163;70
million. There has been such concern in the charitable sector about the
possible effect that eight heads of major charities wrote to <i class="I">The
Times </i>on 23 March to express their concern. The letter
said:</div>
					<a name="07052469000231"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Sir,
Gordon Brown&#146;s tax cuts will mean that UK charities are likely
to lose more than &#163;70 million in income.</div>
					<a name="07052469000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">Under the Government&#146;s
Gift Aid scheme, charities can reclaim the tax paid on donations by UK
taxpayers. With the reduction in the basic rate of tax from 22 to 20
per cent., Gift Aid income will be reduced by more than 10 per cent. We
urge the Government to consider compensating charities for this
significant reduction in
income.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052469000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not read
out all the signatures, but they included those of Professor Alex
Markham, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, Kevin Cahill, the
chief executive of Comic Relief, and Keith Hickey, the chief executive
of the Charities Finance Directors Group.</div>
					<a name="07052469000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The challenge
for charities is compounded by the pressure on lottery funding on which
many charities now rely, and by the additional &#163;675 million of
lottery money that was recently reallocated by the Government to the
financing of the 2012 Olympics on top of the &#163;750 million that
the lottery was already providing for that event. That money will no
longer be available to charitable good causes, which will result in
further intensification of the pressure on charities in the United
Kingdom.</div>
					<a name="07052469000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
a welcome move to amend the gift aid rules to allow donors to receive
greater fringe benefits from supporting charities, while still
remaining in the gift aid scheme. To that extent, we support it.
However, in discussing gift aid I should like to press the Minister on
three points.</div>
					<a name="07052469000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
what is the Minister&#146;s view on the Chartered Institute of
Taxation&#146;s point about thresholds and why were those for more
wealthy donations increased while the others were left unchanged?
Secondly, would he at least think about the practical point in relation
to gift aid and charity shops and does he have any initial view on it?
I say this without irony: if he wants to consider that, he can write to
me about it. Thirdly, given the potential double whammy that charities
will suffer
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 371</div>from the reallocation of lottery funding to the Olympics and from
changes in the basic rate of income tax, what further measures, if any,
are the Government considering to the gift aid regime to account for
that?</div>
					
					<a name="07052469000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052469000294"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:
						</b> I do not intend to repeat the arguments that
the hon. Gentleman has just made. I shall simply add my welcome to the
extension of the benefits to community amateur sports clubs. I can
think of many examples of clubs in my constituency that will benefit
hugely from that. I have only one question. Is anything being done to
make sure that such sports clubs are aware of their new entitlement?
The people whom I have in mind will not necessarily be paying
particularly close attention to the proceedings of this
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07052469000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should also
like to reiterate briefly the comments that have been made about the
asymmetry of treatment between larger and smaller donors. Is that an
intentional change? Some comments on that would be welcome. There are
also concerns more widely about gift aid and how vulnerable it is to
changes in the income tax system and other changes more generally.
Representatives from a museum came to me last year because they were
concerned about some gift aid forms that they had produced to try to
maximise their benefit. Because they had not required visitors to give
their postcode, however, the forms were invalid and they could not
claim gift aid. That represented a huge loss of expected
income.</div>
					<a name="07052469000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Gift aid is a
complicated system. I am therefore concerned that, as was reflected in
the exchange between my hon. Friend the Member for Romsey (Sandra
Gidley) and the Secretary, Cabinet Office, the hon. Member for
Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband), &#163;70 million of income will
be lost overall when the income tax changes kick in next year. That
highlights how vulnerable charities are to changes on the periphery
that can have a major impact on their income. Perhaps it is time for
the Treasury to look again at the gift aid system to see whether it can
be insulated against such changes, and whether a system can be created
that is clear, well defined and not subject to the changes and
uncertainty in the years
ahead.</div>
					
					<a name="07052469000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052469000295"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> As hon. Members have said, the clause will increase
the limits on the value of benefits that can be received by individuals
and corporations who make qualifying donations to charity. The
adjustments will increase the cap on the benefits that donors can
receive in a year in response to gift aid donations from &#163;250 to
&#163;500. In addition, the percentage limit for benefits received in
return for donations over &#163;1,000 will be increased from 2.5 per
cent. to 5 per cent. Those benefit limits allow charities to build
sustained relationships with donors by offering them a gesture of
recognition.
</div>
					<a name="07052469000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
limits have been unchanged since the introduction of gift aid in 1990
and we believe that the changes in the Bill will help to encourage
increased philanthropy, as appropriate levels of benefits can increase
scope for institutions to build up lasting relationships with donors.
As the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne highlighted, for the
purpose of gift aid donations by individuals, community amateur sports
clubs are treated as charities and so will also benefit from the
increase in benefit limits.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column372" />Column number: 372</div>
					<a name="07052469000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Member for Rayleigh
said, reaction to this change has been positive. He asked me three
questions. First, he asked why we were only increasing the threshold
limit for larger donations. As he said, these changes have been
welcomed by the Chartered Institute of Taxation and the London Society
of Chartered Accountants. The benefit limits have not been increased
since 1990. It was sensible to review them. For larger donations, we
understand that the current limits constrain charities when making
gestures of recognition to reflect the scale of donation. That
therefore restricts their ability to deal with and develop
relationships with large donors.</div>
					<a name="07052469000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We feel that the existing
limits for smaller donations are already generous. For example, if a
donor makes a gift of up to &#163;100, a charity may thank them with
items or services worth up to &#163;25, which in that case would be
25 per cent., rather than 2.5 per cent. The changes were specifically
intended to increase scope for charities to recognise larger donations
and develop relations with their wealthy donors. It was in that area,
rather than on smaller donations, that we perceived there to be a
problem. That is why we have acted in this way, but if the sector makes
further representations, we can consider those in due course. The
representations that were made concerned larger donations.</div>
					<a name="07052469000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the second point, the
representation from the Royal Aeronautical Society and the former
Member of this House, Mr. Keith Mans, I am happy to commit
the Treasury to consider the matter. I cannot give the hon. Member for
Rayleigh an answer today. It is not an issue on which he has tabled an
amendment. On this occasion, I had no advance notice of the detailed
point, so I am not in a position to respond to it outside the scope of
the clause. I will, however, examine the matter. We will be happy to
meet Mr. Mans&#151;on the ground rather than in the
sky&#151;and I will happily commit the Treasury to writing to the
hon. Gentleman about the matter, and to meeting Mr.
Mans.</div>
					<a name="07052469000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
that the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne raised in passing about
awareness, we have explicitly flagged the extra benefit limits to the
Community Amateur Sports Clubs forum as well as the Central Council for
Physical Recreation. We will endeavour to ensure the widest
awareness.</div>
					<a name="07052469000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brings me on to the third point about the impact of Budget changes.
When we make changes to the tax system, they have an impact more
widely. Those impacts are considered in making Budget decisions. At the
same time, however, we always work with the sector to try to ensure
that we increase awareness and opportunity. Although the amount of gift
aid repayable to charities is affected by the change to the basic rate
of tax, we believe that there is significant scope for the charitable
sector to increase the proportion of donations that enjoy gift aid tax
relief.</div>
					<a name="07052469000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Charities
Aid Foundation has stated that an additional &#163;700 million of
gift aid tax relief could potentially be claimed. The consultation that
we announced in the Budget is aimed at trying to find particular ways
to raise awareness and to change the regulations so that we can
increase the amount of charitable giving that benefits from the tax
relief. We hope that in the coming years, the strong upward trend in
donations will continue, and the upward trend in donations receiving
tax relief will continue. I remind 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 373</div>the Committee that in 1996-97, the amount of basic rate gift aid to
charities was &#163;134 million. By 1998-99 that had risen to
&#163;306 million. By 2005-06, the amount had risen to &#163;750
million. There has been a substantial rise in the amount of tax relief
for gift aid, but this is one of those occasions on which the Treasury
would like the cost to the Exchequer to go up, not down.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con):
The clause relates to the benefits code. My
understanding is that there are something like 155 sections in the
Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 that apply to the taxation
of benefits other than shares. Clearly, this is a hugely complicated
area of the law; indeed, that is presumably the cause of the anomaly
that the clause seeks to eradicate. Given that, may I ask what
consideration the Treasury is giving to simplifying this area of the
tax code?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052469000297"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman says, the purpose of the
clause is to legislate an extra-statutory concession that was
introduced in 2004 to ensure that an employee who earn less than
&#163;8,500 per annum does not incur a treble tax charge when he is
provided with a car and car fuel paid for by his employer with a credit
card, non-cash voucher or cheque. Such cases are rare, but there should
not be a double charge simply because the benefit of a car and fuel has
been paid for by those means.</div>
					<a name="07052469000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The extra-statutory concession
was published by HMRC in July 2004 on the understanding that it would
be formalised through legislation at the earliest opportunity. That is
what we are doing with the clause. As the hon. Gentleman said, we are
repealing subsections 219(5) and (6) of the 2003 Act. The clause
removes the value of non-cash vouchers and credit tokens used to
provide car or fuel benefits when calculating whether an employee earns
less than &#163;8,500 per annum. The clause legislates the
concessionary treatment that applies in the circumstances I described.
</div>
					<a name="07052469000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Gentleman
said, the issues are complex and the 2003 Act was a complex piece of
legislation. The Government do not have a particular process for review
of the Act, but we keep all aspects of the tax system under review at
all times, and we are always happy to receive representations from hon.
Members or outside organisations when they feel that there are issues
that need to be addressed. That is what happened in this case. We
received representations, and we are acting. I commend the clause to

					<a name="07052469000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
allowance is, then, a welcome development, which we have supported and
will support again today. However, given the importance of pay and
conditions to operational morale, as well as the impact that the
funding may have on other parts of the Ministry of Defence budget, I
want to raise some points with the Financial Secretary about how the
allowance is intended to operate in practice. I have five
questions.</div>
					<a name="07052469000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, how
long is the operational allowance intended to last? Is it now to be
regarded as an established part of the armed forces remuneration
package and is it intended in principle to apply to any new
deployments, beyond those that are currently envisaged? Secondly,
according to a Ministry of Defence press release of 1 March 2007, some
&#163;35 million had been paid to that date to 31,000 members of the
Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force. As the payments began prior to
Christmas 2006, but we are discussing the facilitating legislation
today, can the Financial Secretary confirm whether qualifying troops
who have been given the allowance have been paid it gross or net to
date?</div>
					<a name="07052469000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, from
which departmental budget is the allowance intended to come? I
understand from previous pronouncements by the Secretary of
State for Defence that the new allowance represented some
&#163;60 million per annum of new money provided by the Treasury, in
addition to the MOD&#146;s existing budget. Is it the
Treasury&#146;s intention that that practice should continue, or is
it felt that it should be absorbed by the MOD budget in future years?
That is an important point with respect to MOD budgeting, and it would
be helpful to know the Treasury&#146;s intentions.</div>
					<a name="07052469000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly, to which deployments
will the allowance apply and who will qualify? The clause states that
qualifying deployments can be decided by order of the Secretary of
State for Defence. Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, the Chief of the
Defence Staff, said in an MOD press release of 1 March 2007 that the
bonus is to be paid at present to</div>
					<a name="07052469000235"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;those serving in Iraq,
Afghanistan and the
Balkans.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052469000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">What criteria
will be used to judge whether future deployments will qualify? For
instance, why were the Balkans included but not Sierra
Leone?</div>
					<a name="07052469000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Fifth
and finally, how is the allowance intended to interact with other
benefits and service allowances? For instance, as I understand it, the
operational allowance has been excluded for the calculation of tax
credits, by statutory instrument, but what about the new longer
separation allowance, which is also meant to be tri-service? Is there
any overlap in qualifying criteria and, if so, is one reduced at any
point to take account of another?</div>
					<a name="07052469000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Financial
Secretary may recall the Government&#146;s embarrassment last year
prior to the deployment of 3 Commando Brigade to Afghanistan, when it
was revealed, just as they were deploying, that the Royal Marines were
to receive less in overseas allowances than had been originally
anticipated. That caused quite a row at the time and was raised at
Prime Minister&#146;s questions. Vice-Admiral Adrian Johns, the
Second Sea Lord, was quoted at the time as
saying:</div>
					<a name="07052469000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
unfortunate error could not have materialized at a worse
time.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div>
					<a name="07052469000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is the interaction, if any, between
the operational allowance and other military allowances, including the
LSA?</div>
					<a name="07052469000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reiterate that
we support the new allowance in principle but that we should like some
reassurances from the Financial Secretary about how it is likely to
operate in
practice.</div>
					
					<a name="07052469000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052469000299"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):
						</b> The
clause establishes special provision for the tax charge that would
otherwise relate to the newly introduced operational allowance, payable
to members of the armed forces in certain circumstances. In October,
the Secretary of State for Defence announced the introduction of the
new operational allowance, which will apply to members of the armed
forces serving in specified operational locations such as Iraq,
Afghanistan and the Balkans from 6 April 2006. The purpose of the
allowance is to recognise the increased and enduring danger in
operational locations over and above that which is already compensated
for in a service person's salary.</div>
					<a name="07052469000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The qualifying areas will be
regularly reviewed by the Secretary of State for Defence on advice from
the Commander, Joint Operations. That assessment will depend on a
review of the nature of the danger to armed forces personnel who are
deployed on operations. Any change to the qualifying locations will be
approved by Ministers.</div>
					<a name="07052469000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Rayleigh
asked me four other questions. The first was how long the allowance
would last. It is part of the remuneration package that we judge is
appropriate for our armed forces. I explained how the judgment about
qualifying areas will be arrived at and that is how it will operate in
future.</div>
					<a name="07052469000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s second question was about the
exemption&#151;whether the operational allowance is taxed. I can
confirm that the exemption will apply retrospectively, and HMRC will
not collect tax from any payment of the operational allowance. The
third question was about how the Ministry of Defence would treat the
allowance in budgeting terms. For the current period after the
introduction, the funding comes from the reserve. The MOD Budget is
being set for the longer term as part of the comprehensive spending
review, and it will form part of those discussions and
negotiations.</div>
					
					<a name="07052469000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052469000300"></a>Mr.
Francois:
						</b> I am grateful for what the Financial Secretary
has said so far. He talked about the current period; could he explain
what is the outer end of the envelope for which the Treasury have
guaranteed that the money will be additional to the MOD budget? When
does that guarantee run out? I accept that it will be part of the
CSR.</div>
					
					<a name="07052469000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052469000301"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has answered his own question.
It is part of the comprehensive spending review preparations. He cannot
expect me to share that with the Committee, even if I was in a position
to do so.</div>
					<a name="07052469000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about the interaction with some of the other
allowances that are rightly paid to our armed forces. The new allowance
will be paid separately from the other allowances, such 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div>as the longer separation allowance. In relation to tax credits, he is
right; from this year onwards the tax credit regulations have been
amended to disregard the allowance as income for tax credit purposes.
Prior to that, any operational allowance paid to the armed forces in
these circumstances will not reduce the entitlement to tax credits
because, as he knows as well as anyone, part of our reforms to the tax
credits allow a disregard of income rises up to
&#163;25,000.</div>
					<a name="07052469000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman did not ask me about it but, as he mentioned the
interaction with other allowances, he might be interested to know that
regulations have been introduced that mean that no national insurance
contributions are paid on the operational allowances. Finally, the hon.
Gentleman asked how many people are benefiting from the allowance, and
the answer is about
12,000.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052469000304"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:
						</b> By way of background, I point out that the
pre-owned tax assets regime contained in the Finance Act 2004 applies
to certain transfers of assets where the original owner continues to
benefit from them after the change of ownership&#151;for example,
where someone transfers the title to a home to someone else but
continues to live in it. Where the POAT charge applies, an income tax
charge is levied that is linked to the use value of the asset
transferred.</div>
					<a name="07052469000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rules
were adopted to prevent people from avoiding inheritance tax. Although
the Opposition certainly support measures to prevent such avoidance, we
have always had significant reservations about how the POAT regime
operates in practice. Partly because of the controversy associated with
the regime, the Government have said that people caught within its
scope have the option to elect out of the regime and back into the
inheritance tax rules. The result of such an election is that no POAT
income tax charge is payable. Instead, the asset in question is treated
as part of the original owner&#146;s estate for IHT purposes and
taxed on his death in the normal
way.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07052469000246"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div>
					<a name="07052469000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However,
a time limit was placed on elections. As the draft guidance notes
helpfully circulated by the Chief Secretary confirm, the deadline was
31 January 2007 for those caught in 2005-06, the first year in which
the POAT regime operated. Thenceforth, as the explanatory notes tell
us, the deadline for election has been the self-assessment deadline for
the year in which the person first became liable to the charge. The
original legislation, in paragraph 23 of schedule 15 to the 2004 Act,
allowed elections after the deadline, but only in limited
circumstances. Late elections could be accepted only where the taxpayer
could show a reasonable excuse for failing to make the election before
the relevant filing date. Clause 65 will give HMRC greater discretion
in accepting late elections by deleting the requirement to show a
reasonable excuse.</div>
					<a name="07052469000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Opposition welcome the change, but we feel that it does not answer all
the concerns expressed about elections under the POAT regime. For a
start, clause 65 fails to address the problems surrounding the
procedure for making a valid election. Amendment No. 119 would cover
that point. It was tabled in response to concerns expressed by a number
of professional bodies including the Law Society, the Chartered
Institute of Taxation and the Society of Trust and Estate
Practitioners.</div>
					<a name="07052469000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
23(2) of schedule 15 to the Finance Act 2004 requires the election to
be made in &#147;the prescribed manner&#148;, which in turn is
defined in schedule 15(1) as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div>&#147;prescribed by regulations&#148;. However, no regulations have
been adopted, meaning that it is impossible to make a valid election.
The Treasury has allowed the 31 January deadline to expire
without adopting regulations to enable people to make an election, and
clause 65 does not address that point. No election already made appears
to be valid, and no future election will be valid until the regulations
are in force.</div>
					<a name="07052469000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
situation provides a clear and pressing reason to take a liberal
approach to allowing late elections, as it was not legally possible to
make an election before the prescribed the deadline. Amendment No. 119
would remove the problem by ensuring that any elections made before the
regulations came into force are deemed valid. It is essential to adopt
the amendment if the Government are to allow the election that they
promised.</div>
					<a name="07052469000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
concern is that even with the increased flexibility given by clause 65,
the scope for late elections is still too narrow. The draft guidance
notes seem more relevant to the old test, with its requirement that a
&#147;reasonable excuse&#148; be shown. The provisions for late
election due to events beyond the taxpayer&#146;s control seem only
to repeat the guidance already in force in relation to the unamended
rules.</div>
					<a name="07052469000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions
on other circumstances in the draft guidance seem to be new, and they
are welcome. They provide that a late election will be accepted where
the taxpayer can show that they
were</div>
					<a name="07052469000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unaware and could
not reasonably have been aware that they were liable to an income tax
charge under this section, and elected within a reasonable time of
becoming so aware&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07052469000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is welcome, but the requirement to prove a negative in the last line of
page 2 of the draft guidance could be difficult to satisfy in
practice.</div>
					<a name="07052469000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition believe that a much clearer assurance is needed in relation
to some specific cases. As STEP and the CIOT have pointed out, there
are significant interpretive problems with the POAT regime. To compare
something with the Schleswig-Holstein question has become a tired
parliamentary clich(c), but it would not be an exaggeration to say
that the number of people who fully understand the POAT regime could
probably be counted on the fingers of one hand. I do not know which
Minister is responding, but, given its complexity, I do not suppose
that there was a rush to take this matter over from the Paymaster
General. These provisions are highly complex and controversial, and a
significant number of people may be unwittingly and unknowingly caught
by the regulations and have no clue that that is so. There is a
pressing case for being flexible in allowing late
elections.</div>
					<a name="07052469000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Particular
problems have arisen in relation to those entering into so-called
reversion release schemes. In guidance published in March 2006, HMRC
stated that such schemes were caught by the reservation of benefit
rules, which predate POAT. Where those rules operate, they keep the
asset within the inheritance tax regime. POAT is therefore not payable,
since the asset remains part of the original owner&#146;s estate and
will be subject to IHT on death. However, on 29 January this year, HMRC
reversed its stated view on these schemes and declared that the
reservation of benefit rules did not apply and POAT did. That
announcement came just
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div>three days before the expiry of the 31 January deadline. Very few people
are likely to have seen the announcement in time to make the necessary
election, even setting aside the problems with the legality of such
elections in the absence of regulations. Many people will already have
self-assessed on the basis that no POAT was
due.</div>
					<a name="07052469000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Paymaster
General would say, if she were here, that those entering into reversion
release arrangements had tax avoidance in mind. Her response might be,
&#147;If you play with fire, you may get burned.&#148; Certainly,
we would not wish to defend such schemes and the Government are
justified in taking action against them. However, POAT is controversial
and, some would say, harsh in operation, and the Government have always
sought to mitigate the concern that they provoked by allowing people
involved with such schemes to opt out of POAT and back into IHT. In a
sense, POAT is meant as a deterrent, not as a tax in the ordinary sense
of the word.</div>
					<a name="07052469000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government are going to make good on their promise to allow elections,
they have to be flexible on timing, given the confusion caused by their
own complicated legislation and their last minute change of mind on
these schemes. It would be useful to have a clear statement from the
Minister that people affected by reversion release schemes will be
permitted to make a late election, where they submitted their tax
return thinking that they did not need to pay POAT because HMRC
guidance told them that they fell within the IHT regime instead. It
would be unfair to penalise people for not being in a position to make
an election in the three days between the announcement by HMRC that its
original guidance was incorrect and the expiry of the deadline. I am
told that the official HMRC guidance was not even corrected until
February this year, after the deadline had
expired.</div>
					<a name="07052469000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further
problems arise in relation to section 80 of the Finance Act 2006. Even
by the standards of POAT, section 80 and the changes it made to the
Finance Act 2004 are difficult to understand. Few lawyers, even
specialists, will know that someone is potentially caught by section
80, the stated goal of which was to apply the POAT regime to so-called
reverter-to-settlor trusts, which had been used as part of an IHT and
POAT avoidance scheme. Again, the objective of shutting down those
schemes is sensible and the Opposition would not dissent from it.
However, as I mentioned to the Committee last year during the debate on
the clause that became section 80, defects in drafting mean that it
goes beyond the stated goal and hits other trusts that have nothing to
do with IHT avoidance. Indeed, I am informed by those who understand
such matters better than I that some avoidance schemes may end up
falling outside the scope of section 80, while other arrangements,
where there is no tax planning involved, end up liable to a double
whammy of both POAT and IHT. There is a risk that few people will be
aware of the need to make an election, which is another vital reason to
give flexibility on late
elections.</div>
					<a name="07052469000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Society set out the situation as
follows:</div>
					<a name="07052469000238"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clause
65 introduces a right for a taxpayer to make a late election without
having to show a reasonable excuse&#151;but only at the discretion of
HMRC.&#148;</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div>
					<a name="07052469000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The background to that
is thought to be the official acknowledgement, in response to
representations, that the changes made by section 80 had a wider effect
than the policy to which they sought to give effect, leading to advice
from HMRC that many, but not all, of the innocent cases caught by the
excessively wide legislation could be resolved without practical
consequences by submitting an election under paragraph 21 or 22 of
schedule 15.</div>
					<a name="07052469000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
advice was provided, and published via STEP and the CIOT, only weeks
before the deadline for the first elections on 31 January 2007. In
responding to the concerns expressed by STEP, the CIOT and the Law
Society about section 80, HMRC has stated that problems caused by the
section can be dealt with by electing out of the POAT regime via an
election.</div>
					<a name="07052469000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">If election
is considered to be a solution, we need a clear commitment from the
Minister that, given the difficulty in ascertaining their legal
position in time for the 31 January deadline, those inadvertently
caught by section 80 will be able to make a late election. Even if such
a clear commitment is forthcoming, however, it will still be only a
sticking-plaster solution because, as the CIOT points out, the effects
of an election are not always straightforward, and what about
situations in which the POAT problem comes to light only after the
death of the settlor? Because an election cannot be made by personal
representatives, neither the original paragraph 23 of schedule 15 nor
the version amended by clause 65 would assist in that situation. If the
Government were to accept new clause 1, they would solve the underlying
problem with section 80 that prompted the Law Society to describe the
provision as &#147;excessively
wide&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07052469000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">STEP and
the CIOT have expressed grave concern that a clause that was introduced
to deal with reverter-to-settlor trusts should be used as a way of
imposing POAT liabilities on a property that is already subject to
inheritance tax. They have also expressed disappointment that the
Finance Bill takes no steps to correct the error in section 80 that I
pointed out to the Paymaster General in last year&#146;s
debate.</div>
					<a name="07052469000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem is
that section 80 inadvertently catches many settlor-interested trusts in
which the settlor had a life interest so would be subject to IHT on the
assets on his death anyway. That is because section 80 bites where
property has left a settlor&#146;s estate and then comes back to him.
That could happen in a number of circumstances that are not related to
reverter-to-settlor trusts or to tax planning at all.</div>
					<a name="07052469000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Contrary to the objective of
the POAT regime, in some cases section 80 hits trusts that do not avoid
IHT and were not set up to do so. It actually imposes a POA charge even
where IHT is already payable, leading to potential double taxation. The
CIOT suggests</div>
					<a name="07052469000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the
legislation should be retroactively amended so as to catch only the
intended target.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052469000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Few
settlors will have been made aware of the need to make an election,
because the issue was published by the CIOT and the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales only in January
2007.</div>
					<a name="07052469000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						New
clause 1 seeks to bring that about by amending paragraph 11 of schedule
15 to the Finance Act 2004 to correct the defective drafting in section
80. It would insert a new sub-paragraph (12A) in paragraph 11 to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 382</div>ensure that the provisions will not apply where it is the settlor who
has the life interest in the property. My reasons for tabling the new
clause are as follows. Looking at the background to section 80, the
press notice that announced the measure in the pre-Budget report 2005
is headed &#147;Pre-Owned Assets...and Reverter to Settlor
trusts&#148;. The term &#147;reverter-to-settlor&#148; is
generally used to describe a trust in which the trust property reverts
to the settlor or his spouse after termination of another
beneficiary&#146;s interest in
possession.</div>
					<a name="07052469000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
text of the pre-Budget report press notice on section 80 is consistent
with that definition of a reverter-to-settlor trust. It specifically
refers to sections 53 and 54 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984, which are
the sections that exempt the trust from inheritance tax otherwise
payable on termination of another beneficiary&#146;s life interest.
The drafting error is that the changes made by section 80 apply not
only to trusts in which the life tenant is another beneficiary, but
also to those in which the life tenant is the settlor himself. Where
section 80 applies, it removes the exemption from the pre-owned asset
charge otherwise applicable where the taxpayer is treated as
beneficially entitled to the relevant property for the purposes of
IHT.</div>
					<a name="07052469000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The trusts
affected include a number of old-style marriage settlements, some of
which could date back as far as the late 1980s. The most common problem
would arise where a settlor has given assets to a family member but for
some unexpected reason, perhaps a bereavement, the assets return to his
estate. The CIOT described section 80 as incurring &#147;an absurd
result&#148;,
saying:</div>
					<a name="07052469000240"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
whole point of pre-owned asset tax is to tax assets which a settlor or
donor enjoys despite them not being in his estate for IHT purposes. By
definition, it is not a tax on property to which a settlor or donor is
treated as beneficially entitled, as such property is fully subject to
inheritance tax in their
hands&#148;.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07052469000247"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div>
					<a name="07052469000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC has stated
that the CIOT&#146;s fears are exaggerated, because section 80 does
not apply if the life interest of the settlor has existed at all times
since the inception of the trust. That interpretation provides a degree
of comfort, and it would be useful if the Minister could confirm it on
the record today. However, I do not think that it will save those
settlements that started as discretionary trusts and where the settlor
was granted a life interest at a later
date.</div>
					<a name="07052469000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Accepting new
clause 1 would provide a much clearer and firmer protection than merely
relying on HMRC&#146;s interpretation of the words &#147;at any
subsequent time&#148; in sub-paragraph 11 of schedule 15. It would
also remove many concerns about late elections. I urge the Minister to
consider it seriously&#151;if not today, then for next year&#146;s
Finance
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07052469000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
211 was prompted by a concern expressed by the Law Society, which felt
that people should have the option to elect out of the pre-owned asset
tax in future years. They might choose to pay the tax initially, their
financial circumstances might change and the commitment to pay
pre-owned asset tax might become more difficult. The flexibility to opt
out in future years and back into the IHT regime would be useful. It
would not affect liability for tax in the early 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 383</div>years, and it could increase the range of assets available to be taxed
under IHT on the death of the relevant
person.</div>
					<a name="07052469000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
212 follows on from another suggestion by the Law Society, which is
concerned that HMRC&#146;s powers in such matters are not subject to
review or appeal. The Law Society feels that it should be possible to
appeal against a decision by HMRC to refuse a late election. Again, we
feel that that is a common-sense proposal that the Government would do
well to consider.</div>
					<a name="07052469000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
clause stand part, I shall address two important points. The first
concerns timing. Subsection (2) provides that clause 65 is deemed to
have come into force on 21 March 2007. Are elections made between 31
January 2007 and 21 March 2007 governed by the old rules or the new?
Will they be subject to the test in the present statute or the amended
test? Arguably, they remain late after the 21 March deadline.
Therefore, if HMRC has not yet made any decision on them, they should
be subject to the new, amended criteria rather than the unamended
provisions in statute.</div>
					<a name="07052469000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is particularly important to
take into account late elections made between the 31 January deadline
and 21 March because of the timing problems that I described
in relation to reversionary leases and the changes made to the HMRC
guidance. It would be useful to have the Minister&#146;s guidance on
the status of late elections made before 21 March
2007.</div>
					<a name="07052469000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">My last point is
another highlighted by STEP and the COIT. It is a matter of concern
that the Government have not used this Finance Bill to correct another
significant flaw in the POAT regime, one to which I drew the
Committee&#146;s attention last year. It concerns equity release.
Where, for example, a parent sells half a house to one of their
children, it will result in a POAT charge on the deemed rental income.
That is the case even where the proceeds of sale are kept by the parent
and subject to inheritance tax on their death. However, no such charge
arises where an identical transaction is carried out with a bank or
other commercial provider of equity release schemes.</div>
					<a name="07052469000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CIOT
says:</div>
					<a name="07052469000241"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
remain unconvinced that such a transaction is a suitable target for
anti-avoidance legislation and believe that this will catch many
&#145;ordinary hard-working families&#146; where the parent is
trying to raise funds for an equity release and does not want to go to
a commercial provider, some of whom do not have a good financial
reputation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052469000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware
that the Treasury does not consider that that would cause significant
problems, presumably on the grounds that it believes that equity
release arrangements are fairly uncommon&#151;particularly as
informal arrangements within families. However, the Minister is, I
know, well aware of the expected increase in the use of equity release.
The Economic Secretary himself has emphasised its importance when
debating a new regulatory structure before the relevant Delegated
Legislation Committee.</div>
					<a name="07052469000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">In an era of a growing
pensioner population, the need to find ways to unlock
and use the equity in the family home without having to sell is likely
to increase. Given the potentially high charges and interest rates that
can be levied on equity release transactions by
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div>commercial providers it would not be surprising for a number of families
to seek to solve the problem between themselves, without necessarily
using a bank or other commercial provider. Sales of the whole of the
property&#151;100 per cent. of the equity&#151;are exempt from POA,
and therefore it seems odd and arbitrary to treat sales of part of the
property differently.</div>
					<a name="07052469000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is real concern that
people might undertake such arrangements and go to an ordinary
solicitor with no understanding or awareness of the possibility of a
POA problem. If HMRC is worried about the possibility of avoidance, and
the proceeds of the equity release being given away and passing out of
the relevant person&#146;s estate, it would surely be possible to
draft provisions that would ensure that the POA charge would still
apply in such a
case.</div>
					<a name="07052469000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,
the POAT regime remains highly controversial and, as has been pointed
out, could apply in a range of situations in which those involved were
not motivated by a wish to avoid inheritance tax and were wholly
unaware of the possibility of a POA charge. Its complex nature means
that even seasoned professionals find it difficult to
understand&#151;even Ministers of the Crown may sometimes have a
problem working out what it means. An average high street solicitor is
very unlikely to have the expertise needed to advise people on whether
there is a POAT risk in transactions that may be no more than attempts
to give financial assistance to parents or simply an incidental effect
of family living
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07052469000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
a real risk that people will stumble into the regime unknowingly and
accidentally. Clause 65 is an inadequate response to the serious
problems with schedule 15 of the Finance Act 2004 and
I hope that the Government will consider more wide- ranging reforms in
future, as well as the Opposition
amendments.</div>

&#147;Shame&#148;, but I see no point in repeating arguments that

However, I have a few points to make, and I will be brief.</div>
					<a name="07052469000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">There were warnings during
consideration of last year&#146;s Finance Bill that people would be
caught inadvertently and that the legislation was too wide. Broadly,
clause 65 is intended to narrow the definition so that people will not
be caught in that way. It has been generally welcomed. I note the
change from reasonable excuse to the discretion of HMRC. On that basis,
will HMRC publish guidance about how and in what situations it would
exercise discretion? Will there be an appeals process if the late
election is refused?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 385</div>
					<a name="07052469000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
want to draw attention to the question of changes in
circumstances. What happens if the circumstances of
the individual change? The circumstances of someone who initially
elected to pay income tax might change so that they could not afford to
do so. What scope would there be for that individual to opt into the
inheritance tax system simply because their income could not sustain
the payments that they would be expected to
make?</div>
					<a name="07052469000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, in all
such cases, we are talking about assets that are above the inheritance
tax threshold. My concern is what happens when someone inadvertently
falls into the inheritance tax threshold after the point at which the
asset has been transferred. They may not initially be eligible, but
they may fall into such circumstances. At what point are they expected
to make the
election?</div>

							<a name="07052469000309"></a>
								Ed
Balls:
						</b> As the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet said, this
is a complex area. I am grateful to her for setting out, eloquently and
comprehensively, the issues, which have helped me to focus my remarks
more effectively than I would otherwise have done. I will not go
through the background to the clause, as that has already been done at
length. As the hon. Lady said, and as members of the Committee will now
therefore be aware, the Government have received representations from
professional groups that are concerned about individuals who did not
realise that they were liable to the POAT charge or the deadline for
making an election for the asset in question to be treated as if it
were subject to inheritance tax. In such situations, taxpayers will
unknowingly build up arrears of income tax.</div>
					<a name="07052469000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the representations
have provided no firm evidence of a significant problem, the Government
recognise the concerns. The clause will allow HMRC to use its
discretion to accept elections for inheritance tax treatment in cases
that would otherwise be too late. The change has been welcomed by tax
professionals and representatives of other groups, and I commend the
clause to the Committee.</div>
					<a name="07052469000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition amendment No. 211
seeks to provide that a taxpayer may initially pay the POAT charge but
decide in a later year to elect for inheritance tax treatment going
forward. The original provisions allow people sufficient time to decide
how they want to deal with existing arrangements, including whether to
make an election. Anyone knowingly entering a new scheme is able to
make a fully informed decision. Clause 65 allows HMRC to use its
discretion to accept elections after the prescribed time limit where
the taxpayer was unaware that they were liable to the POAT
charge.</div>
					<a name="07052469000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our view,
amendment No. 211 would give people who have entered into arrangements
to avoid inheritance tax an each-way bet. If they initially chose to
pay the POAT charge but then found that their circumstances had
changed, it would enable them to elect instead for inheritance tax
treatment. In those circumstances, we do not think that there is good
reason to enable arrangements to be revisited. That is why we urge the
Committee to reject the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07052469000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No. 119, the POAT
rules provide that an election must be made in a manner prescribed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>by regulations. No such regulations have yet been made, which we regret.
That is an oversight on the part of HMRC. However, HMRC has consulted
its lawyers about the validity of elections that it has already
received. The advice that it has been given is that all timeous
elections received&#151;whether using the form that HMRC provided or
simply giving all the necessary information&#151;can be accepted as
validly made.</div>
					<a name="07052469000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC
will update its guidance accordingly, and intends that regulations will
be made shortly to prescribe the form of elections for future
use.</div>

					<a name="07052469000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition amendment No. 119
seeks to address the matter by providing that any election already made
shall be deemed to have been made in the prescribed manner. We have
consulted our lawyers, and I think that I have now made our position on
the matter clear. We have explained to representative groups that have
raised the issue with us that we shall update our guidance accordingly,
and make regulations shortly. We do not think that it would be sensible

						</b> I think that I just explained it to the hon. Lady.
I did not take the intervention because I wanted to set out the
position. HMRC has consulted lawyers about the validity of elections
and their advice is that all elections received, whether people are
using the form provided by HMRC or simply giving all necessary
information, can be accepted as validly made. I have said that I regret
this oversight and that it will be addressed. Indeed, we have already
published the draft guidance. We need to get the position on the
regulations sorted out, but in our judgment we do not need to
complicate the position unnecessarily, given that a number of people
have already made
elections.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052469000315"></a>Ed
Balls:
						</b> Well, as I said, whether elections are made on the
form provided by HMRC or by giving all the necessary information, they
will be accepted as valid. On that basis, our legal advice is that we
do not need to accept the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07052469000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition
amendment No. 212 would introduce an appeal route to the special
commissioners if HMRC were to refuse to accept an election outside the
prescribed time limit. When introducing POAT in 2004, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div>the Government recognised that a taxpayer may have a reasonable excuse
for not making their election on time. That is why the original
provisions allowed HMRC to accept late elections in those cases. The
draft guidance that has been produced in connection with clause 65
makes it clear that it will continue to do so.</div>
					<a name="07052469000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">This year, we have gone further
by proposing, in clause 65, to allow HMRC to accept late elections from
taxpayers, but as the guidance also explains, HMRC will not accept a
late election from a taxpayer who has knowingly decided neither to make
an election on time nor to declare a benefit from a pre-owned asset.
Those are not the sorts of cases that should properly be subject to an
appeal to the special commissioners and beyond. That is why the
amendment is not
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07052469000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 1 would provide an exemption from POAT where the assets in
question are effectively back in the taxpayer&#146;s inheritance tax
estate by virtue of their having acquired an interest in possession.
Committee members may remember that the Government amended the rules
last year to prevent schemes that were being used to exploit existing
exemptions to avoid both POAT and inheritance tax charges. Some of
those schemes were being used to resurrect avoidance schemes that were
caught by the POAT charges when they were first
introduced.</div>
					<a name="07052469000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
aware of representations received by HMRC suggesting that the
amendments to section 80 of last year&#146;s Finance Act may apply
more widely than that. Those concerns do not generally arise in
connection with the disposals made on or after 26 March 2006 because of
the changes to IHT rules for trusts, which were also introduced last
year. Moreover, HMRC has already made it clear to representative bodies
that there is no effect on a range of innocent transactions where
taxpayers have put assets into trust for their own benefit before that
date.</div>
					<a name="07052469000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has also been
suggested that a small number of cases may have been caught that
involve complex arrangements put in place by non-UK domiciliaries to
avoid paying UK IHT that would otherwise arise on UK property. The
effect of new clause 1 in those cases would be that neither an income
tax charge nor a UK inheritance tax charge would ever arise. It would
not be appropriate to introduce such special treatment for such cases.
To the extent that they are now subject to the income tax charge, it
has been open to those affected to elect instead that the assets in
question should be subject to inheritance tax. Furthermore, if they
were unaware of their liability and the need to make an election before
January 2007, they can benefit from the provisions in the clause.
Therefore, a further provision is not appropriate. We ask the Committee
to reject the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="07052469000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should just
like to answer some questions asked by the hon. Member for Chipping
Barnet. The clause would give HMRC discretion, from 21 March, to
consider any election that should have been made by 31 January, but
which was not, whether or not there is reasonable excuse. That would be
the case under the new rules, not the old rules, so late elections made
prior to 21 March will be accepted. As I have explained, we do not need
to amend the provisions to allow the previous requirement for elections
to be removed because we have made our legal position clear on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div>legality of those elections. Therefore, for HMRC to accept all late
elections would be both wrong and unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="07052469000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked by the hon. Member
for Chipping Barnet whether I could give guidance on when we would
accept late elections. As I have said, we have already published draft
guidance on that matter. The hon. Lady stressed the complexity of the
POA rules. She is right about that. As we have seen from her speech,
that complexity is driven by the inventiveness of people trying to use
the provisions for avoidance. Most people will therefore know when they
are benefiting from assets that are subject to charge, but there are
some people who have rearranged their affairs without aiming to avoid
inheritance tax. At the same time, they may not be aware of the
deadlines. That is why we have introduced this discretion through the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07052469000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Representative
bodies such as STEP say there are interpretive problems, according to
the hon. Lady. That is why we have worked with those bodies which have
an interest in those matters, including the Chartered Institute of
Taxation and the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, to provide revised
guidance on the internet. I am aware that representations have been
made, asking for changes to the tax return itself. I understand that
HMRC has responded positively to those representations and that the
return will in future make specific reference to the charge and direct
taxpayers to the relevant parts of the guidance. I am sure that that
will be welcomed.</div>
					<a name="07052469000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady asked whether we are unwittingly catching taxpayers with the
changes to reverter-to-settlor trusts in the Finance Act 2006. We are
aware that a small number of cases may have been caught, but they
mainly involve complex arrangements. However, as I said, those were the
non-UK domiciliaries, and we do not think that it would be appropriate
to exempt them from the provisions of the Finance Bill.</div>
					<a name="07052469000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Chipping

can be solved by election. There may be instances in which the problem

					<a name="07052469000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Chipping
Barnet asked me about the particular example of the sales of houses,
which we discussed at length last year. As she knows, the original
rules provide an exemption for the owner of an asset who sells their
whole interest in the asset on arm&#146;s length terms and continues
to enjoy it. Subsequent regulation extended that exemption to certain
sales of a part-interest: for example, part-sales at arm&#146;s
length. In general, it is not appropriate to provide exemption for
sales of a part-interest, which are made in ways other than at

However, if it is true, it is certainly very welcome. I welcome his
specific assurances on the position of late elections in relation to
reversionary lease schemes. I emphasise that I will withdraw the
amendment that heads the group, but I would like a vote on amendment
No. 119 because I continue to be concerned that the Government have
failed to address a number of important problems for the POAT
regime.</div>
