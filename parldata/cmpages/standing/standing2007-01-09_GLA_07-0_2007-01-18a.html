Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Jim
Fitzpatrick):
						</b> Good morning, Mr. O&#146;Hara.
It is good to see you presiding over our proceedings. I am sure that I
speak for the whole Committee when I say that we are sorry to hear that
this is the last sitting over which you will be presiding, because I am
sure that we shall be engaged all the way through to our closure next
Tuesday evening. We are grateful for your assistance in keeping us
focused and on
course.</div>
					<a name="07011848000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 38
places a duty on the Mayor and the assembly to address climate change.
I am not sure who has arranged the weather for the debate today, but it
is clearly appropriate. The Mayor is required under the duty to take
action to help mitigate and adapt to climate change. He is also
required to take the Government&#146;s climate change policy into
account when exercising any of his statutory functions. He must comply
with any guidance or directions issued by the Secretary of State in
performing that
duty.</div>
					<a name="07011848000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The assembly is
required under the duty to take into account the Government&#146;s
climate change policy when exercising any of its statutory functions.
It is also required to comply with any guidance or directions on
climate change in respect of how it performs it
duties.</div>
					<a name="07011848000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The duty will
ensure that action to tackle climate change is taken by the Mayor and
the assembly on an enduring basis in Greater London. In fulfilling that
duty, the Mayor can draw on his existing wide-ranging powers under the
Greater London Authority Act 1999 to promote the improvement of the
environment in fulfilling the duty. The requirement for the Mayor and
the assembly to comply with any guidance or directions by the Secretary
of State in respect of how the duty is performed will stop any damaging
conflict between GLA policies and the Government&#146;s policies in
addressing climate change. A unified and consistent policy approach is
necessary to optimise carbon reduction and adaptation to climate
change.</div>

Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): I support the
clause, but I want to clarify whether the Minister believes that the
duty that will be placed on the Mayor in respect of climate change will
be applicable to other mayors in future. Let us suppose, for example,
that Birmingham chose to go down the mayoral route. Will the clause be
setting a precedent and is it something that the Minister thinks it

Gove:
						</b> What a pleasure it has been to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr. O&#146;Hara. Conservative Members wish
to associate ourselves entirely with the comments of the Minister. You
have been a gentle and helpful Chairman and, speaking for my part, it
will be a great pity that we shall not be serving under your
chairmanship after this morning&#146;s sitting. Thank you very
much.</div>
					<a name="07011848000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment
was tabled in a constructive spirit, as the hon. Member for Carshalton
and Wallington explained. We are broadly in agreement with the
principles behind the enhancement and clarification of the
Mayor&#146;s role in combating climate change. The Minister made an
appropriate reference to the roiling waters of the Thames outside and
to the inclement weather that we face today. On my way here this
morning, I was listening to a debate on the &#147;Today&#148;
programme between two advocates of different approaches to climate
change, as I imagine were many hon. Members. One person was arguing
that climate change was perhaps not as much due to man-made causes as
might have been attested; the other was arguing that climate change was
primarily an anthropomorphic phenomenon. For the benefit of the
Committee, that means that we are responsible for it to a significant
extent.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 273</div>
					<a name="07011848000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The scientific consensus, as
attested by the intergovernmental panel on climate change, is that our
problems of climate change are to a significant extent man-made. In the
House, and across all parties, there is broad acceptance that
man&#146;s actions&#151;and how, among other things, we produce
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>&#151;are contributing to the greenhouse effect and
therefore to changes in climate. As Nicholas Stern pointed out in his
report, such changes will, if unchecked, cause dramatic and devastating
effects on not only the quality of life of people in this country and
elsewhere, but our future gross domestic
product.</div>
					<a name="07011848000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has often
been suggested that there must be a direct trade-off between action on
climate change and economic growth. However, as Nicholas Stern pointed
out, unless one takes prudent action to tackle climate change, our
future economic growth and prosperity will suffer. Some who have rung
the alarm bell on climate change are pressing on us policies that might
well have a deleterious effect on economic growth. An appropriate
balance has to be struck and appropriate sensitivities have to be
respected. We recognise that a significant role has to be played by not
only the national Government but international
institutions.</div>
					<a name="07011848000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Elsewhere
in this House, there is lively debate about what the national
Government can do through taxation. The Minister for Housing and
Planning will be aware of the controversy attached to some of the
Treasury proposals&#151;those relating to the cost of flying, for
example, have been criticised by some as doing too little and being
insufficiently effective in targeting aviation emissions.</div>
					<a name="07011848000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">More broadly, attention has
been drawn to the fact that while the Chancellor of the Exchequer has
been in office, the proportion of taxation from environmental sources
has declined. That has led my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney
(Mr. Cameron) to describe the Chancellor as a fossil-fuel
Chancellor in a carbon-conscious
age.</div>
					<a name="07011848000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
absolutely agree with one of the Government&#146;s points: whatever
steps one takes on taxation, international measures have to be taken as
well. We must pay close attention to the whole principle of carbon
trading. One of the questions that the whole House has to address is
the fact that the current carbon trading system run by the European
Union is not necessarily achieving the goals that it should. Trenchant
criticisms of the emissions trading system have been made by the
think-tank Open Europe. They relate to the fact that public sector
institutions have had to pay a significant amount into the system,
while some major energy companies have succeeded in making a profit
from it.</div>
					<a name="07011848000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
interested in the Minister&#146;s view on how, for example, NHS
institutions could be more effectively protected and safeguarded in
respect of the operation of the carbon trading system. A number of
people think that money allocated to the NHS or other public services
should not be used&#151;as it has been under the carbon trading
system&#151;effectively to enrich energy companies. Any guidance that
the Minister could give us on how London&#146;s taxpayers and public
services could be better shielded in an enhanced carbon trading system
will be appreciated.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011848000180"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would also be
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s views on whether action should
be taken on not only the international and national levels, but the
individual level, so that we take action such as ensuring that our
homes are properly insulated, switching to vehicles with lower
emissions or possibly even flying
less.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011848000181"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has passed the ball to me in a
silky way. I am afraid that the Prime Minister seems to have left an
open goal; some of his recent references to the level of leisure flying
that he wishes to continue to enjoy when out of office have suggested a
public concern about the mismatch between the rhetoric of some people
in public life who enjoin the seriousness of climate change on us all,
and their personal habits, which do not
match.</div>
					<a name="07011848000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to personalise the debate unnecessarily, but I want to emphasise the
important point made by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington.
I have spoken about national and international obligations, but it is
also important that we recognise local and personal ones. I shall come
to those in due
course.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011848000182"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is moving
on. It is an eloquent statement of the national and global
context&#151;I point out that the Mayor of London drives a
Prius&#151;but I hope that the hon. Gentleman is coming to the London
climate change mitigation and energy
strategy.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011848000183"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> As ever, I am grateful for your guidance,
Mr. O&#146;Hara. My point about carbon trading is that it
has an effect on some of the institutions on which London relies and
the taxes and precepts that Londoners pay. Any guidance on how the
London climate change mitigation strategy might have an impact on
broader negotiations about a European and global carbon trading scheme
would be illuminating for the Committee and for
Londoners.</div>
					<a name="07011848000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On
the key question of the personal contribution that we can all make, I
am grateful to you, Mr. O&#146;Hara, for pointing out that
the Mayor does his bit&#151;he is a conspicuous user of public
transport and he drives a Prius. We know&#151;it was a recent subject
of controversy in the Greater London assembly yesterday&#151;that the
Mayor himself has been engaging in a variety of foreign trips recently.
A new clause, to which we will come later, specifically discusses the
Mayor&#146;s foreign policy. During debate on it, we will have an
opportunity to discuss not just the mismatch between what the Mayor
says about climate change and the actions of the Mayor and some of his
officers, but the mismatch between his commitment to making London an
effective multicultural and global city and some of his
policies.</div>

							<a name="07011848000184"></a>The

that the hon. Gentleman is enthusiastic to talk about mismatches, does

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011848000186"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I am grateful to you, Mr. O&#146;Hara,
for making that point. As we all know, there are two potential next
Prime Ministers&#151;the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and
Cowdenbeath (Mr. Brown) and the right hon. Member for Witney
(Mr. Cameron)&#151;and I invite the House to reflect which
of the two has been seen more often on a bicycle, under whatever
circumstances. <i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">] </i>Yes, it probably is
very poor, but nevertheless the Minister invited me down that road, so
I felt I had to go, even though I was rather wobbly as I went down it
and probably needed stabilisers, not to mention a pannier full of
better arguments. I hope that the Committee will bear with
me.</div>
					<a name="07011848000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment
would give the Mayor of London an appropriate degree of flexibility. We
understand why the Bill contains prescriptive clauses and subsections,
and we appreciate the Government&#146;s good intentions in framing
them. However, the Conservatives believe that it is important to
recognise that when it comes to combating climate change, not only are
specific policies appropriate to specific regions but specific policies
might be appropriate and could be piloted by individual
boroughs.</div>
					<a name="07011848000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment would insert into the Bill a provision stating that it is
important that the Mayor&#146;s strategy be in conformity with
policies. We accept the Secretary of State&#146;s role in setting an
appropriate strategy and overall targets, but we want to give the Mayor
greater flexibility. When it comes to combating climate change, we
believe that it is important that we apply the principle of localism,
diversity, pluralism and, through pluralism, greater
innovation.</div>
					<a name="07011848000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">As you
pointed out in your helpful intervention, Mr. O&#146;Hara,
of all the UK&#146;s politicians, the Mayor has probably been in
advance of most and more energetic than many in pressing the need to
tackle climate change. In that respect, particularly given the impetus
behind the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Regent's Park and
Kensington, North, we can expect that this Mayor&#151;and, I
confidently expect, future Mayors&#151;may well be anxious to press
ahead with particular policies, suggestions and strategy aspects that
are more innovative than national policy.</div>
					<a name="07011848000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the reasons why I
suspect that that might be so is that London has a critical mass, which
is almost inevitably likely to grow, of voters who are conscious of the
need to tackle the problem and aware that because of the city&#146;s
congestion, the population flow into it and the high economic growth
that it enjoys, the challenges of climate change are particularly acute
in the capital. More than that, those of us who listened to the
&#147;Today&#148; programme may have heard Damon Albarn and Peter
Ackroyd discussing the city&#146;s significance and culture,
particularly the role of the Thames&#151;the river of tears, as Peter
Ackroyd called
it.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07011848000150"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div>
					<a name="07011848000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the key
points that Peter Ackroyd made is that the London Thames barrier, which
I think was meant to be raised only once every seven or eight years,
has recently been raised seven or eight times a year. There is a great
deal of speculation about whether the support and protection that the
Thames barrier provides to London is adequate. Given that it is there
as a bulwark against one of the potentially catastrophic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 276</div>effects of climate change, any future Mayor is bound to have a keener
appreciation than other local or national politicians of the impact of
climate change on the people whom he serves. In that respect, we
believe that the Mayor&#151;influenced by the boroughs and by the
GLA&#151;should have greater freedom to set a
strategy.</div>

						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that giving the Mayor
greater flexibility and greater strength&#151;strengthening his hand

specifically to water and the Mayor&#146;s role in that
respect?</div>

Gove:
						</b> I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who points
out that my party and the Liberal Democrats have
alternative&#151;they do not really compete&#151;suggestions on how
the Mayor&#146;s powers might be enhanced in relation to water and
sewerage and the role that those two factors play in a broader approach
to climate and demographic change in
London.</div>
					<a name="07011848000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall
indeed have an opportunity to discuss the new clauses in greater
detail. However, I want to emphasise more broadly the fact that
although there have been disagreements across the Floor about the
balance of power between the Mayor and the assembly, as well as that
between the Mayor and the boroughs, in almost every area where power is
or could be passed to the Mayor, or where the powers of the assembly
and of the authority overall could be enhanced, we have been
supportive.</div>
					<a name="07011848000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
interesting things about this part of the Bill&#151;the final
quarter, as it were&#151;is that a number of amendments tabled by my
party and the Liberal Democrats would enhance the Mayor&#146;s
powers. I look forward to some of them being spoken to later by my hon.
Friends, and I hope that that gives the lie to any suggestion that the
Minister may attempt to make, though I am sure she would not, that we
are somehow opposed either to the Mayor&#146;s office or to the
devolutionary principle behind the Bill and the original 1999
Act.</div>
					<a name="07011848000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">On climate
change, my final point is that the rallying cry of the original green
movement was to think globally and act locally. The first part of that
is a point that we appreciate absolutely. The second part, we feel, is
given insufficient weight in the Bill. It is through innovation that we
can respond to the specific circumstances that London faces.</div>
					<a name="07011848000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">At this point, I want to pay an
uncharacteristic tribute to the Minister for Housing and Planning. In
interviews with the <i class="I">Evening Standard</i> and <i class="I">The Observer</i>,
she has pointed out some creative ways in which one might deal with
climate change: growing grass on the roofs of houses, and ensuring that
new build more accurately reflects the requirement to remain warm in
winter and cool in summer&#151;we can learn from Mediterranean styles
of architecture on that. Different people have different views about
the applicability of those policies, but it is right that the Minister
for Housing and Planning should be prepared to think outside the
ministerial red box and put forward such proposals.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 277</div>
					<a name="07011848000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that it is entirely
appropriate, not least given the powers over housing and planning that
the Mayor is likely to receive through the Bill, that the Mayor should
have similar freedom to explore creative ideas through his strategy.
Not all of them might necessarily win central Government approval,
which is why we consider the greater freedom conveyed by our amendment
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07011848000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
supported the Government when they sought to deny the Mayor the
specific powers that he wanted concerning waste. We believe that what
the Minister takes away with one hand he may give with the other, and
that he may therefore support the
amendment.</div>

Baker</b> (Lewes) (LD): What a delight it is, Mr.
O&#146;Hara, to see you in the Chair, and a delight also that we are
at last talking about climate change on a regular basis. Whenever we
discuss legislation now, there always seems to be some climate change
aspect to it, which is entirely right and proper. I must reflect on the
fact that those of us who were warning of the dangers of climate change
some 10 or 15 years ago faced accusations of being bedecked in sandals
and beards, and other such
allegations.</div>

						</b> Indeed, my party in totality was talking about
climate change some 10 or 15 years ago, and we were told that it was
not happening, it was not important, that we were making it up and we
were scaremongering. I am delighted to see that the subject is now
mainstream and everyone has caught up with
us.</div>
					<a name="07011848000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">When it comes to
the clause, our amendment is not dissimilar to the one that the hon.
Member for Surrey Heath moved a moment ago, and we have tabled our
amendment for similar reasons. We do not think it appropriate for
central Government to be so prescriptive about what they expect the
Mayor, or indeed any local authority, to do. There are local
circumstances in which locally elected politicians are best able to
respond to the challenges that their area faces. They know their
circumstances, and they are more attuned to the needs of their area
than people sitting in Whitehall, even if, as in this case, the seat of
national Government happens to be in the area of the local authority
concerned.</div>
					<a name="07011848000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Mayor were to follow national policies, he might end up having weaker
policies than if he followed his own. Also, he might end up not
tackling climate change in the way that he felt was most effective or
would be more effective. For example, he is expected to follow national
policy on surface transport. Figures in parliamentary answers that I
have received from the Department for Transport indicate that since the
Government came to power, the overall costs of travelling by bus have
risen significantly above inflation&#151;I think by about 10 per
cent. The cost of travelling by train has risen similarly, and there
was another big increase in rail fares in the past couple of weeks. The
cost of motoring, however, has gone down by about 10 per cent. Those
are the Government&#146;s own figures, and I am always happy to
believe such figures.</div>

								Mr.
Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): Does the hon.
Gentleman agree that one of the problems in London is precisely down to
the rise in bus fares? Since 2000, a single bus fare has gone up from
60p to &#163;2, which is directly the result of the policies of the
current Mayor.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011848000193"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> I am not sure that we would agree with that. To be
fair, the Mayor has succeeded in reducing road transport in central
London twice in 30 years. He did so with his &#147;fares
fair&#148; policy in 1981, which I think was successful. I was, in
fact, working as a director for a company at that point. Driving around
London, I saw the roads free up overnight. It was a remarkable
achievement. He has also reduced road transport by introducing the
congestion charge, which undoubtedly has moved people on to public
transport. </div>
					<a name="07011848000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The cost
of bus fares has become unacceptably high&#151;that is perfectly
true&#151;but I would not necessarily blame the Mayor for that
because there are other factors involved. Moreover, he has introduced
measures, not least the Oyster card, that have increased the number of
bus
passengers.</div>

circumstance.</div>
					<a name="07011848000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
argument that I want to deploy on climate change is that whatever the
failings of the Mayor&#151;there are some, which I have referred to
under different circumstances&#151;one thing he has done is highlight
the need to tackle climate change. He has introduced measures to
improve public transport&#151;not once, but twice in his
career&#151;and they have worked. He is probably the only person in
Britain, effectively, to oversee a marked decrease in road traffic in
an area for which he is responsible. We need to accept that that is a
reality.</div>
					<a name="07011848000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My
concern with the clause is that if the Mayor is expected to follow
national policies, he will be stymied in introducing measures.
Presumably, the Government&#146;s national policy is to allow the
cost of motoring to decrease in real terms, to cave in to fuel
protesters when they are out on the streets and to jack up the cost of
travelling by train as an alternative to providing more infrastructure
to enable people to come into London. We are back to the old British
Rail policy of pricing people off the
trains.</div>

introduced 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 279</div>

Baker:
						</b> That is the case. I do not think that any political
party, including the Liberal Democrats, came out of the episode with
much credit. Collectively, we were not prepared to face up to that
particular problem. As a consequence, we believed the headlines that
said motorists were being penalised, when the Government&#146;s
figures showed that that was not the case. When the protesters were out
on the streets, the cost of motoring had been decreasing. It was a sad
episode and we might all have dealt with it differently.</div>
					<a name="07011848000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Mayor has a record of
moving people on to public transport&#151;one that I would like to be
pursued further&#151;and I do not think that requiring him to follow
national policies relating to surface transport will help in that
respect.</div>

							<b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): The hon. Gentleman
referred to the Mayor&#146;s desire to persuade people on to public
transport, which all of us accept and agree with, but does he share the
concern about the precise manner in which the Mayor has persuaded
people on to public transport, in particular the way he has negotiated
the bus contracts? The contracts involve increased ridership, but on a
basis that rewards kilometres travelled rather than passengers carried.
Transport for London has revealed that the average load on a London bus
is 14 passengers.

Karen Buck</b> (Regent's Park and Kensington, North) (Lab):
Pursuing that line of argument, does the hon. Gentleman agree that the
logic of the official Opposition&#146;s position is that bus services
would concentrate exclusively on high-demand routes and that,
consequently, the outer suburbs and communities otherwise poorly served
by public transport, as well as areas where buses run at night, would
be denuded of services? Perhaps the official Opposition should make it
clear whether that is their
position.</div>

							<a name="07011848000203"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> It would useful to have a debate on bus
deregulation, but that is probably beyond the Committee&#146;s remit.
When the changes to bus regulation were made in 1986, the situation
described by the hon. Lady was exactly what came about. London is a lot
better off for buses than East Sussex, which has seen a dramatic drop
in ridership. People find it very difficult to catch a bus to a rural
area in my constituency, which is outside Brighton and Hove and the
main city centre, as a direct consequence of bus deregulation. London,
of course, is regulated differently. It is important that we have a
system outside the capital in which there is a centrally determined
division of routes, rather than the free-for-all, which does not
work.</div>

							<b class="B">Martin
Linton</b> (Battersea) (Lab): That is the crucial point. It is
comforting to hear the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst talking
about bus stops. He is unlike his predecessor, who probably never
travelled on a bus, but is it not the logic of his remarks about us
needing higher bus ridership that precisely the services he would
advocate&#151;buses to Biggin Hill or Pratts Bottom or wherever in
his constituency&#151;would have to be withdrawn because they
probably have low
ridership?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011848000205"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> One of the keys to increasing the ridership of
buses is the frequency of the service. Outside London, though not in
Brighton and Hove, there is a vicious circle in which the number of
passengers falls, the frequency falls, and the service is less
reliable, so still fewer people use it. The only people using the
service in the end are those with no alternative. That is not the
vision I wish to see.</div>
					<a name="07011848000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Increasing the frequency and
reliability of buses, not the chopping and changing of routes that
occurs outside London, is the way to bring forward extra passengers. If
we have services that are underused, marketing them better is
preferable to cutting them. This, however, is not simply a matter of
surface transport. According to the clause, the Mayor is expected to
follow national energy policy, but he has a different view on that. He
certainly has a different view on incineration and energy from waste,
and is in the middle of an argument with the Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs about it. It is for the Mayor or
the London boroughs&#151;we could argue about that division&#151;to
decide on waste policy; it is not for the Government to determine it
for them. The Mayor is expected to adopt a policy different from his
own, which is not decentralisation, localism or responsibility at local
level, but national diktat. I do not want to support such a policy,
particularly when it is
wrong.</div>

contribution so far, and I apologise for being a few minutes late. I
was distracted by this morning&#146;s news on the radio that Eric
Black, formerly of Aberdeen, has just been appointed manager of
Coventry. However, may I ask the hon. Member for Lewes why, in the
powerful case he is making, which moves considerably faster than the
River Ouse flowing through his constituency, he is proposing to delete
these measures? Is there no alternative? Is there no sensitive,
sparkling, fresh, green Liberal Democrat alternative? This appears to
be a dull, dark, negative removal, which adds nothing. Can the hon.

						</b> The River Ouse flows very slowly through Lewes,
unless it is flooding the area, which is unfortunate when it happens.
It is for the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs to provide the town with flood defences against
that.</div>
					<a name="07011848000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about deletion misses the argument. This is
not about a Labour version of what the Mayor should do, nor is it about
a Liberal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 281</div>Democrat or Conservative version. It is about what the Mayor should do.
We should not be telling him what to
do.</div>
					<a name="07011848000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Minister, for whom I have had considerable sympathy on many occasions,
is seeking to impose a straitjacket on the Mayor, which is
inappropriate. That is my argument. I have my own view as to what the
Mayor might do, as do my colleagues and others in this room, but it is
for the Mayor himself to decide what to do. He has his own mandate, as
do the London boroughs. It is not for us to second guess and impose a
national framework on them, as the clause does.</div>
					<a name="07011848000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I referred to energy. We also
know that the Mayor, sensibly in my view, is opposed to nuclear power,
but is expected to adhere to national energy policies. Therefore,
against his better judgment, he will have to sign up to nuclear power.
We know, for example, that he is concerned about aircraft emissions, as
indeed we all are. Even the Prime Minister is offsetting his numerous
holidays with some carbon offset.</div>
					<a name="07011848000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are concerned that the Mayor
wants to restrict aviation emissions&#151;I think he genuinely wants
to&#151;but Government policy aims to increase airport capacity
around London. It is likely that an extra runway will be built at
Gatwick. There have been a succession of new runways, and another one
is coming, at Heathrow. Is that in line with the Mayor&#146;s policy?
Are we expected to sign up to that? If he is following national policy,
he will be encumbered with following something he does not believe in.
In turn, that will restrict his freedom of movement and ability to form
policy in line with what he believes is his democratic mandate and what
the people of London may or may not want. That is why the clause is
inappropriate and why I hope the Committee will reject
it.</div>

policy produced by the Mayor to reduce the impact of climate change in

on &#147;transport by air&#148;, which is specifically excluded in
the clause. What does that definition entail? Does &#147;transport by
air&#148; simply cover an aircraft when it is 1 cm off the ground, or
aircraft while they are taxiing or stationary, but using their energy

hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington back to the deletion that he
is proposing? Surely, the Mayor&#146;s being able to publish the
document known as the London climate change mitigation and energy
strategy shows that he is not being constrained. He can happily go
ahead of the Government if he&#151;or she, in the
future&#151;wishes. We must surely accept that climate change has to
be considered nationally, and ultimately supranationally. What on earth
is wrong with requiring the Mayor to operate within the national
framework?</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman has already heard the response
from my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes. I draw the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s attention to the fact that, as part of the London
strategy, the Mayor will be required to assist the national Government
in delivering national policies. I am afraid to say that, although I
cannot agree with the Mayor&#146;s description of the Secretary of
State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as &#147;the carbon
kid&#148;&#151;if nothing else, that is an ageist
comment&#151;the Government&#146;s track record on climate change
will compare rather unfavourably with the one associated with the Mayor
in office as he advances his own strategy.</div>

						</b> I accept that Opposition Members intended to
table their amendments in the spirit of being helpful, but the
proposals would not achieve that objective, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Ealing, North said. Both amendments would remove the
provisions that specify the issues that the Mayor&#146;s London
climate change mitigation and energy strategy should cover and whom he
should consult in preparing
it.</div>
					<a name="07011848000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not support
either amendment. Were either accepted, even the definitions of
&#147;climate change&#148; and &#147;mitigation&#148; in
respect of the strategy would be deleted. No other statutory strategy
that the Mayor is required to publish would be as undefined and vague
as the amendments would make the climate change mitigation and energy
strategy. They would severely undermine a key reason for putting the
strategy on a statutory footing&#151;to ensure that future Mayors
continue to focus on the key climate change and energy issues, critical
for London and the UK, in which the Mayor has an important role. To
ensure a focus on those key issues, and on the key data that underpin
them, it makes sense that we should set them out in the Bill. We have
done that in close consultation with the Greater London
authority.</div>
					<a name="07011848000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also
makes sense for us to ensure that the strategy sets out what action key
bodies such as TFL and the London Development Agency will take to
support its implementation. That is critical, given TFL&#146;s role
in reducing emissions from London transport and the LDA&#146;s role
in engaging London businesses and promoting innovation. However, in
listing the areas that all Mayors must cover if any strategy is to be
effective, we are not seeking to limit the Mayor&#146;s flexibility
on other issues that he believes are important for London. We have set
it out that in the strategy the Mayor must cover areas broad in
definition and scope; he will have great flexibility to define and
deliver in a way that maximises benefits for London.</div>
					<a name="07011848000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The areas listed in the Bill
are not intended to be exhaustive. The Mayor will have freedom to cover
other areas and publish other data in his strategy. We seek only to
define the critical issues that he must cover. Furthermore, amendment
No. 6 would strip away all references to the need for the Mayor to have
regard to national policy when preparing the London climate change
mitigation and energy strategy.</div>
					<a name="07011848000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is vital that the Mayor
should develop his energy strategy having regard to the context of
national energy and climate change mitigation policy. Those issues
cross regional boundaries, but action in London could have significant
repercussions throughout the UK.</div>

national objectives, such as mitigating climate change, that he expects
the Mayor to follow. I do not necessarily disagree with that. The
difficulty is the clause&#146;s wording. It mentions national
policies, and that could be interpreted as being specific to
small-scale policies. That may not be the Minister&#146;s intention,
but it is in the
clause.</div>

					<a name="07011848000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
interpretation of amendment No. 6 is that it would create the odd
position of the Secretary of State retaining a power of direction if
the strategy were inconsistent with, and damaging to, national
policies, but the Mayor not having to have regard to those national
policies when writing the strategy. We are talking about his having
regard to issues. We are not being rigid or inflexible or tying the
Mayor down, as has been described. We are leaving flexibility in.
Relying solely on the Secretary of State&#146;s option of a power of
direction would be an ineffective and blunt way to ensure consistency
with national
policy.</div>

						</b> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, and
obviously we shall reflect on the debate in due course, but that is not
our interpretation. Certainly, we do not acknowledge the restrictions
being identified by Liberal Democrat
Members.</div>
					<a name="07011848000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">My advisers
tell me that in relation to the allegation that the Mayor must
implement national policies, which would be prescriptive, it is in our
view essential that all tiers of government work together, so we are
referring to a working arrangement, not to blindly following policies.
Amendment No. 53 stipulates that the strategy should be developed in
general conformity with national policies but, as it would strip away
the detail on what the strategies should cover, it is unclear what
benefit such a stipulation could have. Since Bill does not specify what
the strategy should cover, it would also be unclear what areas of
national policy it should be in conformity
with.</div>
					<a name="07011848000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both amendments
would also remove the requirement for the Mayor to have regard to any
guidance produced by the Secretary of State in relation to the
preparation of the strategy. That is an important provision as it
allows flexibility for the Secretary of State to provide further
guidance on issues of national importance that may not be covered
specifically in national policy documents. It also allows the Secretary
of State to provide more detailed guidance to the Mayor on national
policy without having to resort to a power of direction. It is not an
unusual provision. The Secretary of State provides guidance to the
Mayor on a number of his existing statutory strategies&#151;for
example, transport, waste and air quality.</div>

					<a name="07011848000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Finally, both
amendments would remove the list of key bodies that the Mayor must
consult when preparing his strategy. He would still be required to
consult the bodies listed under section 42(1)(a) of the Greater London
Authority Act 1999, but the amendments would remove the specific
requirement for him to consult bodies with an important interest in
energy issues. It is vital that the Mayor consult energy companies, the
energy regulator and the main energy consumer body when writing his
strategy because it will have an important impact on their work and, in
turn, they will need to have a role in delivering an effective
strategy.</div>
					<a name="07011848000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington asked for a definition of
&#147;air transport&#148;. The Mayor&#146;s is not required to
refer to aviation in his strategy. I am sorry that that information
does not respond fully to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div>

						</b> I am not quite sure what point the Minister is
making. I want clarification of whether the Mayor will have
responsibility for and power over aircraft that are taxiing, for
example. Clearly, in the vicinity of Heathrow the impact of that on
climate change and emissions is significant. If the Minister is saying
that that is excluded, clearly that is a substantial negative input to
emissions in London over which the Mayor will have no
control.</div>

						</b> Aviation policy is obviously a matter for the
Government. I do not for a moment suspect that the Mayor would not
refer in his strategy to several areas outside his direct power but to
which he wants to draw attention. He does not have responsibility for
aviation policy. As I said, that is a matter for the Government and, in
that regard, it is not referred to under the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07011848000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Lewes asked about the Mayor&#146;s ability to introduce
innovative carbon reducing transport policies and suggested that those
will be stymied by the Bill. The Mayor has wide-ranging transport
powers and has already introduced many innovative policies to which the
hon. Gentleman referred, such as the congestion
charge.</div>
					<a name="07011848000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Surrey Heath made several points that were outwith the scope
of the Mayor&#146;s power but made interesting listening. I am sure
that we shall return to them in due course. He said that the amendments
would give the Mayor more flexibility. As I have explained, we do not
believe that to be the case. We cannot assume that all Mayors will be
as innovative as the current Mayor, and the reason for the strategy and
the proposals is to ensure that future Mayors address the key issues.
There is room for flexibility and innovation. The Mayor can cover
issues that are not set out in the clause and, indeed, we fully expect
him to do so. Given my explanation, I urge Opposition Members to
withdraw the amendment on the basis that it would not achieve the
objectives that they have
set.</div>
