<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000486"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We move on to part 12 of the Bill and the
important issue of company secretaries and their continuing role as a
consequence of the provisions in part 12. May I welcome the
Solicitor-General, as I understand he will debate and respond to
various issues in relation to company secretaries? As Members will be
aware, there has been considerable debate on this issue, particularly
in the context of the continuing role of company secretaries in private
companies as compared with public companies where the role of company
secretary would be retained. I am sure that all members of the
Committee will have received a number of e-mails and letters from
various interested parties with their
views.</div><a name="06062755000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
central to that issue and I note the decision to incorporate the stand
part debate intothe group of amendments that stand in my name
and the names of my hon. Friends the Members for
Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) and for Reigate (Mr.
Blunt). That obviously gives us an opportunity to have a fairly
wide-ranging debate on the current role of company secretaries and how
the proposed regime would operate as currently contemplated in the
Bill. Public company secretaries are to be recognised under the Bill,
but not private company secretaries. We can therefore debate the
practical implications of that and why we believe that it is not the
best way to proceed because of all the issues that would flow from
it.</div><a name="06062755000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is helpful to
give some context as to where company secretaries currently sit in
terms of the corporate governance and corporate structures contained in
companies up and down the country. The company secretary has an
established and understood role in the context of English company law
through a combination of statute, case law and years of custom and
practice. A company secretary is an officer of the company by virtue of
section 744 of the Companies Act 1985, is recognised and identifiable
through notifications to the registrar of companies by virtue of
section 288 of the 1985 Act and as an officer can be held to be
criminally liable for defaults permitted by the company. The secretary
may also have to make out a statement of the company&#146;s affairs
if an administrative receiver or a provisional liquidator is appointed
or if a winding-up order is made by virtue of sections 47, 66 and 131
of the Insolvency Act
1986.</div><a name="06062755000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although not
formally prescribed by statute, company secretaries have responsibility
for a range of administrative matters within the company for which they
may be held liable in the event of default. Those include maintaining
the statutory registers of the company, such as the register of
shareholders, the register of directors&#146; interest and the
register of charges, ensuring that the company keeps it statutory
filings with the registrar of companies up to date, and ensuring that
appropriate filings are made within the prescribed statutory time
limits. I know that that is one of the key functions provided by
company secretaries. It is important in ensuring that companies comply
with their ongoing obligations under the Companies Act in terms of
their relevant filings with Companies House, so that the filings are in
order, and so that third parties can see precisely what is happening at
the company.</div><a name="06062755000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Company
secretaries are also responsible for co-ordinating the maintenance of
the company&#146;s internal records, such as minutes of meetings of
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 243</div>board of directors kept under section 382 of the 1985 Act, and minutes
of general meetings of shareholders. They provide appropriate
notification for convening board meetings and shareholder meetings, and
they compile and circulate supporting documentation. Their role is very
much that of ensuring that directors are properly up to speed with all
board papers and of presenting and compiling board packs, so that
directors are properly informed on what will happen at forthcoming
board meetings. Secretaries in both public and private companies fulfil
an essential
role.</div><a name="06062755000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secretaries are
also involved in the quasi-legal situation of ensuring general legal
compliance by the company with its statutory and legal requirements and
adherence to its memorandum and articles of association. They
co-ordinate the publication and distribution of the company&#146;s
annual report and accounts in conjunction with internal and external
advisers and are involved in preparation and liaison with executive and
non-executive directors to ensure that all appropriate statements are
included and correct, and that all information is provided to the
auditors.</div> <a name="06062755000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
secretaries process share transfers and the issuance of new share
certificates, including signing of share certificates that are in hard
copy format&#151;though as we move to electronic means for holding
and transferring shares that may decline in importance. They ensure
that people who are entitled to do so can inspect company
records.</div><a name="06062755000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have taken
some time to run through that background because it shows the breadth
of the work in which company secretaries are involved and the
importance within the general corporate structure of the role that they
play in public and private companies in the UK. The point to stress is
their position as formal office holders, which allows them to attend
board meetings and gives them the added responsibility of the
liabilities that attach to their office. Their position gives them a
clear status and an ability to ensure that there is proper adherence by
the company to its statutory and legal requirements. It enables them to
have an important foothold in the board through their status and
position, allowing them to be heard and to insist that compliance is
maintained, whereas someone who was just an employee or an authorised
signatory in a very defined role might not have the status and the role
in the company necessary to ensure
compliance.</div><a name="06062755000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
company law review recognised that position. It
said:</div><a name="06062755000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We do
not doubt that company secretaries can provide a valuable service to
private companies&#148;</div><a name="06062755000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
proposed removing the mandatory requirement for a company secretary in
private companies. It stated that the decision whether to use the
services of a secretary would be made by the market rather than by law.
It also
said:</div><a name="06062755000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that private companies should be able, if they wish, to appoint
a company secretary to carry out those functions that are ascribed to a
director or secretary in the alternative in the Act, or performed by
the secretary as a matter of practice. When appointed the secretary
will be able to carry out these functions with the full authority that
he has under the current
Act.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that that scene-setting, in terms of the company law
review and the views that were 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 244</div>taken as a consequence of it, formed the basis of the provisions in part
12. The review proposed dispensing with the requirement for a company
secretary for private companies. On my understanding, that was on the
basis of deregulation&#151;without any other
justification&#151;while recognising that removing the requirement to
have a company secretary would not remove any responsibility of the
company to carry out the functions that a company secretary would
normally carry out. That approach was also reflected in both White
Papers on the company law
review.</div><a name="06062755000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, that
does not seem to be quite what we have in the wording of the Bill,
which includes a subtle but vital difference from the suggestion that
the secretary would have the full authority that he or she currently
has under the 1985 Act. An article by Andy Hamer writing in the June
edition of the <i class="I">Company Secretary </i>summarises the point quite
well. He
states:</div><a name="06062755000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Most
public companies were fairly relaxed about the proposal to abolish the
requirement for private companies to appoint a secretary on the basis
that they continue to do so for their subsidiaries if they wish. Well
nothing has changed in this regard. You will still be able to do that.
The problem is that it will be a totally pointless exercise. The legal
status of the person you appoint will not change one iota as a
consequence of doing so. As far as the Company Law Reform Bill is
concerned, that person will have no more power than your
receptionist.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
one view. It is an extreme view, but it summarises the angst and
concern that clearly exist in various corporate organisations
throughout the country. Having just an authorised signatory role will
not give existing company secretaries the standing and status that they
have at present. Their ability to procure compliance on the various
issues that I alluded to in my initial comments will be
affected.</div><a name="06062755000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The approach
that I outlined, which is reflected in Mr. Hamer&#146;s comments,
seems also to have been taken by Lord Sainsbury on Third Reading in the
other place when he said
that</div><a name="06062755000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;private companies
will still be able to have a company secretary, but whether they so
choose will not be material to third parties. That is why the Bill does
not provide for them to have statutory recognition nor for their
identity to be on the public record, either on formation of the company
or thereafter.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i>
9 May 2006; Vol. 681, c.
785.]</div><a name="06062755000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis of
what is in the Bill, the proposal, rather than being deregulatory, will
impose additional regulatory burdens and confusion as existing company
secretaries continuing in their role will have to be specially
authorised to carry out their existing functions. As they are not
recognised, they would have to become authorised signatories to do what
they do today. For example, company secretaries have authority to
authenticate documents under section 41 of the 1985 Act, but clause 48
of the Bill would require them to be authorised to do
that.</div><a name="06062755000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Third parties
will not wish to rely on a company secretary&#146;s merely saying
that they are authorised, and, in the absence of a continuing
notification of secretaries at Companies House, presumably will wish to
obtain a copy of the board resolution authorising the secretary to
certify documents. However, a director would have to provide that duly
certified evidence to the third party, as clearly the authorised
signatory cannot
self-certify.</div><a name="06062755000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Almost
automatically there is the additional step of having a document
executed by a director to give 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 245</div>evidence to third parties that they can rely on the signature certifying
the document. That will necessitate some additional step, but we will
come on to that in further detail. The Under-Secretary said that her
officials were examining methods of dealing with the situation in
transitional arrangements. We touched on that point briefly last week
when we talked about authorised signatories, and how&#151;to
paraphrase the Under-Secretary&#151;that approach was being
considered in the context of a transitional method under which existing
company secretaries would be deemed as authorised signatories. She
said, in general terms, that the proposal was still being considered by
officials.</div><a name="06062755000446"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="06062755000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">That approach
does not address the fundamental weakness of the proposals set out in
the Bill, however. It goes so far, but not far enough. The Institute
for Chartered Secretaries and Administrators says in its briefing note
for the Committee, which has been endorsed by the Association of
Corporate Treasurers, the CBI, the Institute of Directors and the Law
Society:</div><a name="06062755000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
the board of a private company wants the secretary to continue in his
position post the enactment of the Bill, it will find that all the
secretary&#146;s automatic statutory powers under the Companies Act
1985 to certify documents, execute documents and file returns to
Companies House will no longer exist. For any of the 2 million private
companies which find their secretary useful, and want to continue
employing such a person, there will be the confusing burden of having
to set up appropriate authorisations to try and mimic the current
statutory powers that are well understood. This new burden will bring
complication not simplification. A secretary remains an officer of the
company so his statutory powers should be clear along with his
liabilities.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
last point in that quotation, to which I alluded earlier, is the
continuing status of the secretary in a private company as an office
holder. I have referred to section 744 of the 1985 Act, which currently
prescribes a secretary as being an officer of the company, although the
continuing effect of that section is somewhat vague and I would
appreciate any clarification from the Solicitor-General about it. What
the table of destinations provided by the Department says about section
744 of the 1985 Act is quite
interesting:</div><a name="06062755000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Partially
repealed, partially left in the Act without substantial amendment and
partly replaced with substantive amendment by
Various&#148;.</div><a name="06062755000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is quite
difficult to track where the bits have gone or work out precisely what
will happen to section 744, so some clarification of what will happen
and how the Bill will apply to secretaries moving forward would be
helpful.</div>
<a name="06062755000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">What the Bill
will mean for the status of a company secretary in the context of
liability is a little confusing. The Bill raises the question whether
the legal status of the post of secretary has been abolished from a
statutory perspective for private companies. If someone was appointed
as a new company secretary under the current wording of the Bill, but
was apparently unable to notify their appointment to the registrar of
companies under the new regime, third parties would not be put on
notice of their position, so would they be an office holder or
not?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 246</div><a name="06062755000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">By the contrary, if someone is
shown in the records of Companies House to be a secretary of an
existing company but there is no ongoing notification procedure for
appointments or changes, how would they get themselves off the record,
in order to avoid potential claims against officer holders of the
company in the event of something calamitous happening to the company
many years subsequent to their having relinquished their position as
company secretary?</div>
<a name="06062755000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Practically,
how do people ensure that notification is given to third parties, to
ensure that they are not inadvertently and improperly drawn into a
claim for default that might ultimately arise in criminal liability?
The issue could be serious, so it would be helpful to have some
clarification of what is intended in the Bill for the notification
regime for private companies. I hope that we shall be able to shed some
light on the issue.</div><a name="06062755000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
mystification about all this was heightened when I had as my bedtime
reading further aspects of the
Bill.</div><a name="06062755000047"></a>

Brokenshire:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am sure that we all have happy
bedtime reading at the moment because of this weighty Bill. Clause 640
deals with annual returns. Clearly, filing annual returns and ensuring
that they have been appropriately prepared is one role of a company
secretary at the moment. Subsection (1)
states:</div><a name="06062755000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If a
company fails to deliver an annual return before the end of the period
of 28 days after a return date, an offence is committed
by&#151;</div><a name="06062755000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) the
company,</div><a name="06062755000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) subject
to subsection
(4)&#151;</div><a name="06062755000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">(i) every
director of the company,
and</div><a name="06062755000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">(ii) in
the case of a public company, every secretary of the company,
and</div><a name="06062755000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) every other
officer of the company who is in
default.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
one assumes that the secretary of a private company remains an officer
of the company, one could end up in quite a perverse situation, because
subsection (4)
states:</div><a name="06062755000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
a defence for a director or secretary charged with an offence under
subsection
(1)(b)&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06062755000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">in other
words, the provisions relating to secretaries of a public
company&#151;</div><a name="06062755000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to prove
that he took all reasonable steps to avoid the commission or
continuance of the
offence.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The bizarre
point is that that defence would not be available to secretaries of
private companies if they remained officer holders of the
company.</div><a name="06062755000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will table
an amendment about that, as we have not yet discussed the issue, but
that lacuna or potential issue in terms of liability makes it extremely
important that we are clear about whether a secretary of a private
company, whether recognised on the statutory register or not&#151;we
shall come to that issue&#151;is, as an office holder, liable and the
extent to which they are liable. If there are occasions on which some
form of additional defence is offered to public company secretaries, it
will be perverse if that defence is not available also to private
company secretaries, given that they will be fulfilling the self-same
duties, although one group will be doing so in public companies and the
other in private companies.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 247</div><a name="06062755000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any light that can be shed on
the general issue&#151;I have given a specific example&#151;would
be appreciated not only by me but, I am sure, by company secretaries up
and down the country, who are concerned about the implications of what
is happening.</div><a name="06062755000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that the Solicitor-General can also respond to the comments of Andy
Hamer in the latest edition of <i class="I">Company
Secretary</i>:</div><a name="06062755000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
most embarrassing thing about this whole episode for the Government is
the way that it went about securing the support of (or avoiding
opposition from) listed companies and then moved the goalposts without
consultation. I sincerely hope that it will be made to defend itself
against such
accusations.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
goes back to the fundamental point, which is that the review seemed to
suggest that the statutory rights of company secretaries would be
preserved and therefore in the Bill, whereas we do not have that at the
moment. An explanation or clarification as to why there has been a
difference between the CLR, the White Paper and what we have now is
important, because the reason certainly has not come out for me in
reading the record of the debates in the other place. Perhaps I have
missed it, but clarification as to why the subtlety that I have talked
about was altered is
important.</div><a name="06062755000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">What about
where we are now and the proposals in the Bill? What has been the
response from companies up and down the country? I suspect that hon.
Members will have received many letters and e-mails on the subject, and
I think that it is worth commenting on some of the ones that I have
seen. I appreciate that this is by no means the full list of
representations that may have come into the Department and to other
members of the
Committee.</div><a name="06062755000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Elizabeth
Richardson, company secretary of Reckitt Benckiser plc, a FTSE 100
company,
said:</div><a name="06062755000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;While
Reckitt Benckiser is a public company so will still be required to
appoint a secretary, we have a hundred or so UK private companies
within our group. If the Bill becomes law I will have no power to
administer these companies for our
group.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">She
adds:</div><a name="06062755000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
proposed changes will disenfranchise me and cause enormous
administrative headaches for people in my
position.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">A similar
point is made by Tania Stoat, assistant company secretary of GKN plc,
who says:</div><a name="06062755000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
GKN, as is the case for most large UK-listed groups, the secretarial
administration for subsidiary private companies is carried out
centrally through the appointment of individual or corporate
secretaries, thereby ensuring good corporate governance throughout the
Group. The Bill as currently drafted will render such secretaries
devoid of all statutory powers and require the imposition of
unnecessary bureaucracy to delegate existing authorities in other
ways.&#148;</div>
<a name="06062755000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, Hilary Lowe, company
secretary to the investment trust of JPMorgan Asset Management, which
obviously has to cope with a lot of administration, emphasises a
similar approach and
says:</div><a name="06062755000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
appreciate that for small, simple companies the role of secretary is
not necessarily needed, but there still may be instances where the
Directors of these companies may wish to appoint a secretary in order
to complete, lodge and explain the routine forms on their
behalf...More worryingly is that there are large private companies
where the role of secretary is vital and it is also important to note
that within plc companies the majority of the work is done through
subsidiary companies, which tend to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 248</div>be private companies, as the umbrella plc is merely the listed entity.
Furthermore, if the Bill remains as drafted it is likely that companies
will find themselves in the confusing position of having to delegate
authorities in other
ways.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point that Ms
Lowe makes is crucial. For example, a listed company whose shares are
traded on the London stock exchange would, as a public company, be
required under the Bill to have a company secretary, but in essence it
may be a shell or a holding company that holds the shares of various
subsidiary limited liability companies.</div>
<a name="06062755000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many ways the role of
company secretary in that instance would be fairly limited in scope if
it was ring-fenced at that level in terms of continuing compliance with
the Companies Act 1985 as far as the plc is concerned and in terms of
meeting the UK Listing Authority&#146;s ongoing requirements. Yet in
all likelihood, as some of the examples show, there may be hundreds of
subsidiaries sitting underneath that holding company, all requiring
accounts, forms and registration documents to be filed and updated and
all trading. That would bring a different level of activity and the
need for legal requirement and compliance. It is easy to see that the
need for company secretaries and someone to be in charge of such
activity is at subsidiary, private company level rather than being
ring-fenced within the plc. That is important. Limited liability
subsidiaries in such circumstances are likely to be considerable
companies in their own right as the main trading companies for the
listed group and may have turnovers of hundreds of millions of pounds,
so the need for compliance is significant. Perhaps that aspect has not
come across clearly enough in terms of the importance of maintaining
compliance at that limited liability
perspective.</div><a name="06062755000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062755000489"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): My hon. Friend makes
an important point about the Government&#146;s application of company
secretaries who are often undervalued. There could be a flotation of a
series of foreign operating companies in London. A listed company may
exist in London but it may be a shell and the operating companies, some
of which may be English constituents, may operate overseas. That is
when the clause will not
work.</div><a name="06062755000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000490"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We could also have the perverse situation of
a foreign-listed company&#151;a holding company that is incorporated
outside the UK&#151;being the listed entity that holds shares in a
subsidiary which is a trading company in the UK. Clearly the listed
holding company would be outside the UK, under no obligation to have a
secretary at all. Under the new regime, the subsidiary company would
have no responsibility or liability to have a secretary. That seems a
rather strange situation to have arrived at in ensuring good corporate
governance at a time when there are huge sensitivities about such
issues and about ensuring that companies are in compliance with their
regulatory
obligations.</div><a name="06062755000447"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5

<a name="06062755000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000491"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend uses the word
&#147;strange&#148;. With respect&#151;he is making an excellent
case&#151;should he not be a little stronger? Rather than strange, is
not the situation unacceptable?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 249</div><a name="06062755000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000492"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I suppose I
was using the word &#147;strange&#148; to mean peculiar, bizarre
and extremely ridiculous in terms of the guidance that we set for
corporate entities across the globe. I shall come later to the
international aspect. The situation is not acceptable, and when we turn
to the amendments, we shall see that different approaches can be taken.
I know that the various bodies have had their views, discussions and
debates on the right way forward, which clearly needs to be focused on.
I do not think that it has yet been properly addressed.</div>
<a name="06062755000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a further example, I have
one final comment from Sue Jenner, director and company secretary at
the Thomson Corporation
plc:</div><a name="06062755000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;MPs would
appear not to be aware of the seriousness of this issue and I urgently
request that you seek to redress this anomaly. Does the Government not
realise how damaging this could be to large private companies with
numerous operating subsidiaries, who rely on their secretaries to
ensure good governance and, in particular, to facilitate the day to day
legal administration of these entities. Stripping away their powers
could cause untold difficulties, especially where
certifying/authenticating documents, executing documents with a
director and filing returns at Companies House are
concerned&#148;.</div><a name="06062755000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">She
adds:</div><a name="06062755000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It will
be far more burdensome and crippling for companies if the Bill is left
as drafted. In the cause of good governance, it is absolutely critical
that company secretaries not be stripped of their
powers.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
interesting that under the proposed arrangements it would be possible
for many subsidiaries to sit underneath and not to have the corporate
powers behind the secretary in that
context.</div><a name="06062755000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was looking
at the list of representations that I have received through e-mail and
correspondence during the past week or so, and it makes for interesting
reading: GKN plc; Anglo American plc; the Association of Women
Chartered Secretaries; Harbottle and Lewis solicitors; JPMorgan asset
management; First Choice Holidays; the Thomson Corporation; Hamilton
Downing Quinn solicitors; Argos Retail Group; Mothercare UK Ltd; Vocus
Europe Ltd; Mayer, Brown, Rowe and Maw solicitors; National Express
Group; Virgin Group Ltd; Taylor Wessing solicitors; Renew Holdings plc;
Mitchells and Butlers plc and Lovells. Various other companies and
individuals have expressed their concern, too. There is considerable
angst and worry about the implications of what is happening and the
practical difficulties that might be posed to such companies by the
structural change between the private and public company
settings.</div> <a name="06062755000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
interesting to work out how Companies House will respond in all such
circumstances, given what I have said about the fact that company
secretaries&#146; names would appear to remain on the register going
forward. If secretaries in private companies were not authenticated and
authorised to deal with the filing of forms after the introduction of
the Bill, how would Companies House deal with the situation? I know
that transitional provisions are still being considered, but there
could be a nightmare at Companies House if that is not followed through
properly. I believe that changing our current position is the best way
in which to achieve a sensible arrangement and
settlement.</div><a name="06062755000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend talked about the international aspect. At a time when we appear
to be seeking to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 250</div>downgrade the position of the company secretary, certainly in limited
liability companies, other jurisdictions appear to be embracing the
corporate model that we have created and adopted for many years.
Certainly, in developed and emerging markets, the adoption of our
corporate governance structures and business behaviour are seen as key
elements in the drive to attract
investment.</div><a name="06062755000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
therefore interesting to note that jurisdictions such as Spain and
Dubai have gone in the other direction and are seeking to adopt a
requirement for a company secretary. I have been provided with some
correspondence from Transeuropean Centre Ltd, which is in discussion
with the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators,
stating:</div><a name="06062755000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
UK corporate law is highly regarded in Russia, especially the role of
company secretaries within large
companies.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
suggestion is that Russia is examining our corporate model and
structure. Although it is seeking to adopt secretaries at the moment,
the suggestion is that it might be trying to find ways in which to
codify and structure company secretaries within Russian corporate law.
It is great to see that that wonderful benefit in English corporate law
is being exported far and wide. It is one of the great benefits in this
country, and it is a hidden export. That is great to see. Our corporate
governance structures, in which the company secretary plays a pivotal
role, should be
promoted.</div><a name="06062755000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000493"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I have listened carefully to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s points. I think that he has covered the
representations of just about every lobby group that has deluged the
Committee. However, I have not yet heard him say anything about his
amendments, and I would be grateful if he could tell me about what they
propose.</div>
<a name="06062755000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000494"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> As the Solicitor-General is well aware, we
are in the midst of a clause stand part debate, as well as discussions
on the amendment. I am using the stand part debate as an opportunity to
set out a number of important concerns expressed by company secretaries
and corporate organisations up and down the country. I therefore think
that we should use this opportunity to set out that context, but I
shall come on to the amendments; he can be assured of
that.</div><a name="06062755000077"></a>

Djanogly:</b> May I say how pleased I was to hear the
Solicitor-General refer to the many concerns shown by lobbyists, the
CBI and company secretaries? We have all been inundated with letters
from company secretaries who are concerned about the proposals, and I
congratulate my hon. Friend on dealing with those concerns so
thoroughly.</div><a name="06062755000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000496"></a>James

comments.</div><a name="06062755000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062755000497"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Shailesh Vara</b> (North-West Cambridgeshire) (Con): May I
remind the Committee that last week, it was the Minister who was keen
to emphasise that, because so many people had contributed and she had
taken their views on board, we should not be engaging in that debate? I
hope that the Solicitor-General will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 251</div>take that point on board. I mention it because I am mindful that at that
time he was engaged in another Committee. We are doing only what the

us by various

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000498"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have sought to take a bit of time and care
in Committee this afternoon because the representations are so recent.
That is why it is important that we have the chance to give them a
proper airing. In many cases, the representations arrived only in the
past few days&#151;indeed, the last few hours. Even as I came to the
Committee this afternoon, my I was still receiving e-mails from people
concerned about the
issue.</div><a name="06062755000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
finish on the international aspects. I was interested to read the
letter from the Hong Kong Institute of Chartered Secretaries,
especially as Hong Kong corporate law is historically modelled on
English company law and largely remains so today. The letter, which is
from Mr. Richard Leung, the president, reaffirms
that</div><a name="06062755000082"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if the abolition of
the requirement for private companies to appoint secretaries is to go
ahead, secretaries of those companies which choose to appoint or retain
them should continue to be given the statutory powers and their
appointment should be a matter of public record at Companies
House.&#148;</div> <a name="06062755000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will come to
the last point in discussing another group of amendments, but the
letter gives some further international context by noting the potential
influence and impact that the UK reforms will have on other
jurisdictions, including Hong Kong. Although I fully recognise that we
are talking about UK corporates and the UK situation&#151;and rightly
so in terms of the UK remaining an example that we hope will be
followed by others&#151;it is worth putting it in that international
context.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000499"></a>The

am just wondering if that reference was the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
Eccles cake moment, and which Opposition Member he is waiting for to
come here and vote this afternoon. We are now 40 minutes into the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000500"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> To be honest, Mr. Illsley, that comment was
ill judged and inappropriate. We have had to put up with all sorts of
filibustering by the Government because they have not been able to get
Members to attend this Committee. I am in no way filibustering; I am
making a genuine attempt to run through extremely important issues that
deserve proper debate. I will take no lectures from the right hon. Lady

This is a very important issue, as is evidenced by the amount of
correspondence we have received on
it.</div><a name="06062755000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062755000503"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Nick Palmer</b> (Broxtowe) (Lab): As a relatively new member
of the Committee, replacing my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle
upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins), who has a medical problem, I have had
no correspondence on the matter. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman
can quantify his remarks. How many lobbyists have contacted him on the
subject? His hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon said that there had
been numerous
lobbyists.</div><a name="06062755000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000504"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Whatever the Minister may think, I do not
intend to run through in great detail the number of groups that have
contacted the Minister and other members of the Committee. I went
through the list of companies, company secretaries, plcs and other
limited liability company secretaries and accountants who had contacted
us. That is clear evidence of the
situation.</div><a name="06062755000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000505"></a>Dr.

that is what the hon. Member for Huntingdon referred to. How many
lobbyists have contacted him on the
subject?</div><a name="06062755000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000506"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am not aware of any lobbyists. I do not
know what the hon. Gentleman means by using that term in such a
context. I was contacted by the companies that I mentioned, and the
Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators made its
representations very clear. I can only imagine that my hon. Friend the
Member for Huntingdon may have been alluding to them. It is interesting
to note that the view of the ICSA is endorsed by the Institute of
Directors, the Confederation of British Industry and various other
organisations, as I am sure the Solicitor-General is aware from the
briefing materials that he has
received.</div><a name="06062755000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000507"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> That is an organisation that I know
reasonably well, and it is a very reputable one. We have had
representations from every lobby group, varying from interests in Hong
Kong to those in Russia. It is emerging that the Conservative party is
the party of various lobbyists who, at some stage, have written a
letter to Conservative Members, who are just reading out parts of that
letter. It is fine to make sensible points&#151;the hon. Gentleman
has raised several, and I am happy to deal with them&#151;but I am
concerned that he seems to be going through his list of lobbyists as
though he wanted to check off with them that he has mentioned them
all.</div>

the Under-Secretary said that existing company secretaries of private
companies might or might not be deemed to be authorised signatories by
virtue of their office, while appearing to rule out such an approach
for new company secretaries, saying that transitional provisions were
still a little up in the air. Her comments maintain the view that
secretaries of private companies should effectively be phased out. That
is mistaken and potentially confusing, particularly in large groups of
companies where new subsidiaries may be formed regularly, some of which
might fall within transitional provisions while others&#151;new
ones&#151;might not. A more fundamental approach needs to be
taken.</div><a name="06062755000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

audit for the purposes of subsections (1) or (2) of section 249A of the
Companies Act 1985 should be required to have a company secretary. The
subject was debated at length in the other place and I do not propose
to rehearse the arguments again. Amendments Nos. 186, 188, 192 and 204
make further consequential
changes.</div><a name="06062755000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 248, 249, 187 and 189 make what might be termed
&#147;flexibility changes&#148; to enable the continuing statutory
recognition of the private company secretary. They reflect the views
adopted by the CLR and backed by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries
and Administrators.</div>
<a name="06062755000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The role of the company
secretary is well understood, and it is welcome that as far as plcs are
concerned, it will be retained. However, it is bizarre that the concept
has been completely cast aside, as far as statutory recognition is
concerned, for any private company. The secretary supports the board
and the executive team in their primary objective of wealth creation,
and allows the sophisticated obligations and functions of companies of
all sizes to be discharged effectively. Importantly, the
secretary&#146;s role is widely understood and enables third parties,
via Companies House, to know not only that the secretary has power to
sign on behalf of the company, but that that person is at the heart of
the board process.</div><a name="06062755000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill&#146;s most worrying message is that compliance is in some way
being downgraded. ICSA says that it is already receiving reports of
smaller companies misinterpreting the proposals as a reduction in
obligations to comply, to complete returns and to fulfil a wide range
of functions. To amend the Bill either to require large private
companies to maintain a company secretary or to give all private
companies the ability to appoint or retain company secretaries to whom
the existing statutory powers would be available does not appear to be
overly difficult. I am happy to accept any suggestions or improvements
to the drafting of our amendments. To do so would avoid placing the
costly compliance and bureaucratic burdens on companies throughout the
country which will result from adhering, without any change, to the
current arrangements and
structure.</div><a name="06062755000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our
first sitting, the Minister for Industry and the Regions

open-minded in our approach to the Bill. The provisions are in good
shape, but we are always anxious to improve them. Certainly, during the
discussions that I had in the past month with my officials, we found
that there is always room for improvement in a Bill of such an enormous
size.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing

improvement.</div> <a name="06062755000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">To date,
the Government appear, for whatever reason, to have approached the
matter with a closed mind. I hope that today they will open their eyes
and finally recognise the important continuing role of company
secretaries in private
companies.</div><a name="06062755000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062755000511"></a><b class="B">Mark
Hunter</b> (Cheadle) (LD): May I say what a pleasure it is to
make my first but, I hope, not my last contribution to this marathon
Bill under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley? Right hon. and hon. Members
will be delighted to know that my contribution will not take 45
minutes; it will be more like four and a half minutes. I hope that we
can proceed somewhat quicker than we have done so far.</div>
<a name="06062755000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I understand the hon.
Gentleman, the basic point of the Conservative amendments is that only
small companies should be exempt and it should be made clear that
private companies are allowed to have secretaries if they want to. We
are not unsympathetic to that view. The key question is whether the
company secretary&#146;s function is solely to protect the interest
of potential investors or to go further than that, and for example
protect the interests of creditors, too. If the function is to protect
only potential investors, the Bill is right to draw the distinction
between companies that need a secretary and those that do not, as
between public and private companies. However, if the function goes
beyond that and the protected interests go beyond those of investors,
it might be appropriate to use other criteria. The argument for using
the size of the company is that one of the main functions of the
company secretary is to maintain the integrity of the company&#146;s
system of governance.</div>
<a name="06062755000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice, the company
secretary&#146;s job is to hold the ring between the directors, the
shareholders and the creditors of the company, with creditors including
employees. Their job is to represent the interests of the company as a
whole, which might include reminding the directors that they are
supposed to act in the interests of the company as a whole, not their
personal interests, and take account of the interests of company
members. In small companies, the distinction between the interests of
the directors, or the director and the shareholders, can be
theoretical, but as soon as it is meaningful to speak of shareholders
as a separate interest from that of directors, it makes sense to
require companies to have company secretaries. The key issue is how
that idea is put into practice.</div>
<a name="06062755000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The distinction between
companies that are required to undertake an audit and those that are
not might make some sense in that context. It relates to the difference
between companies in which the members are so closely connected with
the management that they can be assumed to understand what is going on,
and those in which members are likely to be a separate interest and
unconnected with the management of the business.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 255</div><a name="06062755000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Admittedly, there is a problem
about whether the criteria in the 1985 Act are right. The amendment
sets the limit at &#163;5.6 million or more in turnover or
&#163;2.8 million or more in gross assets for private companies not
involved in insurance or financial services. Do those criteria set the
limits of concern about corporate governance, and is &#163;5.7
million so different from &#163;5.5 million in that sense? There must
be a limit somewhere, and all numerical limits are arbitrary to some
extent. The real question is whether exemption from a requirement to
audit is in principle the same as an exemption from a guarantee of
rectitude in corporate governance. Arguably at least, they are the
same, and the requirement for an audit takes hold when the
company&#146;s affairs are complicated enough that an outsider is
needed to help maintain trust between the various interests. That seems
close enough to the situation in which a guarantee of the integrity of
the company&#146;s governance system is needed.</div>
<a name="06062755000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those reasons, we support
the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James
Brokenshire) and his colleagues.</div>

arguments advanced in favour of the amendments suggest that the Bill
would make it illegal for private companies to have secretaries. That
is not true. It is a deregulatory proposal so that companies that do

legislative fiat. I find it strange, the Conservative party urging that
life be made more difficult and complicated for private companies. That

private company wishes to have a company secretary, then it should be
allowed to have one, and with the existing powers in statute.
<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>The Government Whip, the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Hall Green (Steve McCabe), says that they are still allowed
to do so but, he will note, not with the existing powers. That is one

the point. Of course private companies are allowed to do that. Company

being taken away; there is still a requirement. It is quite clear. They
can still do the same thing, but not by virtue of having that
professional

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000515"></a>Mr.

the existing powers rather than for the 2 million companies that have
company

word &#147;burden&#148; in what is essentially a deregulatory
measure. I know that we all have to be careful in our use of English,
but will the hon. Gentleman for heaven&#146;s sake explain how taking
away a regulatory requirement for companies to have a company
secretary&#151;by deregulating and leaving it as an option&#151;can
in any way be described as a
&#147;burden&#148;?</div><a name="06062755000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000517"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> I am more than happy to enlighten the Minister on
the so-called deregulatory measure. The company secretary has statutory
duties&#151;various administrative duties&#151;which my hon. Friend
the Member for Hornchurch so clearly expressed. If one removes company
secretaries, the company will have to delegate those responsibilities
to some other body or individual, which will create more
work.</div><a name="06062755000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000518"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman seems to be arguing
that we need more statutory regulation of private companies, even small
ones, and we should not give them the choice to decide who should have
the authority to do the various tasks. The Government are on the side
of allowing private companies to have the choice. It appears that the
Conservative party wants more
regulation.</div><a name="06062755000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000519"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> I am not talking about the corner shop, which has a
small revenue and for which there might well be more burden, but about
a large number of private companies. Indeed, it has been mentioned that
it could include many listed companies, where effectively the bulk of
their business is carried out by various subsidiaries which carry out a
substantial amount of business. The business of the company secretary
is fundamental. I am referring to such companies, not necessarily to
the small company where it can be a burden. I do not deny that for some
companies the company secretary is perhaps
superfluous&#151;</div><a name="06062755000121"></a>

a company secretary to deal with, why on earth is he not supporting the

companies?</div><a name="06062755000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me ask
the hon. Gentleman another question. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.]</i> It
is not a speech; it is an intervention. To which statutory duties is he
referring? Which duties is a company secretary responsible for that
will have to be passed to somebody else should the necessity for a
company secretary no longer exist? I am unclear that there are
any.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000523"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> The Minister obviously missed a large part of the
speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch and has clearly not
quite got the thrust of where I am going. Indeed, it is ironic that the
Government accuse the Opposition of procrastination, yet Labour
Members&#146; questions all seem to indicate that they have not paid
any attention to anything that we have said so far. My argument is that
companies should have the option to have a company secretary if they
want one, and the majority of companies will probably want one. Yet the
Minister seems to be basing her argument on the strength of a small
number of companies for which company secretaries may not be
relevant.</div>
<a name="06062755000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000524"></a>Dr.

way?</div><a name="06062755000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000525"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> I should like to make progress.</div>
<a name="06062755000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is merit in the
Government&#146;s argument that there should not be a blanket
requirement for all private companies to have a company secretary,
which in some cases is a mere box-ticking exercise, but we should allow
for companies to have and to appoint a company secretary if they so
wish, with the existing powers as they are. It is interesting that
Labour Members were happy to nod their heads in agreement when I said
that private companies should be allowed to have a company secretary,
but as soon as I mentioned that they should be allowed to have company
secretaries with the existing powers there was a blank look on their
faces and no nodding of
heads.</div><a name="06062755000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000526"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I should be grateful if the hon.
Gentleman would enlighten us by setting out precisely the statutory
powers that he claims currently exist for company
secretaries.</div><a name="06062755000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000527"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b><b class="B"> </b>There is the authentication of documents.
Statute provides that a company secretary is an office holder and as
such has responsibilities and liabilities. There is also the
requirement&#151;I do not know whether it is a statutory
requirement&#151;that there is a register of secretaries at Companies
House.</div>
<a name="06062755000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062755000528"></a><b class="B">Justine
Greening</b> (Putney) (Con): I am impressed by my hon.
Friend&#146;s ability to respond to questions from Ministers. I hope
that we will have no more writing of notes when our questions cannot be
answered, and perhaps we will get similarly factually correct and
exhaustive responses from
Ministers.</div><a name="06062755000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000529"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b><b class="B"> </b>It does seem that the Government are happy to
fire salvos in our direction knowing that we do not have the back-up of
civil servants eagerly writing notes to us. It is ironic that they are
constantly being supplied with notes. I take it on the basis of their
contributions so far that Ministers will dispense with all advice,
jottings and notes and rely on their own knowledge and
experience.</div><a name="06062755000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000530"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman is trying valiantly
to defend his position and I respect him for that. He has a good record
in the House. He is seeking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 258</div>to defend virtually the indefensible in the sense that there is a claim
that there are statutory powers that he cannot ascribe, and nobody else
can either. I appreciate that we have advice from others, but he is
making a strong point and accusing the Government of doing something.
We are merely trying to get him to be precise about that. We do not
think that he can be, and I think he accepts that. The thing to do now
is to move on. Once in a hole, it is best to stop
digging.</div><a name="06062755000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000531"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for those
comments. I do not agree with them. In the interests of making some
progress, I should like to continue. I hold to my original view. Those
who listen to my speech or read the record will doubtless form their
own opinion as to which one of us is
correct.</div><a name="06062755000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having a
company secretary also has the benefit of giving certainty to third
parties about who specifically in a company is charged with the
responsibility of complying with statutory requirements, dealing with
corporate governance and ensuring co-ordination between directors,
shareholders and various departments within the company, and so on. The
notion that anyone who wishes to contact a company should simply write
to a director negates the argument for proper corporate governance. It
is important that there is a specified individual who is an officer of
the company and that third parties know with whom they are
dealing.</div><a name="06062755000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there were
not a company secretary, the directors would be burdened with the
responsibility of form filling and dealing with changes in shares,
changes in directors, changes of address and so on. The job of
directors is to run a business and develop it. They do not wish to be
bogged down with the detailed requirements for the proper efficient
running of a company, so it is important that a company secretary can
take on the responsibility of the administrative duties while the
company directors get on with the business of developing the company
and expanding it in what is a cut-throat and competitive business
world.</div><a name="06062755000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that the aim of the Bill is to simplify matters and to
allow people to get on with running businesses. By putting the
additional burden of dealing with administrative duties on directors,
as opposed to a specific individual, it will act as a hindrance to
proper business efficiency. My hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch
referred to plcs, which have many subsidiaries that are private
companies and, thus, need company secretaries. There are also many
large private companies that would qualify for listing, if so they
wished, in which the role of the company secretary is vital. We must
not forget that. If a company secretary&#146;s duties were dispensed
with, authority would need to be delegated to other individuals to
fulfil the company secretarial role. It is important that third parties
know who that person
is.</div><a name="06062755000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000532"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, if a private
company feels, as he does, that it would be burdensome not to have a
secretary, and takes no action and maintains its existing secretary
with the existing corporate duties, there will be no additional
burden?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 259</div><a name="06062755000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000533"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> That may be the case for companies that wish to do
that, but we are in the business of providing for new companies, too.
The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate and ensure that, since 1985,
company law is up to date. It is our duty to take into account new
companies that will be set up in the next 20 or so years, which is why
it is important to have certainty and not necessarily deal exclusively
with existing companies and their current
frameworks.</div><a name="06062755000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000534"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. We
are genuinely in some difficulty. ICSA has put forward some good
arguments, so I am not sure that he has done it justice. Given his
political party, I find it odd that he might seriously be suggesting
that the Government should prescribe precisely how new small companies
administer their business and meet the regulations by insisting that
certain of their functions are carried out by specified named
individuals, be they company secretaries or
otherwise.</div><a name="06062755000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000535"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> I was happy to give way to the Minister, as always,
but it is regrettable that, as usual, she has missed the point. When
legislators are in the business of setting out legislation, it is
important that they try as best as possible to cover future
eventualities. I am not saying that we should deal with the minutiae,
but we should cover the future, to the extent that that is
possible.</div><a name="06062755000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Only when
companies get over the appropriate threshold should proper auditing
come into operation. That is the answer: only when companies exceed the
proper audited limits should the rules kick in. No doubt some legal and
accountancy practices would welcome the additional work that will be
created for them, not to mention the additional costs that companies
will have to bear in giving them the work and paying their extortionate
rates.</div><a name="06062755000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friends
the Members for Hornchurch and for Huntingdon referred to the
importance of being able to deal with company secretaries based in
Britain when company directors are overseas. In an increasingly
international business environment, we must recognise the need to have
a specific person in the UK to whom third parties can turn to ensure
proper corporate governance of a company, as well as proper service of
notices, proper filing of documentation, and so on. There are many
private companies, and company secretaries are crucial in ensuring
their compliance with the proper requirements.</div>
<a name="06062755000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Company secretaries also have
an important role as co-ordinators of internal company departments. As
the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter) mentioned, they are a link,
and we must not overlook their importance in that role. As a former
practising solicitor, I remember that on occasions I used to speak to
company secretaries. We would not necessarily discuss a particular
issue ourselves, but the company secretary was the one person with whom
I could liaise, and he would agree to speak to the various departments
in the company and give me the answer that I wanted. In the business
world it is important that banks, lawyers, accountants, architects and
so on have an individual whom they trust and with whom they can develop
a working relationship to progress business.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 260</div><a name="06062755000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us not overlook the role of
non-executive directors in recent years. A number of reports have
emphasised the importance of having independent non-executive
directors, and we regularly see very able directors with a large
portfolio of non-executive directorships. It is important that in that
context a company secretary can advise each of them properly on the
relevance of business practice for the company with whom that secretary
is concerned, rather than the eight or nine other companies with which
they have non-executive directorships. If the burdens and
responsibilities of non-executive directors are to be
increased&#151;as they are&#151;it is important that they are
properly monitored and that there is an individual to do that
monitoring. That should be the company secretary, who does it now and
should continue to do
so.</div><a name="06062755000146"></a>

words such as &#147;vital&#148; and &#147;crucial&#148;. Is he
saying that in no case, when one is dealing with medium-sized private
companies, should the company have the choice of whether it wishes to
have a company secretary? A corporation that controls a private company
of the sort described may choose not to have a company secretary, but
instead to have others authorised to do the tasks. Would he deny them
that choice because it is &#147;vital&#148; and

indeed a little perplexed. Let me repeat my point. The hon. Gentleman
believes that no choice should exist for medium-sized private
companies. We are dealing with SMEs, and Opposition amendment No. 185
relies on section 249A of the 1985 Act, which essentially distinguishes
between small and medium-sized companies in accountancy
terms.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000540"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Member for North-West
Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara) will see that the hon. Member for Hornchurch
is nodding. Essentially, the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire
is making a distinction and saying that medium-sized private companies
should not have choice set out in the Bill. Is that his point or is it
not?</div>
<a name="06062755000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000541"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> I stand corrected. To clarify, I am saying that we
should have company secretaries for medium-sized companies. When I say
that there should be an option not to have a company secretary, I have
in mind small companies and the corner shop, which already have enough
burdens.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 261</div><a name="06062755000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000542"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> That is precisely the issue on which I
want to narrow down the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. Is he saying
that there is no situation in which he would allow medium-sized private
companies the choice of whether to appoint a company secretary? That
seems to be the argument that his Front-Bench colleagues have made, but
is he seriously saying that he would insist on regulation and deny such
companies the freedom to choose how they appoint people and regulate
themselves?</div>
<a name="06062755000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000543"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> The criteria for qualification as a medium-sized
company are that turnover should not be more than &#163;22.8 million,
that the balance sheet total should not be more than &#163;11.4
million and that the number of employees should no be more than
250.</div>
<a name="06062755000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000544"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I know the criteria, but what I want to
know is whether the hon. Gentleman is saying that there is no
circumstance in which he would allow private companies that exceed
those levels to have the choice set out in the Bill. Is he saying that
they should be denied that choice?</div>
<a name="06062755000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000545"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> That is the way that the amendment reads, so, yes,
that is the case.</div> <a name="06062755000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not in the public
interest&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The hon. Member
for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce) is very keen on making comments that are just
below the audible level. If he has anything credible or valid to say, I
hope that he will make his contribution audible so that it can be put
on the record, rather than constantly muttering so that it falls just
below the radar. As I was saying, it is not in the public interest to
create an additional administrative burden on directors, who have other
duties and who do not need to be filling in forms, co-ordinating
departments and so on. It is important that we let companies decide
whether they want a company secretary, and we need a register of
secretaries at Companies House so that it is clear to all third parties
who is responsible for the various administrative duties and whom they
can contact immediately.</div>
<a name="06062755000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an increasing focus on
transparency and good corporate governance in business, but that is
undermined when we seek to diminish the role of the one person who can
be held accountable for high principles of corporate governance. As I
mentioned earlier, there are 2 million private companies, all of which
are subject to statutory requirements, proper corporate governance
codes and guidelines issued by various company bodies. Company
secretaries play a useful role in such companies, and doing away with
that role will mean confusion and will impose the burden of setting up
appropriate authorisations to duplicate the current statutory
responsibilities.</div> <a name="06062755000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
conclude, company secretaries play a vital role&#151;I repeat the
word &#147;vital&#148;&#151;in the efficient running of companies
and in our legal framework. We should seek to retain them and give them
the necessary authority and power properly and effectively to do their
job.</div>

David Jones</b> (Clwyd, West) (Con): I do not propose to
detain the Committee too long, because on the general thrust of the
arguments there is little 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 262</div>separating the Government and the Opposition. The Opposition are just as
much&#151;possibly more&#151;in favour of deregulation than the
Government. By the same token, I imagine that the Minister and the
Solicitor-General recognise the importance of company secretaries to
good corporate governance.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000547"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am struck by the curiousness of the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s comment that his party, in proposing the

the Government&#146;s proposal, are more deregulatory than the
Government. Will he clarify that? On the face of it, it does not make
any sense.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000548"></a>Mr.

that the Opposition and the Government are in favour of greater
deregulation. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Does the Minister want to
intervene?</div>
<a name="06062755000162"></a>

not.</div>
<a name="06062755000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000550"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> We will touch on that issue later.</div>
<a name="06062755000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government recognise the
importance of company secretaries to good corporate governance. Were
that not true, the Government would not have made it necessary for
public companies to appoint company secretaries. I shall not rehearse
at length the benefits of company secretaries; my hon. Friend the
Member for Hornchurch and other contributors have already touched on
them adequately. Save to say, company secretaries fulfil an important
role to ensure that directors toe the line and operate within the
bounds of their responsibilities and duties, and to assure persons such
as creditors and shareholders who deal with the company.</div>
<a name="06062755000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not a million miles
apart, but we need increased regulation of private companies with an
annual turnover of &#163;5.6 million or more. They are not small,
although they only just exceed the definition of small enterprise. A
company that has a turnover of &#163;5.6 million a year is by any
stretch of the imagination a significant enterprise. It probably has a
large number of employees, it will undoubtedly enter into obligations,
and creditors and others will deal with it regularly. The existence of
a company secretary who fulfils their statutory duties, and other
duties not so closely defined by statute in this Bill, would be a huge
reassurance to those individuals.</div>
<a name="06062755000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many private companies are very
large. Theexample given on Second Reading was John Swire and
Sons, which is an enormous company with morethan 130,000
employees and a turnover of about&#163;2.3 billion. It is
inconceivable that such a company would not appoint a company
secretary.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000552"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I see the Minister nods as if to say, &#147;All
such companies are quite at liberty to appoint such an
individual.&#148; However, I find it hard to understand why such a
large and significant enterprise&#151;with a huge turnover, thousands
of employees and, presumably, obligations that run into millions of
pounds&#151;is not required by the Bill to appoint a company
secretary, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 263</div>whereas a public company that may have a significantly smaller turnover
is. That is the nub of the argument between the Government and the
Opposition in this
Committee.</div>
<a name="06062755000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062755000553"></a><b class="B">Lorely
Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): Would the hon. Gentleman not agree
that there is a balance to be struck among not only the interests of
the company and its directors but, for a certain size of company, the
interest of others, which should be differentiated? Although none of us
on this side of the Committee desires to introduce or allow any more
regulation than is required, we still think that a balance that
acknowledges the interests of the different parties should be
represented in a regulatory sense.</div>
<a name="06062755000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000554"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> The hon. Lady is entirely right: it is a question
of the size of the company. Again, to take the Swire example, it would
be extraordinary for a company with 133,000 employees not to have a
company secretary.</div> <a name="06062755000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
fully understand that the Government will say that it is open to such
companies to employ secretaries. In the case of such a large
enterprise, where so many interests are at stake, it should be
mandatory for a company secretary to be appointed. That is not
regulation for the sake of regulation, but simple logic. It is
ridiculous that a small public company should be obliged to appoint a
secretary, whereas a huge private company should not. That is the nub
of the argument, which I think is unanswerable. I can see no good
reason for the argument, which Lord Sainsbury advanced in another
place, that a private company of that size should not be required to
appoint a company secretary. That is the main thrust of the
Opposition&#146;s amendment.</div>
<a name="06062755000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000555"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> The argument has moved a little more in the
direction of rationality because the hon. Gentleman is not arguing, as
his colleagues did, that being forced to give up secretaries would be a
burden on companies, because he accepts that they would not be forced
to do so. He is saying that companies should be required to have
secretaries in the wider interest if they are of a certain size, but is
he arguing that there should be no difference in law between the duties
placed on private and those on public
companies?</div><a name="06062755000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000556"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> Clearly that is not what I am arguing, because I am
supporting the amendment. I openly acknowledge that a small
company&#151;what my hon. Friend the Member for North-West
Cambridgeshire referred to as a corner-shop company&#151;should not
have the same degree of onerous obligations as a larger company.
However, by the same token, it seems quite illogical that enormous
private companies, of which there are many, should not be subject, in
the interests of good corporate governance, to the appointment of a
company secretary. That is the simple basis of the amendment and it is
on that basis that I support it. That is also the simple point that I
look forward to the Solicitor-General
answering.</div><a name="06062755000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000557"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is a great pleasure to appear before
you for the first time, Mr. Illsley. I am sure that we will have a
number of interesting debates in the coming weeks, although I hope not
too many weeks. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 264</div>appreciate that some people might like Committees to go on for longer
than I would, but provided that we make progress I see no reason why we
cannot enjoy each other&#146;s company before it becomes too
stale.</div> <a name="06062755000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I begin by
endorsing many of the points that the hon. Member for Hornchurch made
in praise of the benefits of company secretaries. They provide an
enormously valuable instrument for the protection of members in
particular and, in certain circumstances, of the public. In the case of
public companies, company secretaries perform a role that it is
necessary and desirable that they should continue to perform. Private
companies should have a greater degree of freedom and choice. We
believe that that will not lead to any significant problems, and that
this deregulatory approach is the better
one.</div><a name="06062755000451"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="06062755000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman said that there was a great deal of angst, worry and concern
among members of ICSA and other organisations about the proposals. I
appreciate that ICSA, an organisation that I have had some contact with
in the past as a lecturer in law and for which I have the greatest
respect, will want to reassure its members. I read the briefing paper
with interest, and I hope during the course of my comments to be able
to provide some reassurance that its members need not have the concern,
angst and worry that he
identified.</div><a name="06062755000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
essential issue is not, as the hon. Gentleman said, about additional
regulation. He was corrected by the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr.
Jones), who rightly said that the Conservatives were proposing more
regulation than the Government want. The Conservatives want to regulate
medium-sized private companies&#151;for want of a better
description&#151;rather than small companies. We agree that we should
give more freedom to small companies, so the issue between us is in
respect of medium-sized private companies. It was correctly identified
by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer), who said that
it was not about confusion, as the hon. Member for Hornchurch said, but
about whether we give greater choice and
freedom.</div><a name="06062755000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also want
to deal with issues such as subsidiaries that are owned by larger
corporations that may be public corporations and subject to obligations
to have a secretary. Large public corporations that own private
companies should be able to determine the internal management of those
companies, provided they comply with the requirements on audit and so
on.</div><a name="06062755000179"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000558"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I hear what the Solicitor-General says, but does
not more than the internal organisation of the company have to be
considered? Is there not also the company&#146;s dealings with the
wider world, and the point that I made earlier about Swire, which has
133,000 employees? Do not companies of that size need the reassurance
of a company secretary at the
helm?</div><a name="06062755000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000559"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Unlike the hon. Gentleman, I believe
that there should be an element of choice for companies. I suspect that
most companies of that size will choose to have a company secretary
because it is the appropriate thing to do, and because it will provide 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 265</div>the reassurance that they choose to give to those who deal with them and

would like to advance the argument and perhaps give way later. However,
if she wishes me to give way now, I
will.</div><a name="06062755000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000562"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I want to ask the Solicitor-General what the
difference is between an unlisted private company and a similar sized
or smaller public limited company in that context of choice. I do not
understand how the transaction basis on which shares are traded or not
traded on a stock exchange has any bearing on the corporate governance
levels that are required in the company and in its dealings with
external stakeholders on a day-to-day
basis.</div><a name="06062755000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000563"></a>The

not intervene, as I wanted to come to precisely that point. Let me deal
with it briefly
now.</div><a name="06062755000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Everyone
understands the difference between public and private
companies&#151;at least everyone who deals with these legal issues.
If one creates within that distinction a further distinction&#151;an
important one&#151;based on internal financial thresholds of private
companies, they create new categories and therefore new consequences
and problems. Section 249A as a dividing line adds complexity to these
issues.</div><a name="06062755000186"></a>

from the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening)? I will then give
way happily, but I want to make progress with my
argument.</div><a name="06062755000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my view
section 249A provides a basis on which auditors and accountants can
look at companies, but the hon. Lady wants to make a distinction in
company law, instead of having the present distinction between private
and public companies which is straightforward. Most people understand
it, as the hon. Lady obviously does and all members of the Committee
do. She wants to create a new category for the purposes of company
secretaries to identify that there is a particular new requirement that
she wishes to
introduce.</div><a name="06062755000189"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000567"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Lady shakes her head, but I am
not sure how she can say that she does not intend
that.</div><a name="06062755000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000568"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> It is not a question of understanding. The
Government must assume that the people involved in this area are far
more intelligent at grasping a lot more about business transactions
than just whether a company is a plc or a private company. I fail to
see why the level of understanding of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 266</div>difference between a plc and a private company should have any bearing
on the matter. The Solicitor-General has not addressed my original
intervention.</div><a name="06062755000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000569"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Perhaps the hon. Lady will consider
that companies grow and companies decline and their financial
circumstances will alter. The number of employees they have will alter
and other criteria will alter during the course of a year. Some of
those companies may not know until after the conclusion of the
financial year whether they fit within the category of section 249A or
not. They are growing or declining and their circumstances change. To
protect themselves, they may decide that whether they go up or down
they had better appoint a company secretary. They may have chosen not
to do so before, but they may decide to do so now because they will
have to comply with the law that the hon. Lady wants to impose. The
difficulty is that if they are growing or declining they will not know
at the start of the year whether they comply with section
249A.</div><a name="06062755000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000570"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> It sounds as though the Solicitor-General is
arguing for our amendment, which would give companies a clear framework
within which to operate and, therefore, simplicity instead of the
complexity of having to make predictions about what they thought good
corporate governance would be in the private company world before they
reach the end of the
year.</div><a name="06062755000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000571"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> In that case, the hon. Lady has
misunderstood what I said. I said exactly the opposite of what she
suggested. I said that the Opposition&#146;s proposal in the
amendment would produce precisely the lack of precision and the
inability to predict that would cause an undesirable level of
complexity. It would create an entirely new
category.</div><a name="06062755000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000572"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000573"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am engaged in a debate with the hon.
Lady and as soon as I have finished that I will give way to the hon.
Gentleman with
pleasure.</div><a name="06062755000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal
that the hon. Lady is presumably supporting today is based on criteria
in section 249A&#151;her hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch is
nodding his head in agreement&#151;and would impose a set of
criteria. That set of criteria would create a distinction between
whether a private, medium-sized company must have a company secretary
or not. That is the objective of the Conservatives&#146; proposal and
that is precisely what I am saying will lead to lack of precision
because a company might not know until the end of the financial year
whether it was obliged to comply with that. The point is
simple.</div><a name="06062755000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000574"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Solicitor-General missed the point made by
my hon. Friend the Member for Putney. If a company is set up as a
public company it needs little more than two directors and paid-up
share capital of &#163;12,500. The Solicitor-General made great play
of the need not to include medium-sized companies, but a public company
could be small or medium-sized, so he has destroyed his own
argument.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 267</div><a name="06062755000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000575"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> No. With respect, that is not the case.
Of course a public company can be small or medium-sized. I used private
medium-sized companies as shorthand to illustrate for the purposes of
the debate that the Conservatives were proposing the creation of a
distinction between small and larger private
companies.</div><a name="06062755000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the case
of public companies, such a distinction will also arise. I am not
arguing that all medium-sized companies should be in the same category;
I am saying something entirely different. I am saying that a plc should
be treated as a plc, subject to the requirements that plcs must comply
with under the
Bill&#151;</div><a name="06062755000201"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000577"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman let me finish
before he jumps up? I am saying that private companies should be able
to make the choice that he would deny them. The Government are in
favour of giving private companies a level of choice about how they
determine their internal organisation, particularly in appointing a
company secretary. I do not accept his proposal that the financial
criterion set out in section 249A is the best way to determine the
difference between various kinds of private company. I say that that
would create confusion. I say that that is unnecessary regulation. I
say that the Government want to give private companies greater choice
and freedom, and the Conservatives are seeking to deny
that.</div><a name="06062755000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000578"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Let me tie that down. Is the Solicitor-General
saying that his idea of clarity is that a public company with one
employee should have a company secretary, while a medium-sized private
company with 260 employees does not need
one?</div><a name="06062755000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000579"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman knows very well that
a person who wishes to create a publicly listed company with one
employee&#151;it happens; it is not impossible&#151;will know that
they must comply with certain criteria. It will be a perfectly
straightforward, clear distinction that everyone understands. Nobody
knows&#151;</div><a name="06062755000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000580"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Will the Solicitor-General give
way?</div><a name="06062755000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000581"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman let me finish?
Nobody can guess the difference between the various criteria that he
seeks to identify for private companies. In the case of a public
company, which may be listed or not, the Government have made a clear
distinction that everyone who creates a public company will understand.
They will know that they must have a company secretary. In the case of
a private company, they will know that there is an element of choice.
That is the key distinction that he seeks to deny. The amendments are
essentially regulatory. They will impose regulations on medium-sized
private companies by requiring them to have company
secretaries.</div><a name="06062755000207"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000583"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Let me develop my argument, and then I
will give way.</div><a name="06062755000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are committed to better regulation. We are opposed in
principle to any regulation that is not justified by its benefits. The
amendments would require private companies over the threshold to
appoint a company secretary.</div>
<a name="06062755000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Company secretaries have
certain benefits. They protect members and provide reassurance in
particular circumstances to third parties. But do we need to impose a
regulation like the one proposed by the Conservatives? It would have to
be justified in terms of the needs of medium-sized private companies,
and nothing that I have heard from the hon. Member for Hornchurch shows
that level of justification. We agree that there is no need to impose
company secretaries on small private companies, and we agree that
company secretaries are necessary in public companies. We are in
agreement.</div><a name="06062755000452"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="06062755000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">In order to
justify the imposition of that regulation on medium-sized private
companies, or&#151;for want of a better description&#151;companies
that go above the criteria in section 249A, the Conservatives will have
to show that it is necessary for the purposes of the proper running of
those companies. They say that choice should be denied, and we say that
choice should remain. That is the difference between
us.</div><a name="06062755000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000586"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I shall not give way. Let me advance my
argument, and then I shall give way to Opposition Members with
pleasure.</div><a name="06062755000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
does not strip away the powers of private company secretaries. However,
like all previous Companies Acts, it does not specify the role,
functions, duties or responsibilities of a company secretary. Those are
matters for the companies themselves. Clause 43 retains the power of
any person to enter into contracts on behalf of companies if he or she
is</div> <a name="06062755000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;acting under its
authority, express or
implied.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only powers conferred on the company secretary by Companies Acts
are&#151;like those for a director&#151;to authenticate the
company&#146;s documents, and to be a co-signatory with a director
for the execution of documents by the company. The Bill will give a
company the right to appoint one or more individuals as authorised
signatories who will be able not only to authenticate the
company&#146;s documents, but to execute documents on the same basis
as directors. There is room for both the concept of company director
and the concept of authorised signatory, as I think that the hon.
Member for Hornchurch said last Tuesday. Under the Bill, both of those
should be optional for private companies. Unlike public companies, they
will be able to have secretaries who are not also authorised
signatories. That should be the choice of the private
companies.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 269</div><a name="06062755000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill goes further by giving
all companies the power to appoint an individual as an authorised
signatory, and private companies the freedom to decide whether to
appoint a company secretary. Clearly, a private company that decides to
appoint someone as its secretary can decide also to appoint that person
as an authorised signatory. That is its choice. Many will wish to do
that, but I expect others to prefer their secretaries not to have that
authority. That, too, is their choice. The Bill gives them the freedom
to decide. It introduces flexibility and a deregulatory approach that
takes account of the widely varying nature of our private companies. We
see no need to impose on any private company a requirement to have a
company secretary. That is our
position.</div><a name="06062755000219"></a>

Greening:</b> I still do not think that the Solicitor-General
has made a good argument. Several minutes ago, he said that company
secretaries provided members with some protection. I do not understand
why members who have invested in private companies of a substantial
size deserve less
protection&#151;</div><a name="06062755000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000588"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000589"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> It is not a choice that they will have had a
chance to make, if they have already invested and then, as a result of
the Bill, the company chooses to no longer have a company secretary.
They have already invested. So it is not true that they will have
hada choice. I do not see any justifiable logic in saying that
a company secretary is needed for a plc company of a significant size
but not for a private company of a particular size. Either it is
worthwhile for a company to have a company secretary, or it is
not.</div><a name="06062755000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000590"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> If we take the hon. Lady&#146;s final
position&#151;that there is either a logic in the role or there is
not&#151;to its logical conclusion, she is essentially arguing that
we should have company secretaries in all private companies, big or
small. She shrugs her shoulders to indicate that that is her position,
but that is not our view or, indeed, that of her Front-Bench
colleagues, as she will find. We and her Front-Bench colleagues take
the view that small private companies should not be obliged to have a
company
secretary.</div><a name="06062755000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000591"></a>Justine

<a name="06062755000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000592"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> If the hon. Lady will let me answer, I
will give way in a minute. The view of those on both Front
Benches&#151;there is no distinction between us on this&#151;seems
to differ from the hon. Lady&#146;s position, because we believe that
small private companies do not need to have a company secretary unless
they choose to have one, and that should be their choice. The hon. Lady
appears to take a different view, but if she has misstated it, perhaps
she can correct that now.</div>
<a name="06062755000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000593"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> The Solicitor-General is clearly a master of
body language assessment, given that my shrug of the shoulders was
taken to mean so much. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 270</div>fully support the amendments and giving companies a choice whether to
have a company secretary. Our point, however, is that the Bill is
devoid of any intellectual rigour, because it simply does not say why a
company of one size, which happens to have publicly traded shares,
needs a company secretary, when a private company of exactly the same
size or smaller does not.</div>
<a name="06062755000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000594"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Mere assertion&#151;and repetitive
assertion at that&#151;does not make for an argument. To repeat the
answer that I gave before&#151;the hon. Lady obviously does not
accept it, and that is a matter for her, but the rigour of the argument
is clear&#151;there is a clear distinction between private and public
companies, which we all accept. Anyone who decides to create a public
company therefore knows that they will have to comply with certain
rules and appoint a company secretary. Anyone who decides to become
involved in a private company will have an element of choice that is
denied to those in a public company. There is a distinction between
private and public companies, and that difference in nature is
essentially the reason why it is right that private companies should
have an element of choice.</div>

way?</div>
<a name="06062755000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000596"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I will give way once more, but then I
will make some progress. I am anxious to give people as much
opportunity as they want to get at me, but I want to set out my
argument fully and deal with some of the points raised by the hon.
Gentleman and his hon. Friends. I will be happy to give way after that.
</div><a name="06062755000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000597"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> Does the Solicitor-General agree that the
fundamental purpose of regulation is public protection? If he does,
will he please tell me how it makes for greater public protection to
ensure that a small public company has a company secretary, while a
large private company employing 133,000 people and with a turnover of
&#163;2.3 billion, to take the Swire example again, does
not?</div>
<a name="06062755000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000598"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The essential difference between a
private and a public company is that only a public company can make
offers to the public, so the requirement for it to have a company
secretary is needed to protect them. To that extent, I think that the
hon. Gentleman and I agree. The need for corporate governance is
different because of the ability to make offers to people who seek to
be shareholders.</div>
<a name="06062755000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a clear administrative
difference between the natures of private and public companies and a
clear dividing line. However, the hon. Gentleman and his Front-Bench
colleagues are seeking to impose a very imprecise new criterion to
distinguish between different kinds of private company&#151;one that
requires a company secretary for all sorts of reasons and another that
does not. Given that the criterion is so imprecise, companies that are
growing or declining might not have a clue whether they will comply
with it in a particular year. Essentially, the result will be
regulation by stealth. Companies will need to appoint a company
secretary just in case they grow or decline during the coming financial
year, because they will not know 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 271</div>whether, at the end of that year, they will come within the criteria
imposed by section 249A. The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. Can he
tell me how a company whose position is quite marginal in terms of some
of the criteria outlined and which is growing or declining will know
what the company results will be by the end of the year? Such companies
would be forced to take precautions, would they not? They would be
obliged to appoint a company secretary, would they not? That is why I
say that the result would be regulation by stealth. If the hon.
Gentleman wants to regulate, fine; let us be open about it. However, he
is seeking to create a criterion that is not precise enough. The
distinction between private and public companies is very precise, and
everyone understands it. No one is in any doubt, least of all he or any
member of the public. He is seeking to identify a new criterion, which
is a recipe for
confusion.</div><a name="06062755000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000599"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> The Solicitor-General is making too much of this.
The company will be aware when it hits the criterion at the end of the
financial year. The situation is as simple as that. Clearly, it will
not be required to appoint a company secretary until at the end of the
financial year it knows that it has hit the audit level. The
Solicitor-General still has not answered my point about public
protection. Perhaps he will address
that.</div><a name="06062755000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000600"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I did answer the question about public
protection. The essential difference between a public company and a
private company is that only a public company can make offers to the
public. Therefore, it is necessary to impose a level of regulation on
public companies that is not necessarily required to be imposed on
private
companies.</div><a name="06062755000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000601"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000604"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Because I have said repeatedly that I
want to make progress on the argument. I have given way to the hon.
Member for Clwyd, West several times. Let us be
fair.</div><a name="06062755000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me deal with
some of the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Hornchurch,
because he raised concerns that have been expressed elsewhere that
existing private companies with secretaries that wish to retain them
would face a further administrative burden if they wished the existing
secretary to be appointed as an authorised signatory. I make it clear
that we intend to make the transition to the new regime as easy as
possible for existing companies. We shall consult on what the
transitional provision should be in respect of such companies. We want
to respond positively to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s important point.
We intend to ensure that individuals who are private company
secretaries immediately before the Bill&#146;s provisions come into
force will continue to be able to authenticate documents for
their companies and to participate in the execution of
documents.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 272</div><a name="06062755000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 248 is
inconsistent with the provision in clause 253 that frees any private
company from the requirement for any private company to have a
secretary. The amendment has three parts, which I shall address
separately. On the first part, we see no reason why the sole director
of a private company should not also be its secretary. As there is no
requirement for a private company to have a secretary, it would be
unnecessary regulation to place restrictions on who may be the
secretary. Such bureaucratic nonsense would lead to the sort of
complexity that we aim to strip out of company law, a move that I
thought both parties
supported.</div><a name="06062755000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
part is similar to section 287(4)(a) of the current Act, but whereas
the existing provision refers to a corporation, the sole director of
which is the director of the company, the amendment refers
to</div><a name="06062755000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a corporation, the
sole director of which is secretary to the
company.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
appears to bite only if the company has a joint secretary; otherwise,
paragraph (a) does not appear to make much
sense.</div><a name="06062755000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third part
is not necessary, as clause 140 already provides that every
company</div><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must have at least one secretary who
is a natural person&#148;,</div><a name="06062755000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">so
the sole director cannot be a
corporation.</div><a name="06062755000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 185 and 188 would require private companies over the threshold to
appoint a company secretary. Having a company secretary would benefit
some private companies, and I think that many private companies will
decide to appoint one. As we are talking about private companies only,
the benefit would go no
wider.</div><a name="06062755000453"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="06062755000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the Bill,
private company directors would be able to appoint a company secretary
and the members could require them to do so. The members can choose for
themselves. We considered that the decision whether or not to have a
secretary should be left to the directors and members of all private
companies, regardless of their
size.</div><a name="06062755000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
189, 192 and 204 are consequential on amendments Nos. 185 and 188.
Subsection (2) is intended to remove any doubt for third parties that
are dealing with private companies and ensures that the
company&#146;s decision whether or not to have a secretary does not
affect others. Amendments Nos. 249 and 186 would introduce a level of
complexity and uncertainty and, in our view, are unnecessary. They
would impose costs on third
parties.</div><a name="06062755000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
187 would conflict with the officer in default provisions under clause
744. It would be worthwhile for the hon. Member for Hornchurch to
peruse that. The Bill provides that directors would be liable as
officers in default for offences committed by the company. A director
would be held to be in default for the purposes of a provision under
the Companies Act if he authorises, permits, participates in or fails
to take all reasonable steps to stop a contravention. That is not the
case for every
offence.</div><a name="06062755000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would provide a blanket rule for all offences and obligations under the
Act. It would remove any defence to a director being in default and
would have the consequence of a director becoming 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 273</div>automatically liable for an offence in instances when he arguably has a
reasonable defence. That would be disproportionately harsh. It is like
the Conservatives deciding to be tough on directors and tough on the
causes of directors, not something that they intend, but it would be a
consequence of the amendment. It would impose a disproportionate burden
on directors and, on that basis, I ask Opposition Members to withdraw
it.</div> <a name="06062755000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
explained, the Bill, like previous Companies Acts, does not specify the
roles and functions of a company secretary. That will be a matter for
the company. The Bill takes matters a step further. It will give all
private companies the freedom to decide whether to appoint a secretary.
As the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire said, that is little
change, in effect, from the functions that the secretary usually
performs in so far as those functions are statutory. They will still
have to be performed by someone. We are not claiming enormous benefits
in respect of the deregulatory measure, but it will be a helpful
response to many private companies that wish to organise their internal
affairs as they
choose.</div><a name="06062755000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Matters have
been raised about the extent of consultation, who would be consulted
and the way in which the policies arose. Opposition Members are
familiar with the company law review and the background to it. They
will have read the explanatory notes, so I shall not go into how it
explored the issues. The 2005 White Paper included proposals to
implement that recommendation. The draft clauses were complex, as they
addressed the CLR supplementary recommendation that the secretary
appointed should have full authority as under the current Act. That
complexity was much criticised, not least by the Institute of Chartered
Secretaries and
Administrators.</div><a name="06062755000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
responses to the White Paper were fairly evenly split. Eight welcomed
or supported the proposals, including the Federation of Small
Businesses, the Law Society, the Confederation of British Industry and
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
Previously, the Law Society and the CBI had been opposed to the
proposals. Eight opposed them, including ICSA and the Institute of
Directors; five were broadly neutral and three did not comment
significantly on the policy. Given that the main beneficiaries of the
Bill will be private small companies, our view was that we should move
forward with the
proposals.</div><a name="06062755000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
other points were raised by the hon. Member for Hornchurch. I will go
through them reasonably quickly. The hon. Gentleman spoke about the
shell listed plc with a secretary, with hundreds of subsidiaries, all
trading, that would not need a secretary because they are private. The
parent listed company will have to produce group accounts and reports
in the normal way, which is what matters to the public. Even if the
parent company does not actively trade, the responsibility will lie
with
it.</div><a name="06062755000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman raised issues about all private companies being able to
have a secretary for internal matters. It is the case that there is no
change here. If they want a company secretary they can have one. For
all external matters private companies will have a straightforward
choice: they can have no secretary, or a secretary able to sign and
authorise documents, or a company secretary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 274</div>not able to sign and authorise documents. That will be a matter for
them. Others may also have authorisation from the company to
sign&#151;again, that will be a matter for the
company.</div><a name="06062755000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hornchurch said that a company secretary is an officer of
the company by virtue of section 744. He is an officer, but it is not
section 744 that makes an officer of the company. Companies are free to
create officers. There is no general great legal significance. We do
not believe that it makes someone an office holder in the sense in
which that applies. For example, in employment law a company secretary
ceases to hold office when removed in accordance with the articles of
the company&#151;that is, normally by the directors or maybe by the
members, depending on the
circumstances.</div><a name="06062755000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman raised a point in relation to clause 640, which I will
deal with briefly. I do not think that I accept his point about a
lacuna existing in clause 640, but I will have a look at that and
explore it. At the moment our view is that directors in the public
company sector and other officers in default can commit the offence.
Directors in the public company sector in office when the return was
due to be made commit the offence unless they prove that they took all
reasonable steps to avoid the offence. For other officers in default
and anyone who took office subsequently, an officer is liable only if
he or she is in default&#151;that is, if he or she is authorised or
permitted. Of course they will need to be authorised or permitted, and
they must have participated in or failed to take all reasonable steps
to prevent the offence being
committed.</div><a name="06062755000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that I have dealt with most of the points raised. I have made a note
here about some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Clwyd, West
and to some extent the point raised by the hon. Member for Putney, but
I think that I have waxed eloquent on the distinction and made my
point. I will add just one more. It would appear that many of the
private companies that are over the audit threshold are in fact wholly
owned subsidiaries of public companies and our view remains that the
internal administration of those companies is best left primarily to
them.</div><a name="06062755000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">In essence, what
we have here is a clear distinction between the Government and the
Opposition. That distinction is on whether to impose a level of
regulation on the larger private companies or to allow them an element
of free choice about whether they have a company secretary. That, in
essence, is the issue. We take the view that private companies are
different in nature and, to that extent, they should be able to choose
whether or not to have a company secretary. The Conservatives take the
view that larger private companies are not in a position where they
should be able to have that choice. The Conservatives wish to impose
more regulation on them than the Government do. That, in essence, is
the distinction.</div><a name="06062755000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
chief concern is the means. I understand why the Conservatives have
gone for those criteria that they are seeking to make the judgment on.
Basically, it is necessary to have something and there are no other
useful criteria that one could choose. I can see why the hon. Member
for Hornchurch, or whoever, would have chosen that particular section,
which does create an element of distinction. But section 249A also
creates a level of complexity and confusion for companies that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 275</div>may during the course of their year move up or down and not know whether
they are in compliance or not.</div>
<a name="06062755000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not accept that the best
way of dealing with the matter is to apply to appoint a company
secretary in any event. We take the view that that element of choice
should remain with the private company or with those who control it.
That is therefore a fundamental distinction between us. We are best
sticking to a clear distinction on the nature of companies, so that
everyone understands the difference between public and private
companies. That distinction is one to which we can, and should, all
adhere. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I am being asked to give way, and I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000605"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I am most grateful to the Solicitor-General for
giving way once again. In those circumstances, does he still consider
that private companies with an annual turnover of more than
&#163;5.6 million need to be subject to an
audit?</div><a name="06062755000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000606"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> There is a need for private companies
that are above a certain size to comply with all sorts of things. The
question is whether a company secretary has to be one of them. The
distinction between the hon. Gentleman and I is that he would wish to
impose what I believe to be an unnecessary burden on those larger
private companies. He would say that they must be regulated in a way
that I do not think is necessary. He obviously thinks that it is
necessary and he is entitled to that view, but it is a clear
distinction between us. He has been honest throughout this debate;
unlike some others who have suggested that this is not regulatory, he
says yes, it is more regulatory because it is necessary to regulate
more. I accept that that is a very straightforward position.</div>
<a name="06062755000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Others have
suggested&#151;and got themselves into a bit of a mess by doing
so&#151;that the obligation is deregulatory. It is not deregulatory;
it is more regulatory. There may be arguments for it but they are not
very good. That is why the Government would prefer to stick with the
position that we have set out in the
Bill.</div><a name="06062755000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000607"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister refused to give way to my earlier
intervention, so before my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch
replies to the Minister I want to put one point on the record about the
relationship between corporate governance and the size of the company.
The Solicitor-General made great play about the difference between a
private and a public company&#151;that a public company can make an
offer to the public. On that basis he justified the need for a public
company only to appoint a company secretary and to need the corporate
governance protection that having a company secretary
implies.</div><a name="06062755000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
somewhat narrow view of corporate governance, because a private company
may have many hundreds of members. Indeed, it may be an old public
company, which offered shares to the public but which now does not need
to do so. But with hundreds of members, corporate governance in a
private company will be very important. In some ways it will be more
important that such a company adopts good corporate governance
procedures because it is not forced to do so. Furthermore, corporate
governance goes much further 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 276</div>than the company&#146;s relationship with its members, or its future
members; it goes to other issues such as the company&#146;s
relationship with suppliers, employees and community interests. I
submit that the corporate governance importance of the large private
company will be just as great if not greater than if the company is
simply public.</div>
<a name="06062755000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000608"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I do not think there is much disagreement about the
statement that the Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for
Huntingdon, made. But there is an oddity in his assertion. We will
consider a range of amendments, if we get to them, on the subject of
the percentage of members who are required to have resolutions and so
on.</div> <a name="06062755000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition
Members are raising the stakes;they have tabled amendments
proposing 5 per cent. to 10 per cent. To me, the key corporate
governance issues provide the sort of probity that is wanted. Yet we
are being asked to consider the issue that corporate governance depends
on whether we impose on companies of a certain size the rigidity of
having to have a particular employee with a particular conscience. That
is an odd way of defining corporate governance, on much of the
definition of which, in theory, I am in agreement with the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
<a name="06062755000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000609"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister makes her point and I will not put
this into the context of this and every other clause in the Bill, as
she tried to
do.</div><a name="06062755000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000610"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b>
Consistency.</div><a name="06062755000454"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000611"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> No. We take these clauses on a one-by-one basis
and look at what is appropriate in the circumstances. Surely the
Minister will appreciate that. Again, I do not want to make a series of
points; I just want to make a specific point on corporate governance.
The issue is much more than whether the company is public or private,
and the size of the company will often be relevant to the level of
corporate governance that is
required.</div><a name="06062755000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000612"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We have had a good debate on company
secretaries and their continuing role within either the public or the
private company environment. The hon. Member for Cheadle made an
important point, recognising the role and importance of the company
secretary, and also recognising the point that my hon. Friend just made
about the need to look not only at the company itself, but externally
at the continuing roles and
functions.</div><a name="06062755000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Broxtowe touched on the regulatory/deregulatory issue.
Although I recognise that private companies are being given a choice,
our amendments would mean less regulation on either side because all
companies currently have to have company secretaries. It is a bit of a
false argument to say we are being more regulatory, because we already
have company
secretaries.</div><a name="06062755000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire emphasised the
deregulatory nature of whatever approach we take. He made an important
point about the involvement of directors. If the role of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 277</div>the company secretary, whether intended or not, is downgraded or
downplayed in a private company setting, directors will become more
involved in the day-to-day administrative matters and that may cause
problems. ICSA identified that problem in relation to good corporate
governance, which might be threatened in some way.</div>
<a name="06062755000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Clwyd, West talked about reassurance and how, from the corporate
governance perspective, it is important to have certainty for a
particular size of company. In some ways, that is where the dividing
line is drawn in terms of when it is appropriate to require a company
to have a secretary or not. The Government say that the dividing line
is a plc, as compared with a private company. We think that we need to
be more sophisticated and take a different view. It is the size and
scale of operations that matters, not an artificial definition of
whether something is a plc or a limited liability company because of
the nature of the activities that are undertaken. I suppose that that
is the dividing line between our two differing approaches.</div>
<a name="06062755000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Huntingdon pointed out that some plcs will have outside shareholders,
too. Although the Solicitor-General is right that a limited liability
company cannot make an offer to the public, certain other offers can be
made in a private placement which could bring in institutional
investors, and there could be a limited number of high net worth
individuals who might invest in a private company. In some ways, they
may have a lesser protection if a very clear dividing line is drawn
between the plc and the limited liability. That is certainly the
distinction that I would draw.</div>
<a name="06062755000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Solicitor-General tried to
brush aside the plc versus private company issue, but private companies
with a significant number of shareholders might not be family companies
and might have outside interests. It is better to look at the
distinction in terms of financial issues, and that is why the
amendments are drafted in such a way. To be fair to the
Solicitor-General, he eventually framed the distinction in a high-blown
way, but we would distinguish it on the basis of the turnover
threshold, as identified in our amendments.</div>
<a name="06062755000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000613"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman made a reasonable
point about the way in which an offer can be made by a private company.
Indeed, it might attract institutional investors, but surely the
response to that must be that the institutional investors or others, if
they intend to invest in a private company and seek the protection of
the company secretary, will be able, in the course of negotiations, to
say, &#147;If you want my investment, I want the satisfaction of the
protection of a company secretary.&#148; It will be a matter for the
company and those who seek to invest in it to choose whether they want
that level of protection.</div>
<a name="06062755000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000614"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Solicitor-General makes an interesting
point. That is why I talked about the provision creating burdens. He
made a good argument for the fact that additional costs and burdens are
being created. We all understand what a company secretary is at the
moment, whereas in such circumstances an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 278</div>investor will say, &#147;Okay. This is a limited liability company. I
want it treated as a plc.&#148; The lawyers will have to be brought
in and additional costs racked up to put that into the articles. That
is additionally burdensome. His point about what additional burdens
might be created in such circumstances was well made. That is what I
mean when I talk about the burdens.</div>
<a name="06062755000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the
Solicitor-General&#146;s comment about transitional arrangements and
the transitional situation with existing company secretaries, but the
problem is that if a group is large and has a number of different
subsidiaries, it is possible for new subsidiaries to be formed all the
time. As of today&#146;s date, the company secretary of a large group
will have to create that position in the new subsidiaries to maintain
the status quo. That brings an additional level of complexity. They
will have to ask whether the limited liability company was in existence
prior to the Bill and whether he or she was company secretary at the
time, or whether it was a limited liability company for which they were
not company secretary at the time, or which was not formed prior to the
Bill. Within large groups, there is likely to be a level of complexity
that the Solicitor-General perhaps glossed over in some of his
comments.</div> <a name="06062755000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
talking about burdens and regulation. ICSA and its members are
concerned about the regulatory requirements that might be created as a
consequence of the construct that has been created by the Bill. We
touched on the fact that plcs they can be small and not necessarily
listed. It is interesting that the Government want to maintain that
line, rather than take our approach with the turnover
threshold.</div> <a name="06062755000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note
that the Solicitor-General emphasised the authorised signatory
situation and said, &#147;Look, you&#146;ve got the choice. If you
want to create a company secretary, that is fine, but it is up to you
to go and create that role, to make them authorised signatories, to
give them authority, and everything like that.&#148; I hear what he
says, and that might be suitable for small companies who might say that
they do not need a company secretary. I think that we are in agreement
on such cases. There are clearly situations when a company secretary
might be inappropriate and unnecessarily burdensome, such as in a
small, family-run company. We are not arguing at all on that
point.</div> <a name="06062755000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
question of where we set the benchmark from a corporate governance
perspective and from the external perspective of what people who deal
with a company and who might become shareholders expect. Although I
hear what the Solicitor-General says about it all being terribly
regulatory, I do not accept that. The Government are accepting the
requirement to have company secretaries in plcs, so one might say that
they are being over-regulatory in that way. If they believe so
fervently that company secretaries are an unnecessary burden, perhaps
they should have got rid of them altogether.</div>
<a name="06062755000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the Government
rightly recognise the value of company secretaries in ensuring good
corporate governance. That is why they sought to retain them in a plc
context, but it should not be viewed in that context alone. For
medium-sized and larger companies, it is appropriate to expect that
standard of behaviour and for corporate governance to
apply.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 279</div><a name="06062755000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000615"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is the case that, particularly in
public companies, a company secretary will be a necessary level of
protection for members and third parties. It is also the case, however,
that many private companies will choose to have a company secretary.
That will be to their benefit and it is right that they should have
that choice. The essential difference&#151;the hon. Gentleman is
glossing over it&#151;is that we want to provide an element of
choice, particularly for larger private companies and he wants to deny
them that choice. I am still waiting for the argument that will explain
why we must have
regulation.</div><a name="06062755000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000616"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> With all due respect to the
Solicitor-General, I have made that argument. It is about what external
people who deal with the company can expect. It is all very well saying
that the company must have choice, but there comes a time when
consideration must be given to the members and shareholders of the
company, its creditors and third parties, and to what they may expect.
It is a false argument to say that the matter concerns the company
alone. We must look at the context of the company, where it sits in its
dealings, and how that works in
practice.</div><a name="06062755000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that
the Solicitor-General will return to the point about section 640, which
I raised in the context of whether secretaries are officers of
companies. I note also that he said that that does not necessarily
derive from section 744, which defines an officer for the purposes of
the 1985 Act and specifically lists a secretary as being an officer in
that context, from an interpretive point of view, to give clarity. In
relation to section 744, I am not sure whether that will be entirely
reflected in the Bill when it is finalised and we have all the
definitions and so on lined up. I seek clarity on whether that will
appear in it.</div> <a name="06062755000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Solicitor-General said that companies can create officers without
statutory authority, but we need to be clear whether someone is an
officer or not. The current mechanism of having a secretary whose name
appears on the record at Companies House provides that clarity and the
standing for that individual to be able to ensure compliance at board
level. That provides added weight and credibility. It may be possible
for a company to create an officer in the way that he describes, but
because company secretaries do not have the back-up of registration at
Companies House and in the record of third parties, their position is
not properly recognised and their standing is lessened in the eyes of
third
parties.</div><a name="06062755000287"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000617"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a powerful contribution.
The important word is &#147;standing&#148;. Many company
secretaries have written to us about the loss of standing that they
believe they will suffer as a result of the proposals. At the heart of
that is their position as an officer of the
company.</div><a name="06062755000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000618"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. What
concerns us is the liability that goes with an officer&#146;s
position. I want to put that in context in relation to section 640,
because the way in which it is drafted provides a defence for a
secretary of a public company that is not available to a secretary of a
private company. I note that the Solicitor-General 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 280</div>will come back to us on that. My point is genuine and I am not trying to
raise false problems. That needs to be examined carefully and it puts
into context the status of secretaries, whether they are officers and
what liability they may have in that
regard.</div><a name="06062755000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">In closing, I
want to encapsulate two lines of argument that we have developed and
which have not been distilled out. Most of the debate has been in
connection with the pure issue of whether we should have company
secretaries for plcs as against whether we should have company
secretaries for medium or larger-sized private
companies.</div>
<a name="06062755000455"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="06062755000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
further line of argument, in that if the Government are not minded to
accept our position in insisting that medium-sized or larger private
companies should have a secretary, there is the residual issue of the
standing of a secretary. I note that the issue comes through clearly in
ICSA&#146;s latest briefing note. It is concerned that if additional
language is not built into the Bill, the standing of a secretary will
be diminished in some way.</div>
<a name="06062755000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if we were to accept the
Government&#146;s argument about limited liabilities having the
choice of whether to appoint a secretary, the further point is, first,
that that should be given recognition by Companies House and, secondly,
that there should be some recognition in the Bill of where a secretary
sits, either as an office holder or more generally. It is that absence,
what it will mean and the point about administration moving forward
that is causing disturbance, distress and&#151;to repeat the language
that I employed in my opening comments&#151;anxiety among existing
company secretaries.</div>
<a name="06062755000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a question where we
set the dividing line. I hear what the Solicitor-General said and
clearly we are at variance on that. There is also the point about the
recognition of private company secretaries, if a company chooses to
adopt that route. That point should be not underestimated, ignored or
glossed over, because it is serious and needs to be examined carefully,
but it has not been addressed properly by the Government to
date.</div><a name="06062755000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">In light of
that, I would like to press the amendment, which concerns where we set
the dividing line, to a Division. Separately, I should also like to
press to a Division amendment No. 249, which concerns the secondary
issue that I have raised on the need for some recognition of private
companies&#146; secretaries in the Bill. Private companies&#146;
secretaries play a significant role in our corporate environment. That
their role appears to be being downgraded is a shortcoming of the Bill.
That role should be protected; I shall therefore press those two

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000659"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Amendment No. 191 relates to the power of the
Secretary of State to give directions to a public company in
connection with its requirement to have a company secretary. Clause 254
states:</div><a name="06062755000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
public company must have a
secretary.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 255
provides the Secretary of State with a mechanism for maintaining
compliance. However, clause 256 sets out certain requirements that a
public company secretary should fulfil. I do not want to take up the
Committee&#146;s time unduly, but it might be worth looking at clause
256(2):</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 282</div><a name="06062755000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The qualifications
are&#151;</div><a name="06062755000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) that he has held
the office of secretary of a public company for at least three of the
five years immediately preceding his appointment as
secretary;</div><a name="06062755000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) that he is a
member of any of the bodies specified in subsection
(3);</div><a name="06062755000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) that he is a barrister,
advocate or solicitor called or admitted in any part of the United
Kingdom;</div><a name="06062755000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">(d) that he is a person
who, by virtue of his holding or having held any other position or his
being a member of any other body, appears to the directors to be
capable of discharging the functions of secretary of the
company.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
(d) emphasises that there is some flexibility on the part of the
company in determining whether a person meets the criteria. The
amendment therefore probes the interrelationship between clauses 254 to
256 to ensure that the direction-making power of the Secretary of State
cannot be used to question or challenge a company&#146;s decision as
to whether a valid appointment has been made for the purposes of the
qualifications in clause 256 and therefore whether clause 254 is
satisfied.</div><a name="06062755000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 266 raises a separate issue. It seeks to probe the review
undertaken to draw up the list of relevant organisations included in
clause 256(3), and which are treated as satisfying the requirements in
clause 256(2)(b), which I read out a few moments ago. The amendment
proposes to include the Association of Accounting Technicians on the
list. We have been contacted by the AAT, which set out why it believes
that it is an appropriate body for inclusion. I make no specific
comment or argument whether it is appropriate, but it raises the
question whether the list has been reviewed and what flexibility there
will be to amend the list, either formally through the Bill or through
guidance that could be incorporated indirectly under clause
256(2)(d).</div><a name="06062755000350"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000660"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I rise simply for a point of clarification, as we
are without the good offices of our expert Member this afternoon.
During our long and fascinating debate earlier, I was reading the
explanatory notes, which
say:</div><a name="06062755000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is
no requirement for the company secretary to be a natural
person.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">Must that person
be an unnatural person? That would create concern, and the Liberal
Democrats would not be able to support the clause if it were the
case.</div><a name="06062755000352"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000661"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I reassure the hon. Lady that because,
in law, corporations are persons, the distinction must be made between
individuals&#151;natural persons&#151;and corporations. She need
not fear, although I do not wish her to support the amendment and I
hope that it will be
withdrawn.</div><a name="06062755000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
255 provides the Secretary of State with the power to issue a direction
only if the public company is in default of a requirement to have a
secretary. It does not provide for the Secretary of State to consider
the suitability or qualifications of any appointment. It is a matter
for the company whom it wishes to appoint and whether a particular
secretary and their qualifications are suitable. I hope that on that
basis, the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw amendment No.
191.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 283</div><a name="06062755000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to amendment No. 266. The
Bill follows the 1985 Act in specifying only a list of various
organisations. The Government&#146;s view was that we could have
widened the group, but that the issue would then become where to draw
the line. At the moment, we will stick with the position as it is.
However, I point out that the list of bodies in subsection (3) is not
exhaustive. Any company that wishes to appoint a member of the AAT as a
company secretary should be able to do so. I am sure that that
organisation is very reputable; I have read the background information
on it. Subsection (2)(d) provides that if it appears to the company
directors that the member of any other body is capable of discharging
the functions of company secretary, that person can be appointed. On
that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw
the amendment.</div> <a name="06062755000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision dates back to the Companies Act 1980. Although it seems to
restrict eligibility for the position of company secretary of a plc,
there is little restriction on who may be appointed as long as that
person appears to the directors to have the requisite knowledge and
experience. The criterion is what the directors think. Nevertheless, we
think it useful for directors to have a list of bodies whose members
are considered capable of discharging the functions of a plc
secretary.</div><a name="06062755000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000662"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for
that explanation. I am reassured by his comments that the current
regime concerning the Secretary of State&#146;s involvement in any
challenge whether a plc has an appropriate company secretary or not is
being maintained, that the list prescribed in clause 256(3) is not
intended to be prescriptive in relation to clause 256(2)(d) and that
directors&#146; flexibility to determine whether someone is
appropriate to fulfil the role of company secretary will therefore be
maintained as it is under the Companies Act 1985. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000665"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Amendment No.193 deals with clause 258
regarding the duty to keep a register of secretaries, which is the
internal requirement on a company. It is a flexibility amendment that
follows the line of argument in the previous debate on statutory
recognition of company secretaries and private companies.</div>
<a name="06062755000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 197, 202 and
203 make consequential amendments to clauses 260 to 262 to reflect that
change. Therefore, in light of the previous debate, I do not intend to
spend any further time on
explanation.</div><a name="06062755000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 194 raises the matter of similar flexibility in clause 259. It
concerns the duty to notify the register of companies on changes to the
secretary and the appointment of a new secretary. As currently drafted,
that requirement is limited to public companies.</div>
<a name="06062755000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the amendment, that
requirement would be extended to companies that have a secretary. It
would make it clear to the outside world whether a private company has
a secretary or not and who the office holders of the company are. It
would also seek to address the point that I highlighted earlier about
existing secretaries of private limited companies who may wish to come
off the record, providing a mechanism to enable them to do so. That is
an important point.</div>
<a name="06062755000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">The enabling of the
registration of private companies is endorsed by ICSA, the CBI, the
Institute of Directors, the Association of Corporate Treasurers and the
Law Society. It would afford protections for existing and new
secretaries from authority and potential liability. It would involve
the simple completion of a form with the registrar and would clarify
who the office holders of the company are.</div>
<a name="06062755000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">I maintain that it would be
important for transparency to appoint a secretary to a private company.
It would assist good corporate governance in terms of the
interrelationship between a private company and the external parties
with whom it
dealt.</div><a name="06062755000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000666"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The Committee has already agreed to our
proposals on authorised signatories. That means that the public record
will include the particulars of those authorised to sign for any
company&#151;essential third parties&#151;whether public or
private.</div> <a name="06062755000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
1985 Act, the company secretary may authenticate company documents and
be a co-signatory for the execution of documents. Under 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 285</div>the Bill, under amendments already agreed by the Committee, a company
secretary, if an individual, will continue to be able to perform the
external role, providing that their particulars are on the public
record.</div> <a name="06062755000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although many
public companies appoint individuals as their secretaries, some will
want secretaries to have that authority, some will not. It is up to
them; we have discussed that. If the company does not want its
secretary to have the authority, there is no reason why the
secretary&#146;s particulars should be publicly available. The Bill
ensures that entries in the public record are required only if the
information is truly
needed.</div><a name="06062755000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, under
the amendments, the details of all private company secretaries would
have to be put on the public record, whether or not the secretary was
able to authenticate documents for the company and to sign for the
execution of documents. Such a requirement would be another unnecessary
burden on private companies. It would have serious practical
implications in the real world. It would be inevitable that many
private companies that had notified the appointment of a secretary
would neglect their statutory duty to notify that the person had ceased
to be secretary.</div> <a name="06062755000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would be particularly likely if the secretary was not replaced by
another and if the appointment had not ended amicably. That would mean
that the public record would be seriously defective. Furthermore, entry
on the register would have legal consequences as such errors would have
consequences that might put some people in the company at risk. It is
not right to expose companies to that risk. Therefore, I hope that the
hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendments and that we
will be able to move forward.</div>
<a name="06062755000379"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000667"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have listened to what the Solicitor-General
has said. Earlier in this sitting, we debated the matter of company
secretaries in great detail. However, I do not accept that the
amendment would impose an additional regulatory burden. The appointment
of a company secretary in a limited liability company must be notified
now. Nor do I accept that the amendments would add to confusion. They
would provide a formal mechanism to allow company secretaries to come
off the record, and I do not see how that would add to confusion.
Having the secretaries of limited liability companies on a public
register is an important issue, and we may well want to return to it
later.</div><a name="06062755000380"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000668"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000669"></a>James

prescribed.&#148;</div><a name="06062755000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">How will
that fee be prescribed? What regulation will there be in that respect?
How will we ensure that the fee is not abused in some way to deny

<a name="06062755000386"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000671"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Clearly, any fee would have to be
reasonable, and we will look at provisions on how we determine that.
The objective is to ensure that persons can gain access to information,
and the registrar can prescribe various requirements. Clause 721
states:</div><a name="06062755000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Registrar may impose requirements as to the form,
authentication&#148;</div><a name="06062755000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">and the
various ways in which the various forms are to be issued. The aim is
that the registrar will have rules that set out the prescribed fee, so
there will be some element of regulation to prevent someone from
deciding that the fee will be so large as to prevent
access.</div>
<a name="06062755000388"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000672"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am interested by the comment that the
registrar will prescribe the fee, because that might be slightly

the record itself, but I should have imagined that the Secretary of
State would regulate the fee, if that was the intention. However, I
will guided by the Solicitor-General on

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000673"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000675"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 196, in clause 259, page 120, line 7, after
&#145;consent', insert
&#145;signed'.</div><a name="06062755000394"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000676"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The amendment deals with clause 259, which
relates to the duty to notify the registrar of changes to company
secretary&#146;s details.</div>
<a name="06062755000395"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000677"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It may save the hon. Gentleman some
time if he looks at clause 721, which is entitled
&#147;Registrar&#146;s requirements&#148;. It
provides:</div><a name="06062755000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
registrar may impose requirements as to the form, authentication and
manner of delivery of documents&#148;,</div>
<a name="06062755000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">so neither amendment is
needed.</div><a name="06062755000397"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000678"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for that clarification because
I was trying to get at how notification would be given. Obviously, it
is currently done on form 288. Previous comments about resolutions to
change the company name seem to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 287</div>suggest that more informal requirements might be adopted on whether a
specific form would be required. I take it from the
Solicitor-General&#146;s comments that that may become clearer in
regulations set out by the registrar in terms of the form in which such
matters are set out. The Solicitor-General may wish to make further
clarification points in that
regard.</div><a name="06062755000398"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000679"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right in that the
registrar will impose any requirements and it will be for the registrar
to determine how that can be done most efficiently and effectively.
That is probably a better approach than trying to impose everything by
detailed regulation
here.</div><a name="06062755000399"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000680"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Obviously, the concern behind all this is to
ensure that when we talk about authentication we are mindful of the
issues that we debated last week and the ways in which companies can be
hijacked by people purporting to have authority and filing registration
forms and so on. That is of concern to me and other Opposition Members,
and I am sure that the Government are concerned about what might be
reflected in terms of detailed consideration of the relevant proposals.
That is the context in which the amendments were tabled: to ensure that
hijacking and fraud were appropriately and adequately dealt with. I
hope that the Government will continue to reflect on the matter so that
we have a robust system that does not expose companies to the risk of
being hijacked by third parties with malicious intentions, or limits
that risk as much as
possible.</div><a name="06062755000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">In light of
the Solicitor-General&#146;s comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="06062755000401"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000681"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have one further point for clarification.
Obviously, the clause deals with notification of changes in relation to
public company secretaries. Could the Solicitor-General clarify what
might happen at Companies House if a private company sought to notify
the registrar of a change or appointment of a company secretary? How
would Companies House and the registrar of companies treat that? Is it
likely that they would simply reject it, or would they reflect it on
the
register?</div><a name="06062755000404"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000682"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Companies House would not be involved.
It would essentially be for the private company to decide whether it
wished to take a view and, therefore, it would be rejected. That is
essentially the position. It will be a matter for the
company.</div><a name="06062755000405"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062755000683"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for that response, but I can
envisage that if the existing regime is maintained private companies
would still seek to notify the registrar of companies as they have done
historically in relation to appointments and changes. The purpose of my
question was to allude to the fact that that is recognised and to ask
how the registrar would respond and whether a formal notification would
simply be rejected and sent back to the private limited company. In
many ways, that goes back to my point about putting things on the
record and providing choice. I hear what the Solicitor-General said
about rejection on the basis of the current
arrangements.</div><a name="06062755000406"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
