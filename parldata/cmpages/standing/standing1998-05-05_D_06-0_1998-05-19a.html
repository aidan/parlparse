<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 124, in page 10, line 2, leave out `(1) or'.
<P>
I begin by welcoming you, Mr. Jones, to this exciting and action-packed Committee. I look forward to you presiding over the deliberations with your usual tact, charm and discretion.
<P>
Government amendment No. 124 is similar to the amendment already made by the Committee to clause 10. Clause 13(1) allows individuals, by giving a written notice, to require controllers not to take certain decisions about them by fully automated means. The Committee has to some extent discussed the decisions affected; they relate mainly to credit scoring and to individuals' ability to secure credit especially from retail organisations based on the automated processing of data about them.
<P>
Subsection (3) requires controllers to respond in writing within 21 days. The amendment would remove that requirement. The Committee has agreed to the removal of a similar requirement from clause 10. The Government believe that it also makes sense to remove the requirement in clause 13. On reflection, we are persuaded that the notice serves little purpose. It does nothing more than confirm an intention to obey the law. There is, of course, no option about that, and the notice adds nothing else by way of informing the data subject.
<P>
The provision in question is effectively a statutory requirement to acknowledge correspondence. The Government believe that such acknowledgement should not be a statutory requirement, and that it is best left to good practice.
<P>
<B>Mr John Greenway (Ryedale):</B> I reiterate the welcome given to you, Mr. Jones, by the Minister. The sitting will be action packed. The trick is to keep one page ahead of everybody else then one has a reasonable chance of understanding the Bill.
<P>
The Opposition welcome the amendment. It will remove a requirement that has little value, as the Minister said. That is welcome, and it reflects the amendment agreed to in clause 10. Remarks about the clause are best left until later.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 10, leave out lines 5 to 23.
<P>
When I studied the Bill, I began to lose patience several times. I should say at the outset that amendment No. 55 is a probing amendment. It reflects the difficulty that I had in getting my mind round the clause. In preparing for this morning's sitting, I made some progress in understanding it. In general terms, the clause seeks to restrict the making of decisions solely by automatic means, when such decisions affect people. It also seeks, however, to provide a partial exemption, as does the directive. The mechanism is contained in subsections
(4), (5), (6) and (7).
<P>
There are, however, justifiable grounds for questions. Subsection (5)(a) and (b) states that an exempt decision means any decision in which the conditions of subsections (6) and (7) are met or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"which is made in such other circumstances as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State by order".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That order-making power is subject to affirmative resolution under clause 63, but we need some clarification from the Minister that is one of the advantages of Committee proceedings on a Bill on why the Government think that such circumstances will arise and what they will be.
<P>
Subsections (6) and (7) say that it is all right for a decision about whether to enter into a contract to be taken "by automatic means" provided that the data subject's request is granted or that steps are taken to allow him to make representations about his legitimate interests. It is, however, not clear what the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the effect of the decision is to grant a request of the data subject"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
means. Committee members will have received representations on the issue, and I have had a letter from the Finance and Leasing Association, whose interests I shall pray in aid later; indeed, we have already debated them. The association has expressed concern it obviously did not recognise that this is a probing amendment about the removal of the exemption for decisions by automated processing. It believes that that would mean that every application for credit, for example, would have to be viewed by a person, not just done by automatic means.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm, therefore, whether I have understood the provisions correctly? As I see it, the name of someone who applied for credit could be fed into the computer system. If nothing came up, the computer would say that, as far as the records were concerned, Mr. Greenway was good for the required credit. An automatic decision would then be taken and I would get the credit which would be unusual. That would be an exempt decision because we had entered into a contract, my request was granted, and the credit was provided. I have no difficulty with that.
<P>
The problem arises, however, when the automatic decision goes the other way and the credit is not granted. Will the Minister confirm whether the words in subsection (7)(a) mean that, because the credit is not given and the contract is not entered into, the request is not granted? If the decision is negative, the provisions are, therefore, not satisfied. That means that one of two things must then happen. Either steps must be taken to allow the person who has been refused the credit by an automatic decision to make representations or, under clause 13(2), the data controller must notify the individual that a decision has been taken by automatic means because the terms of the exemption do not apply. That seems rather messy.
<P>
The directive is not entirely clear on the matter either. It states that the request lodged by the data subject has been satisfied, or that there are suitable measures to safeguard his legitimate interests. The meaning of "satisfied" seems to be open to doubt. The words, "the request has been satisfied" could logically mean that
the request has been dealt with, not necessarily that the request has been met with a positive decision.
<P>
I hope that the Minister understands that we do not seek to be difficult. However, this measure will affect hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of decisions taken within the credit industry, and it is important that everyone involved understands precisely what it means.
<P>
Government amendment No. 124 improves matters a little. If a data subject who has had his request for credit refused contacts the data controller to find out why, as he is entitled to under clause 13, at least the data controller does not have to reply within 21 days specifying the steps that he is going to take to deal wit the issue. Although I welcome that, doubts remain. Had we been able to arrive at a better formulation than that of the Bill, we would have used those words in our amendment instead of tabling a more general probing amendment.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm whether a contract under subsection (6) would include a contract of employment? It may be easier if I postpone the question of employment issues until a stand part debate, as there are separate matters to be discussed in that context.
<P>
I should like to summarise the two questions that we are putting to the Minister. First, will he clarify what are the "other circumstances" to which subsection (5)(b) refers? That phrase potentially covers a wide area. Secondly, will he confirm that the Government's understanding of the directive is that, if a request is not satisfied that is, if it is not "met" the decision is not then exempt? If that is so, the data subject will be entitled either to make representations to the data controller or, crucially, to expect notification from the data controller that the decision not to grant his request was taken on a solely automatic basis. Alternatively, is the interpretation of the directive that the request is satisfied simply by being dealt with, and that a negative decision would fall within the subsection's definition of the exemption? It is important that we understand the intention: after that, we can consider other aspects of the clause.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</b> I had thought that I understood clause 13 until I listened to the hon. Member for Ryedale </B>(Mr. Greenway). However, I shall do my best to answer his questions and explain how the clause works.
<P>
Clause 13 is a provision that is new to UK data protection law. It is modelled on article 15 of the directive, and I accept that neither is entirely straightforward. The clause is concerned with decisions made by automated means, which significantly affect individuals and which evaluate matters about them, such as their work performance, credit worthiness, reliability of conduct.
<P>
Subsection (1) gives individuals the right to write to data controllers requiring them not to take such decision by automated means. People with principled objections to machines deciding such questions can object, up front and for the specified reasons.
<P>
Subsection (2) deals with the situation where controllers have received no such notices and have taken decisions of the kind covered by the clause that is, by automated means. It requires controllers to write to the individuals concerned giving them the opportunity to write seeking a review of the decision. In effect, people objecting to a decision can challenge it.
<P>
Subsection (3) requires controllers to respond in writing to written notices from individuals made under subsections (1) or (2).
<P>
I now come to the provisions that the amendment would affect.
<P>
Subsections (4) to (7) provide exemptions from the entitlements provided in subsections (1) and (2). The exemptions are of two broad kinds. the first relates to decisions taken, and I use the term loosely in the context of a contract between the data controller and the data subject. The second is where the decision is authorised or required by statute. Both conditions are found in subsection (6).
<P>
However, those conditions are not sufficient in themselves to justify the exemption. they must be accompanied by one or other of the conditions mentioned in subsection (7). The first of those is, in essence, that the decision in question goes in favour of the data subject that for example, people seeking credit get the loan that they have asked for. The alternative condition is that, if the decision does not go in the data subject's favour, steps have been taken to provide safeguards for his or her interests.
<P>
I hope that that answers the general problem raised by the hon. Member for Ryedale, but I shall try to be more specific about the second condition, which seems to be the essence of the matter.
<P>
The wording used in the directive specifies that the data subject's request "has been satisfied". That is intended to apply when the data subject's request has been granted in other words, that he or she has been given the loan or whatever it was that was wanted.
<P>
However, if the loan was not granted as a result of automatic processing, the data subject has the opportunity to make representations: for example, he or she may seek a review of the decision by non-automatic means. The general principle running through the directive was that, although automatic processing should be allowed, a decision to turn down a data subject's request for a loan, for example, should be reviewable by non-automatic means. It could properly, be argued that the directive's underlying principle was to allow and encourage automatic processing, so long as it was in favour of the data subject; where it turned out to be against or potentially against the data subject's interests, the means should be available to him or her to have that decision reviewed by human agency.
<P>
I do not know how much detail Committee members want me to go into on the specific amendments. I am sure that the hon. Member for Ryedale recognises that if we accepted them, they would wholly undermine the scheme that I have just set out. I can deal with them in detail if he wants, but I took them to be probing amendments that would allow him to ask various questions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Exactly so. I followed entirely what the Minister said. He confirmed one of the three concerns that I raised that the directive's intention, which was not wholly clear, was that "satisfaction" means that the request is granted, not merely that the procedure has been dealt with. That is helpful.
<P>
There are still two matters that I want the Minister to address. First, what are the "other circumstances" which may be prescribed? Secondly and more importantly subsection (7)(b) says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"steps have been taken to safeguard the legitimate interests of the data subject (for example, by allowing him to make representations)."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would apply if the data controller claimed that the decision regarding the data subject came under the exempt category. Otherwise, the exemption is not satisfied. Either credit is granted and therefore the data subject is satisfied, or credit is denied and the individual is able to make representations.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I require interventions to be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I thought that I had answered that question, but I apologise to the hon. Member for Ryedale if I had not. The basic proposition remains. If the automated processing allowed the data subject what he or she wanted a loan, say presumably there is no further debate. If it did not, the principle underlying the directive, which the Government have tried to carry through into the Bill, is that the data subject should have the opportunity to say, "Hang on, I don't like the decision. It appears to have been taken by automatic means. I want a human being to review it." The hon. Member for Ryedale is right to concentrate on the major question of what should happen in the event of someone being turned down, but I want to deal with the other two points.
<P>
The Government are aware that automatic processing is on the increase. As equipment becomes more sophisticated and the amount of data that is collected becomes more extensive, more and more automatic processing will take place. The Government are anxious that, in the light of that increase, we should not unduly limit the circumstances in which it can occur. We want to develop flexible rules that will take account of changes and improvements in technology and an extension of automatic processing into other areas. Provided that that is permitted by the directive, such flexibility is allowed for, and it is important that it is preserved in our domestic legislation.
<P>
I am not in a position today to be able to forecast precisely what orders will have to be made, because we simply do not know where the technology will lead. This measure is designed to preserve that flexibility, so that we do not require a further Act of Parliament to delineate such circumstances.
<P>
The word "contract" in subsection (6) includes a contract of employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister. I have just one other point to make. I apologise for the length of my intervention, Mr. Jones.
<P>
All that the Minister explained is now clear. My point is that the provision that allows the individual to make representations applies only if the data controlled argues that the decision might have been exempt. If he does not argue that and he is not required to when a decision significantly affects an individual and no notice under subsection (1) has effect, the alternative under subsection (2) is for him to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as soon as reasonably practicable notify the individual that the decision was taken"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
by automatic means. In other words, the data controller is offered a choice of two ways in which to argue the matter. An individual could fail to get a job because his CV was scanned automatically and his job application was turned down. In such circumstances, under subsection (2), the individual data subject would not be given notice as to whether he wants the decision to be made by automatic means. A decision would have been taken by automatic means. As I read it, subsection (2) requires the data controller to notify the individual that the decision was taken on that basis.
<P>
The data controller therefore has a choice. He can write to the individual stating either that a decision taken by automatic means is exempt and that he is allowing the individual to make representations, or that the decision was taken by automatic means.
<P>
It is not entirely clear what a data controller should do. If I have got that wrong, I apologise to the Committee. It seems, however, that the deletion of subsections (4), (5), (6) and (7), as proposed by the amendment, would remove doubt about what would have to happen. In each case, the controller would have to write to the individual and inform him that every decision was taken by automatic means. That would apply in all circumstances. It would apply if the individual got the job, or, as was discussed earlier, if he got the credit. The exemption must, therefore, make sense. That is why the Opposition will not press the amendment. The fact remains, however, that the data controller has the choice about which I have spoken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor (Esher and Walton):</B> I rise to check on which side of the argument my bewilderment lies. My hon. Friend's remarks triggered in my mind a document from the Finance and Leasing Association. As I said in an earlier intervention, the finance and leasing industry represents about £93 billion of business. The credit industry is concerned about whether every application for credit would have to be viewed by a person. I think that the Minister clarified that matter earlier. I am not sure, however, who will subjectively make the judgment one way or the other. I want to check that point. The presence of such a human override in the finance and leasing industry would mean a clear diminution of service levels and of speed of service delivery, which would be difficult and dangerous to the competitiveness of this important British industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) for his observations. He dealt with the point made in passing by the hon. Member for Ryedale.
<P>
It is important that automatic processing is allowed. It is equally important that, in allowing it, we do not enormously increase the burdens on business. Generally, a person for whom a loan application has been automatically approved will not be aware of it, and will be happy with it. The obvious illustration is of a person going into a retail store and asking for credit a routine occurrence these days. No one is going to challenge a decision to give credit, because that is what the person wants, yet it is almost certain that that decision will be taken automatically.
<P>
The directive was devised to tackle the problem that arises when a person is dissatisfied with an automatic processing decision. It provides that that person should be able to challenge such a decision and to require human intervention to put it crudely in the review of the decision.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that that answer deals with both the questions raised. The danger in eliminating subsections (4) to (7) would be that we would end up placing an enormous bureaucratic burden on business. The hon. Member for Ryedale appears to have shifted his ground subtly: he now seems to want the Committee to take seriously what he introduced as a probing amendment. I accept that probing amendments are important in challenging the Government to justify the clause, but the amendment cannot be taken as seriously as he would appear now to want.
<P>
I shall reconsider the hon. Gentleman's observations about what is and what is not exempt. It is important that he should be content with the answer that I give and I shall write to him if a difficulty remains that I have not understood properly or that he has not explained sufficiently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That would be helpful. The intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton emphasised that business needs certainty. I think that the clause is unclear about whether people should have the opportunity to make representations when an application for credit, for example, is refused by a data controller on the basis of the exemptions, or when the data controller ignores the exempt decision procedure altogether. In the latter circumstances, under subsection (2), the data controller might simply write to the data subject, saying, "We have made a decision about your credit. You have not got it, and the decision was made entirely by automatic means."
<P>
I hope that my reservations are clear. I am not especially worried about the clause, but business is. That is why we are debating the matter.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's response, and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Jones, for allowing me to make a few comments in this stand part debate. I appreciate that we have debated the clause for half an hour already, but I asked the Minister earlier to confirm that the contract mentioned in the exempt decision process includes employment.
<P>
What will be the effect of that in the process of job selection, where automated processes are increasingly used in candidate aptitude procedures? Earlier this month, an article in The Times stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Psychometric testing is used by consultants to ensure that an applicant will fit with a company's culture"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If an aptitude test shows that a person who wants to enter the candidate list for one of the parties in next year's European elections is not satisfactory, will that person be allowed to make representations or to say that he or she disagrees with the basis of the test? I suspect that the response in the example that I have given would be, "Tough luck," but they is a serious point at stake.
<P>
The Minister was right when he talked about the increasing use of technology. One can envisage CVs being scanned and aptitude tests increasingly being done using technology. I am not sure whether there is an alternative procedure to that in the Bill. As we discussed, the clause would give effect to article 15, and the difficulty is in paragraph 2(a). It is important to place such matters on the record.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Sir B. Mawhinney) tells me that there is a thing called the Myers Briggs test, which is an aptitude test in which someone gives answers. Those are scanned and if they go the right way, he is in; if they go the wrong way, he is out. The provisions will make matters extremely difficult.
<P>
The headline on the recruitment page of the 19 March edition of People Management reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Computer selection could fall foul of data protection".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Minister has not seen that, I will happily copy it for him; I got it from the Library. Ministers and the House need to have an eye to such matters, which demonstrate the provisions' far-reaching effects.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale is right to say that the provisions have far-reaching effects and to note the potential difficulties. It is, however, also important that the Committee recognises that we are dealing with rapidly changing technology that brings business and individuals real benefits. Earlier, I used the example of someone going into a retail shop and applying for and being granted credit in a matter of minutes. That is a tremendous benefit for the retail trade and the individual. It can be achieved only by using automatic processing.
<P>
Where the decision is entirely positive, no further issues arise. A concern remains, however, about people being turned down automatically. That was the underlying concern when the directive was drafted, and it remains the Government's concern, which we have set out in the marginal note to clause 13, which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Rights in relation to automated decision-taking".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Concerns remain about someone being turned down automatically for a contract of employment or an application for credit. In those circumstances, it is important that we provide an opportunity for representations to be made and for a further review of the decision through human intervention.
<P>
Clause 13 would balance emerging technology against the rights of the individual. I hope that it remains part of the Bill so that we can preserve that appropriate balance and give effect to the terms of the directive.
<P>
Clause 13, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move, That clause 13 be transferred to end of line 25 on page 8.
<P>
The amendment paper contains a curious formulation to move the clause; more accurately, it is a motion to reposition it. Given the Bill's structure, it would be better for the clause to come after clause 10, not clause 12.
<P>
Clause 13 imposes restrictions on certain automated decision making. As introduced, it was expressed as a prohibition of such decision making, subject to certain exemptions. It was a set of general rules that applied to a particular kind of processing. At that time, it fitted well enough after clause 12. Members of the Committee will be aware, however, that it was substantially amended in another place. It is now drafted in terms of individual rights, exercisable by notice, and of remedies, after the model of clauses 9 and 10.
<P>
The other substantive rights created by the Bill are dealt with in clauses 7 to 10. Clauses 11 and 12 deal with remediable rights. As it stands, therefore, clause 13 is somewhat out of sequence. The Government believe that its natural place is with the other provisions dealing with rights. If the motion is agreed, the clause will be moved accordingly.
<P>
The motion involves nothing more than changing the clause's position there are no proposed changes of substance. I hope that the Committee will agree to this purely technical improvement.
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`wherever in the world that may be'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have already considered this mater under clause 5, which deals with jurisdiction. We discovered that clause 5(2) (d) means that someone can be treated as being established in the United Kingdom if he maintains
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"an office, branch or agency through which he carries on any activity".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment to clause 15 would add to the end of line 35, which deals with the address of a registered company, the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"wherever in the world that may be".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We gave tabled it to ask how else one could otherwise enforce the provisions of clause 5.
<P>
It is a difficult matter. The Government have rightly concluded that people should not escape the Bill's provisions by processing elsewhere. However, data subjects wanting to gain access need to know where they should approach the controller who is doing the processing. We are making a simple point of jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I suppose that I should congratulate the hon. Member for Ryedale on keeping his amendment on the planet. Unfortunately, I must explain why the Government cannot accept it.
<P>
Clause 15(3) provides that, for the purposes of the register and court hearings and appeals on data protection matters, the address of a registered company shall be treated as being that of its registered office. I emphasise that the provision applies only to registered companies. By virtue of clause 64, a registered company is one registered under UK company law. The meaning of the words "registered office" in clause 15 must be considered in that context. Registration of a company within the terms of UK company law requires that it has a registered office in the United Kingdom. It is the address of that office to which the provisions refer. It cannot be anywhere in the world; it must be in the United Kingdom. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that his amendment is inappropriate and withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Clause 16</center></H4>
<H4><center>Prohibition on processing without registration</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Clause 16 is extremely important. We have not sought to amend it, but would like some clarifications.
<P>
The requirement to register was difficult to enforce under the 1984 Act. Under clause 16, anyone who processes data is required to register with the Data Protection Commissioner. We should bear in mind that data processing has a broad meaning that can encompass merely the storing of information in a structured arrangement.
<P>
Will the Minister explain the significance of subsection (3)? It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If it appears to the Secretary of State that processing of a particular description is unlikely to prejudice the rights and freedoms of data subjects, notification regulations can provide that, in such cases as may be prescribed, subsection (1) is not to apply".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In such circumstances a person would, presumably, not be required to register. That creates a potentially substantial exemption, and it would be helpful to know who might be included under it. Subsection (4) is straightforward.
I accept that someone who is maintaining a public register would not be covered.
<P>
The Committee should explore the full extent of these provisions. Clause 16 is the engine of the Bill in legal terms. The potentially wide exemption that is implied by subsection (3) requires clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale is right to place emphasis on clause 16.
<P>
The clause is largely an enabling provision, in that it makes other parts of the Bill work. It puts a prohibition on processing unless there is an entry in respect of the processing in the register held by the commissioner. By virtue of clause 20(1), processing in contravention of the prohibition is in effect. This is a technical, enabling mechanism to ensure that the Bill operates effectively.
<P>
Subsections (2) to (4), as the hon. Gentleman correctly pointed out, provide exemptions from the prohibition in subsection (1). They cover the processing of manual records, other than those that are subject to preliminary assessment under clause 21, processing that is unlikely to prejudice the rights and freedoms of data subjects and that is to be specified in notification regulations, and processing that is intended solely to maintain a public register. The Government are currently working on the notification regulations in consultation with the Data Protection Registrar.
<P>
It is too early to say what categories of processing will be exempted. However, the White Paper that sets out the Bill's proposals suggested that exemptions might include payroll, personnel and work planning administration; purchase and sales administration; advertising, marketing and public relations; and general administration. We are talking about the routine information that business compiles which it would be sensible to exempt. If we do not do so, the burdens on business will be ridiculously onerous.
<P>
The categories were based on work that the Data Protection Registrar did at the time. We shall need to review further developments when we decide which categories of processing to exempt. Technology will change, and increased processing wil benefit business and, therefore, individuals. It is, therefore, important that the Bill is sufficiently flexible to allow for technological developments. That is consistent with my earlier remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is very helpful and deals with the point that I made.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 16 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 17</center></H4>
<H4><center>Notification by data controllers</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 12, line 10, leave out "may" and insert "shall".
<P>
Those of us who have served on Standing Committees for a long time know that whenever we see "may" in a Bill, we table an amendment to insert "shall". We then try to find an argument to explain why that seemed a good idea when we tabled the amendment. I hope, however, that the Minister will dismiss all such thoughts from his mind in this case.
<P>
Given our debate on clause 16, clause 17 creates some confusion. As the Minister said, the Bill requires people to register to process data that will not be exempt under any of the other categories. It also states that it is an offence to process data without having made an entry in the register with the Data Protection Commissioner.
<P>
Having got that through my mind, I was surprised to find that clause 17 appears to give data controllers a choice. It is not simply that they may require an entry, but that they may wish to be included in the register. Given that the rest of the clause deals with the way in which the Data Protection Commissioner is given notification and that it is an offence not to register, it would be better to make matters clearer, although my amendment might not do that. It should be clear that there is a requirement for people to give notification, and I felt that it would be helpful to the Committee to have a debate to emphasise that. Using the words "may" and "wishes" suggests that people have a choice, but my reading of the clause is that they do not. The only choice concerns whether the Bill's provisions catch their processing.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am sure that all members of the Committee are profoundly grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale for his further advice on tabling Opposition amendments he has clearly refined his technique.
I suspected from our previous sittings that his was merely a scatter-gun technique; he suggested on one occasion that if he tabled enough amendments, one of them might eventually hit the mark. We now see from chapter 2 of his guide to tabling Opposition amendments that more sophistication is at work than we might have suspected.
<P>
Clause 17(1) sets out the key step that data controllers must take if they wish to be included on the Data Protection Commissioner's register. The provision is intended to cater for two broad groups of controllers. The first group comprises those who are obliged to have a register entry as a precondition of processing personal data, as identified in clause 16. The second group consists of those who are exempted from the requirement to have a register entry because clause 16(1) does not apply. It also includes those who are specifically exempted from it by notification regulations under clause 16(3) but who nevertheless choose to register as the best way of meeting their obligations to give appropriate publicity to their processing of personal data. The provision can therefore be said to deal with both the pressed man and the volunteer.
<P>
The Bill provides that having a register entry is not a free-standing duty but simply a prerequisite, in some cases, for the processing of data. If a register entry is desired, to commence processing or for any other reason, it can be achieved through notification, which is also not a free-standing duty. Clause 17 therefore exists for those who want it, as it were, and that is why it is expressed in permissive rather than mandatory language.
<P>
The Government recognise that the Bill would probably work if the word "may" were to be replaced by "shall". Indeed, there is some attraction in the amendment. It might help clarify that a controller who wants to go on the register must make a proper notification to the commissioner in the form required by the rest of the clause. The format of notification will be mandatory for those who wish to proceed in that way.
<P>
The Government are therefore pleased to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This has been a constructive Committee: not for the first time, an amendment that we have tabled has been accepted. Some of our proposals may seem less serious than others, but our purpose has always been to ensure that the Bill is as clear and certain as possible.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's response, and for his helpful confirmation that some people must be on the register while other may choose, for different reasons, to be on it.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, that the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> I do not want to prevent the clause from being agreed to, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale, with his pertinent amendments, increasingly is dictating the passage of the Bill through Committee. However, I have a genuine question.
<P>
I noticed in a communication from the Data Protection Registrar, that she is worried that collective notification is not permitted under clause 17(4)(a) and (b). She asked whether it might
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"be helpful to provide for notification by an additional method of joint notification by means of specific schemes or otherwise in the notification regulations",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and she suggested that schools in a certain area might benefit from that.
<P>
That seems a good point, and I hope that the Minister will offer some clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Esher and Walton. We are satisfied that the problem can be dealt with in the proposed regulations for notification, and we shall probably discuss some of the points he raises in our debates on clause 18. We are aware of the Data Protection Registrar's concerns, and we shall take them into account when we draft the regulations. I am sure that the Committee will want to discuss aspects of that when we come to clause 18.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 17, as amended, order to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>Register of notification</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 125, in page 12, line 39, after `of' insert `(a)'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 126 and amendment No. 218, in page 12, line 41, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) In the case of a maintained school, a single entry in the register may be taken as notification in respect of both a representative of the governing body and of the head teacher of the school.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Clause 18 sets out the basic requirements relating to the register that the commissioner will maintain. Subsection (2) provides that the register should contain the details notified by the data controller in line with clauses 15 and 17, together with any necessary updating amendments. That is fine as far as it goes, but in developing the data protection scheme the Government realised that it will sometimes be appropriate to include further material in the register entry. Government amendment Nos. 125 and 126 allow for that.
<P>
If I may, Mr. Jones, I shall try to give some examples. It may be relevant or necessary to include in a register entry information about the position of, for example, partnerships or other joint data controllers. It would be necessary in such circumstances to inform the data subject that parties other than the specific person say a single partner who is entered on the register may well be processing his data. The amendments are designed to provide more information to the data subject and therefore greater protection of his or her interests.
<P>
It is important, however, that the measure should not serve as a means of including all kinds of extraneous material on the register. For reasons of transparency, it is also important that any further material should be added to the register in a consistent way. Under the subsection as amended, the notification regulations would have to authorise or require the commissioner to include particular types of material. He or she would have no discretion beyond that. The regulations would have to be laid before Parliament, so hon. Members would have an opportunity, if they wished, to debate a proposal to provide for additional material.
<P>
The amendments would thus allow limited, common-sense additions to notification entries. I would expect the power to include such matters in regulations to be used sparingly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White  </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): The hon. Member for Esher and Walton almost stole the thunder of my amendment when we debated the previous clause. He raised a very important issue.
<P>
I have said several times that my concern about the Bill stems from my experiences of implementing the 1984 Act. Under that Act, schools had to register separately the governing body and the head teacher. That caused a bureaucratic nightmare for some schools. Governors have a hard enough task as it is, without the addition of that requirement.
<P>
I wish that I could claim the credit for amendment
No. 218, but it has a long history of being tabled to various Bills by Labour Members. Most recently, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris), now the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, tabled the amendment to the Bill that became the Education Act 1996, but the Minister at the time said that the Data Protection Bill would be the most appropriate legislation to which to table the amendment.
<P>
I hope that the Government take on board the important point about school bureaucracy, and that that is reflected in the notification regulations. It is critical to take into account the experiences of the 1984 Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for tabling the amendment and for the way in which he spoke to it. I do not want to increase or maintain burdens on school governors. I am married to a school governor and I occasionally not more than once a day, anyway receive representations about this issue. The amendment would deal with a situation that has been a long-standing cause of concern under current data protection legislation.
<P>
I should explain the background. Under the basic scheme of the Bill, each person or organisation determining the purpose and manner of processing must be treated as a separate data controller, responsible for applying the provisions of the regime to a set of data.
<P>
In the case of schools, under present law governors and the head teacher must be treated as separate controllers. Although they use pupil and staff information, they do so in order to carry out distinct, albeit related, functions. The information may or may not be held on the same database, but they are separate controllers with distinct purposes. The data that they control may overlap, but it will also have differences.
<P>
We recognise that the present scheme places an additional burden on schools of preparing separate notifications and paying separate registration fees, and that there is a case for arguing that this brings little additional benefit to the data subjects concerned.
<P>
We intend to address the matter through the notification regulations. As they have not yet been prepared in detail, it is too soon to say precisely how it will be tackled. One option would be to provide in the regulations under clause 16(3) that one of the two types of controller does not have to notify. We would need to consider the merits by reference to the test in clause 16(3) of prejudice to rights and freedoms.
<P>
Another option would be to enable individual data controllers to channel their notifications through a single source, with a corresponding fee reduction for the other party. Meanwhile, however, given that they are separate controllers, it is necessary to guard against side stepping any of the main tests in the Bill with a direct provision along the lines of amendment No. 218. We must ensure that the protections established by the Bill are still available to data subjects. The merits should determine the case, as with other controllers.
<P>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) for raising the matter. I hope that he will not press his amendment, given my undertaking that the matter will be addressed in the regulations, subject to the work that the Government will take forward in due course.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am sure that the Minister is right, but his remarks emphasised that much of the implementation of the Bill is dependent on secondary legislation, and regulations. Four or five weeks from now, the Bill may find its way on to the statute book. Will the Minister indicate the time frame that he has in mind in respect of the notification regulations? It should be borne in mind that if these points are not pressed in Committee, there will be no opportunity after Report to make any major change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Increasingly, a great deal of modern legislation has to be carried through in practice in the form of regulations. I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will accept that there is a particular justification for the regulations in respect of the matters with which the Bill deals. The legislation has to be flexible to deal with rapid technological change. The directive anticipated that flexibility, and the Government are trying to carry it through. Much as I welcome the prospect of regularly meeting the hon. Member for Ryedale and his colleagues to amend primary data protection legislation, I am sure that I speak at least for Labour Members when I say that hon. Members would be reluctant to amend primary legislation too often. Inevitably, a great deal of flexibility must be built into the regulations that the Government are drafting.
<P>
I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a specific time frame, save to say that we are working towards implementing the legislation, and the consequential regulations, during the autumn. I hope that he will accept that that time scale is reasonable. It will allow those who are responsible for drafting the regulations to consult those who will be affected. Regulations generally have a much greater practical impact on the relevant sectors of the business community, and it is therefore important that they are aware of the developments that are taking place.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

Amendment made: No. 126, in page 12, line 41, at end insert
<P>

<P>
(b) such other information as the Commissioner may be authorised or required by notification regulations to include in the register". [Mr. Hoon.]{**/w3**}
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East wish to move amendment No. 218?
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> No, Mr. Jones. I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for his response, and in the light of the assurances that he has given I do not wish to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 13, line 3, leave out "twelve" and insert "thirty six".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 60, in page 13, line 4, leave out from "regulations" to end of line 5.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Subsection (4) is of considerable importance to the commercial world. It empowers the Data Protection Commissioner to charge fees for the entries that are made in the register.
<P>
The amendments relate to subsection (5), which states that "the relevant time" that is, the frequency with which the fees are to be paid will be annual. Amendment No. 59 suggests that 36 months would be a more appropriate period. I understand that the current arrangement provides for a three-year cycle. The introduction of an annual fee may result in costs rising more quickly than the rate of inflation. We have heard many comments from members of the Committee about the need to avoid imposing undue burdens on business. Why, then, should there be an annual fee rather than a three-year fee? The requirement for notifications of fees due and payable to be sent out annually instead of every three years means that companies will have three times the amount of work, with costs rising proportionately.
<P>
The last subsection of the Bill, clause 69(6), states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Nothing in this Act shall impose any charge on the people or on public funds".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I take that to mean that the Data Protection Commission will be self-financing. I can see the point of an annual fee in terms of planning ahead and ensuring that the commissioner does not require a subvention every now and then because the money is running out. However, it ought to be possible to plan ahead so as to have a longer period for fee payment than 12 months. I would encourage the Minister to retain the current three-year structure.
<P>
Amendment No. 60 would delete the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and different periods may be prescribed in relation to different cases".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government are seeking an annual fee-levying arrangement, but the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"such other period as may be prescribed by notification regulations"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
suggests that they might not take such a rigid approach and that periods of more than a year might apply in some cases. In the end, three years might be the norm.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The position is a little uncertain, and it would help commerce and industry to have a clearer idea of whether they will face an annual levying of money by the commissioner, with all the annual increases and sending out of notices that that entails, or whether the current position will change little in practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I should like to support my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale. I am one of the 100 Members of Parliament who are registered under the existing Act. The three-year period works well and should be retained not only because it takes time to fill out all the forms if one does so conscientiously, but because the flow of forms to the Data Protection Commissioner will substantially increase if done annually, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale said.
<P>
It seems likely, in these days of opposition to subsidies, that the organisation will have to fund itself through its fees. If the commissioner has to carry out registrations on a one-year basis, however, costs will necessarily increase. It is also inevitable that the fees paid by businesses and many of the small voluntary organisations and charities that the Bill will affect will be substantial.
<P>
An annual fee would perhaps not be too bad a thing for a business with a large office and many personnel. It would, however, be unreasonable for a small local charity or voluntary group to have to go through the process of filling out long forms annually. I therefore support amendment No. 59, which would increase the 12-month period to 36 months. There is logic in it. In today's politics, we do not want to put undue costs on business and institutions. The current system works well. The Minister will have to come up with some convincing reasons to explain why the period should be 12 months rather than 36 months.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> May I deal with the comments made by the hon. Members for Ryedale and for Poole (Mr. Syms) together because they were substantially the same?
<P>
The Government are grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale for tabling the amendments, because they give us the opportunity to clarify important aspects of our proposals for the future operation of the system of notification.
<P>
As was correctly noted, under the Data Protection Act 1984, a data user registers for a set period of three years. At the end of that period, he or she has to apply for a fresh registration, also set at three years. That has two significant administrative consequences, which the Government, in agreement with the registrar, and, I hope, Opposition Members, would like to simplify as part of the drive towards better regulation.
<P>
First, under the present arrangements, fresh consideration has to be given to an applicant every three years, technically without distinction as to whether he or she is an existing and perhaps long-experienced data user or as to whether he or she  is a new entrant to the system. Of course, the registrar already has information about the applicant, but a fresh decision has nevertheless to be made.
<P>
Secondly, the Government have, as a result, inherited a three-year cyclical inflow of funds. The surge of new data users who presented themselves in 1987, when registration started, still manifests itself in large variations in annual registration fee income. In 1997-98, that income was £4.8 million, whereas we estimate that were it not for the implementation of the directive it would have been £6.5 million in 1998-99. A three-year cycle has continued through the process. It would be very helpful to bring about a more even flow of income in a way that does not burden data controllers.
<P>
We have, therefore, developed a new scheme for notification and for maintenance of the register. Under the new law, a data controller will have to notify and thus enter the register only once in respect of a specific processing operation. Subject to necessary amendments which could be made, for example, because of a change of the data controller's purposes the register entry will continue to operate provided that an annual renewal fee is paid.
<P>
That does not mean that existing data controllers will escape scrutiny. The commissioner has new investigatory powers, and if she finds that the law has been breached she can serve an enforcement notice. The registration must be kept accurate and up to date. The conscientious registered data controller will be able to remain in the system simply through the payment of an annual fee. That will make life easier for data controllers. They will not have to resubmit all the details of their data processing. Only changes will need to be notified and they will, more appropriately, be notifiable as and when they occur.
<P>
The public purse will have the additional benefit of a more steady stream of income that is more closely geared to the expenditure that has to be incurred through annual parliamentary votes to operate what will become the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.
<P>
Amendment No. 59 would mean that a registration would remain in force for three years before a fresh payment had to be made. While I would not and could not argue that there is any great magic in one period as distinct from another, I believe that we have developed a simple annual renewal system that is more appropriate than a triennial one. It will fit in with the financial years to which registered data controllers and the registrar the future commissioner operate, for a wide range of purposes. It will even out the flow of expenditure for the controller and of income for the public purse. Incidentally, it will provide a suitable annual opportunity for the controller to be reminded to check whether the register entry is still up to date and for the commissioner to enclose with the reminder any convenient material relevant to the operation of the legislation.
<P>
Amendment No. 60 would remove the provision in clause 18(5) allowing notification regulations to set various renewal periods for various registrations. As I explained, our basic proposal is that from the commencement date, all register entries should last for
12 months and continue on payment of the prescribed fee. Subsection (5) provides flexibility for the future. We believe that it is right to start on a 12-month basis, but when we have operating experience of the new scheme it might be appropriate to vary the arrangements for at least some data controllers.
<P>
It should be borne in mind that the register will embrace parties that must compulsorily notify before beginning processing and those who choose to do so as a way of declaring their data processing. The register will, therefore, span a wide range of organisations, from at one extreme the Department of Social Security of ICI, for example, to relatively small and specialised organisations or practising individuals at the other. The notifications regulations can exempt data controllers whose processing is unlikely to prejudice the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Nevertheless, some smaller and simpler organisations are bound to be caught. The Government want only to maintain reasonable flexibility to adjust the operations in a beneficial way as appropriate. Under clause 63(5), notification regulations will need to be laid before Parliament, so hon. Members will be able to consider them if necessary.
<P>
We propose to start the scheme with a 12-month period and we have no specific plans to change that for any category of data users. However, future circumstances or experience may make a change beneficial. It would help efficient public administration and data controllers' interests for the Bill not to tie us into an unnecessary straitjacket.
<P>
Given that explanation and assurance, I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. The spirit and preparation of his reply show that he understood precisely what we were getting at. We will be happy to withdraw the amendment, but first I have another question for him.
<P>
I presume from what the Minister said that when the new Act takes effect, there will be a substantial rush of people making notification. Two matters arise. First, that will create quite a work load for the commissioner, although I am sure that that is being taken into account. Secondly, what is the likelihood of there being a fee payment on a given day each year, which applies to everybody? With many organisations that require entry on a register, a fee is payable on 1 January or another date. On the other hand, do the Government expect this to be on-going and that people will pay fees on different dates throughout the year?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> There will not necessarily be a rush because some people are already registered. The transitional arrangements will allow registration to continue until it has to be reconsidered. We propose that the payment of an annual fee will, arguably, mean registration continuing indefinitely, subject to proper observance of the law and the fee continuing to be paid. I assume therefore that there will not be a fixed date and that the renewal will occur on the anniversary of the previous renewal. Incidentally, that guarantees a steady flow of income into the system, out of which we will be able to pay the necessary costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 61, in page 13, line 7, after `facilities', insert `at geographically convenient locations'.
<P>
Subsection (6) requires the commissioner to make the information in the register.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"available for inspection by members of the public at all reasonable hours and free of charge".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have tabled the amendment to probe the Government's intentions. Will there be just one place to which people would have to go, or will the information be available in several places?
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that my terminal, by which I can access the information over the internet, is "geographically convenient"?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is one interpretation, but I do not think that it would meet the spirit of the Bill. Not everyone has that facility. I understand that there should be some facility for public inspection of the register. It is a serious point. Will that be in one place or several?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The Government's White paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We intend that the Access Regime should be as simple and helpful as possible for the Applicant".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our amendment is tabled in that spirit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> In this Committee, it is never a
simple matter of tabling an amendment and debating it in a couple of minutes; interventions spark off other thought processes. My hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) makes an interesting point, but I have spoken to the amendment and look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Subsection (6)(a) requires a register to be available for inspection by the public free of charge. We recognise, as does the hon. Member for Ryedale, that that is an important part of the data protection scheme. Not only should the commissioner know who does what in terms of processing personal data, but so should members of the public with a personal or other interest. That basic statutory duty has been, and will continue to be, discharged in the same way as similar duties placed on other public registrars that is, by opening the register to inspection at a central location.
<P>
The Government and the present registrar agree wholeheartedly with the objective of easier public access to the register. Originally, that was a significant problem. The first register was a large collection of paper, necessarily held at the registrar's Wilmslow headquarters. Reproducing that and making it available in paper form at many locations around the country would have been, and would remain, difficult in practice.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Much the same applied to microfiches in public libraries, which represented the first attempt to distribute the register more widely. Appropriately enough, technology has come to the rescue. The registrar now makes the register available on the internet, where it is accessible by members of the public with direct access from their homes and from public libraries. The Bill means that the commissioner will continue that practice, under the powers in subsection (6) (b). As access to the internet grows, so public access will extend in practice.
<P>
However, our interpretation of amendment No. 61 is that it would require the register to be physically available across the country. As individual register entries can run to many pages, even after simplification a paper register would be bulky and expensive to reproduce and keep up to date. Moreover, there would be an obligation on the commissioner to ensure that all the physical copies were accessible in their various locations. That is nor more practical now than it was in the past. As I hope that I have explained, across through the internet under subsection
(6)(b) is fast achieving, by a different route, what was never before possible to manage by traditional means.
<P>
I hope that the hon. member for Ryedale will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I assure the Minister that we did not intend that copies of the vast tomes of information in paper form should be available in every public library. However, the Government's intention has been clarified, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 264, in page 13, line 12, after "public", insert "free of charge".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 62 in page 13, line 13, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"6(A) The facilities provided by the Data Protection Commission as set out in this section shall be paid for out of public funds".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Clause 18 requires the commissioner to maintain a register of those who have notified. Subsection (6) covers the commissioner's responsibility to make the information in the register available to the public. The subsection is in two parts: paragraph (a) places an obligation on the commissioner to provide facilities for making the information available for public inspection in visible and legible form at all reasonable hours and free of charge; paragraph (b) gives a discretionary power to the commissioner to provide such additional facilities for making the information publicly available as he considers appropriate.
<P>
The Government do not intend that the commissioner should be able to charge for any of the facilities provided for that important purpose. The subsection, as drafted, did not make that clear. Amendment No. 264 will remedy that slight oversight. I hope that, in the light of that clarification, the hon. member for Ryedale will not press amendment No. 62. There is not a great deal between us, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the Government prefer our wording over his.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We are making constructive progress. I was delighted that the Government had tabled amendment No. 264, which allowed amendment No. 62 to be selected.
<P>
The Minister has covered one of the points that I wanted to make. However, I want to add the important caveat that the proposals will cost business money. The spirit of our earlier comments was that we want information to be available to members of the public and that we want the Data Protection Commissioner's office to work efficiently and smoothly, as I am sure it will. We should, however, have the caveat at the back of our minds that businesses will have no choice but to pay. We need to ensure that they are not overburdened by the costs of the Government's largesse, deeply desirable though it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I should like to re-emphasise the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale made. Nothing in life is free. The Government might be giving those who want access a free facility, but somebody will have to pay for it. The difference between the amendments is that amendment No. 62 makes it explicit that the facilities should be paid for out of public funds because they are being made available to people.
<P>
In our previous debate about three-year as opposed to one-year registration, the Minister gave a good explanation. Businesses must, however, also pay this fee. The original costs of the Bill included £120 million on charities; they also have costs to pay.
<P>
That is my one reservation. In these days of freedom of information, the public should have free access. That might, however, be reflected in the fees that businesses, charities and other organisations have to pay. The Committee should have some regard to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Jenkins (Tamworth):</B> I was not going to speak, but it is always a pleasure to speak in a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Jones. I know that you will keep me on the straight and narrow, as is your nature.
<P>
I become concerned when I hear people flag up the words "public funds" or "at public expense". We are talking about the allocation of taxpayers' money. The Opposition are saying that I should reallocate money away from such needy causes as pensioners to subsidise businesses and to meet some of their running costs. We should be careful about making such a decision. If a cost falls on an industry, it must bear the full cost. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will bear that in mind when he responds on this difficult point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale set out more eloquently than I could the balance that has to be struck. There are costs to business and, as the hon. Member for Poole said, to smaller organisations and charities. Equally, those costs have to be balanced against ensuring that information is made available to members of the public about what can be fundamental decisions that affect their future and, as we have heard this morning, their livelihood.
<P>
I am sure that all members of the Committee will accept that the Government have consistently sought to strike a balance and properly to protect individual members of the public while minimising the burdens on business. The hon. Member for Ryedale will be the first to concede that we have been reluctant to accept amendments from Opposition Front Benchers because they might have imposed greater burdens on business. That reflects the considerable change that has taken place in our respective positions. The Government's concern for business underlies our approach; the Opposition's desire to increase those burdens seems to underlie their approach, at least according to their amendments.
<P>
I accept that nothing is free, as the hon. Member for Poole said. My hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins) mentioned the importance of minimising the cost to the public purse to ensure that taxpayers' funds are used for the most important purposes and that we do not unnecessarily burden the taxpayer with funding the scheme.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 95, in page 13, line 42, after "who", insert "wilfully".
<P>
I hope that the Minister will take the amendment seriously. The clause involves the creation of an offence, and we question the extent to which there must be a requirement to prove a deliberate intention on the part of a data controller not to comply with any duty that may be imposed on them. The amendment would provide that, if someone is guilty of an offence by which they fail to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"comply with the duty imposed by notification regulations made by virtue of clause 19(1)",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
there should be a hurdle that distinguishes that failure from a simple accident that has perhaps arisen from neglect. We must be careful with our definitions, but I am sure that the Minister will accept that the word "wilfully" is commonly used in criminal law.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lock (Wyre Forest):</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if his amendment were carried, it would be a licence to the indolent and incompetent and would penalise the efficient and organised?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am not sure that that is the case. It is true that subsection (3) provides the defence of due diligence. Nevertheless, the Bill creates an offence and it is therefore right to consider the appropriate hurdle that a prosecution should have to mount in order to proceed successfully. It seemed to me that the addition of the word "wilfully" was something that the Committee should consider in that respect. No doubt the Minister will now give us his response, one way or another. In all seriousness, we should ensure that we get this right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale appears to require some reassurance that the Government are taking his amendment seriously. We always take them seriously, but we do not always agree with them, and that is so in this case.
<P>
Notification to the Data Protection Commissioner by data controllers of information about their processing is an important part of the transparency provisions of the Bill. If it is to serve a useful purpose, it is essential that the information notified should be accurate and should be kept up to date.
<P>
Under clause 19, the Secretary of State must include in the notification regulations requirements as to the provision of information to the commissioner by controllers about changes in their processing arrangements. Clause 20(2) makes it an offence not to comply with such requirements. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would mean that it would be an offence only if failure to comply was wilful. His purpose, I think is to ensure that innocent slips or simple forgetfulness should not lead to the commission of a criminal offence. He has therefore suggested the test of "wilful" non-compliance.
<P>
The Government agree that it would be wrong to make failure to notify the commissioner of changes to notified information an absolute offence. That is why the Bill makes provision in clause 20(3) for a defence of due diligence. The hon. Gentleman may agree that that approach and his approach are broadly in the same direction. I accept that there is a slight difference between them. The current position is that it is for the data controllers to show that they exercised "all due diligence".
The amendment would reverse the burden of proof and require the prosecution to show that the controller's omission was "wilful". The Government prefer the suggestion in the Bill. We think it right to impose on controllers a duty to be alert to the need to keep their notified information up to date and to take proper steps to ensure that the necessary changes are notified.
<P>
As I said, this is an important transparency provision. It is the beginning of the process by which data subjects can inform themselves about data controllers' processing, with a view to exercising their rights under the Bill. Given the provision's importance, we think it essential to encourage data controllers to take this responsibility seriously and to put the onus on them to do what is necessary. We believe that a "due diligence" defence achieves that objective rather better than would the amendment of the hon. Member for Ryedale. There is not a great deal between us, but we believe that our approach is better. I therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am not 100 per cent. convinced. The Minister clearly demonstrated that the Government's course would mean that it was up to the defence to establish the true position. My proposed course would mean the prosecution establishing that an offence had been committed.
<P>
I am tempted to suggest that the thinking behind the provision stems from the 1984 Act, which, as we have said before, did not provide the Data Protection Registrar as she is now called with sufficient powers to require compliance. It is right that the Bill should overcome those difficulties. However, we have not on this occasion persuaded the Minister of our case. Those who may be affected by the provision will have to draw what comfort they can from their solicitor reading in Hansard that the innocent slip is not meant to be caught. I am bound to say that an innocent slip is certainly sufficient for someone to be found guilty of driving a motor vehicle without due care and attention. I read the "all due diligence" requirement as meaning precisely the same thing.
<P>
I am not sure that the Minster fully answered my concern, but we have again raised an important issue. We are not always successful in persuading the Minister to accept our suggestions, but for the moment we shall leave it at that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 20 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 21</center></H4>
<H4><center>Preliminary assessment by Commissioner</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 194, in page 14, line 3, leave out from `likely' to end of line 6 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`to present specific risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This probing amendment draws attention to some of the difficulties of definition associated with implementing the real meaning of the directive. The Government's preferred wording refers to processing likely to cause
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"substantial damage or substantial distress to data subjects, or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>otherwise significantly to prejudice the rights and freedoms of data subjects."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State may, by order, seek to prohibit such processing. The wording that we suggest comes from the directive itself.
<P>
When I read the Government's preferred wording, I wrote underneath, "What does this mean?" We seek clarification about what would significantly prejudice the rights and freedoms of data subjects. The word "prejudice" does not appear in the directive, which deals with specific risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.
<P>
Will the Minister explain why the Government's wording is better? The Committee is again left having to interpret the meaning of substantial damage or distress. What is wrong with the wording of the directive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Clause 21 provides for a mechanism that is new to UK data protection law. It has been introduced as a result of a requirement in the directive. The clause describes it as a preliminary assessment mechanism. In the language of the directive, it consists of prior checking by the commissioner before processing starts.
<P>
Under usual arrangements, a data controller subject to the prohibition on processing without notification must properly notify but may then go ahead and process. It is for the commissioner to intervene if he or she becomes aware of an actual or potential problem.
<P>
The directive and clause 21(1) impose an obligation to wait between notification and starting to process for select categories of data processing. It effectively provides that the commissioner must first be notified of the intention to process. She will then have 28 days, extendable once by 14 days, in which to assess and serve a notice about the extent to which she thinks that the processing is likely to comply with the substantive data protection regime. Provided that she has made a proper notification entry, the data controller can at that point start processing in the knowledge that either the commissioner has not raised a problem or that a problem has been identified, and if the controller persists without taking action he is at risk of incurring an enforcement notice.
<P>
Such provisions are necessary because effective protection law is needed to ensure transparency and to give the enforcement authority necessary information and tools to guide data controllers and to intervene when something goes wrong. The Government do not think it appropriate to make a significant shift towards prior authorisation or licensing. In the interests of proper balance between the rights of individuals and of data controllers, we propose that the preliminary assessment scheme should be confined to a select range of processing.
<P>
The policy paper that the Government published in July last year stated that we were considering three possible options: operations involving data matching, genetic data and private investigation activities. We will consider those options in more detail before laying an order, but I hope that they give a flavour of our approach. We should focus only on types of processing that cause exceptional risks.
<P>
Having set the context, I shall deal more briefly with amendment No. 194. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 21(1) set out the threshold that the Secretary of State would have to cross before identifying a specific type of processing as requiring prior checking. We believe that such processing should appear to the Secretary of State as especially likely to cause substantial damage or distress to data subjects, or otherwise significantly to prejudice their rights and freedoms. The amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Ryedale would replace that test with words taken from article 20.1 of the directive.
<P>
We do not believe that the meaning of the words in the directive is sufficiently precise for them to be copied into the Bill. The words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"specific risks to the rights and freedoms"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
pose a question: what sort of risks? The directive provides some sort of answer in recital 53, which makes clear that it is for member states to specify such risks if they so wish. That is what we are seeking to do in the Bill to make the general language of the directive more precise. In the end, the choice of categories when we propose an order will be what matters. The Bill will help everyone if it signals to the Secretary of State and to Parliament, when it debates these matters in detail that we should be sparing in our use of the power. The concepts of "substantial damage", "substantial distress" and "significant prejudice" show the sparing nature of the Bill's approach. I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will agree, and will consider withdrawing the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, who appeared to suggest that the Government intend the interpretation of article 20.1 to be a significant barrier and that the power under clause 21(1) would be used sparingly. The Government must be satisfied that the clause will meet their obligations under the directive. We have no wish to press the amendment, and the Minister's explanations will be helpful to others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The Government are entirely satisfied that the clause meets our obligations under the directive. The recital states that it is for member states to determine how the provision should be implemented. However, I had hoped that our approach would commend itself to the hon. Member for Ryedale, as any other would involve considerably greater bureaucracy. Our intention is that our sparing approach will limit the potential for what the directive calls "prior checking": we want to ensure that we do not impose unnecessary burdens.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 97, in page 14, leave out lines 20 to 23.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 98, page 14, line 29, leave out from `Commissioner' to `has' in line 31.
<P>
No. 99, page 14, line 32, leave out from first `period' to `the'.
<P>
No. 100, in page 14, leave out lines 38 to 40.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The amendment flows from what the Minister just said about clause 21, which was that it provides for a prior assessment of whether certain processing will be permitted. Subsections (4) and (7) provide an extension to the normal 28-day period during which a data controller would get an answer about whether processing would be permitted.
<P>
What are the special circumstances referred to in subsection (4), at line 21? No doubt the Minister will talk about flexibility, but why is it necessary to provide for such an extension? Under what circumstances will it be necessary? The extension will be for only 14 days. That is not unreasonable, but the Government seem to want to cover as yet unforeseen circumstances that would require a data controller to wait another fortnight for a notice, beyond the specified 28 days.
<P>
Is not there a danger that the provision could inhibit the controller? To some extent, the Minister has clarified the matter by making it clear that the power would be used sparingly, but I hope that he will accept that data controllers are entitled to a relatively early decision.
I hope that the Minister will say that the special circumstances will be used sparingly, like the power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Amendments Nos. 97, 98, 99 and 100 relate to the time periods that govern preliminary assessments. Amendments Nos. 97, 98 and 99 would remove the commissioner's ability, in special circumstances, to extend by a maximum of 14 days the normal 28 days she will have to carry out the preliminary assessment.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government believe that 28 days is a reasonable period to set. The period should certainly not be too long, but the commissioner will often have inquiries to make and must then reach a careful judgment about the risks of breach of the law. Having set the standard, however, we must allow some leeway for cases that are particularly difficult to assess. That might, for example, be because it takes a while to obtain the results of further inquiries from the organisation itself or from elsewhere. Subject to the higher threshold that there must be special circumstances the commissioner should have a special discretion to extend the period, just once, by just 14 days at the outside. I hope Opposition Members will agree. I shall give a general justification in a moment.
<P>
Amendment No. 100 would remove the power that we proposed to vary the 28-day and 14-day periods. I would very much prefer to maintain that power, for purely practical reasons. This is a new procedure, and we do not know exactly how it will work. We have set what we think will be the right time periods, but experience might prove us wrong. To cater for such circumstances, there should be reasonable discretion to vary the periods by order, subject to negative resolution. We are trying to ensure that the new legislation is workable, not just over the first few months, but over the next few years. I entirely accept that the powers ought to be use sparingly, but we must ensure that we have a regime that stands the test of time. In that way, we can avoid the necessity for the Committee to reassemble at some near date in the future. Given the likely changes in technology, we need the ability to make machinery adjustments to help us guarantee that the Bill stands the test of time. I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will not press the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. I want to ask him a more general question to avoid us having a stand part debate. Subsection (6) creates an offence in regard to processing information without consent. Is the Minister satisfied that it is unlikely that the 28 days could elapse with no answer from the commissioner and that that could be taken as implying consent? Could a controller think that he had given notification and start the processing after 28 days had gone by? If the Data Protection Commissioner uses the 14-day extension period, the controller should be clear that he has not been granted consent and that it would be an offence for him to carry on processing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Let me deal with that specific point. Three sorts of action are involved in the period that we are talking about. First, information is obtained from the data controller. In those circumstances, it is for the data controller to supply the information as quickly as is practical. Secondly, the commissioner may require extraneous information from another source. Again, it would be in the commissioner's interests to secure that information as quickly as possible. Equally, there would then be a period of reflection on the information that had been gathered. We would assume that the commissioner would resolve those matters expeditiously so far, there is no evidence to the contrary.
<P>
The whole purpose of the arrangements is to ensure that we do not place unnecessary burdens on business and we do not allow processing to take place in a way that is detrimental to particular individuals. We have resisted the amendments in order to ensure some flexibility. We will need to test the operation of the procedures in the light of practical experience. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale for indicating his willingness to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

Clause 21 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 22</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to make provision for appointment of data protection supervisors</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 101, in page 14, line 41, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 103, in page 15, line 9, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) An order under this section may not require the Commission to insist that a data controller must appoint a data protection supervisor.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Clause 22 appears to create, under order by the Secretary of State, the opportunity for data controllers to appoint persons to act as data protection supervisors within their businesses with a view to bringing some independence to the supervision of their operations and to the data controller's compliance with the legislation. That seems to be a perfectly sensible proposal and I am sure that it will be taken up.
<P>
We have suggested that "may" should be "shall" because, as drafted, there is no requirement for the Secretary of State to make such an order. I cannot understand why, given that the provision will be beneficial. We are not saying that we do not trust the Secretary of State to make the order, but it seems strange to leave it to his discretion, given that the Government intend to provide this opportunity. It would be better if the Bill read, "The Secretary of State shall by order" make such a provision.
<P>
Even if we persuaded the Minister and his officials to make the drafting clearer so that an order definitely would be made, no business should feel compelled to appoint a data protection supervisor. We tabled amendment No. 103 for clarification. Whether or not the Government accept amendment No. 101, it seems sensible at least to make it clear that nothing in the Bill provides that a commissioner could require a data controller to appoint a data protection supervisor. The decision whether to appoint should be left to the individual business concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I should like to make a similar point. This would be a useful option for many data controllers to have. Although a company is responsible for health and safety at work, it is not unusual for smaller companies to employ consultants to inspect factories, sites and so on externally, to ensure that they comply with the latest regulations.
<P>
I assume that the data protection supervisor would be the agent of a data controller, in the same way as one might have an accountant as an agent to deal with the Inland Revenue. People sign their forms and they are responsible for them, but their firms of accountants may write letters daily and find out details. Presumably, the clause allows a data controller, as a business or an organisation, to use an expert to deal with the Data Protection Commissioner. They should not do that to push off their responsibility, but to ensure that they fully comply with regulations.
<P>
It would be helpful for the Secretary of State to give businesses that opportunity by order. It should be up to data controllers to decide whether to take it. Substantial businesses might not require a supervisor, but small businesses might see an expert who deals daily with
10, 12, 15 or 20 businesses as a useful facility. I hope that the Minister interprets the Bill in the same way.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Amendments Nos. 101 and 103 deal with what may be referred to in layman's terms as the in-housedata protection supervisor scheme. People talk of little else. I shall explain the background before discussing the individual amendments' effects.
<P>
Under current UK data protection law, and under that of most other countries with equivalent legislation, direct legal obligations are placed on organisations and others who process personal data to comply with specific legal requirements. The data user, as the relevant organisation or person, is defined in current UK law, and is a key figure. The obligations ensure that compliance falls on him and that he is answerable for compliance with the full body of the law, however he manages to deliver that compliance. He may do so personally, or he may entrust employees and/or contractors with the task, but he must take appropriate steps to get it right and to answer to the registrar or to the courts if he gets it wrong.
<P>
The data protection directive, in the same way as the Council of Europe convention before it, is generally based on the same model. Article 18.2, however, provides for a variant, whereby a simplified notification or exemption from notification may apply
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"where the controller, in compliance with the national law which governs him, appoints a personal data protection official, responsible in particular:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> for ensuring in an independent manner the internal application of the national provisions taken pursuant to this Directive<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> for keeping the register of processing operations carried out by the controller...<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>thereby ensuring that the rights and freedoms of the data subjects are unlikely to be adversely affected by the processing operations."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provision allows for a scheme that currently operates under German data protection law. It differs from our previous thinking in respect of data protection, although it is possible to think of parallels in other areas, as did the hon. Member for Poole, such as the professional responsibilities of company auditors.
<P>
In their 1996 consultation document on implementing the directive, the previous Government sought views from interested organisations about the value of such a refinement for the UK. The response might be summarised as a polite interest, but little sign was given of serious intention to take up such a scheme.
<P>
The Government have, therefore, taken a pragmatic decision. Launching the main data protection scheme to implement the directive is a very large task for the Government and the registrar the future commissioner and controllers will have to take on board a new body of law. Even with the very positive spirit that has ben shown on both sides of the House, we have our work cut out to get the main scheme up and running. Given the tight deadline for implementing the directive, we do not want to have to devote a great deal of effort and resources to a variant that may not prove to be very popular or useful in the UK.
<P>
That does not mean that the Government are hostile to such arrangements. It is simply a matter of priorities and of where we consider that we should put our main effort.
<P>
I suspect that the new scheme will take some time to bed in fully, but when it has we shall look again at the possibility I put it no higher than that of introducing such a variation. When we consider the matter in detail, we might conclude that it is not workable in the UK context. Obviously, there would have to be further consultation among those affected, but I hope that I have clarified the Government's general thinking.
<P>
Amendment No. 101 would oblige the Secretary of State to introduce an order providing for such a variation. I hope that Conservative Members will understand, in the light of my more general remarks, that the Government do not want to be tied down on the issue now. It is much better that we should be able to approach the matter pragmatically in due course, when we have gained experience from operating the existing system.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 103 would stipulate that no clause 22 order could require the Data Protection Commissioner to oblige a data controller to appoint an in-house supervisor. The amendment is not necessary, as clause 22(1) states only that such an order can
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"make provision under which a data controller may"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
appoint a supervisor. That does not empower the Secretary of State to prescribe circumstances in which a data controller must appoint a supervisor.
<P>
The role of the order in conferring function on the commissioner, under subsection (2), must be read in the light of the basic limitation on the order's scope in subsection (1). That scope is permissive only. The data protection supervisor scheme could only ever be optional for data controllers.
<P>
I hope that my general explanation, and my specific comments on the proposals of the hon. Member for Ryedale, will encourage him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is extremely helpful. The Minister has explained that this is an idea whose time may have come, that the Government do not want to be tied and that therefore the word "may" is better than "shall". We accept that explanation, but the Bill moves data protection into uncharted waters and I confess that the concept of an in-house, independent view has its attractions.
<P>
Clause 22 (2) makes it clear that data protection supervisors would be placed under obligations in relation to the commission and the functions of the commission. We have explored the implications and the associated possibilities, and I understand why the Government do not wish to be tied down.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 22 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 23</center></H4>
<H4><center>Duty of certain data controllers to make certain information available</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 104, in page 15, line 17, after "person", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"subject to the agreement of the data subject.".
<P>
The clause means that data controllers not required by clauses 17 and 19 to notify their processing to the commissioner or those who choose not to do so must provide to any person on request certain information about that processing. They must make available relevant particulars to that person in writing and free of charge.
<P>
That appears to be a very wide provision. Why should people be able to find out information to which they have no relevant entitlement? The clause will allow people to get information about which they have no direct interest. Again, the amendment is a tool to probe the Government's intentions. Clearly, they seek transparency, but surely the data subjects should give their agreement. A person could say, "Because you, data controller, have chosen not to register, I want to get information about your processing activities". That should not result in information about data subjects being provided and, potentially, confidences being broken. Will the Minister clarify that?
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The purpose of clause 23 is to provide the necessary alternative transparency requirement for data controllers who are not required, or do not choose voluntarily, to notify under earlier provisions of part III. It states that such data controllers must provide on request all the sorts of information other than information about security arrangements that they would have had to provide had they notified the commissioner. In other words, they must be willing to make available information similar to that which would otherwise have gone on to the commissioner's register of processing.
<P>
It is important to note that this type of information is general information about what the controller does; it does not involve the disclosure of personal data. A typical example might reveal: "I run a small business and I process the names and addresses of my customers for the purpose of fulfilling their orders or mailing them regularly about the offers that I have available". It will be general information along those lines, which emphatically does not require that the controller should disclose any information about specific individuals. There is no data subject identifiable in the information from whom it is necessary for the controller to seek assent, even if that were practicable. I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will accept that there is no need for his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Subsection (2) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`the relevant particulars' means the particulars referred to in paragraphs (a) to (f) in section 15(1).".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 15 (1) (c) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a description of the personal data being or to be processed by or on behalf of the data controller and of the category or categories of data subject to which they relate".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We seek reassurance from the Minister that information about data subjects is not caught by clause 15(1)(c). That would not be desirable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> That is a helpful comment. It is important, however, to bear in mind the fact that clause 23 provides alternative mechanisms for those who are not caught by other provisions. We are dealing here not with the generality of cases, but with matters outside the earlier provisions of part III. What is involved is a general description of what a particular business is doing, rather than precise details about the business's individual customers. It is simply not possible to identify who might be required to give consent in those circumstances,. That is why the Government believe that the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I can see that the wording of the amendment does not entirely address the point it merely probes the meaning.
<P>
Can the Minister confirm that the Government do not expect that any person requesting such information will be given access to personal data? I welcome one aspect of the clause the fact that it creates a fresh and further incentive for people to register voluntarily. Without the provision, there would be a beneficial effect in not so registering: with it, and the fact that anyone can request information and find out what is being done, controllers are probably better off registering.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Again, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who is usually able to answer his own questions.
<P>
There is no intention that people should have access to personal data, and the hon. Member for Ryedale is right that the provision is a further encouragement to voluntary registration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I take his point about the process of our debates: as you will have grasped, Mr. Jones, we are trying to find out what this complicated Bill means.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 105, in page 15, line 26, leave out `all'.
<P>
We are back to our previous argument about the hurdle that should be imposed in respect of offences. When we debated clause 20, we did not suggest that the phrase "all due diligence" should be altered in cases of wilful failure to comply. However, this amendment questions whether even the phrase "due diligence" does not amount to too great a hurdle when a defence is mounted against offences under clause 23(4).
<P>
Data controllers who are registered will, through their regular dealings and correspondence with the Data Protection Commissioner, be aware of the ramifications of the Bill. Those who remain unregistered will not, and a failure by them could be accidental or the result of misunderstanding. A requirement for "all due diligence" in mounting a defence might be interpreted very strictly in court, and might therefore be a source of unfairness for unregistered controllers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I think that we are on to chapter 3 of the Opposition guide to tabling amendments. Leaving out a little word like "all" may appear an attractive way of presenting an argument.
<P>
The test in question is important and well recognised. The phrase "all due diligence" is often used in statute, and I do not really understand why the hon. Member for Ryedale wants to change it in this context. The amendment would cause doubt to be cast on the meaning of the expression elsewhere in the Bill for example, in clause 20(3) and on its use in other legislation.
<P>
The intention of the subsection is to encourage controllers to do all that they reasonably can to comply. If they do that, they should be able to rely on that defence if a criminal charge is brought against them, and that is what the expression "all due diligence" is well understood to achieve.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
