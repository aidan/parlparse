                           </span> On a point of order, Mr
Hancock. On Tuesday, we had an interesting debate about competition law
and European competition law. For the Opposition, that debate is
crucial—it is also in the interest of the House—because
the Bill will change the nature of the application of competition law
to the national health service. There was, therefore, a lot of debate,
and the matter was also raised yesterday during the Opposition day
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000018">&#160;</a>

Tuesday, the Minister, for whom I have a great deal of

this—said:<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000019">&#160;</a>

I just explain this first? As NHS providers develop and begin to
compete actively with other NHS providers and with private and

                        <p>We need
to know which is the case. I know the Minister is considering
publishing legal advice on competition law, so he might want to say
something about that, but, for the sake of our ability to scrutinise
the Bill and make proper decisions about competition law, we need to
know exactly what is the case in terms of EU competition
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000022">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not think that that is a point of order, but
it is a point that the Minister might choose to clarify at some time. I

carefully, the message will sink in and become clear. The Bill does not
extend the application of EU competition law or the application of
domestic competition law; you referred to that in passing, Mr Hancock.
The powers given to Monitor as a sector regulator are the same as those
now available to the Office of Fair Trading. The Bill does not change
the scope of competition law at all, and neither of us said that it
did.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000030">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I absolutely will. It is important that we have a
full discussion about the matter, but that is not appropriate under
clause
54.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to make two main points about the clause, which are directly
relevant here, but they lead to an overall concern about the Bill.
First, clause 54 sets out a whole range of issues that Monitor must
have regard to in exercising its general duties. Those include a duty
to promote the economic, efficient and effective provision of health
care services. We have also talked about its function to promote
competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
under clause 54, Monitor must also have regard to the desirability of
securing continuous improvement in quality and efficiency, ensure fair
access to services, and ensure that commissioners make best use of
resources. It has to have regard to the desirability of promoting
investment and the need to promote research and high standards in
education and training with respect to health care.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am sure
that hon. Members agree that balancing those different issues is no
easy task. There are inherent conflicts between the need to balance
fair access with competition. Sometimes the one improves the other,
sometimes not, depending on how the system works. With regard to
balancing quality with efficiency, there is a lot of evidence to show
that the two are linked, but there are also difficult trade-offs that
inevitably have to be made. That brings us to the fundamental point.
There are always trade-offs between trying to improve the quality of,
and meet demand for, services—demand that, if not infinite, is
increasing in the NHS and health care services across the
world—while making the best use of finite resources.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is an
extraordinarily difficult task for Monitor. However, not only Monitor
is involved in those difficult conflicts, balances and trade-offs; GP
commissioning consortia also have to seek to strike those difficult
balances. They have been told that they cannot go over budget. I have
already raised issues about how difficult that would be, although it is
a desirable goal. The NHS commissioning board also has the goal of
trying to make the best use overall out of taxpayers’ money for
the NHS, while securing all sorts of different improvements in quality
and
outcomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
this is a very difficult issue. Secondly, the problem is that there are
a number of different bodies charged with achieving the goal. My real
concern is about where 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 789<a class="bkMark" name="Column789">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the authority finally lies for making that difficult balance of
decisions about what is the best use of taxpayers’ resources to
get the best possible outcome for patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I refer hon.
Members to the helpful and thoughtful briefing from the King’s
Fund. I should mention at this point, as a declaration of interest on
the record, that aeons ago I worked at the King’s Fund. The

54 —<em>[</em>

Minister will listen because this is a difficult issue. I am, as
always, trying helpfully to alert him to issues and problems—not
to misrepresent the Bill, as the Minister was reported as saying in

duties and considerations should be struck and how conflicts between
Monitor’s policies and those of the Care Quality Commission and

not adequately define the role of Monitor in relation to these bodies.
For example, it does not make clear the circumstances determining
whether the Secretary of State should turn to Monitor or the NHS
Commissioning Board to deal with performance issues. Under the
framework set out in the Bill, no single organisation is responsible
for overseeing the NHS as a whole, in terms of both provision and
commissioning.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000245">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not know why the Minister is shaking his
head, because the Bill states that it is based on precedence in those
sectors. That is why I made a probably overlong speech on Tuesday
trying to explain why the two systems are so fundamentally different
and that a different system should apply. Interestingly, the
King’s Fund
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000061">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“this difficulty
has been resolved in part by giving ministers powers to issue general
directions relating to the policy framework within which the regulator
should operate. However, these sectors have a much simpler governance
structure and there are no equivalent bodies to the Care Quality
Commission or the NHS Commissioning Board.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000247">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>In other words, with
gas, electricity and telecoms, there is Ofgem and Ofcom, and that is
it. There are no other bodies with responsibilities, as there are in
the NHS. The King’s Fund also states:<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“In
relation to specific trade-offs such as cost or access versus quality,
other regulators have commissioned research from service users to help
define where the balance should be struck. In one case, the water
regulator asked ministers for a decision as the cost implications of
implementing higher standards were so
considerable.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000248">&#160;</a>

is very unclear who takes the ultimate decision on the appropriate
balance between efficiency and costs, and quality. In the regulatory
systems, there is one body that does that, which is the economic
regulator. Under the Government’s plans, there will be Monitor,
the Care Quality Commission, the NHS commissioning board

                        <p class="tabbed">This is an
opportunity for the Minister to be very helpful and clear up
Members’ concerns. As I listen to the debate, it seems that
there are not vast gulfs in terms of the objectives that people set
themselves, via this set of clauses, but that there are vast
differences in the policy outcomes that people foresee. This is a
genuine attempt on my part, therefore, to get the Minister to convince
those who are more sceptical than he is about how things will pan
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are in
unknown territory, because there is no natural history for a regulator
such as this. However, the natural history of existing regulators shows
that when they have been created, they do not always have the effects
that were anticipated. There has been criticism of regulators that
Parliament has created and then regretted doing so. We are, in a sense,
creating not a new feast—because Monitor is not a completely new
feast—but a new mechanism.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
was helpful in a previous sitting in pointing me to parallel examples
of regulators in Germany and the Netherlands, and I have since
researched that. I do not think, however, that those regulators have
precisely the same role as the regulator we seek to put in place here.
I could not find a regulator that has the job of promoting competition
in Germany or the Netherlands, although I was unable to look at the
situation in all parts of America, which he also specified.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In my initial
remarks on this matter the other day, I did not ask whether the effect
of creating Monitor would be good or bad. I questioned whether it was,
in fact, necessary to have Monitor to achieve the effect that the
Minister clearly wants, given that primary care trusts are already
procuring a range of services in a relatively competitive health
market. We have to accept, however, that the Minister and the
Government are trying to avoid some of the crude effects that might be
imposed by a pure economic regulator, and that is to be
supported.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By and large,
we know that regulators tend to regulate profit-driven industries, but
we are creating an organisation that will regulate institutions that
are presumably aimed at the public good. Most regulators that I have
seen hitherto essentially accept the fact that there is a market out
there driven by profit, and they seek to moderate that market to
achieve a public good. We are, at any rate, doing something different,
because we are trying to control a whole series of agencies—NHS
agencies, in particular—that seem to be primarily motivated not
by profit, but by public interest. Therefore there are
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
I am most interested in—the Minister can help me with
this—is that the key thing about Monitor is that it can overrule
commissioners or producers when they act anti-competitively. That is
the fundamental thrust behind creating the body, but there is a series
of mitigating factors in the clause to ensure that Monitor does not act
in a crude or insensitive way.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">During our
discussions on a clause that we were debating the other day, the Labour
party moved that Monitor should also be sensitive to integration and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 791<a class="bkMark" name="Column791">&#160;</a>
                           </div>collaboration, and the Minister ingeniously, but not particularly
convincingly, tried to distinguish outcomes and processes. I do not
want the Minister to comment on the solution, but will he give examples
of how the provision will work in practice and the kind of progress
that there will be through the
system?<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
seems that Monitor will not do a lot about uncompetitive behaviour by
producers, provider organisations, which are, by and large, encouraged
by the legislation to compete against one another. It is not clear what
anti-competitive behaviour by provider organisations towards the NHS
looks like; I know what competitive behaviour in the NHS will look
like, and perhaps some of the unfortunate consequences will stem from
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The only
example of uncompetitive provider behaviour that I can think of is if a
company such as Tesco decided to price its pharmacy products in such a
way as to put local pharmacies out of business. That strikes me as
fairly uncompetitive, but I do not think that Monitor’s remit
would extend to Tesco. It would help if the Minister gave some examples
of uncompetitive behaviour by providers, for which Monitor would show
the red
card.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is easier to understand what uncompetitive commissioning looks like,
and the Minister helpfully provided examples of that. The hon. Member
for Stafford mentioned doctors in their surgeries worrying about
whether they were referring someone to a provider without giving them
sufficient indication of their options, or persistently recommending
the same provider. That would clearly be perceived as uncompetitive
behaviour, particularly if the options were not adequately disclosed to
the patient.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman also mentioned objections to block contracts—with
which I am familiar—when they are against patients’
interests. There is also the refusal to fund any willing provider,
which is what I am most interested in. If a willing provider arrives in
town wishing to provide a service and the commissioners refuse to
commission it, even though patients are keen on using it, Monitor will,
I imagine, intervene and show the red
card.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Members who
have heard me speak in the past will probably think that I am biased in
favour of primary care trusts, but I am not. Primary care trusts in my
part of the world have behaved in a wholly anti-competitive way, in one
sense. The biggest single health issue in my constituency of Southport,
stretching back more than 10 years, is that we do not have an A and E
department for children. The hospital is on a split site, so anyone in
Southport who has a child with a minor ailment has to go to Ormskirk.
That has been a huge issue, and I have even had the Secretary of State
down campaigning for the Conservatives about it. It has gone on and on,
as a festering sore, and two successive PCTs have tried to resolve
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We got a
pledge from the PCT that it would deliver a solution and give us what I
thought we would have as a minimum: a walk-in centre for children in
Southport. The plans were stopped at the last minute, however, after a
report was produced with the help of the Department of Health—it
indicated a useful person to do the report—and senior paediatric
specialists. Essentially, the report was produced to do a job, which
was to say that constituents could not have the facility that they
wanted 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 792<a class="bkMark" name="Column792">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and were paying for. They had organised petitions about it, and I had
been to Richmond House to see successive Secretaries of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The report
said that my constituents could not have the facility because it would
have a detrimental impact on the A and E department in Ormskirk, which
happens to be part of the same trust; that is effectively saying that
it cannot stand the competition. During a subsequent discussion with
Assura Medical, I asked what would happen if it provided a service that
people dearly wanted but that affected the A and E department in a
nearby town. I was told that under the any willing provider rule, if it
provided a service that people wanted to use, it would be funded for
it. In a way, I should have said that that was good and applauded the
advent of Monitor in that arrangement, because it would deliver a
political objective that I have long had in mind and that the residents
of Southport dearly want.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One can
imagine what might happen, however. The A and E department, or the
paediatric department, in Ormskirk might become no longer sustainable.
A shortage of paediatricians was the key issue, because they need a
certain flow of patients—the fewer they got, the less
sustainable the department was. It would have a ripple effect. It would
have an effect on Ormskirk hospital, which would have an effect on the
local networks in the area, which would have an effect on Alder Hey.
One could say, “Well, so be it. This is driven by consumer
interests from the bottom.” But one wonders who is going to sort
out all the pieces.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am more
comfortable with the idea of resolving the problem by explaining to a
democratic body of decision makers the options, the
effects—according to the best professional advice—and
what will fall on their heads as a result of their decisions, because
they have to live with those decisions. The problem is that Monitor
does not have to live with the decisions. It is a long way away, and
right across the country it can make all sorts of decisions that have
consequential effects.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We can live
with that environment and tolerate it, but it is the local health
economy rather than Monitor that has to live with it. It is a genuine
concern that, if Monitor operates as I expect it to, there will be
these effects right across the country.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000082">&#160;</a>

by letting the commissioning consortia answer

always tension between what people regard as clinically safe and what
some of the population regard as desirable in terms of access. In my
constituency, that has been the debate over this particular issue for
the last 10 years. Committee members might be interested to know that
the embryonic GP consortia asked about this outstanding democratic
issue, which had people marching through the streets of Southport and
has seen successive parliamentary campaigns. In 2005, a hospital
campaigner stood against me on the failure to deliver this particular
outcome. The GP consortia asked about it very recently, and they say
not only that they are not offering a solution to it, but that it is
not a
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000090">&#160;</a>

belief that GPs will somehow deliver something that is more
democratically acceptable to the population is arguable. It does not
seem evidenced in my own experience, which is what drives me here. The
issue for the Minister, a genuine, serious concern—and I know
that he is as anxious as I am to get this right—is how we can
avoid Monitor’s making decisions on narrow grounds that ignore
the overall effect on the health economy. Are these clauses sufficient
to ensure that that is the outcome, given that Monitor does not have to
live with
outcomes?<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000091">&#160;</a>

clause 54 that I would like to point out. Picking up from the closing
remarks made by the hon. Member for Southport, I think we do now have
clarity in respect of competition. The Minister is right that there is
no difference between what he said on Tuesday and what the Secretary of
State for Health said yesterday.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The only
difference was what the Secretary of State left out of his remarks,
which is the crucial coda that the Minister gave us on Tuesday and
repeated this morning: competition law is not changed by this Bill, but
it will increasingly apply in and bite on the NHS as more entrants come
into the market. In effect, as there is a more genuine open market, so
too the safeguards or challenges that we see of competition legislation
have to be applied to the NHS fairly and under the law, in a way that
has not happened before.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000097">&#160;</a>

of competition and the number of entrants, had we removed the crucial
caveat that the NHS was the preferred provider and had we opened up
competition to 95% of the NHS instead of the 5% where there was managed
intervention, I imagine we would have seen competition law abiding.
However, we did not do that. Only 5% of the NHS budget was ever in the
hands of private
providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000100">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I respect your intervention, Mr Hancock, but the
point I am trying to make is that the extent to which competition law
will bite on the NHS absolutely impacts on the functions that Monitor
has both to perform and have regard to under clause 54. As the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 795<a class="bkMark" name="Column795">&#160;</a>
                           </div>hon. Member for Southport was pointing out, it will impact on its
ability to make holistic decisions—to think about the totality
of the health care system and to try not to make decisions on narrow
grounds. The sorts of forces that will dictate its making decisions on
narrow grounds may well come about as a result of its having to have
greater cognisance of competition law and the implications of
competition law.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So I turn
again to clause 54 and it is in that context that I challenge the
notion about Monitor. The clause is interesting in that it is a list of
“need to do” and “nice to do”, with
desirability. Under the “need to do”—I assume this
is really important; more important than the “nice to do”
desirability provisions—there is the need to maintain patient
safety. We would all accept that that is a crucial aspect of any duty
in any facet of the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000103">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My concern
here, which is an adjunct to the point that the hon. Member for
Southport was making, is about how Monitor can be certain that it is
making decisions in the best interests of patient safety if it is also
having to have regard to value for money. Furthermore, and crucially,
it is potentially being dictated to—over time, in the decisions
that it has to take—by case law, competition law and the way in
which it may become increasingly fearful of intervention in the courts
by other actors in the health service who are looking to get a piece of
the action of clinical service or pathway or local health economy x or
y.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000104">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I offer a hypothetical example—I am not as
wary as the Minister about hypotheticals—to try to illustrate
what I mean. I extend the point into one that I will make in a minute
about research, because it holds fast for both issues. Take a medicine
such as Lucentis, which was being used for age-related macular
degeneration and around which there was an enormous row a couple of
years ago. Was it the right medicine? Was it effective? It was
certainly expensive. Should it be used? NICE was in a quandary about
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We ended up
with a postcode lottery of Lucentis being allowed, often under
exceptional case rulings, in certain parts of the NHS and not in
others. We also ended up with Lucentis effectively being discounted
enormously in certain parts of the NHS, where they were keen to use it,
and not in others. Age-related macular degeneration is an area where
this sort of behaviour has happened in the NHS over a long period.
There was a cohort study that saw different bits of the NHS using
earlier generations of drugs against AMD.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What would
happen in a world where other companies provided those services to the
NHS? Those services might not simply involve the product, but the
product plus its administration and the excess treatment costs
associated with using it. What would happen in a world where certain
bits of the NHS were interested, perhaps through GP consortia, in the
drug’s being delivered in primary care or secondary care, but
other bits of the NHS were not?<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000108">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Once
competition law was applied, how would the NHS withstand a company or
other actors through the courts insisting on all parts of the NHS using
the medicine? How would NICE’s views on whether that medicine
was safe and appropriate for all patients withstand a challenge in the
courts? The Bill opens up all those questions if competition law bites,
as we anticipate it might.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Any medicine
that is controversial or being trialled in the NHS is interesting,
because Monitor also has to have regard to the need to fund research in
the NHS. I am sure that none of us would disagree with the fact that
the NHS is potentially a hugely important global resource for research,
as it has the largest total patient pool. For many years, Members on
both sides of the House have wanted to realise fully the potential of
the NHS as a vehicle for research.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One key
problem we have with the Bill in terms of research—we heard
about it in evidence—is that PCTs have in the past picked up the
excess treatment costs associated with research, but there is no
clarity in the Bill about who will pick up the bill for those costs.
Will it be the GP consortia? We do not know. Will it be the ethereal
regional presence of the NCB? We do not know. Will the drugs companies
be forced to pick up those costs in future? It certainly will not be
Monitor, so how can Monitor have regard to the desirability of
promoting research? Is that not an entirely redundant duty to place on
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000111">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Even if the
duty is not redundant, it absolutely cannot be delivered by Monitor.
There are many holes in the Bill in so many respects—and the
more I look at it, the more I see vast chasms and worry about how on
earth it can ever work.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000112">&#160;</a>

good one—the rest of them are, of course, absolutely excellent.
Presumably, in a commissioning decision, someone may commission
something more expensive that has benefits for NHS research, so a
viable case can be made for it, as opposed to commissioning something,
perhaps in the private sector, that has no research element attached.
In that way, the research imperative in the legislation could kick in
and help make decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000113">&#160;</a>

cross-purposes. Perhaps I did not explain myself carefully enough. The
point I was trying to make is that there is always a cost associated
with trialling a medicine in the NHS. Previously that cost was,
essentially, met by PCTs. The NHS body that delivered and
operationalised the trial with NHS patients did not have to bear extra
costs as a result; they were picked up centrally. Nowhere in the Bill
is it clear where that central cost will be
met.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000114">&#160;</a>

stood here and said to my hon. Friends and Opposition Members that we
had not looked at their regulatory procedures to see whether there was
anything relevant or useful, we would be criticised for not doing so. I

that we do accept that health care cannot be delivered in a completely
free market, that is the reason why the Government want to introduce an
economic regulator for health. The key purpose of economic regulation
is to protect the interests of patients and taxpayers by protecting
essential services and promoting efficiency, transparency and fairness
in the way in which taxpayer funds are
used.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000124">&#160;</a>

economic regulation will create certainty about prices, offer
incentives for providers to thrive, facilitate the introduction of
innovative services and safeguard essential services, which a free
market cannot necessarily do. That is fundamental in our vision for
putting patients and quality first. Monitor cannot deliver that in
isolation. It will be part of a health care system. It must work with
the commissioning board on pricing and with the Care Quality Commission
on the licensing regime. It must also work within an overall context
and give consideration to how its regulatory functions will impact on
the wider

                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause goes on to make provision that Monitor should have regard to
certain considerations that would apply to commissioners. The clause
also specifies and provides for Monitor to take account of the need for
high standards in education. The final subsections in the clause are to
help ensure that Monitor works effectively with other parts of the
system that will create the infrastructure for the provision of NHS
health care services. Monitor would have to take account of the way in
which the Secretary of State and the NHS commissioning board performed
their relevant statutory duties. The clause is to ensure that, in its
role as economic regulator, Monitor would work in a way that had regard
to, and complemented, the roles and responsibilities of other key
players in the system. I believe that it is right to leave it to
Monitor to consider and balance those things. Independence will be key
to Monitor’s role as an economic regulator, hence the
requirement about “having regard to”, rather than them
being absolutes. They are not in competition with one another. It is
about balancing them in the best interests of patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000148">&#160;</a>

seem, in the nicest possible way, to be slightly splitting hairs. I
will seek, however, to answer the bottom-line question, which
was—unless I have misunderstood what the hon. Lady
thinks—who exactly is responsible for driving up quality.
Quality, as we keep mentioning during the course of these debates, is
the guiding principle of the NHS, and we are, for the first time,
making that a reality in primary legislation. That is why we have
sought to ensure that all levels of the system have a role to play in
driving up quality. That includes the need for Monitor to have regard
to the need to secure continuous improvements and quality in the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000153">&#160;</a>

providers and clinicians are responsible for delivering high-quality
care and are held to account, through contracts, by their
commissioners. As now, the CQC’s role will be to safeguard
essential levels of quality. It is the job of the commissioners to
drive up quality and the job of providers to deliver care that is of
much higher quality than set out in the essential standards. I hope

responsibility for ensuring competition, many of us in the Committee
would like to know who has the equivalent job of being the ultimate
arbiter of quality. The CQC is sometimes quoted as being that body, but
we all know that it will provide a basic safety net. I respectfully say
to the right hon. Gentleman that it is simply not good enough for him
to say, “Oh, it’s everybody’s responsibility to
push up quality.” If we are talking about something as important
as developing a market and competition, why is there not in this

ensuring increases in quality?<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000157">&#160;</a>

have said in earlier debates, and I will say it again so that the hon.

there is the CQC; there is Monitor, which will carry out its duties as

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Southport raised a number of issues, which I would like
briefly to address. He mentioned accident and emergency departments,
and they are already paid for the patients that they treat. Those
services would not be subject to any willing provider as they need to
be commissioned and planned to ensure that they are safe and clinically
viable. The Bill allows local commissioners to designate services
traditional protection, to ensure that the country is covered with the
relevant number of services; for example, of A and E
departments.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000170">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman also asked how one can avoid Monitor’s making
decisions on narrow grounds. The answer is by requiring Monitor to have
regard to exactly those broader issues that commissioners need to take
into account. He also suggested that decisions should be made by a
democratic body rather than Monitor. Monitor will not make decisions
about which services are provided. It will ensure that the choices of
patients and clinicians shape the development of services. Health and
well-being boards give democratic oversight at a local level in a way
that was not possible before.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000171">&#160;</a>

Gentleman also asked what anti-competitive behaviour looks like. I hope
that he will find these examples helpful. They include things such as
colluding with a commissioner to keep out competitors; colluding to
keep prices high when there is no national tariff; not offering
patients the choice to which they are entitled; agreeing not to compete
against each other; and sharing confidential cost
information.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000172">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That was certainly the impression given by the hon.
Lady. I shall answer anyway, as I am sure that she would have liked to
have asked the question. Commissioners decide on the best use of
resources and priorities for patient care. Monitor simply ensures that
the system works fairly and in the interests of the patient. Patients
decide who they want to treat them.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000179">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hesitate to
say so, but I think that the hon. Lady wanted to know where the overall
authority lies for deciding how best to use resources.
<em>[Interruption.] </em>Given that the hon. Member for Islington South
and Finsbury is acting as a kind of Greek chorus, it seems that the
hon. Member for Leicester West did not ask that question. However, she
will have the benefit of an answer so as to avoid confusion at a later

                        <p class="tabbed">The answer is
simple. Commissioners secure the  best quality services for
patients in line with patient choices. The CQC ensures essential
standards of safety and quality. Monitor ensures that services are
efficient  and fair. The Bill creates a much more coherent
framework than the current confused mix of overlapping
responsibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000181">&#160;</a>

the question that I asked. It is not who has

There are trade-offs and difficult decisions, and those issues need to
come together. It is quite illuminating that in his reply, the Minister
wished to separate the two and that, I am afraid, is the problem. That
is the fundamental, difficult decision that needs  to be taken
in the NHS, both locally and nationally, whoever is in power. As for
the difficult trade-off, it is not clear, under the Government’s
proposals, whether the responsibility for the system as a whole lies
with the NHS commissioning board nationally, GP commissioning consortia
locally, the Care Quality Commission or Monitor. It is fair enough that
the Minister does not take my word for it, but he should read the
briefing from the King’s Fund. If he had been at the Westminster
health forum, in which a number of eminent people, including David
Bennett, spoke, he would have seen that such questions are being asked
by the health policy world. How are those difficult trade-offs made and
where does ultimate responsibility lie? I humbly ask the Minister to
listen to what those organisations say because this is a difficult
question.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000183">&#160;</a>

discussions that I have had with a number of organisations, it was said
that responsibility is not included in the Bill. My hon. Friend the
Member for Pontypridd and the hon. Member for Southport made the
important point that Monitor does not have to live with the
consequences—financial or otherwise—of its decisions. My
hon. Friend raised that point in relation to research costs and the

                        <p class="tabbed">As for
democratic accountability—I beg the Chair’s forgiveness
for my over-long contribution—Monitor may be able to make
decisions, which have serious implications for local people, but it is
not democratically elected and it does not have to live with the
consequences of those decisions. My—not
philosophical—point was that, although I absolutely believe that
we need to base decisions on fact and evidence, we also need to bring
people with us, because ultimately it is the people’s national
health service, and who is to say that some independent body, even if
it has all the science behind it, has democratic legitimacy? That is a
hard issue, which we have struggled with for many years. I, like hon.
Members in all parts of the Committee, think that there has always been
a democratic deficit in the NHS. We need to ensure that it is more
accountable, but I am not sure that we should put powers in the hands
of Monitor without that democratic
legitimacy.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000194">&#160;</a>

listened very carefully to the hon. Member for Southport, who said that
he is not wedded to primary care trusts, but wants greater
accountability and legitimacy for decisions. Under the clause, Monitor
will take significant decisions, but it will not have to live with the
consequences of those decisions. There is no other body that can have
that legitimacy at the moment. GP consortia do not have elected
representatives. We cannot just say that it will be up to health and
well-being boards, because they will not be making decisions on all the
difficult trade-offs. We have debated whether they will have a say in
reconfigurations of services, but they will not be responsible for
those difficult trade-offs. Health and well-being boards cannot direct
GP consortia to do anything. At the moment, there will not be
democratic accountability in the system. The clause, like many others,
does not resolve that issue, and therefore my hon. Friends and I are
not able to support
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000195">&#160;</a>

Monitor will have two main roles—its main role of economic

Monitor will need to have Chinese walls between its role of economic
regulator and its functions on foundation trusts. The Government
amendment will provide clarity that Monitor’s duty is to ensure
that no conflicts arise in the exercise of its main functions,
including those related to foundation trusts. It refers to
Monitor’s specific functions on foundation trust accounts, and
makes it clear that they will be covered by the provision on the
conflict of interest. I hope that hon. Members will agree that the

                           </strong> I have one or two points. Hon. Members will be
aware that the Labour party does not support Monitor’s new role
as an economic regulator, but as it moves towards that position, there
is obviously a transitional period in which it remains responsible for
part of the move of trusts into foundation trusts. As hon. Members will
know, that will be extremely difficult and many organisations have
queried whether it will be possible for all NHS trusts to become
foundation trusts by 2016, as in the Government’s timetable.
This is not just about hospitals; as primary care trusts separate out
their provider role, community services will also become foundation
trusts. There is a huge amount of work for Monitor to do.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000228">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As Monitor
proceeds in trying to make all trusts ready for foundation trust
status, the Bill seeks to ensure that there will be no conflicts of
interest. A body cannot be the regulator of a provider as well as of
the market, and I understand what the Government are trying to do. I
would like clarity from the Minister about the resources that Monitor
will have to ensure that every trust becomes an NHS foundation trust by
that period. Does he believe that some NHS trusts will never be ready
to become foundation trusts? Unfortunately, the list of the 20
hospitals that will not reach foundation trust status has already been
published, and the chief executive of the NHS mentioned that to the
Public Accounts Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000229">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am
concerned about the timetable and the resources that Monitor has to
secure all trusts that move towards foundation trust status. I
understand what a “Chinese wall” means, but will the
Minister explain what that would look like within
Monitor?<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000230">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 55 makes various provisions about how
Monitor should handle potential conflicts of interest in relation to
its functions. From listening to the hon. Lady, I get the impression
that we agree that that is important and must happen. There is no
conflict between us on that point.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000231">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It may be
helpful if I say something about where such conflicts might arise.
Clauses 52 and 54 create a number of general duties on Monitor. Its
main duty, however, is to protect and promote the interests of people
who use health care services by promoting competition where
appropriate, and through regulation where necessary. Monitor must also
promote the economic, efficient and effective provision of NHS health
care services and, among other things, have regard to the need for
commissioners to ensure fair access to services for those who need
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In many
cases, there will be a synergy between those duties, but at least in
theory, there could be a scenario where the most economic, efficient
and effective provision did not deliver fair access, for example
because that access was limited to certain days and times, or
locations. Hence, the clause creates a general duty on Monitor to make
arrangements for resolving any conflicts of interest that it considers
there are between any of its general duties. The provision makes it
clear that, in cases where the general duties conflicted, there would
be no external authority to which Monitor could or should turn for
resolution. Subsection (2) is about how Monitor would achieve two of
its functions: its main role of economic regulator and any of its
continuing functions in relation to NHS foundation trusts under chapter
5, part 2 of the National Health Service Act 2006.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Once Monitor
has taken on the role of the economic regulator, its main role in
relation to foundation trusts will be that of registrar. That will
include, in the short term only, determining what foundation trusts
must include in their annual reports. Monitor will also have functions
in relation to foundation trusts arising from its time-limited
transitional powers over all new and some existing foundation trusts;
and its ability to trigger the transitional failure regime in relation
to foundation trusts. In the short term, Monitor will need Chinese
walls in relation to its role as economic regulator and its functions
in relation to foundation trusts.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Similarly,
subsection (3) provides that, when carrying out its competition,
licensing and pricing functions, Monitor must ignore those of its
functions that would enable it to intervene in NHS foundation trusts
for a time-limited period during the transitional period, while the new
governance arrangements in new, and some existing, foundation trusts,
become fully effective. That includes ignoring the power that it has to
impose additional licence conditions in cases where it considers there
is a significant risk of a newly designated foundation trust failing to
meet its principal purpose. Under the subsection, Monitor could not
take account of the fact that it was intervening in a foundation trust
when considering whether there had been a breach of competition law
involving the same
trust.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Subsections
(4), (5), (6) and (7) cover conflicts between Monitor’s general
duties that are, in ways specified in the clauses, significant. The
provision also applies to any other conflicts of interest that Monitor
considers 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 807<a class="bkMark" name="Column807">&#160;</a>
                           </div>are of unusual importance. In all those cases, Monitor must publish a
statement setting out the nature of the conflict, the manner in which
Monitor has decided to resolve it and its reasons for the decision.
That is an important provision in relation to transparency and public
accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000236">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Taken
as a whole, the clause makes provision for real-life conflicts of
interest that Monitor might encounter in exercising its functions, and
ensures that Monitor is clear how it should deal with them. It also
ensures there would be transparency in cases where there might be
significant public
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000237">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also asked: what are Chinese walls? Those would be a complete
separation of functions, roles, people and information below the
chairman in Monitor. Monitor could, for example, set up a separate
committee to deal with its specific foundation trust functions to
provide that protection. The hon. Lady also tried to tempt me on the
foundation trust pipeline. That will not be Monitor’s job. We
are setting up a

                           </div>separate time-limited authority to manage the FT pipeline. For those
reasons, I urge that clause 55 stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000238">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for his reply. I am not
necessarily convinced that a committee of Monitor, beneath the chair,
with separate information streams—if that were possible in a big
organisation—is a genuine Chinese wall. I am keen to see further
information on that. Anyone who has run a big organisation knows that
just having a committee does not mean that it is a separate function,
or necessarily a safeguard. That is  a serious issue, raised by
the Foundation Trust Network and others, about how that conflict of
interest can be safeguarded. I am not sure that the Minister’s
response is sufficient, but I would be glad to hear
more.<a class="bkMark" name="11031760000239">&#160;</a>
