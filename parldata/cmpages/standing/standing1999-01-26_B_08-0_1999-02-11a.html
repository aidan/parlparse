</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning. If hon. Members wish to remove their jackets they may do so.
<P>
Before we commence this morning, I should point out that the Chair's incredibly politically acute antennae have picked up the fact that the clause is mildly contentious, as shown by comments in earlier debates. The clause itself is brief and to the point. The amendments that have been selected have been grouped to encapsulate the whole clause. As has been said, they run the gamut of emotions from A to B.
<P>
As always, the Committee has a choice. Hon. Members may either debate the amendments at considerable length, which is their right, or have a brief debate on the amendments and a clause stand part debate. But they cannot have their cake and eat it. Hon. Members may wish to move three amendments separately, and again, because these amendments have been grouped to encapsulate the clause, they may do so after the usual discussions with the Chair.
<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Secretary of State's powers</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard (Taunton):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 199, in page 10, line 2, leave out from "applies"to first "is"in line 3 and insert "if a report under section 12 is not approved by a full meeting of the authority and the Audit Commission".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following Amendment No. 179, in page 10, line 2, leave out

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 181, in page 10, line 39, leave out from "enforceable"to end of line 40 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"only after an order containing the direction has been approved by resolution of both Houses of Parliament".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> You are right, Mr. Gale. Many roads have led to this clause and many hon. Members will want to have a substantive debate on it. I am also quite surprised and delighted to see that some Labour Back Benchers have finally found their voice and have tabled an amendment. That perhaps shows that there is widespread concern about the powers that the Secretary of State will be given if the clause is accepted as it stands.
<P>
It will come as no surprise to anyone that we oppose the clause, and we will vote accordingly on clause stand part. I am sorry to disappoint the Government Whip but I am feeling quite bullish about it this morning. The clause gives the Secretary of State power completely to emasculate local government, to ride roughshod over local democrat mandates and to ignore the consultations procedure laid down in the Bill.
<P>
The notes that accompany the Bill are, as usual, illuminating. They say that the clause
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"offers the Secretary of State a wide range of intervention powers in response to failures. These include some which are of a procedural nature, and others which involve more substantive action".</font></ul>
<P>
I suspect that no matter how persuasive the Opposition's arguments are, the Goverrnment will not withdraw the clause, although I would be delighted if they surprised me and did so. [Interruption.]
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) has more confidence and thinks they are a listening Government and that they will withdraw the clause. Nevertheless, I will to through the amendments that we have tabled which are designed to improve the clause.
<P>
Amendment No. 199 paves the way for our other amendments and tries to tip the balance of power in this relationship away from the Secretary of State and back to local people. Amendment No.153 deletes the open-ended ability of the Secretary of State to give best value authorities any instructions that he or she wants. Amendment No. 96 deals with the hit squad. We know that hit squads can go into education authorities, and that they have been used very sparingly, but the proposal for a more wide-ranging hit squad is the most centralising and draconian measure in the clause.
<P>
The views of the late Nicholas Ridley on local government were mentioned earlier. He would have been delighted with this clause, and with its hit squad power, which goes beyond even his wildest dreams of the extent to which central Government could emasculate local government. When the hit squad is sent in, it will not even be subject to best value in the way that it runs local government services. I see that that has been addressed by an amendment tabled by the hitherto silent Labour Back Benchers. Let us hope that their amendment will be successful, even if none of ours is.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 59 to 61, which propose the urgency powers, take an already greedy and grabbing clause and make it much worse. When exercising those powers, there would not even be a requirement for a debate in parliament, as there is with, for example, the reserve capping powers. When individual authorities are capped, that must be debated on the Floor of the House. Indeed, I took part in such a debate on my own local authority, Somerset county council, when I was first elected. Amendment No. 97 proposes a procedure to ensure parliamentary scrutiny before the hit squad powers are exercised. That is also dealt with in amendment No. 154.
<P>
The clause gets to the heart of the relationship between local and national government, and exposes starkly the fact that in this country, perhaps uniquely among western democracies, local government has no constitutional right of independent existence and no powers of general competence. Indeed, the Minister implied that she did not believe in the power of general competence, and that it had never been Labour party policy, which came as a surprise to me and perhaps also to some Labour Members in Committee. Local government has no independence over its-[Interruption.] The Minister suggests that the election was not fought on the power of general competence.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> My hon. Friends know on what issues they fought the election. In our manifesto we committed ourselves to a power of well-being, which we believe is more relevant than a power of general competence. I said to the hon. Lady that, following work done before the election, it was decided that a power of general competence would not be the catch-all, the magic wand, that she and her hon. Friends pretend that it would be, and that it would have been of little use to local government.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</b> I thank the Minister for that explanation.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson (North Shropshire):</B> By a happy chance, I have the Labour manifesto in my right hand. It says clearly:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Local decision-making should be less constrained by central government, and also more accountable to local people."
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Jackie Ballard:</b> If one reads the rest of the Labour manifesto, one will find a "but", followed by "as resources allow"or "as the mood takes us"or "as focus groups tell us".</B><P>
<P>
One of the Government's first acts was to sign the European charter of local self-government. The Government did-[Interruption.] This is not a leadership speech; only one other member of the Committee would have a vote in that election. I shall not waste the Committee's time in that way.
<P>
The Government signed the European charter of local self-government very early on, but there is no real commitment in the Bill to giving self-government to local government. I regret that local government will not have the power of general competence or any independent control over their own finance. Indeed, clauses that we shall debate-at great length, I am sure-later in the Bill propose to take away even more of local government's power to control finance. It will have very little flexibility, if the Bill goes through as it is, to meet what it and local people think are local priorities.
<P>
The report of the Select Committee on Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs, with which many Labour Members were involved, stated that many local authorities were concerned at the extensive power that would be given to the Secretary of State under the clause. They were also particularly concerned that those powers would undermine efforts to make local authorities more responsive to their communities and would compromise innovation and local flexibility. I do not believe that the Government want to stifle innovation and flexibility and create even more disputes between local and central government than we have witnessed over the past 20 years. Indeed, the Select Committee pointed out that that was a danger. A number of Government Members were on that Select Committee, and their names appear at the end of its report. I hope that they will give us their views on this matter.
<P>
The Select Committee pointed out that the threat of sanctions might lead to a siege mentality and stigmatisation, which would lead to poor morale among people on whom we rely to improve the delivery of local services.
<P>
I hope that the Government will listen closely to our debate and will be able to reassure local government that they do not intend to centralise further; that they do not trust a Tory Secretary of State more than they trust Labour-controlled councils.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin (North Essex:</B>) I do not wish to pre-empt your judgment about the Committee's conduct, Mr. Gale. However, none of the amendments in this group addresses the protocol that the Government produced for Committee members, and we need to discuss that at some stage. I hope that we will have an opportunity to do so.
<P>
We have tabled three amendments-
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</b> Before we even begin to go down that road, I must tell the Committee that the protocol is not part of the Bill. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be extremely creative in his remarks. However, should he wish to raise the protocol, he will have to find a way of doing so within the debate on the Bill and the amendments that have been tabled to it.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</b> The Government have produced a document that shows how powers under clause 13 are to be exercised. The Government have produced the protocol with the intention of informing the Committee's debate on that matter, so it seems reasonable that we should be able to discuss the protocol in relation to the clause. However, I am not sure that it is in order to discuss the protocol in relation to the amendments.</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</b> Let me clarify the position. I shall be surprised if the hon. Gentleman is not sufficiently creative in wording his comments to make them apply to the Bill and the amendments that have been tabled. Under the circumstances, I may endeavour to exercise the Nelson touch. I shall see how we get on.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin: </b>I am most grateful, Mr. Gale.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry (Skipton and Ripon):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Remarks made by Ministers in Committee may be referred to when, for example, courts seek to interpret an Act. Therefore, a protocol that has passed outside the Committee may have very little value in comparison with remarks made by a Minister in the Committee. It is important that explanation of how a clause will work in practice should be made in the Committee itself for the convenience of everyone who will have to interpret the Act.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</b> It is not for the Committee Chairman to exercise judgment over what the courts may consider at a later date. However, my experience and the right hon. Gentleman's experience suggests that the courts pay attention to what is said in Committee.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I was brought up to believe 
that the courts should not impugn Parliamentary proceedings. I do not know what infection has got into law that that should now be happening.
<P>
My right hon. and hon. Friends and I have tabled three amendments in this group. Amendment No. 179 addresses the tone of clause 13 and the way in which the Secretary of State's powers may be exercised. I can imagine circumstances in which a Secretary of State pushes his or her luck by explaining that he or she is satisfied that best value authorities are failing to comply with part I requirements. It underlines the curious nature of the Bill whereby the Secretary of State interprets the legislation and assesses whether it is being applied by best value authorities.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, if the authority is complying with the requirements of this part of the Bill, it should be evident in the Audit Commission's report, as set out in clause 12. I understand that the wording is technical, but the provision underlines the extraordinary discretions given to the Secretary of State. That is why amendment No. 179, on which we intend to divide the Committee, would delete it.
<P>
Amendment No. 180 would delete subsection (4). I understand that the Local Government Act 1972 should apply, but I want the Minister to explain the procedure and tell us how long it will take, who will pay for it and what she expects to achieve by it. Later Government amendments suggest that a short-cut procedure may be necessary for exercising the powers swiftly.
<P>
It is ludicrous to have an extensive inquiry procedure to provide some sort of protection for the local authority, and then to set up a short-cut procedure to bypass that whole process. Under what circumstances would the short-cut procedure be used? If money is being wasted, when can an inquiry be justifiable and is not the Audit Commission the proper body to conduct it? Having established an Audit Commission model for the supervision of local government-with the Audit Commission acting as ringmaster for the various supervisory bodies-I fail to understand the need to go into a quasi-judicial mode, which the Secretary of State can bypass anyway. That is a complete mystery.
<P>
Amendment No. 181 complements amendment No. 199, tabled by the Liberal Democrats. We cannot imagine circumstances in which the unrestricted and undefined powers given by the clause to the Secretary of State should be exercised without the approval of both Houses of Parliament. These powers are much more comprehensive than those related to competitive tendering, and I am reminded how often those powers have been used.
<P>
Formal notices issued to local authorities under the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 and the Local Government Act 1988 are many and various. I have pages of them before me and it seems that they have been the main animus of oppn against competitive tendering. It is difficult to imagine what local authorities would be like today without compulsory competitive tendering. In previous debates, the Government have been generous enough to acknowledge its contribution to creativity and efficiency in local government-or economy, efficiency and best value values.
<P>
Council after council has been subject to directions over such failings as anti-competitive behaviour, financial failure and so forth. I assume that such directions are envisaged under the clause.
<P>
I note that a direction issued against Burnley council has been withdrawn. Perhaps that is a Billboard advertisement for best value. Why has the notice been withdrawn? Other directions have been issued against Burnley council in the past for financial failure in building maintenance, cleaning, and highways and sewers. I hope that the Minister can explain the withdrawal of the most recent notice.
<P>
Those directions were made under limited legislation, and on specific, well defined grounds. Clause 13 is much more general. It is extraordinary that Labour Members, who stood for election on a manifesto that promised to hand back control to local authorities, and local decision making to local people, want to give untrammelled power to the Secretary of State. Subsection (5)(b) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "the authority shall comply with any instructions of the Secretary of State or his nominee in relation to the exercise of that function and shall provide such assistance as the Secretary of State or his nominee may require for the purpose of exercising the function."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause gives the Secretary of State power to take over or privatise a function. Its powers go even wider. Both Opposition parties in Committee have described the measure as the "nationalisation of local government Bill". I am sure that the circumstances in which the
powers will be used are similar to those under other clauses, but it is incumbent on the Minister to tell the Committee the further circumstances that are envisaged, and why the powers need to be yet wider.
<P>
The protocol that I mentioned earlier gives us a clue. The Minister circulated a letter that made it clear that the draft protocol on intervention had been negotiated with the Local Government Association. The letter states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It has, however been drafted with the possibility of extension to intervention powers in other legislation in mind."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister should explain those further intervention powers.
<P>
The letter also claims that the clause will have to be adapted,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to reflect the distinct involvement of the Association of Police Authorities as well as the LGA."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We expressed the anxieties of police authorities earlier in our proceedings. The letter also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Protocol will record an understanding between central and local government."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why is not that understanding reflected in the Bill?
<P>
We know what goes on behind the scenes at the LGA. It comprises many unhappy people. When the Labour party was in opposition, LGA members argued against many of the powers that now appear in the Bill. The protocol is an attempt to whitewash that disagreement with the LGA. I understand that the chairman of the LGA is under pressure from some members to express more anxiety about the clause and its wide powers.
<P>
The protocol has no legal status. In many respects it is similar to the concordats that are being negotiated between Government Departments and the new Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly. It is a new form of constitutional law, with no legal status at the moment. However, the very fact that we are discussing it in relation to the Bill means that, if there is a dispute between central and local government, the document is likely to become part of the dispute in court.
<P>
Over time, jurists may well begin to draw on the content of such a document to inform the interpretation of the statutes. That has happened, for example, with the role of executive agreements between federal and state governments in the United States. It is one way in which European Community law is developing. Various different tiers of law exist. The document is, therefore, of extreme significance and has a bearing on the future interpretation of the clause.
<P>
With respect to the principles governing intervention by the Secretary of State, the protocol states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The government will exercise intervention powers only when there is clear evidence that an authority is failing either to discharge its functions adequately or failing to meet its statutory obligations."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 That is a good argument for removing the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if the Secretary of State is satisfied"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
from clause 13(1). The protocol says nothing about the Secretary of State being satisfied as to the point. It says only that it should be clear. The only body that can make the matter clear is the Audit Commission, since it has been charged with the responsibility.
<P>
The protocol states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State will inform the authority of the reasons for intervention whenever using his powers under best value legislation".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is laid down in the Bill. Further on, the protocol states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The form and extent of intervention will"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
reflect
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the type and seriousness of failure"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 and the need for effective improvement. That is a good instance of the principle of proportionality-something which is implicit in the competitive tendering legislation. Intervention can take place only when there is clear failure constituting a breach, and the intervention will achieve an objective. However, that is not in the Bill.
<P>
The clause nowhere provides that an order made under it would have to be proportional to the failure identified in the Audit Commission's report. It is important that it should be placed on record that that is what is intended. It is distressing that no relevant amendment has been tabled. Had we had the material more than a few days ago, we would have tabled appropriate amendments. Why does the Minister consider it unnecessary to provide for proportionality in the clause?
<P>
In dealing with timing, the protocol states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the authority will normally be given the opportunity to make the necessary improvements itself."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is comforting, but is like a gun being held to the head of the authority. Paragraph 5 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Best value authorities will provide accurate and timely responses to requests for information, and co-operate with such action as the Secretary of State may 
direct in accordance with his powers and this protocol."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That emphasises that the Secretary of State expects authorities to jump when the process is undertaken. It is extraordinary that there is not more detail in the clause to reflect what is in the protocol. It suggests that, when the Bill was presented to Parliament, the job was only half done, and that the Government are making it up as they go along.
<P>
The exercise of the powers by order of mandamus means that the Secretary of State will not need to adhere to any procedure at all. An order of mandamus, for members of the Committee who may not know, is simply an order made by the Secretary of State under his own hand, and as soon as it is, it is. Stalin and Mussolini ruled by order of mandamus; it is dictatorship. I am never sure whether this is a Cavalier or a Roundhead Government, but I think that we are a Roundhead opposition because we believe in the power of Parliament. It was Cromwell who, after the civil war, emasculated Parliament. He was at one time very much a people's hero who became unpopular because he took on dictatorial powers.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If any member of the Committee wanted real evidence that the Bill is without precedent, it is that the Secretary
<P>
of State is assuming powers to take over the functions of local authorities at the stroke of a pen. It is breathtaking that a party that championed local government when in opposition has produced such an extraordinary provision, the effect of which is to ensure that there will be no control over the exercise of those powers. Representations received by us from parts of the Local Government Association on this point have been quite startling.
<P>
I believe that my amendment expresses wide concern about the clause. It is incumbent upon the Minister to answer all my questions, explaining in detail what circumstances will apply when the Secretary of State uses these discretionary powers and telling us what will happen if a future Secretary of State misuses them in a damaging way. We need to know, for example, what powers local authorities will have to hit back.
<P>
I notice one interesting amendment tabled by the Minister's hon. Friends to the effect that the Secretary of State should not be able to apply the powers unless he or she is subject to a duty of best value. I find it extraordinary that they have done that here. We tabled an amendment to make the Welsh Assembly subject to best value, but hon. Members who tabled amendment No. 199 did not support us. The amendment, by implication, makes the Welsh Assembly subject to best value. But, leaving aside that inconsistency, it would be helpful if the Minister explained to her hon. Friends its exact implications. We will raise questions throughout her speech if she fails to answer points that we have raised.

<P>

<B>Dr. Alan Whitehead </B>(Southampton, Test): Amendment No. 198 attempts to draw attention to what at first sight appears to be a lacuna in clause 13(5) in that the Secretary of State will be able to intervene after various stages have occurred, effectively to remove an authority's function if it has repeatedly failed to apply best value provisions to its services.
<P>
As I understand the clause, the Secretary of State can either exercise that function himself-or herself-or can require the function to be exercised by a person whom he nominates. When the Secretary of State takes such an action, he will argue that the local authority has consistently failed to apply the principles of best value to a particular service, therefore it is justified that it should not provide that service for a specified period. The principles of best value should be reapplied at a future date and the service might be restored to the local authority.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): The hon. Gentleman talks about the service being taken away and given to someone else? Who does he have in mind?
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> There is a range of authorities and agencies. As I said in relation to clause 13(5)(a), the Secretary of State could exercise his authority directly or he could require an agent, perhaps another local authority, to undertake the service.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that, despite having the mandate of being elected by local people, an administration that failed to satisfy all the Government's tests could have its responsibility for a certain service removed? Does the hon. Gentleman genuinely believe that there is legitimacy in the Secretary of State deciding that another local authority, elected by other people, could run that service?
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> I am describing what is apparently in the Bill as drafted. The hon. Lady must know that local government does not have a separate federal status within the constitution of the United Kingdom; its status relates to statutes passed in the House upon which it can act. That is how it derives its authority and how, logically, a power of general competence must be bound. Local government cannot exercise an entirely separate authority without recourse to the statutes. Thus a Secretary of State can properly exercise guardianship of statutes passed in the House as they relate to local government. Local government has always derived its constitutional authority from this House, and that is consistent with the Secretary of State's powers as proposed in the Bill. There is no problem with that.
<P>
I want to draw attention to the circumstances under which the Secretary of State will properly exercise that power which, as I said, derives from the statute which relates to local government in the first place.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Hayes </B>(South Holland and The Deepings): The hon. Gentleman is setting out the case for a unitary constitution, which is, of course, what we have. He is right to say that local government does not have sovereignty, but it does have democratic legitimacy. That is the point. Although it may be true to say that the power of local government is derived from the sovereignty of the House, its democratic legitimacy is derived from the consent of local people. The Bill cuts across that tradition of local government, so the hon. Gentleman is in fact saying that the clause will mean that local people will not have the right to make a separate judgment about the effective delivery of a particular service, but the Secretary of State will. He will be able to intervene, perhaps offering the provision of that service to another local authority or even to the private sector for which the local people have no right to vote.
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> I am not saying that. What I said is that when a local authority has repeatedly failed to carry out the reasonable requirements of best value as laid down by the statute, when various procedures and consultations have been carried out, and the local authority has been given opportunities to put matters right, issues that are properly the concern of the Secretary of State under the powers of the statute-
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> May I just develop my point? Those are the 
circumstances in which the Secretary of State might intervene. It is astonishing that the Conservative party is surprised by that notion, because, systematically, for 18 years under their Administration, they passed legislation to give themselves tremendous powers of intervention. Not only did they give themselves those powers, they gave local authorities no opportunity for consultation, partnership or redress, which is an essential element of the Bill, an argument that I shall develop in the clause stand part debate. It is breathtaking for Conservative Members suddenly to claim that they have discovered a new constitutional principle whereby the Secretary of State should never intervene, while systematically disregarding statutes as they relate to local government.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I am surprised by the hon Gentleman's comments. In common with hundreds of others, we are both vice-presidents of the Local Government Association, which I do not think would take the hon. Gentleman's line in respect of local government's powers, rights and independence. Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that under the compulsory competitive tendering legislation even Tories did not have the ability to take over the running of local services?
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> The previous Administration imposed legislation on local government which cited circumstances in which the Government could appoint agents or intervene directly if the Minister deemed that local government had failed in certain duties. Under section 14 of the CCT legislation the Government could impose an anti-competitive notice which could be followed up by powers of direct intervention. The principle is well established by the House; it is the way that Parliamentary works. I remind the hon. Lady that I am not a member for the Local Government Association, I am a Member of this House. Given that the power of local government is essentially derived by statute from the House, one of my duties is to ensure that there is a proper, statutory relationship between the House and local government. That is my argument in respect of the amendment-
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> I would like to make progress, and to get to the point. There should be a proper, consistent relationship between the House-the Minister is the executive responsible for ensuring that legislation passed by the House is properly applied-and local government. My anxiety about the Bill is that in principle it appears that the Secretary of State could issue a direction for an agent to take over a local authority's function after all the proper procedures have been carried out, if the local authority had consistently failed to 
tackle the issue of providing best value. However, that agent would not be subject to the best value test. That would be a perverse outcome given that the Secretary of State intervened in order to uphold the principles of best value. As a starting point, we should ensure that these powers are exercised consistently.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> This is genuinely intended to be a helpful intervention. We understand that the alternatives to taking over a particular function might be to appoint another local authority, another agency or a firm from the private sector. I would not, like the hon. Gentleman, say, "Even the private sector,"as that may be a legitimate option. How would a firm from the private sector that took over the running of local services be subject to best value?
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> At present, there is no problem with local government using an agent from the private sector, provided that the agent is contracted to local government to act in such a way that its actions are consistent with best value requirements. There is no problem with that. However, should the Secretary of State require an agent-either in the private sector or another local authority-to undertake a particular function, we must trace the principles of best value consistently throughout the whole process.
<P>
The amendment would ensure that the Secretary of State, in any direction that he or she gives to any agent undertaking work on behalf of local government, maintains the principle of best value enshrined in any such action-
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B> Dr. Whitehead:</B> May I make progress on this point before I give way?
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> It is a helpful intervention.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> With respect, it would be even more helpful if I finished my sentence.
<P>
It is important also because of the partnership and protocol in this part of the Bill. Justice must be seen to be done in relation to the proper application of best value through a partnership arrangement between central Government and local government-manifested, among other respects, in the protocol before us today. If it appears to local government that the Secretary of State could remove a particular function entirely from the arena of best value, that would undermine the relationship that we are trying to build by the exercise of the protocol and the manner in which best value works.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The hon. Gentleman has carefully explained the relationship between local government and central Government-it sounds like a contractor and sub-contractor arrangement-which will intrigue and endear him to local government. He is effectively talking about central Government moving in on a white charger bearing a banner that says "best value". My difficulty is that by the time all the procedures have been gone through, the services might have degenerated into a shambles. Expenses might also have gone up-I can think of several local authorities to which that would apply. How long will people have to wait before the white charger with the best value banner comes in?

<P>

<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood what I am saying. We will be able to debate later the possibilities for the Secretary of State to intervene speedily; but Opposition Members have said that that is a bad idea for local government. The hon. Gentleman now seems to be saying the opposite-that waiting a long time will be bad news for the service so he should now stand up and support the Minister when she says that speedy intervention may be necessary in some circumstances.
<P>
Let us assume a scenario in which local government honourably attempts but fails to carry out best value provisions. The Secretary of State attempts to assist the local authority to implement best value, but inspections and reports show consistent failure. That procedure may take considerable time. At the end of it, the Secretary of State can properly intervene to ensure best value.
However, there is a lacuna in the procedure whereby the Secretary of State can remove the intervention service from the whole framework of the previous dialogue between central and local government.
<P>
The hon. Member for Mole Valley suggests that local government will find itself surprised that it is a creature of statute and central Government. If local government finds itself surprised about that, it should examine the history of the relationship, which may not be ideal and there are some who might like to see a different constitutional settlement between central and local government. In future, it may be possible to move in that direction, but not now.
<P>
Local government is a creature of central Government statute. That is the constitution of this country. Under those circumstances one must make that relationship the best that it can be in terms of affording local government the maximum freedom and understanding of what they can undertake within that statutory framework. However, at the same time it is quite reasonable that central Government should protect themselves within the context of those statutes to ensure that those statutes are carried out by local government. That is a perfectly reasonable understanding of the relationship between central and local government.
<P>
My amendment, and I hope that I have made it clear, aims to ensure that that is done consistently. It asks the Government to do that. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can assure me that other areas of the Bill make it clear that that is the case. There appears to be a problem which I would like to see rectified. my hon. Friend may be able to give me the assurances that I require not to press my amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> What the hon. Gentleman has just said at interminable length is that he cannot understand what all the palaver is about. In that I agree with him.
<P>
There is nothing dramatic in the Bill that I can see. if one looked at the list of interventions into local government it would be interminable and headed, of course, by Liverpool. Any list of interventions is always headed by Liverpool. Then there is a string of other local authorities. Such interventions may not have had the comprehensiveness of the legislation but the practical effects will have been similar.
<P>
The problem is not in the inherent content of the Bill. All the feeble-minded liberal palaver about this has been entirely typical. My Front-Bench colleague, who comes somewhat to the right of me in the spectrum, displayed a certain squeamishness, which I regret. Perhaps he is moving towards the libertarian element of the party. The problem lies in the contrast between what is written in the Bill and what the Government say. The Government's blather about local government is all about setting them free and trusting them, but that is not apparent when one looks at what they do.
<P>
A whole series of White Papers have come out and underlying them all is a strong authoritarianism. The Government believe in local government, but they are going to tell it how it should manage itself to do what they want it to do. The whole argument should not be about the inherent nature of the Bill, but about the contradictions displayed between the spin which Labour puts on its opinions and the content of its legislation. If we have not got used to that in 18 months, people must have spent most of that time on an extended trip to outer Mongolia, which I recommend as it is an extremely agreeable country. [Laughter.] I have been on a short trip there.
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> How is it possible to go on a short trip to Mongolia?
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Concorde.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The answer is to fly to Peking, although not on Concorde. There was no helicopter provision available at the time but I am not bad on a yak. Before you point out, Mr. Gale, that Mongolian models of local government may not be entirely apposite to the discussion I shall return to the Bill.
<P>
I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) would call clause 13(2)(d) the Henry VIII clause, and I was going to leap to my feet to defend him as a greatly underestimated monarch. Anyone who could have more wives than Gerhard Schrôder commands a certain admiration. But it is an enormously powerful clause which represents an authoritarian strain. It is the nuclear deterrent in the Bill. Nuclear deterrents only work if they do not have to be used. I assume that the purpose of the clause is to hold up a stick which casts such a shadow over local government that it will not need to be used in the full plenitude of its powers.
<P>
If the clause does have to be used, the whole best value principle has failed. I therefore take it that it is to be used in extremely rare circumstances. What it says is, "If everything else doesn't work chaps, I can do what I want to do in any case."That is the catch-all of the clause. In what circumstances might this ultimate deterrent be used?
<P>
I said during my point of order that, irrespective of what is in the protocol, it is important to get things on the record. There are some important questions about the local inquiry. By whom will it be directed, and what form will it take? How long will it last? Who will pay for it? What will be the outcome, and how will it be implemented? On the taking over of functions, could a company-the classic externalisation-take over? Could an individual be sent in to run a department-the Sir John Harvey Jones of his day? Could management consultants be put in, as, for example, head teachers are put into failing schools to try to pull them round? Could a function be handed out to another local authority? It would, for example, be a good idea if Westminster took over many of the functions of some London boroughs because it would perform a great deal more efficiently than some of them.
<P>
Perhaps the Minister will answer the following serious questions. When someone has been sent in to take over, say, a housing department or other department, what will be the criteria by which to judge when that department has been turned round? Finally, how can a function be retrieved? The problem with all interventions is not the process of intervening but the problem of disengagement. How can we be sure that disengagement has happened? After all, if a function has been externalised, what will happen to the people in the local authority which formerly carried out that function. Will they sit twiddling their thumbs, will they have been dismissed or moved elsewhere? What infrastructure will remain for the function to be resumed? Those are key questions. How much will these people be paid? How will the cost be determined, and who will pay?
<P>
By way of illustration, will the Minister answer this point? If the Bill had already been enacted, which function of which local authority might now be subject to its provisions? Where, among surrounding local authorities, might she have sent in her people to turn things around? Might they have gone into Hackney? That is already happening there because of its education problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen (Nottingham, North):</B> Wandsworth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry: </b>The Minister has just given a large additional sum to Wandsworth under the standard spending assessment, so Wandsworth is clearly back in favour. We in north Yorkshire would much rather have had it, but I shall not go into that again. Knowing where the provision might apply would be a useful test. It would give us an idea of the magnitude of the problems that are likely to trigger this sort of legislation.</B><P>
<P>
Bradford would be a good place to begin. An example not commonly cited is Cornwall's district councils, which have an absolutely chronic inability to use their planning powers straightforwardly. In that part of the world, "I know Fred, and Fred scratches my back"practices are commonplace in the giving of planning permissions.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</b> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</b>Yes. I said that deliberately and wondered whether the hon. Lady would respond.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</b> I assume that the right hon. Gentleman was referring to the independent district councils, not county councils. He is aware that many district councils are independently controlled. I believe that he was referring specifically to North Cornwall, which is under independent control. On behalf of my hon. Friends who represent Cornish constituencies, may I ask the right hon. Gentleman to be a little more specific rather than damn all district councils there?</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman: </b>Order. While it is perfectly in order for hon. Members to illustrate points, I would not wish the Committee to stray too far from the fundamental thrust of clause 13 and the amendments.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</b> I am sorry, Mr. Gale, that you have precluded my going chapter and verse into this. I have long held the view that the trouble with local government is that there is not enough politics in it, therefore I deprecate the existence of independence anywhere in local government. We should all have the guts to stand and fly flag.</B><P>
<P>
One of my earliest experiences was a significant problem in a planning department in Cornwall over the way in which planning permissions were granted. It happened to be north Cornwall but there was a general belief that north Cornwall was the exemplar of a wider problem.
<P>
I do not know where the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) would stand on the matter of the final approval of the House, because he said-and I agree with him-that local government is the statutory creature of this House. Of course that is a correct legal definition. I have said that I do not dissent from the possibility of using the powers that we are considering. I do not subscribe to the thesis that the whole provision is wrong in principle. One must be realistic and realise that a relationship of the kind that is envisaged must employ some ultimate weapon. However, where such severe powers are used, the final sanction should be with this place.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Particularly in the case of the powers, to be dealt with by way of an amendment, to disregard normal procedures and act by way of an emergency procedure, some recourse to the House would appropriately represent the relationship that the hon. Gentleman correctly described. I should like the Minister to explain why there should not be a recourse to this House. It is also important to obtain from him an idea of the practical application of the powers. All joking apart, we know that the relationship between central and local Government is often difficult. Many of us have aspired to the goal of greater autonomy for local government. All of us have at some time hit the wall, so to speak, of understanding the degree to which public expenditure acts as a prior determinant, requiring central Government to lay down the conditions to make it possible to adopt an overview of the total amount that it is legitimate for local government to spend in the economy. We all face the problem of where to locate the equilibrium between the autonomy of local government and the ability of central Government to have a say.
<P>
The Bill takes matters a little further. An explanation of how it will work will be more useful than long debates about the constitutional principles involved.

<P>

<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders (Torbay):</B> I have looked long and carefully at the Bill and have been trying to work out why clause 13 is needed. The intervention powers appear to be unnecessary. The Government seem to distrust the other methods that they could have chosen to ensure best value. An alternative might have been an independent auditor with greater powers to intervene, but the Government seem unwilling to give away powers in that quarter. The Government might have trusted electors to boot out a failing administration, but they know that a first-past-the-post voting system protects entrenched majorities. They could not trust that system to achieve the appropriate result. Service improvements are unlikely without external pressure. Of course, the Government could change the voting system for local elections to a proportional system. That would certainly ensure the end of one party states, and would introduce extra pressure on local councillors and administrations
who presently have little expectation of defeat at the polls. However, that course of action would require far more trust in the public and the recipients of local services than Secretaries of State have shown.
<P>
A strange conundrum emerges. A well-meaning policy to improve standards in local government has come from a party that has previously prided itself on its commitment to local democracy. However, clause 13 sets out a framework under which a Secretary of State could shut down a local council or take away a local service against the wishes of local people. It is an extraordinary clause because it allows a Secretary of State to overrule the ballot box. It is therefore dangerous in the hands of any Secretary of State.
<P>
Hon. Members should ask themselves who, in this context, sets the standards. Who judges whether the standards have been reached? Who determines the sanction when they are not? The answer is not users of the services, people who pay for them, or an independent body that can examine the case objectively and make a rational decision, but a Secretary of State.
<P>
Clause 13 is, therefore, a centralising and undemocratic provision. We shall vote against it happily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> The hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) presents the human face of authoritarianism. He rightly says that local government derives its power from Parliament, and there has always been a tension between central Government and local government, which creates a dynamic and changing relationship. However, local government also draws its power from the consent and will of the local people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Is not my hon. Friend confusing power with legitimacy? Local government gets its power from Parliament and its legitimacy from the electorate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> That is absolutely accurate. I used the word "legitimacy"in an earlier intervention. Local government derives its power from Parliament and its democratic legitimacy from the will of local people. Therefore, the consent of local people is crucial. Previous Governments established the statutory framework in which local government operates. Throughout their existence, local authorities have had duties and responsibilities. Different Governments have extended the powers of various Ministers to affect those duties. Education is a good example of that.
<P>
Legislation has occasionally been made over the heads of local government. That could be argued in the case of grant-maintained schools. However, no previous legislation is as pervasive, or as significant in its effect on the relationship between central Government and local government, as the Bill. The CCT legislation was about process and method, not output. It did not define output in the way that the Bill defines it.
<P>
Local people have the right to choose, through the ballot box, a bad local authority, just as they have the right to elect a good one. When people elect an authority that is less than desirable in the opinion of the Government of the day, it is not up to us to take that power away from local people. That is the nub of our arguments on the clause, and on the Bill as a whole. If a local authority's performance satisfies its constituents, a Secretary of State should not imperiously say that it is unsatisfactory to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The discussion on the constitutional position of local government in the context of the clause is interesting. One part of the equation is democratic legitimacy and the distribution of power from Parliament, the other is money. We must accept that Parliament has a legitimate interest in local authorities' management because so much local government money derives from Parliament. The clause is surprising because it contains no pretence of or gesture towards the legitimacy to which my hon. Friend referred.
<P>
Is the clause a longstop provision, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) suggested, or an intervention process, which will resemble the compulsory competitive tendering process, and lead to intervention after intervention? By removing a short and neat process of intervention, there may be recourse again and again to powers under the clause. The Minister must deal with that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> It may well be a longstop clause in the hands of responsible and decent Government. However, the Bill assumes that all Governments will be responsible and decent. Nuclear weapons were used earlier as an illustrative example. The danger of such weapons is that proliferation will put them in the hands of irresponsible people. Labour Members will regret their enthusiastic and forceful support for the Bill if, in future, an irresponsible Government uses the Act in a chilling way-to use a word that I used earlier.
<P>
The nub of the matter is that power is being transferred to a Secretary of State who will choose how to use his or her judgment without the necessary reference to local people. I am not comfortable with that. As a Conservative, I might be said to be naturally suspicious of the abuse of centralised power. Clearly, the Government are prepared to make such a judgment. They may think that they will never lose power. Perhaps an arrogance at the heart of their attitude makes them believe that affairs will always be conducted properly and therefore it is permissible to pass the matter into law.
<P>
Subsection (5) is perhaps the most worrying aspect of clause 13. It refers to the Secretary of State or a person nominated by him
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for a period specified in the direction or for so long as the Secretary of State considers appropriate".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That assumes that the transfer of local authority's power is in an area in which it is deemed not to have provided best value.
<P>
The Secretary of State's power may, therefore, be like the long Parliament-which at least was a Parliament-because, according to the Bill, it may continue for an unspecified period. The Secretary of State may exercise his power for a period that he deems appropriate, without requiring consent from the people who are receiving the local service concerned. Imagine the scene: the Secretary of State decides that another local authority should carry out such a service deemed not to be providing best value. Such an authority would not necessarily have to be a neighbouring local authority, but could be one anywhere in the country, although that
<P>
would be unlikely. It could also be a private sector organisation. The Secretary of State would make his decision without reference to local users and consumers.
<P>
That places enormous power in the hands of the Secretary of State and constitutes an attack on the theory of consent and the will of local people. Such power is undoubtedly more significant and pervasive than that in existing legislation on local government. I defy the Minister to suggest otherwise. When I used the word "pervasive"she assumed-quite understandably-that I meant "numerous", and said that there will be only 25 new powers. Of course, if we examine matters from a draftsman's perspective subsection (2) may contain only one power. It states that the Secretary of State may direct a local authority
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(a) to prepare or amend a performance plan;
(b) to follow specified procedures in relation to a performance plan;
(c) to carry out a review of its exercise of specified functions;
(d) to take such other action as in the Secretary of State's opinion is necessary or expedient to secure compliance".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That may be only one power in the eyes of a draftsman, or indeed, of Committee members. However, it will be received as four powers by local authorities and local people. Earlier, I referred to specific powers: if powers are broken down, there will be more than 50 particular powers in the Secretary of State's hands as a direct result of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I wonder whether the Bill reads like an emergency provisions Bill that would be issued in a war, when a Secretary of State needs to assume all kinds of powers? How often is it envisaged that the Secretary of State will exercise powers under clause 13?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. The powers are so allembracing that they will give the Secretary of State carte blanche to extend his influence in ways suggested-but not specified-in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suffering from amnesia? Does he not recall that there has always been a doctrine of ultra vires in local government? Although I have a great deal of sympathy with the context of legitimacy and power that has been outlined, no automatic right to override the doctrine of ultra vires is conferred on a party in local government simply because it has received a great many votes.
Indeed, the previous Government appointed reporting officers in local authorities who were specifically charged with a legal duty to report on circumstances in which a local authority appeared to act in an ultra vires manner. The previous Government also sent in commissioners to enforce the sale of council houses where local authorities, acting on their local mandate, had claimed that they had a right not to sell them. I believe that the hon. Gentleman is skating on thin ice in making the claims that he does.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I once wrote a paper on ultra vires powers. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that local authorities have always acted within a statutory framework
established by Parliament; that framework has been dynamic, as I said earlier.
However, the real test of how that statutory framework changes is to determine what discretion is left to local authorities to deliver services discretely, individually and innovatively, in line with the wishes and consent of local people.
<P>
I want diverse local government to achieve excellence in many different ways within that statutory framework. The architects of the Bill want uniform, vanilla flavour local government. The net effect of the provisions, and of this clause in particular, will be to decrease practical choice for local people. Local authorities, and parties within local authorities, will be unable to differentiate themselves one from another, as a result of the provision. That will be a further blow to local democracy, because it will minimise the ability of local people to make an informed genuine choice.
My hon. Friend the member for North Essex is right to say that national Government have a responsibility to control public spending. Local authorities absorb a significant proportion of the national Exchequer's expenditure. However, once that money has been given, we have traditionally trusted local government to carry out their functions within that statutory framework in line with the wishes of local people.
<P>
The real issue is how the provisions will work in practice. My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex and my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon have generously assumed that they are to act as a deterrent, a way of keeping local government in line for fear that the Secretary of State might use those draconian powers. They have been described as draconian throughout the Committee's proceedings by the way.
<P>
However, if the Secretary of State chose to be draconian, there would be very little that the local authority or the local people could do about it. The provisions seem to have the puritanism of a Cromwellian, authoritarian approach, without any of the style or character that we, as parliamentarians, would wish, with the spirit of the Cavaliers, for people.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> It is nice to follow my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes), even though I may not have quite the same attitude to the discussion. My approach is more akin to that of my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon. I should like to support the points that he has already made, and perhaps add to one or two of them.
<P>
When I read this clause, I was reminded of the schoolboy's retort to someone who threatens him, when he bravely turns to the bully and says, "You and whose army? "My right hon. Friend has said that part of the problem will be that an enormous army or work force will he required in order to get through all the procedure. My right hon. Friend has raised questions-which I am sure that the Minister will answer if she can, or not answer as normal-on costs and on where the manpower will come from. My right hon. Friend asked her to provide an example. He resisted continuing with Mongolia, but I should like to come closer to home. The Minister may wish to consider the example-her
 officials will be aware of it; they certainly were before the last election-of the London council of Barnet, or Barmy Barnet.
Barmy Barnet put its garbage service out to competitive tendering and, despite alternative suggestions, decided at the last minute to award the service to the in-house team. Yet an alternative highly competent contractor had put in a bid that would have saved about £1 million in comparison with the direct labour organisation. Section 13 was served-supported by the Minister-but nothing seems to have happened.
<P>
In addition to costing local people another £1 million, the council made a loss this financial year just short of £500,000-and a similar amount was lost in the previous financial year. Following the same trend, and despite section 13 notices, street cleaning made a loss of about £250,000 and the civil engineering service-a direct service organisation-lost another £500,000 and is now the subject of police inquiries.
The hon. Member for Southampton, Test referred to the procedure that would be followed through and it would be interesting to apply that lengthy procedure to Barnet. Under clause 13 an authority will have to draw up an action plan for improvement and deliver a specific level of improvement by a set date. I can imagine Barnet doing that. There would be stacks of papers and officials would sit around for days wading through hours of videos-I know because I have seen such a response to a section 13 notice.
<P>
By the set date, all the information would be available, but it would probably take about three months for officials to wade through it and come out at the other end with a decision. If brave, the Minister would react to the decision and force the authority to accept external management help-the next stage. From the comments of the hon. Member for Southampton, Test, it seems that external help could be some of the neighbours-perhaps Hackney or Haringey and the standard of service will continue at an all time low.
<P>
Of course the service could be required to be put out to competition. However, as the behaviour of Barnet in the past shows, that would be accepted but stitched-as it has been day after day. If it had not been stitched, there would not have been such losses because competitive tendering would have been carried out properly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend said that the service could have been put out to competitive tendering, but no provision for any such direction is made until we reach this part of the Bill. The Audit Commission can make a recommendation, or the inspector declare that it should have been done, but there is no direction for competitive tendering until we reach this sledgehammer clause. My hon Friend says that it could he put out to competitive tendering, but how does he know that it would work?
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I accept that competitive tendering is different from what is being envisaged under the clause which, as I understand it, provides for putting out services to competition. My hon Friend is right: they could be put out to competition by bringing in other local authorities. That issue was also touched on by the hon Member for Southampton, Test.
<P>
It is possible for a service to cease to be provided directly by the local authority-that specific local authority. In view of the reaction of Barnet and the subjective element, the Minister may well allow another local authority in-and in comes team Lambeth.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North) rose-
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Perhaps I should say team Southwark.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> The hon Gentleman makes an interesting case, but are not other powers available to deal with such matters as police investigations? There is already benchmarking on the sort of services that local authorities should provide. Is not one reason why the previous Government failed to deal with certain aspects of local government performance that it suited them to keep some local authorities as a whipping post?
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The hon Lady makes an interesting point. If those powers exist, why has it taken 18 months for nothing to happen? If she looks at the record of what I said at the beginning she will see that just before the election a section 13 notice was applied to the local authority so action had been taken. It took place extremely quickly. I was helped by the fact that many of the officials in the Department lived in the area and were aware of it exceptionally quickly. I hear the brave words but I do not believe that it will happen. I would love to hear some genuine answers to the questions of my right hon. Friend  the Minister for Skipton and Ripon to the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The clause brings to a head the muddle that the Government are in over local government. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings said, the problem is that local government is delegated certain functions by central Government. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex quite rightly pointed out, money is delegated, but how it is spent is decided by people with a democratic local mandate. The less money that is raised locally and spent on services and the more functions that are delegated from the centre, the more cumbersome it is. Mechanisms have to be created to square the circle.
<P>
The advantage of competitive tendering was that it was transparent and easy to understand. A local elector effectively voted for the party or the councillors offering the most efficient means of delivering the services. There was a contractual clarity to competitive tendering. The problem is that the Government made two conflicting commitments in the election. Many Labour Members who have been admirably silent-I have seen noisier cauliflowers made their careers in local government by hammering away at the evil of competitive tendering being sent down from on high by central Government.
<P>
Labour had to come up with something as well to keep the Exchequer happy: all the focus groups and opinion polls said that they would never be elected if they were profligate with public money, as Labour Governments were in the 1970s. There is an absolute clash. There is the commitment to the boys in local government to get rid of competitive tendering and come up with something better which would suit them and that sector of Labour support, but Labour also had to go after the new support, which wanted a prudent, central Government.
<P>
We therefore have this monster called best value which is totally woolly. We talked last week about the extraordinary structure of complex mechanisms to square the circle. It is in complete and utter contrast to what was said about local government in the election. The Minister was elected on the following manifesto. I mentioned it earlier but it is worth repeating. It reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Local decision-making should be less constrained by central government, and also be more accountable to local people."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She also said in one of our debates that responsibility to the public must be "open and accountable".
<P>
No one has yet mentioned Wales, which is worth touching upon. In the White Paper-[Interruption.] My hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings says that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales is not here. That is sad, but I am sure that this will be passed on. He may also have been involved in writing the White Paper which was quite clear. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Assembly will be required to have regard to the interests of local government in exercising its responsibilities for public bodies in Wales.
<P>
Through their partnership with the Assembly, Welsh local authorities will have a greater voice in the running of bodies that spend millions of pounds of taxpayers' money".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There was no hint of what would come up in clause 13. There was not a sniff that this extraordinary sledgehammer law would come in.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> During the referendum in Wales, specific assurances were given that powers would be transferred from Westminster to the Welsh Assembly and that local government powers would not be taken away from local authorities and given to the Welsh Assembly. But the Bill-because when we read Secretary of State we read National Assembly for Wales-gives the National Assembly for Wales the same powers as the Secretary of State will have over local authorities in England. That is effectively a threat to take powers away from local authorities, which is a direct breach of the Government's assurances during the Welsh referendum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> My hon. Friend is spot on. It brings me to my next point. The previous Government's abolition of the two-tier system in Wales was extremely popular. Unitary authorities have settled down well in Wales; there is clarity because only one authority delivers services. I live near north Wales; there was always great resentment of the Lubianka in Mold, the centre of Clwyd county council. There was no hint during the referendum campaign or during debates on the subject that there would be such a drastic transfer of powers to Cardiff, which is a very long way, timewise, from north Wales, as the referendum showed. There is a split in Wales between north and south and east and west.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I say to my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon that it is all very well to be able to impose such powers but it has certain implications. If by the diktat of the Secretary of State or the Assembly it can be decided that an authority is not performing correctly, that is an enabling laws just as Hitler made in the Reichstag in 1933. The problem is when there is a muddle, as there was in Stalingrad. How does one get out of such a muddle? There is no explanation of how the Secretary of State escapes. Once the Secretary of State has swept aside-[Interruption.] May I ask the Government Whip to shush, as I am trying to make a serious point? There is probably a new furniture catalogue available at the Post Office this morning which would keep him quiet and happy. He could go and buy the latest book by the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Clark).
<P>
We have no idea what happens to the local authority that is dramatically swept aside, how long the powers will be in force, and how the democratically elected local representatives can return to running the service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes: </b>Perhaps it would be useful if my hon. Friend were to ask the Minister to say what length of time will be involved and whether any particular powers are outside the remit of the clause, because that is not clear from the Bill. She must have a notional idea of what is intended. For example, would the Minister give social work functions or functions relating to statements for special needs children to the private sector? Will anything be ruled out or will the Secretary of State's powers apply to every local authority service?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson: </b>I reiterate what my hon. Friend said; I hope that the Minister will answer those questions because there is no clarification in the Bill.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</b> My hon. Friend has an interesting point. The hon. Member for Southampton, Test said earlier that comprehensive intervention powers as a last resort have been available to Ministers for some time. Apart from minor, specific matters, such as council house sales, the Conservative Government did not appoint commissioners, even in Lambeth where there was a financial collapse because we could not see how to get them out. A political penalty is involved in appointing an agent and no doubt in those days the Labour party would have objected vociferously to our sorting out Lambeth council. As my hon. Friend argued, the Secretary of State may never feel able politically to exercise the powers for fear that they will become the Government's Vietnam. The proposed powers will therefore become the white elephant of the Bill.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</b> My hon. Friend is testing the Government's historical knowledge. No one has yet mentioned the implications of section 250</B>(2) to (5) of the Local Government Act 1972, although it touches on cost, a matter raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon. The Local Government Act 1972 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"For the purpose of any such local inquiry, the person appointed to hold the inquiry"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
may be summonsed. Who is that person? Who will be involved and for how long? By what powers will that person's period of office be extended?
<P>
Let us consider cost. Section 250(4) of the Local Government Act 1972 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Where a Minister causes an inquiry to be held under this section, the costs incurred by him in relation to the inquiry . . . shall be paid by such local authority or party to the inquiry".</ul></font>
<P>
Subsection (5) states:
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
"The Minister causing an inquiry to be held under this section may make orders as to the costs of the parties at the inquiry and as to the parties by whom the costs are to be paid".
<P></ul></font>
Unless amendment No. 180 is accepted, the clause grants a Minister absolute right, without referring to anyone, to appoint an unknown person, who, as far as we know, has no qualifications, to take on a role for an indefinite period while the local authority bears the costs of the exercise.
<P>
I challenge those Labour Members who sit silently, day after day, to square that with their manifesto commitment, which I quote again:
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
"Local decision-making should be less constrained by central government, and . . . more accountable to local people."</ul></font>
 <P>
How can Labour Members sit in Committee and let the Bill go through? The clause is a disgrace, and I shall vote against it.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong: </b>We have had an interesting debate, which has revealed a range of views among Opposition Members.</B><P>
<P>
The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) talked about a muddle in the Bill. There was certainly a muddle on the Conservative Benches. The hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) and the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, who have ministerial experience took a different view from new Members and from the Conservative Front Bench.
<P>
Too often, because of political convenience, central government have stood by and watched local government shooting itself in the foot. The hon. Member for Mole Valley almost conceded that when he responded to a point from my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble). We are not prepared to stand by.
<P>
Local government is important. As the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon said, occasionally such terrible failures occur that a local authority does not have the wherewithall, commitment or will to put them right. That damns local government as a whole. Such conduct neglects the interests and aspirations of local citizens. I shall consider the nature of those failures later.
<P>
We could be cavalier, but I suspect that there are circumstances in which no member of the Committee would oppose intervention. In the past year, Liberal Democrat Members have asked if I could do anything about particularly dreadful failures of local authority services. They worry about the responsibility that citizens feel for a mistake. People do not want things to go wrong, none the less, it happens. People come to us because they want something to be done to put matters right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin: </b>I make no apology for the fact that Conservative Members have begun to explore ways in which we can reverse the centralisation of local government. Centralisation occurred under the Conservative Administration, but it is extraordinary that the Minister, who complained about over-centralisation when in opposition, has now jumped on the centralising bandwagon.</B><P>
<P>
When the hon. Lady was Opposition spokesman, how many times did she press a Minister in the Conservative Government to intervene in a failing local authority?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman should read Hansard, from which  he will see that I did so at length on several occasions. Indeed, we had an Opposition day debate to beg the Government to intervene on one occasion. They refused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On one occasion.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> On one occasion there was an Opposition day. I have not yet noticed the Opposition devoting any of their time to local government. I wait with interest for them to do so. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Labour party  debated the issue of best value fully before the general election. Its outline, in one of our Opposition papers, was put to our party conference in 1994 or 1995 and was approved unanimously.  The manifesto deals at length with our plans for best value and makes it clear that we are not prepared to accept failure at levels that put people at risk or cause them serious concern about their future. We will not stand idly by while that happens.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I suspect that the Minister's last  few remarks were directed at those sitting behind her, as a reminder that they were elected on a particular platform and must not wobble on any of the votes on amendments. I am sure that that, and the presence of a senior Government Whip, has terrified the hon. Members in question.
<P>
The Minister said that she had received representations from Liberal Democrat Members of Parliament begging her to intervene in local authorities where things were going wrong. Perhaps she would give an example. I suspect that she may be referring to something going wrong in a children's home run by social services, for example. Can not inspection powers, criminal proceedings and other measures already be invoked in those circumstances? Those are outside the matters covered by the Bill, which is about the duty of best value.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I will come to that later. The hon. Lady is right, but if she were to consult former Ministers, including those who were at the Dept of Health, she would find that they considered their powers to be inadequate. They felt that they did not have the powers to intervene-[Interruption.] The hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) says from a sedentary position that this is not the place to tackle that issue. We want to ensure that a coherent means of intervention is available across local government. We are trying to ensure compatibility and complementarity between the different regimes. Best value covers all services. The hon. Lady may not like that, but it is the truth.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin rose-</B><P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am in a little difficulty, because most Opposition Members did not mention amendments when they spoke, but for the record I need to give the Government's response to each of the amendments that have been tabled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister is trying to create a myth of consistency between her stance in Government and what her party did in Opposition. She cannot point out a single occasion when she pressed the Government with the argument that they needed more powers to intervene in local government.  At no point was there any suggestion from the then Opposition that the Secretary of State did not have sufficient power to intervene in local government. If my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon had tried to intervene, in the way that the Secretary of State now proposes, the Labour Members would have erupted in defence of local government-an uproar no doubt supported by the Local Government Association. The LGA and those in local government who support the Bill need to look into their hearts to consider what they are agreeing to. There is much hypocrisy outside the Committee on the matter.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> All I would say to the hon. Gentleman is that he doth protest too much. I know that he is diligent, but he did not hear every speech that I made before the election and I can tell him that those in local government soon got used to me being a blunt and straightforward friend. I have never shirked from putting my view and what I am saying today is no different from what I said when I was the Opposition spokesperson on local government. I am sorry if that disappoints the hon. Gentleman-aspects of local government were also disappointed by it-but it is the truth.
<P>
The amendment would remove the disscretion of the Secretary of State or the Welsh Assembly to determine when a best value authority is failing to comply with the requirements of part I of the Bill, and replace that with a requirement that clause 13 will apply only in cases where an inspection report has not been approved by a full meeting of the authority and the Audit Commission. Requiring a failure to secure best value to be defined by an inspection report would reduce the number and type of cases in which the Secretary of State could legitimately intervene.
<P>
The decision that an authority is failing to meet best value is a matter of judgment and should remain with the Secretary of State, especially as he or she will be responsible for the exercise of powers to tackle such failure. The Government recognise that audit and inspection reports will provide a key input to that decision and will be the main source of evidence for intervention in the majority of cases. That is why the clause makes provision to allow authorities to make representations about the representations about the report, as a result of which intervention is proposed under subsection (6)(a).
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Is the Minister saying that local consultation is less important than the Secretary of State's judgment?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The Secretary of State will of course take into account the role played by local consultation in developing the performance plan, but will also examine whether that consultation has been followed in the authority's performance of its duties. The review and the performance plan are different: one is part of a process that leads to action. The Secretary of State, unlike local citizens during the consultation process, will be in a position to consider all the facts.
<P>
In some cases, important evidence may emerge from other sources and may be sufficient to warrant the use of intervention powers. For example, public complaints may reveal evidence of serious health and safety, risks to the public which may need to be investigated immedilately. By requiring intervention to be based solely on an inspection report, the Secretary of State would lose the discretion to act to address such serious failures. The discretion to determine when the best value has been breached should remain with the Secretary of State, who will judge when it is appropriate to issue a direction and take action. In deciding what action is appropriate, his judgments need to be informed by his prior definition of the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Whenever the Minister resorts to examples, the gets interesting. She now says that, under the Bill, the Secretary of State will suddenly be required to take action on health and safety matters.
<P>
The Health and Safety Executive, health and safety legislation, powers of inspection and many regulatory bodies exist, yet she is justifying the fast-track procedure on health and safety grounds. That is completely inconsistent.
<P>
If something seriously dangerous is going on in a local authority, Ministers have powers to act under other legislation and, therefore, the Secretary of State will not need to use the clause to intervene in a health and safety matter. Now come on, let the Minister give the Committee a more realistic example of when the fast-track procedure might be required.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I will come to the fast-track procedure as I deal with the amendments. The hon. Gentleman is right; there are other statutory powers. The Committee might like to know that they are listed in annex B of the draft protocol. That reinforces what I have been saying: the powers are complementary and, through the protocol, we will ensure that they are used coherently. However, those statutory powers do not cover every eventuality, and we want to ensure that we have the ability to do so.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Another helpful suggestion: perhaps the Minister would like to consider the possibility of taking action on Barnet, where the health and safety issue is that the bins are not being collected properly, the rubbish is on the streets and street cleaning has not been sorted out. Barnet has chosen a contract that cost local people £1 million more than a competent contractor would have charged, over and above which there is an expenditure of another £500,000. The Minister could have acted by now. Why has she not? What would she do under the clause with that authority? I have given her the timings in that case.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I will not put myself in jeopardy of judicial review, or whatever, by rising to the hon. Gentleman's bait. Actions have been taken under current law, and I shall not make flippant comments or respond to the hon. Gentleman's provocation in that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin rose-</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister has said that she is not giving way.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Amendment No. 179 would remove the provision that the Secretary of State, or the National Assembly for Wales, needs to he satisfied that a best value authority is failing to comply with the requirements of part I of the Bill before exercising intervention powers under clause 13.
<P>
By suggesting that the decision to intervene is purely a matter of fact and not partly a matter of judgment, the amendment implies that intervention should be based only on a matter of fact, such as an audit or inspection report-but it fails to make it clear exactly what criteria or matters of fact would be used to establish that situation.
<P>
Although in most cases intervention will be based on an audit or inspection report, in some cases evidence of a failure to secure best value might emerge from other sources. In whatever way an intervention is triggered, the Government are committed to acting on clear evidence. That is key principle of the protocol.
<P>
Evidence might emerge from public complaints that draw attention to health and safety risks to individuals or vulnerable groups. In those cases, it is essential that the Secretary of State, or the Welsh Assembly, retains the discretion to judge when a breach of best value has occurred to enable him to issue a direction and take action immediately.
<P>
A recent case was brought to the attention of the House by my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington North (Ms Buck). She told the House how the council in her constituency has misled the Audit Commission on performance indicators for examining and inspecting food outlets.
<P>
Citizens may have been put at risk. Had outbreaks of food poisoning occurred as a result, that would have indicated failure and rapid intervention would have been necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Lady has given another interesting example demonstrating the danger of giving such wide powers to the Secretary of State. She chose an example of a complaint brought to her by one of her hon. Friends concerning a Conservative local authority.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I did not say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Well, the hon. Lady did not say exactly that, but that was the implication of her remarks. Will she assure the Committee that the power will be used in an even-handed way? Will the Secretary of State be subject to judicial review for failing to intervene, when doing so might prove embarrassing in cases in which his or her own party is controlling the authority concerned?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I cannot give instances of when a Secretary of State will be subject-
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Lady just did.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No, I did not. In particular circumstances, the Secretary of State will be subject to judicial review. However, that is a matter for those seeking such a review. In all circumstances, the Secretary of State must he able to demonstrate that he or she is acting fairly and within the terms of the Act. Our actions demonstrate that we have not shown political bias in terms of the powers that we have taken and used.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Were a Conservative Government introducing the Bill, the hon. Lady, her colleagues and local government would be screaming that it is a subjective measure. How, therefore, does she respond to local authorities, who believe that the Bill is subjective?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, the powers in subsection (2) are similar to those that he and his right hon. and hon. Friends had under legislation for compulsory competitive tendering. In those days, there was no protocol for local government and no memorandum of understanding with other authorities about how such powers were to be exercised. Powers were included in legislation without tempering or mediation with local government about their use. Now, however, we are ensuring that we engage local government in discussion by means of the protocol, a draft of which has been circulated to Committee members.
<P>
It is important that the discretion to determine when best value has been breached remains with the Secretary of State. I hope therefore hope that amendment No. 179 will be withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment No. 153 would remove clause 13 (2)(d), thereby depriving the Secretary of State of the ability to secure substantive action by the authority, short of intervening himself directly under clause 13(5). The amendment would severely limit the Secretary of State's ability to intervene effectively so as to address failure in the delivery of services.
<P>
That point has been missed in earlier debates. At every step of the way, local authorities have an opportunity to take hold of the problem and address the failure that is evident from reports or through other means. At every step, local authorities had the opportunity to deal with those problems-on their own, with the support of the improvement and development agency of the LGA or through other means.
<P>
Subsections (2) or (5) of clause 13 will be necessary only if an authority simply fails to address the problem. The amendment would prevent the Secretary of State making sure that the authority addresses the problem in the way that he directs. It is important to leave that power in place; otherwise the only option available to the Secretary of State would direct intervention under subsection (5).
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The Minister will know that the amendment was tabled to cover the possibility of us not being able to remove the Secretary of State's power to take direct action. Removing clause 13 altogether would be the best route.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that it is still Labour party policy that local government elections should be held annually? I do not support that proposition, but if it did happen, local electors would more frequently be able to say that they were not happy with the way in which local services were being run. That would make it even less necessary for the Secretary of State to take such a power.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The White Paper makes it clear that we want more frequent elections. The White Paper also sets out arrangements for two-tier authorities, because annual elections in each tier at the same time would clearly not be appropriate. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We cannot have a separate meeting going on while the Committee is sitting.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I do have sympathy with hon. Members; they are trying to work things out. We must be generous.
<P>
The reality is that the legislation is not yet ready. I happen to agree with the hon. Member for Taunton that annual elections would give local people a better opportunity to say, "You promised us one thing, but you are delivering things differently and we want to put a stop to it."
<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton prayed in aid elections as a way of deciding whether a service is working well. Perhaps she forgets that some people have the opportunity to vote in local elections only once every four years, unless there is a serious failure in the first year following an election, which means that they usually have to wait an awfully long time before being able to say that they are not happy with local services or that things are not working properly. Local government has different tiers and different cycles of elections, and I confess that we do not have the ideal, with unitary authorities and more frequent elections. None the less, we must try to ensure that local people have that high quality of service.
<P>
By deleting subsection (5), amendment No. 96 would remove the important powers provided to the Secretary of State or the Welsh Assembly. If there is serious or persistent failure, the Secretary of State may need to intervene in the internal management of an authority and take over a specific function if the authority is unable or unwilling to make the necessary improvements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am seeking to respond to points raised earlier. The hon. Gentleman may wish to wait until I have done so.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon raised several questions on the subject. The use of the powers provided under clause 13 was not entered into lightly; it has been the subject of serious discussion over many months, if not years.
<P>
Subsection (2) contains provisions for relatively minor intervention right through to radical intervention. It provides the Secretary of State with powers to direct an authority to take action to secure compliance with part I of the Bill. That includes, for example, requiring an authority to prepare or amend a performance plan, or follow specified procedures in relation to a plan. We anticipate that in most cases these powers would be used to address less substantive failures on an authority's behalf, and that intervention would be of short duration.
<P>
The choice of measure and communication with the authority in the LGA would be conducted in accordance with the protocol, of which the Committee has a draft. Where necessary, tougher action would be taken. Responsibility for the function would rest with the authority but it might have to comply with a wide range of directions as to how the function is carried out, including, for example, requiring an authority to contract with a third party for the provision of a service. This is a wide provision but it mirrors the sort of action that Ministers in the previous Administration were empowered to take under current legislation.
<P>
The powers in subsection (5) would enable the Secretary of State to intervene directly in a failing authority or to nominate someone to do so on his behalf. This includes taking over responsibility for exercising a function on behalf of the authority and for intervening in an authority's internal management. It is envisaged that the option would be exercised only rarely, as the hon. Member for Skipton and Ripton suggested, and often only after options in clause 13(2) had been fully explored.
<P>
Clause 13(5) may be used to address more substantive failures, including serious and long-term systemic failure, where an authority has conspicuously failed to act despite having had the 
opportunity to do so. Intervention using these powers will generally be over a much longer time scale, although it need not always be. This more radical form of intervention requires the Secretary of State to take over the authority's function, in keeping with the commitment in the White Paper to transfer responsibility to another authority or third party in case of serious service failure. Where responsibility is taken from an authority, it is right for the Secretary of State initially to accept responsibility for the function, and to decide how it should best be discharged. In most cases-we expect only a small number-the function will be undertaken by a nominee. Even then, the Secretary of State will continue to be responsible for his nominee's actions.

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I was about to turn to the question of who will pay for intervention. I give way first to the hon. Member for Taunton.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The Minister prayed in aid previous intervention powers of Secretaries of State and Ministers. Into the management or delivery of which services did previous Secretaries of State have the power to intervene?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The Act to which subsection (2) relates introduced compulsory competitive tendering, and therefore covered a narrow range of services. Other powers in other Acts have, as I said, occasionally been found wanting, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I am grateful to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am not the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Perhaps the aspiring Secretary of State.-[Interruption.] Yes, I suppose that is comical.
<P>
I have a specific question for the Minister, who has failed to answer specific questions about police authorities before. How would this apply to the police authorities? She hangs her head in-
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Despair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Yes, despair. I find it hard to understand why she has consistently failed to answer questions about police authorities when the clause applies to them. The Bill certainly does not state that it does not. Which authority would assume power if a police authority were found to be wanting in this respect? Would it be another police authority or would it be a private security agency? Those are the only two feasible options. If it was another police authority in a rural area, how could that practically be done?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I know of the hon. Gentleman's interest in police authorities. The police authority is not the same as the chief constable. The powers of intervention are therefore different. The Home Secretary has the power of intervention in relation to the activities of the chief constable and that will remain. The hon. Gentleman was told earlier that the police authorities association will be part of the discussions on the protocol. it will therefore be party to the protocol which will govern the nature of the intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister said that, in exceptional circumstances, an intervention could be quite long. If that were for a major department such as a housing or social services department, the people who were administering that function would have nothing to do if it was taken over. In practice, in those circumstances, is not an intervention likely to be permanent? It will not be practical for that function to revert to a local authority if it must then recruit and set up a division in order to resume that responsibility. Should not we in practice be talking about that and could not the hon. Lady forget the problem of the disengagement?

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Minister replies, can I remind hon. Members that the House sits at 11.30 this morning and it is up to the usual channels to determine how and whether to release hon. Members who wish to attend Speaker's prayers.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman is aware that other people will be able to come in to run a service in a number of ways. That does not necessarily mean that the whole work force will be replaced. New management may come in from another organisation to make sure that the work force is directed and managed more effectively. Intervention may take place in a range of ways but the whole work force may need to be replaced, and that would have to be dealt with.
<P>
The main reasons why that would happen would be, for example, if it became clear that children's services were totally infiltrated by paedophiles at both management and care level. In such circumstances no one here would want anything but immediate, fast-track intervention with new people being brought in.
<P>
But that would be an extreme; in most cases, new management would ensure that they had capacity within the existing work force so that they were better prepared to take back the service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> We can agree on that. We have all agreed on the need for stability, particularly in the care of children. In the exceptional circumstances to which the Minister referred, one could say that in practice an externalisation-the notes refer to an externalisation as an example-would tend to be permanent.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am not even prepared to concede that. I can see that that would be-
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is embarrassing.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No, it is not. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon is trying to make a serious point. It is a serious matter, and not one for party political banter.
<P>
In those difficult circumstances, there would need to be a new way of tackling the service. In all circumstances, management of existing personnel would be necessary for the exit strategy, to enable the investigation to establish who was innocent and therefore capable of being re-employed, either within that organisation or elsewhere. That would have to be part of the process. I expect that as much of the infrastructure and as many of the staff as possible would normally be used, whatever the nature of the intervention. Obviously, that would depend on the diagnosis and on the nature of the problem. We cannot run away from the fact that we are learning a lot more about what can go wrong, and there is not an easy answer. It is irresponsible to say that we should wait until the next election before we can properly tackle the issue.
<P>
The powers would be used only in extreme circumstances, but I do not believe that any member of the Committee can now say that those circumstances are impossible. We are trying to envisage the worst that might happen, and ascertain whether we have the powers to act to protect people. I can tell the hon. Member for 
Taunton, who was anxious about the matter, that Ministers in the Department of Health are not confident that their current powers would enable them to act in the way that we are discussing.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I am not convinced that existing powers do not enable the Secretary of State to act in cases where vulnerable people are at risk of being abused. I know that the Minister was trying to make a serious point, but the picture that she painted of the entire management structure of the social services department and all the staff in the children's home being paedophiles is as likely as the Secretary of State being a paedophile.
What would happen if that were so? A Bill on best value is not the right place to extend those powers, if the Minister is trying to address those serious cases where people's health and safety is at risk.
<P>
I should like to move on to the issue of temporary interventions. We have discussed joint partnership and partnership working, and circumstances where local authorities sometimes have horizontal work across different departments, for example in services for the under-eights. We have also discussed the role of local authorities with, for example, primary care groups, where housing and social services are also involved with delivering the health agenda. How would the Minister see such partnerships and cross-departmental work being able to carry on effectively if a temporary intervention had been made by the Secretary of State to send someone else in to run a group of local authority services that were closely involved with those outside agencies?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Lady raises an interesting issue. Such a partnership could not be developed in the event of the failure of that particular aspect of the service involved in the partnership, or in cross-cutting working, which would be a matter of great anxiety to the others involved. Let us suppose that the others involved were unable to secure active cooperation on that part of the service to work to turn it around-which, for all the provisions that we have discussed so far, the authority will have had the opportunity to do. In such circumstances, the partners would be pleased that action would be taken to ensure that their contribution was not also deemed a failure merely because their partner, whether social services or another department, was not active and engaged.
<P>
One of the reasons why the powers are as wide as they are is that it may not be appropriate to take over the entire service, perhaps because only a part of it is failing, time and time again, and no one is committed to turning it around. The powers will enable the Secretary of State to intervene in only a part of a service. Moreover, the power would not always be used to take over the service, so that point is rather a red herring. The powers of intervention will not always mean that the Secretary of State will impose an alternative means of running the service.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon was worried about exit strategies. It is important that authorities are given a clear indication of how intervention powers will be exercised, which should include how intervention will finish and how normal activity will resume. We are therefore developing the protocol, to ensure that intervention is consistent and fair. I hope that that addresses his anxieties.
<P>
The protocol states that the Secretary of State will review in consultation with the best value authority at suitable intervals whether the authority could resume direct provision of a function or responsibility for purchasing a function in relevant cases. Clause 13 (5) provides that a specified function of the authority shall be exercised by the Secretary of State, or a person nominated by him, for a period specified in the direction, that is to say, for as long as the Secretary of State considers appropriate. Clearly, that is an important issue. It is also 
important that we discuss the matter with those in local government and gain their confidence. That is what the protocol is designed to do.
<P>
Hon. Members have asked who will pay for the intervention. We expect it to pay for itself. Frequently, failures occur because people have not exercised financial and other controls. Failure to address problems frequently results from the absence of such involvement and control. The presumption is that the costs of putting right a failure, serious or otherwise, should be met from an authority's own budget. Cries might come from authorities that have managed their budgets and services well if failing services were suddenly to receive an extra allocation of money. We have considered that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Is the negotiation of the contract for the performance of a service put out to another authority by the direction of the Secretary of State a function of the Secretary of State or of the local authority?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am not sure. I shall have to come back to the hon Gentleman. I believe that it would be for the Secretary of State, but I am not sure. The protocol deals with that, but I cannot remember at the moment. I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman on that.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The hon. Lady talks of extra expenditure landing on the local authority. Will that be reflected in the SSA, and will it be within or without a cap if a cap is to be applied?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman keeps trying to be helpful by referring to other legislation. As I have just said, we do not believe that the proposal should lead to additional expenditure. In fact, it ought to be a means of saving expenditure rather than increasing it, because the money, rather than being badly spent, will ensure that the service is successful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No. I want to make progress.
<P>
It is important that I speak to the Government amendments, as I have not dealt with them or amendment No. 153. That amendment would remove clause 13 (2) (d) , therefore depriving the Secretary of State of the ability to secure-[Interruption.] Have I done that amendment? I am sorry.
<P>
By deleting clause 13(5)-[Hon. Members: "You have done that one too."] I am sorry.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 97 and 181 would make any direction under clause 13 conditional on a statutory instrument. Amendment No. 154 is similar but requires instead the approval of the Select Committee. Those proposals would impose unacceptable constraints on the ability of the Secretary of State to exercise the powers of intervention. From the previous debate, I hope that hon. Members will know why I think that that would cause unnecessary and sometimes dangerous delays.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I know that the word "helpful"keeps coming up, but the amendments were helpful. We are aware that local government sees the approach as subjective, and the amendments would to some degree overcome that. Some of the Committees that scrutinise secondary legislation sit for only an hour and a half.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman is trying to be helpful, but he did not find such assistance helpful when he had responsibility for similar powers of intervention. Therefore, I take his helpfulness with a pinch of salt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It would not be a huge encumbrance if the power was to be used relatively rarely. The hon. Lady has not given an idea of how often she expects the intervention power to be used under the clause. Will she do so? If she is to use it hundreds of times, as it has been used under compulsory competitive tendering, it would be an encumbrance.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> There are two aspects to the clause. As the Member for North Essex knows, the first part of the clause reflects the legislation that his Government introduced in relation to powers of intervention under CCT. The second part is direct intervention that the Secretary of State could take, and I have said that I would imagine that that would be used exceptionally rarely.
<P>
I hope that the best value regime will give local government much more responsibility for its own services, so clause 13(2) should not have to be used as often as CCT. However, I do not have a crystal ball. I do not enter into guessing games. The hon. Gentleman about his family background, but I come from a background in which gambling was simply not on the agenda, so I will not join him in considering stakes.
<P>
Amendment No. 180 would delete clause 13 (4) and would apply subsections (2) to (5) of section 250 of the Local Govt Act 1972 to a local inquiry that the Secretary of State directs to be held under clause 13. Its purpose is to ensure that local inquiries conducted on the request of the Secretary of State are consistent-
