Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Angela Eagle):
						</b> Sir
Nicholas, I shall try to deal with new clause 4 and clause 13 in
responding to what I thought was an interesting and revealing debate.
The new clause, tabled by the hon. Member for Dundee, East, is in a
state of evolution, as he was honest enough to admit when speaking to
it. Finance Bills have a history of such new clauses, and I compliment
him on the welcome way in which he has evolved his. I hope to persuade
him, however, that although a fuel duty regulator might appear
superficially attractive&#151;I share his concerns about the cost
implications, the pressures that high oil prices bring to bear on all
drivers and the clear issue with hauliers&#151;unfortunately, his
approach, which he has been dutifully evolving over the years, has some
major flaws.</div>
					<a name="0805163000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right
hon. Friend the Chancellor demonstrated in the Budget that we are
sensitive to the issues of high nominal petrol costs. Again, the hon.
Gentleman was generous enough to point out that oil prices can be
incredibly volatile. Since 1997, when the Government first took office,
the price of a barrel of oil has continued to rise, but fuel duty has
fallen&#151;in real, not nominal, terms. Hon. Members on both sides
of the Committee must bear in mind that there is no obvious connection
between the price of oil in the barrel&#151;let alone at the
pumps&#151;and the fuel duty level. To some extent, his idea for a
fuel duty regulator, which he has brought before the Committee, tends
to assume that there is such a connection.</div>
					<a name="0805163000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0805163000333"></a>
							<b class="B">Justine
Greening</b> (Putney) (Con): I just wanted to correct the
Minister. Just before we adjourned after the morning sitting, she said
that I had supported the new clause, but in fact I said that we did
not. I said that we supported clause 13. I wanted to make that
absolutely clear, before she
continued.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805163000334"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> I thank the hon. Lady for that
correction. In her remarks earlier, it sounded as if she was supporting
the new clause, which is why I asked her whether she supported the
concept of a fuel duty regulator. If that were so, it would be an
interesting development in Conservative policy. I now see, from her
intervention, that the Conservative party does not support the use of a
fuel duty regulator, and she and I may be able to agree on a reason for
that, as my remarks progress. There are some pretty difficult practical
and design issues with the idea set out in new clause
4.</div>

Eagle:
						</b> My pleasure.</div>
					<a name="0805163000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth putting into
perspective the current duty rates on oil in the UK. As I was saying
earlier, the graph that is available demonstrates that those are now 16
per cent. lower in real terms than they were in 1999, when the Prime
Minister abolished the fuel duty escalator. The current fuel duty rate
is 50.35p per litre. Had fuel duty gone up in line with inflation since
1999, the rate would be 61p per litre, and if it had gone up in line
with the 3 per cent. escalator that we inherited from the Opposition,
as it did prior to 1999, it would now be 79p per litre&#151;close to
30p per litre more than it is
now.</div>
					<a name="0805163000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The overall cost
of motoring has also fallen by 13 per cent. in real terms since
1999. There is a difference, in debate on statistics, between the real
and nominal prices of motoring and fuel. The high nominal prices at the
moment are clearly being felt in the pockets of the constituents of the
hon. Member for Dundee, East, and he is doing the best he can for them,
by way of his new clause, in response to that. We are all aware of the
pressures and difficulties that the current high nominal oil prices
present to our constituents.</div>
					<a name="0805163000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to consider the
broader taxation picture. It is true that fuel duty rates are lower in
other European Union countries, but our overall GDP to tax ratio is
below the EU 19 average and other countries with lower fuel duty rates,
such as Italy, France and Austria often have higher overall tax
burdens, so there is an element of swings and roundabouts. EU
regulations mean that the UK must charge VAT on fuel. However, the UK
has one of the lowest VAT rates of any EU country.</div>
					<a name="0805163000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">To come to the
nub of the new clause, I want to refer to the intervention by my hon.
Friend the Member for South Derbyshire, which was so completely to the
point that it should form the cornerstone of any response to the
provision. I compliment him on the astuteness of what he said. He
questioned the concept of the existence of a VAT windfall, for exactly
the right reasons. The new clause assumes a VAT windfall, caused by
high fuel duty prices, that increases receipts to the Treasury. That is
rarely the case, as my hon. Friend pointed out. As fuel duty is a fixed
rate, reduced fuel sales lead to reduced fuel duty receipts. In
addition, the so-called VAT windfall does not materialise. In the
context of the wider economy, people tend to have a fixed amount to
spend. Therefore, if they have to spend more on one commodity they tend
to spend less on others, leaving the overall level of VAT receipts
largely unchanged. I might even say that the VAT windfall from higher
nominal fuel prices is a myth. Part of the basis of the new clause is
that that windfall exists and can be recycled, to give support to
hauliers and those particularly affected by high nominal fuel prices.
It is also important to remember that VAT-registered businesses are
liable to reclaim the VAT that they incur when buying fuel for business
purposes, so the VAT paid at the pump should make no difference to
their overall tax burden.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>
					<a name="0805163000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reducing duty
would not guarantee a reduction in the fuel price at the pump. My hon.
Friend the Member for Broxtowe pointed out that there are other reasons
for the record levels of oil prices, none of which are to do with
levels of fuel duty or taxation policy in the UK. He is right that the
only way to deal with that is globally. My right hon. Friends the Prime
Minister and the Chancellor are attempting to do that in the G7 and
other international bodies, where work is going on to see whether the
high oil prices caused by different global events can be reduced. Since
those wider VAT effects can be taken into account, the lost fuel duty
revenues are likely to outweigh any extra VAT, given that there is no
windfall. As a result, the new clause, although it is presented as
revenue neutral, would be likely to lead to significant revenue losses
for the Exchequer. It would also lead to massive volatility in
receipts.</div>
					<a name="0805163000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
part of the new clause would introduce a fuel duty reduction for
sparsely populated areas. The Government recognise that fuel prices
have risen in recent months to high nominal rates, and that people who
have fewer alternatives to driving are particularly affected. However,
while fuel prices have increased greatly over the past year, duty rates
have not risen by the same amount. It is not feasible or appropriate to
set a different duty rate for rural areas because it is unclear how
those sparsely populated areas would be defined. There is agreement on
that between the Government and the main Opposition party. The point
was made when we debated the Bill in the Committee of the whole House.
It is a difficult
issue.</div>
					<a name="0805163000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is recognised that fuel prices are higher in some areas, for example
the Western Isles and the Shetland Isles, but in other parts of the
highlands they are closer to the national average. Scotland has lower
average petrol prices than the rest of the UK. There are problems in
particular areas, but it would be difficult to define and ring-fence
such an area for the purposes sought by the new clause. Creating an
exemption would be likely to involve drawing a line between areas with
similar prices and therefore creating an incentive&#151;rather like
the Irish border incentive&#151;for people to cross the border and
fill up in lower duty areas. That would distort the market. It would
also be difficult to ensure compliance, and the potential for fraud
should be
obvious.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): The point that the Exchequer
Secretary made about cross-border shopping between Northern Ireland and
the Republic of Ireland may apply less in this case, because the cost
of going to a sparsely populated area to fill up the car would tend to
mitigate against the incentive of cheaper
fuel.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805163000341"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> The experience of having
differential duties so close to each other is the opposite of what the
hon. Gentleman suggests. Perhaps he is being slightly naïve.
Even if it were feasible to ring-fence and define areas in an
appropriate way, we would need to receive a derogation from the EU
energy-using products directive. There is certainly no guarantee that
we would be successful. France holds a derogation, but it is not
directly comparable, because in France the authority to set excise
duties has been devolved to regional government.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 247</div>
					<a name="0805163000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final part of the new clause
would introduce a fuel duty regulator solely for road haulage
operators. The Government recognise the road haulage industry&#146;s
concerns over the current high nominal cost of fuel and we understand
the pressure that that puts on the industry. But requests for reduced
duty rates for road haulage operators are often associated with the
relative competitiveness of the industry compared with foreign
operators which can fill up their fleet from abroad, due to lower fuel
prices in other EU member states.</div>
					<a name="0805163000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Studies, including one by the
road haulage industry task group, have shown that duty differentials in
many cases are offset by other costs such as lower labour and
employment costs. Overall, operating costs in the UK are quite similar
to those in countries such as Germany, Italy, Belgium and the
Netherlands. A scheme such as the hon. Member for Dundee, East has
suggested would require the introduction of an administrative system
with potentially high costs. Any system would create significant
compliance and fraud risks and consideration must be given to the
incentive for fuel efficiency that the receipt of the reduced rate
would bring, again a point admirably brought out by my hon. Friend the
Member for
Broxtowe.</div>
					<a name="0805163000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have continued to support the industry through other policy
measures which are more achievable such as freezes to HGV excise duty
rates, the reduced pollution certificate scheme and significant funding
for enforcement to deal with some of the foreign competition points. I
know that the road haulage industry is very supportive of the
significant extra amounts of money that the Government have been able
to bring to bear on enforcement.</div>
					<a name="0805163000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">While the
Government accept that rising fuel prices are having an impact on
families, we do not believe that the new clause provides a workable or
sensible answer. We will continue to take steps to reduce higher oil
prices through the international action that I mentioned earlier,
working through the G7, to stabilise the volatility of the oil market.
Those factors were taken into account by the Chancellor when we made
the decision, set out in clause 13, to defer the planned fuel duty
increase at the Budget, and any further steps at this stage would be
counter-productive. While asking the Committee to agree that the clause
should stand part of the Bill, I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press
his new clause to a vote.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805163000342"></a>Stewart
Hosie:
						</b> Before we adjourned, the hon. Member for Broxtowe
made a number of points. He said that prices can rise and spike because
of political instability. One of the purposes of the new clause is to
smooth out those spikes. He also asked what would happen if oil prices
fell. Given that most of his hon. Friends are talking about peak oil
and the industry is talking about $150 to $200 a barrel, that should be
less of a concern. However, this is not about tempering the way the
market rises in general, but about moving the spikes that cause
particular
difficulties.</div>
					<a name="0805163000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that there was no obvious connection between the barrel
price and the price at the pump. That is absolutely correct. That is
why part of the new clause calls for a forecast of the fuel duty and
VAT yield. I have used the barrel price as a trigger 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>point. That might need to be finessed and I will come back to that. She
also said that she shared the concerns, particularly those of hauliers.
I welcome that. In her various criticisms of the new clause, she said
that an expensive administrative system would have to be introduced if
we were to deal specifically with hauliers. As we have the licensing
scheme&#151;the standard, the restricted and the standard
international licence&#151;and one cannot be a haulier without a
licence, I suspect that the cost of an administrative scheme for
hauliers might be rather less than she would expect. The question would
be: how much of a rebate would be calculated, and on what basis? Fining
the haulier and paying that rebate back might be rather
straightforward.</div>
					<a name="0805163000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have heard the comments from the various parties and from the
Ministers. I recognise that implementing the measure generally might be
tricky and that implementing it in remote rural areas, although it is
vital, does have its difficulties. Although I may wish to return to the
issues in a more refined form in specific relation to hauliers at a
later time, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<a name="0805163000344"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con):
Sir Nicholas, I welcome you to the Chair this
afternoon. I shall begin my brief remarks on clause 14 and schedule 6
on a note of consensus. I, too, agree with the Exchequer Secretary that
it is a pity that the weather is so gloomy on the first day of the Test
series, although I recall that the weather in the fine county of
Cheshire yesterday was glorious.</div>
					<a name="0805163000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 14 and
schedule 6 relate to the taxation of aviation gasoline, of the fuel
used for private pleasure flying and of the fuel used in private
pleasure craft. There are two areas that I would like to ask the
Minister about. First, we recognise that the Government&#146;s hand
has been forced in the case of private pleasure flying, by the fact
that various derogations held with the EU have not been extended. The
Government, particularly with red diesel for private pleasure craft,
sought to extend that derogation, and it is regrettable that that has
not been
achieved.</div>
					<a name="0805163000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have adopted a free-standing duty rate for avgas, which
appears to be widely welcomed by the industry. The rate is 31.03p per
litre and I would be grateful to know if that was the minimum level
allowed under EU rules. I know also that representations were made that
there should be exemptions, for flying emergency 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>vehicles, for example, and that the Government&#146;s position is
somewhat restricted. In particular, will air ambulances pay the duty?
Will vintage aircraft be exempt? There are still aircraft from the
second world war flying. Will flight training be exempt? I would be
grateful to know the Government&#146;s position on those.</div>
					<a name="0805163000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government are consulting on
aviation duty. The proposals set out in schedule 6 and clause 14 will
come into effect on 1 November this year, but new aviation duty may
come into effect on 1 November 2009. Therefore, is it likely that we
will revisit this area next year and that what we put in place now will
only last for 12 months and then we will have a new
regime?</div>
					<a name="0805163000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I now turn to
the issue of red diesel for private pleasure craft. I declare an
interest in that the Grand Union canal runs through my constituency.
This Saturday, I will be opening the Rickmansworth canal festival, an
event that I can recommend to anyone who would like a fun day out.
<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> Alternatively, one could watch the
test match, but I will certainly be at the Rickmansworth canal
festival.</div>
					<a name="0805163000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, red
diesel has been a concern for boaters, whether inland or otherwise. The
Government&#146;s original proposals suggested that private pleasure
craft would be required to fit additional fuel tanks, but that is no
longer the case. Although it is regrettable that the derogation was not
extended, the Government have, in all fairness, taken quite a
reasonable approach. If they had pursued their original proposals, one
implication would have been that craft would have to have had two fuel
tanks fitted. There was certainly an issue about whether operators
would want to provide two sorts of fuel in more remote areas, with the
result that private pleasure craft would not be able to visit such
areas. The alternative approach is therefore welcome, but I would like
to ask some questions about it.</div>
					<a name="0805163000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the current approach, boat
users must self-certify that they are non-commercial and they must
distinguish between fuel for propulsion and fuel for heating, lighting
and so on. On propulsion, the estimate in the Treasury&#146;s impact
assessment is that the price of gas oil could more than double. I would
be grateful to know whether the Government still agree with that
assessment, given the changes that we have seen in fuel prices in
recent months.</div>
					<a name="0805163000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
be grateful for clarification of the distinction between propulsion and
domestic use&#151;heating, lighting and so on. Will that be made
purely on the basis of self-certification, or will a standard
percentage be used, as has been suggested?</div>
					<a name="0805163000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
be grateful for confirmation that the European Commission has accepted
the proposals and that the proposed route forward will not cause
further difficulties. Similarly, will there be any difficulties with
other member states not recognising the continued use of red diesel?
That concern was raised in the consultation.</div>
					<a name="0805163000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs has made no estimate of the cost of increased enforcement.
Given that we will rely heavily on self-certification, will there not
be a need to enforce the arrangements and perhaps do spot checks? I
would be grateful to know the Government&#146;s position on
that.</div>
					<a name="0805163000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I want
to raise a point that struck me as I read the impact assessment. The
Exchequer will raise between &#163;10 million and &#163;15 million
a year, depending 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>on the balance between propulsion and domestic use, and I understand why
there would be that range of uncertainty. However, there are also
figures for the reduction in fuel used for propulsion for the purposes
of calculating the carbon reduction. The figures range from 10 to 30
per cent., with the central forecast therefore being 20 per cent. In
evaluating the carbon reduction, the Government appear, entirely
reasonably, to be making a dynamic assessment&#151;that if they put
up the duty, less fuel will be used, with the central projection being
a 20 per cent. reduction.</div>
					<a name="0805163000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Have the Government undertaken
the same assessment in calculating the Exchequer costs and therefore
assumed a 20 per cent. reduction in use as a consequence of their
proposals? If they have, that is entirely reasonable, although there is
evidence of a dynamic effect. If they have not, why not, given that
they have taken account of a dynamic effect in relation to the same tax
in a different context? If the Treasury does take account of the
dynamic effect on this tax, does it do so on other issues? I would be
grateful if the Exchequer Secretary could answer those
questions.</div>

Eagle:
						</b> I must confess to experiencing a slight tinge of
envy when the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire talked about the
great event on the Grand Union canal this weekend. I used to be the
Minister responsible for canals. One misses some certain things about
one&#146;s previous jobs&#151;certainly being able to leap on a
narrowboat and steer it through a few locks, which I did on occasion. I
am slightly envious of how the hon. Gentleman will spend his
weekend.</div>
					<a name="0805163000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy to
do my best to answer some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s perfectly
reasonable questions on clause 14. He is right&#151;and I thank him
for acknowledging it&#151; that it was not the Government&#146;s
wish to be in a situation in which we had to deal with the ending of
derogation for such fuel, but we reached the stage at which the
European Commission would not allow the derogation to
continue.</div>
					<a name="0805163000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 14
introduces changes in response to the loss of the UK&#146;s energy
products directive derogation and provides for free-standing rate of
duty for aviation gasoline which, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said,
is known as avgas, with effect from 1 November 2008. It also introduces
schedule 6, which makes provision for charging duty on</div>
					<a name="0805163000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;fuel used for private pleasure
flying or private pleasure
craft&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805163000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">and for a
partially-rebated rate of duty on heavy oil other than kerosene, which
is a nil-rated oil because it is used for heating&#151;hence the
issue of propulsion and heating about which the hon. Gentleman
asked.</div>
					<a name="0805163000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under energy
tax directive 2003/96/EC, which is also known as the energy products
directive, fuel used for pleasure flying and in private pleasure
aircraft must be taxed at the full rate that member states charge on
the equivalent fuel, and waste oil that is re-used as fuel must be
charged with duty at the rate that member states charge on the
equivalent heating fuel. The UK held
derogations&#151;<i class="I">[</i>

							<a name="0805163000347"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> Sir Nicholas, I was trying to earwig on that
conversation as well. It was rather
intriguing.</div>
					<a name="0805163000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
UK held derogations permitting the application of exempt or reduced
rates of duty of fuels used for those purposes. Unfortunately, they
expired on 31 December 2006, and our applications for renewal were
turned down. Consequently, the new free-standing duty rate on avgas set
independently from other duties will be the rate that applies when the
free-standing rate is introduced on 1 November. The current rate for
avgas, which is set at half the rate for leaded petrol, is 30.03p per
litre. The date of introduction coincides with the implementation of
schedule 6.</div>
					<a name="0805163000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked whether it was the minimum level allowed under EU
rules. I can confirm that it is. He also asked about exemptions,
particularly for emergency flying vehicles and vintage aircraft. The
new regime applies only to private flying, so air ambulances and so on
are not covered. We are considering in more detail the position of
training flights, which he mentioned. I cannot usefully add anything on
that, but I am sorry to disappoint him that there are no exemptions for
fuel used in vintage aircraft.</div>
					<a name="0805163000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman asked how the
new rates might interact with the planned introduction of the new
aviation duty in November 2009. The interaction with the new aviation
duty will be considered fully as the details of that new tax are
finalised. That issue is under consideration by the Government. He
asked about fuel use for domestic purposes, which does not have to be
charged at the full duty rate. We are talking about the difference
between the purpose of heating and the purpose of propulsion. An
allowance will be made for fuel used for domestic purposes, which will
continue to be supplied at the rebated rate, because there is a zero
rate for heating. Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs will discuss
appropriate allowances with representatives of the boating
industry.</div>
					<a name="0805163000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
work done on designing and introducing the new rates has been
accompanied throughout by consultation of all the industry bodies to
ensure that we are as aware as possible of the details and the
technical problems that may arise. I have the impression that there has
been good co-operation between HMRC and the industry representatives
during the consultation. We have tried to make the introduction of the
rates as technically effective as possible, with the least number of
unintended consequences, and I hope that we can show that we have done
that.</div>
					<a name="0805163000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the possibility of the EU not being happy with the way in which we have
ended the derogation and introduced the new rates, there is no reason
for the Commission to challenge our new arrangements. The Commission
always keeps a close eye on what member states are doing, so I cannot
say that there will be no objections, but we are not expecting
objections, as we have ended the derogation as it asked and put in
place systems that enable us to comply with the appropriate
directive.</div>
					<a name="0805163000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
self-certification approach raised a few eyebrows, but HMRC&#146;s
enforcement effort has to be proportionate to the risk, and this is
quite a small area for fuel sales. In the context of the total yield of
&#163;24 billion from oil, use in private pleasure craft would
account for&#151;get ready for this&#151;0.06 per cent. of the
total revenue. The chief risks arise both from pleasure craft owners
misleading 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div>suppliers about the nature of their boat, whether it is commercial or
domestic, and inflating their entitlement to fuel supplied for domestic
purposes, and from those who supply the fuel failing to submit returns
or pay the revenue that they
collect.</div>
					<a name="0805163000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">For aircraft,
the only risk is that flyers will fail to declare any duty on fuel use
for private pleasure flying, but the revenue risk is considered
negligible, as private pleasure flying use of avtur&#151;aviation
turbine fuel&#151;is estimated to be a fraction of 1 per cent. of the
avtur that is used in the industry. HMRC will not give a free hand, but
it will approach the paying of duty according to a risk-based
assessment. That does not mean that if there are obvious examples of
deliberate evasion of the duty, action will not be taken, but I hope
that it gives the hon. Gentleman an insight into our
approach.</div>
					<a name="0805163000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the 20 per
cent. reduction in use deployed in calculating the cost, which the hon.
Gentleman also mentioned, it is difficult to project the impact,
especially when taking into account the concession on fuel for domestic
purposes, because we do not quite know how that will work out. It will
mitigate the impact to some extent, but that is a best guess. Clearly,
the way in which it develops will be taken into account in refining the
assessments of cost in the future. I hope that, with those responses to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s quite reasonable questions, the Committee
will be happy to pass clause 14 and schedule
6.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805163000348"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> It may benefit the Committee if I
declare at the outset that it was expected that it was expected that my
hon. Friend the Member for Putney, who has done a great deal of work on
the clauses that we are debating this afternoon, would speak on behalf
of the Opposition and that the Exchequer Secretary would respond. On
behalf of myself and the Economic Secretary, I would like to say that
we are to some extent performing the role of stand-ins. I know that a
successful performance by the understudy in a theatrical performance or
opera tends to result in standing ovations. I suspect that we will not
receive them today&#151;at least, not in response to my performance.
I am grateful for the work of my hon. Friend the Member for Putney on
the clauses.</div>
					<a name="0805163000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
graze one or two matters regarding the landfill levy, which we are
considering in relation to clause 16. There is an increase in the level
of the landfill levy to &#163;32 this year, which is the biggest jump
in landfill tax from year to year since it was introduced in 1996. The
levy was the UK&#146;s first environmental tax, and it was introduced
by the previous Government. It has been announced that in the following
year, it will increase to &#163;40 and the year after that, to
&#163;48. I would be grateful if the Minister explained why, given
that it is an annual levy, it is necessary to make announcements in
advance. I would be grateful for that clarification.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>
					<a name="0805163000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
points that I would particularly like to raise with the Minister.
First, there has been a reduction in landfill during the years in which
the landfill tax had been in place. No doubt, the landfill tax has
played a part in incentivising industries, local authorities and
individuals to be more efficient, but is the Minister concerned that
one reason why there has been a reduction in landfill is fly-tipping?
One of the unintended consequences of the significant increase in
landfill tax may well be an increase in fly-tipping, which is of
concern to all of us. I would grateful for the Minister&#146;s views
on that, and if she could tell us what steps will be taken to ensure
that that does not happen.
</div>
					<a name="0805163000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second concern is that to a large extent the big payers of the landfill
tax will be local authorities and the public sector. Essentially, money
will be circulated from local authorities, who will be paying more in
landfill tax. That will, of course, need to be funded one way or the
other&#151;perhaps by increased council tax. The increase in landfill
tax will place financial strains on local authorities. The Local
Government Association has said that local authorities will face an
equivalent of a &#163;1 million rise to cover increased costs in
2008-09. Councils expect total landfill tax costs to be in the region
of &#163;2.3 billion over the next three years. That is a substantial
additional cost, which will place a strain on local authorities. In my
constituency, an attempt to find savings in recycling has resulted in
an unpopular proposal to close the Tring recycling centre, which causes
alarm to those who know the area well including, I think, the Economic
Secretary&#151;although I do not know whether she is aware of that
particular
issue.</div>
					<a name="0805163000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are concerns that these proposals may result in money being moved
around different parts of the public sector and going from local
councils to central Government. Local councils may find themselves
paying an additional amount as a consequence of the proposals. There
has also been a substantial increase in the revenue raised, although
originally it was envisaged that it would be a neutral tax and
additional environmental tax credits would be used in the
circumstances. However, that does not seem comparable in any way with
the amount raised in revenue. Is the landfill tax supposed to be
revenue neutral? We return to the question, which has been raised a
number of times, of whether landfill tax has two motivations: to raise
revenue, and to change behaviour. Is it another way of raising revenue,
or is it seen as revenue
neutral?</div>

Whips that I have, uniquely, requested a Doorkeeper to bring an

North has obliged, and I see that two more hon. Members have done so. I

					<a name="0805163000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a couple of brief points to make about landfill tax, which my
party supports for obvious environmental reasons. The hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire asked a moment ago why the increases had been
anticipated for future years. The explanation is simple: it allows
companies interested in developing new technology to plan ahead with
some reasonable assumptions about their future revenue stream. New
Earth Solutions and TEG have campaigned on that basis. Mr.
Steve Lee, chief executive of the Chartered Institution of Wastes
Management,
said:</div>
					<a name="0805163000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Raising
the tax by &#163;8 per tonne per year to &#163;48 by 2010 for
&#145;active&#146; waste will make a whole range of waste treatment
technologies financially viable&#151;for all wastes, not just
municipal. The three-year plan for the escalator is good, too.
Businesses need time to change and even the anticipation of a
&#163;48 per tonne tax&#151;plus steadily increasing landfill gate
fees&#151;will be enough to influence many waste and resource
management decisions.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805163000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
that basis, the Government&#146;s proposals seem to be eminently
sensible.</div>
					<a name="0805163000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will put a fly in the ointment, however, as concerns have been
expressed that councils are not managing to get the money
recycled&#151;probably the appropriate term&#151;into their
coffers. The incentive for the councils to do so is partly because, as
the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said, there is a cost to
them of meeting their obligations on landfill tax, but also because
they might often use, or be able to use, the money for environmentally
helpful projects, including new recycling plants and rubbish reduction
and collection facilities. I would be grateful if the Minister told us
what steps are being taken by the Government to ensure that local
councils gain the benefits of the additional
revenue.</div>
					<a name="0805163000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will finish by citing an example from my constituency. Last year,
Somerset Wildlife Trust&#151;an organisation of which I am pleased to
be a member&#151;planted a new woodland just outside Taunton, with
&#163;100,000 contributed from revenue raised from the landfill tax.
There are clear environmental benefits, both in carbon emissions and
the natural environment available for the public to enjoy, if the money
can be made available for such projects. I hope that the Minister will
be able to say some encouraging words in that
regard.</div>

							<a name="0805163000354"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Kitty Ussher):
						</b> May I
say, Sir Nicholas, that it is an honour to make my Finance Bill debut
under your chairmanship. It is true that I know the constituency of my
fellow stand-in, the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, although
it was in about 1980 that I left the Tring vicinity. I am not sure that
the recycling depot that he mentioned was in operation then, but I am
deeply perturbed to find that the situation may
change.</div>
					<a name="0805163000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to the
matter in hand, the clause increases the standard rate of landfill tax,
which applies to active waste disposed to landfill, by &#163;8 per
tonne to &#163;40 per tonne next year, in line with previous
commitments. We announced as long ago as the 2002 pre-Budget report
that the standard rate would have to increase to encourage investment
in alternatives to landfill. That approach has worked well, with the
quantities of active waste going to landfill reduced by almost 19 per
cent. between 1997/98 and 2006/07, while the economy grew by 28 per
cent.</div>
					<a name="0805163000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to the points made by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, we
are legislating for next year&#146;s increases this year,
because&#151;the hon. Member for Taunton is entirely right&#151;we
wish to provide certainty and to achieve a behavioural impact on firms
seeking to invest. It is consistent with the approach that we have
taken in the Bill on other environmental taxes&#151;the climate
change levy and the aggregates levy&#151;and with the approach that
we took last year. Pre-announcing something as early as possible has a
maximum affect on behaviour. On the issue of rate increases encouraging
fly-tipping, we recognise that fly-tipping is a significant antisocial
problem affecting communities, landowners and regulators alike. That is
why my colleagues at Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
have been working with the Environment Agency to develop and implement
a waste crime action plan, which aims to improve prevention, detection
and enforcement with regards to fly-tipping. I understand that DEFRA
will consult on proposals over the summer months this year to
strengthen waste controls and to give enforcement authorities greater
powers to stop and seize vehicles involved in illegal waste activity.
In my constituency, it seems to be the determination and dedication of
local authority staff, rather than the standard rate of landfill tax
that makes a difference. We provide a programme of education and advice
that encourages local authorities to do just
that.</div>
					<a name="0805163000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Revenue
recycling is an important issue, which I am glad that hon. Members have
raised. A number of local authorities have claimed that the increases
have not been adequately factored in, adding pressure to council tax
bills. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked about that as
well, but the answer is that that is not the case. The cost of landfill
tax was taken into account when agreeing the sustainable settlement
with local authorities. It is sufficient to ensure that excessive
council tax rises are avoided. The local government settlement that
provides continued real term increases with an average, annual increase
of 1 per cent. above inflation takes into account local
government&#146;s landfill tax liability, including the increased
costs that we are discussing
today.</div>
					<a name="0805163000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the question of whether the tax is intended to raise revenue, the
answer is no. We are not seeking to increase landfill tax to raise
revenue, although the initial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div>introduction helped us to reduce corporation tax at the time. The tax
increase is aimed at stimulating a behavioural change to reduce the
quantities of waste sent to landfill and to encourage a move to more
sustainable waste management practices. It is important to remember
that the decision to increase the standard rate by &#163;8 per tonne
from 2008-09 was taken as part of the overall package of reform of
business taxation.</div>
					<a name="0805163000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
corporation tax cut announced in the Budget would not have been
possible without increases in landfill tax. That does not mean that we
are not investing in ways of improving resource efficiency,
particularly among businesses. In the current financial year 2008-09,
&#163;155 million is being invested in that way. I hope that, having
answered those questions, the Committee will accept the
clause.</div>

end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3) In
sub-paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 6 to FA 2000 after &#147;on&#148;,
insert &#147;the level of carbon dioxide emissions emitted
by&#148;.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0805163000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
party supports the climate change levy in the absence of a better
alternative, but the amendment proposes the introduction of something
that we regard as a superior alternative&#151;a carbon tax. I shall
explain briefly why we believe that to be the case. The climate change
levy is too complex, it offers too many exemptions and suffers from a
confusion of objectives. It does not apply at a standard rate to each
tonne of carbon, and it applies only to business users. What is more,
several confusing initiatives are used concurrently, such as the
European Union emissions trading scheme, which is compulsory for heavy
industry and the power sector; the United Kingdom emissions trading
scheme, which is a voluntary scheme in which firms are incentivised by
the Government to reduce emissions through trading; and other climate
change agreements between industry and the Government. The amendment
would consolidate the various initiatives and schemes into a more
effective and efficient carbon
tax.</div>
					<a name="0805163000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The carbon tax
would apply to all carbon fuels at a uniform rate per tonne of carbon
at the point at which they enter the economy. Our party policy is to
tax emissions from energy supplies, as is done in other European
countries that we often regard as leaders in good practice, such as
Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands, and it would enable us as a nation
to reduce pollution. The proposal is to set the carbon tax to achieve a
level of emissions reduction that is not otherwise achieved through the
emissions trading scheme; to adjust the carbon tax to maintain progress
towards our long-term target of carbon neutrality, with any changes to
the tax notified well in advance to give investors time to adjust; and
to use the revenues to cut other taxes when possible so that the
overall net effect of the tax burden is
neutral.</div>
					<a name="0805163000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
enter one caveat. A reasonable objection has been made about the impact
in the short term on domestic users and those who suffer from what is
commonly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div>called fuel poverty. Transitional measures would have to be put in place
to ensure that people were not penalised unfairly in respect of their
lifestyle when they could not afford to take an alternative approach.
Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have set out as succinctly as I
could, a carbon tax would be a superior way in which to reach the
objective that we pretty much all share in
Committee.</div>
					<a name="0805163000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Being
a realist, I do not anticipate that the Committee will be persuaded of
the case for the amendment, however brilliant my speech may, or may
not, have been. It is worth my saying, to save my rising to speak
again, that we support the climate change levy, because it is better
than not having such a levy, and we support increases in line with
inflation. Until that levy is replaced with a more coherent carbon tax,
we will support the arrangements advanced by the
Government.</div>

							<a name="0805163000356"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> We have some sympathy with the objective outlined
by the hon. Member for Taunton, but whether that is because of the
brilliance of his speech or otherwise I leave others to decide.
However, we share the view that the climate change levy is an imperfect
tax. My right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr.
Letwin) once said, in a typically erudite allusion, that it reminded
him of what history masters used to say about the Holy Roman empire: it
was neither holy nor Roman nor an empire. The climate change levy is
not really about climate change: it is a tax on energy. Although that
might be an aspect of reducing carbon emissions, it is not the complete
story, because if we want to reduce carbon emissions we need to
distinguish between sources of energy that produce a lot of carbon and
those that do not. The climate change levy does not sufficiently
address that matter and is therefore flawed. I have a lot of sympathy
with what the hon. Member for Taunton said and with the objective
proposed in amendment No.
57.</div>
					<a name="0805163000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Others
have criticised the climate change levy: the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution described it as a blunt instrument, and the
Select Committee on Environmental Audit also made a number of
criticisms. The levy is flawed and is not ideal, so there is
accordingly a need to reform it into a carbon tax, which it is not at
the moment, rather than an energy tax. Although I have expressed
sympathy for the amendment, whether it does everything that the hon.
Member for Taunton would like it to do is another matter. But as far as
the objective is concerned, we hope that the Government will listen and
reform the climate change levy and replace it with a genuine carbon
tax.</div>

Ussher:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comment will go into <i class="I">Hansard</i>. However, under his amendment, the
levy would be based on emissions rather than on energy supply. There
would be a technical problem with doing that&#151;as well as legal
problems&#151;notwithstanding the fact that amending the introduction
to the clause is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div>insufficient to achieve the legal outcome that is required. However, I
take his amendment in the spirit in which it is intended, so I will
overlook that problem. The real problem is that the amendment would be
contrary to European Union directive 2003/96, which requires a tax on
energy supply rather than
emissions.</div>
					<a name="0805163000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
main problem that I urge Committee members to consider stems from the
fact that our climate change levy has been incredibly successful as
devised. An independent analysis by Cambridge Econometrics, published
at the time of the 2005 Budget, estimated that it had delivered
emissions savings of more than 16 million tonnes of carbon up
to that point, that by 2010 it would save some 3.5 million tonnes of
carbon a year&#151;well above initial estimates&#151;and that it
would reduce energy demand in business and public sectors by some 15
per cent. a year. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment is therefore
unnecessary.</div>

The Treasury shall publish, not later than the date

the carbon emissions savings resulting from the changes to climate
change levy contained in this
section&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0805163000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no need to repeat all the arguments that we have just heard about
the climate change levy in general, although my amendment addresses one
aspect of what we were considering: its effectiveness in reducing
carbon emissions. Everything that the hon. Member for Taunton and I
have said about the flaws in the climate change levy in that context
should be borne in mind. The Minister quoted the Cambridge Econometrics
report. I have a quote from Cambridge Econometrics&#151;I believe it
is from the same report, but I apologise if that is not the
case&#151;which observes that the relative decline in UK
energy-intensive manufacturing sectors suggests that many of the energy
efficiency and carbon saving targets would have been achieved without
carbon change agreements. It says of the climate change
levy:</div>
					<a name="0805163000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Only for
one sector did we find that the CCA would have been missed had no
climate change levy ever
existed.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805163000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
also worth noting the observations made by the Environmental Audit
Committee, which acknowledged that the tax is on course to save 12.8
million tonnes of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> by 2010, according to a Government
report on the scheme&#146;s impact. The Committee also viewed the tax
as the second largest element of the Government&#146;s climate change
programmes in terms of carbon
saving:</div>
					<a name="0805163000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the CCL
significantly raised awareness of potential carbon savings in the
business environment before implementation. This resulted in the
majority of savings being made before the tax was actually
introduced.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805163000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
the climate change levy as effective as it might be in reducing carbon
emissions? If we wished to do so over the years ahead, a review would
be helpful. The Government should consider that on an ongoing basis to
see whether the climate change levy is working as effectively as it
might. That is why we have tabled amendment No. 68, which requires the
Government to make</div>
					<a name="0805163000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an
estimate, audited by the Independent Committee on Climate

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div>
					<a name="0805163000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">so that we can see
whether we are making as much progress as we should. That would inform
the debate about whether the climate change levy should be replaced by
a carbon tax, as two of the three major parties
advocate.</div>

							<a name="0805163000362"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> In a sense, we agree with the
spirit of the amendment, although we are not prepared to accept it, for
reasons that I shall explain. The hon. Gentleman was right to discuss
the work by Cambridge Econometrics. I will go back and read the report
again, but what Cambridge Econometrics said to us was that, in its
analysis, the climate change levy would save 2.8 million tonnes per
annum and reduce energy demand in the business and commercial sector by
22 per cent. by 2010. It is an independent, well-respected consultancy,
and it used peer-reviewed econometric methodology, so one cannot get
much better than
that.</div>
					<a name="0805163000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment requires that we publish, no later than the date of the
Budget 2009, our own estimate, audited by the independent Committee on
Climate Change. There are two problems with that. First, now is not the
time for a further review, as the independent study has just been
completed. It is better to do such work independently. A lesser, but
relevant, point is that the independent Committee on Climate Change was
not set up to audit Government forecasts or assumptions, so it would
not consider that to be in its remit. I have no problem with the
general point that we should always keep under active review the effect
of our policies. People would expect us to do that across all
Government policies, and we will continue to do so in the medium and
long term with this policy. However, the amendment will not achieve the
spirit of what it intends to
achieve.</div>

						</b> I have one quick question. Should the climate
change levy be seen as revenue neutral? Should money raised by the
climate change levy be used to reduce taxes in other areas, or for
items of expenditure of a related nature? I believe that when the levy
was introduced it was supposed to be revenue neutral. At the time,
employers were compensated for the levy with a reduction in national
insurance contributions, but since then, their national insurance
contributions have increased. Is it the Government&#146;s policy that
the climate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div>change levy should be neutral, and that increases in that area would be
offset by cuts elsewhere? There is a problem with the credibility of
green taxes, which are viewed as stealth taxes. If it were clear that
additional revenue raised in that area would be used to reduce taxes in
other areas, the suspicion and cynicism would not be so
strong.</div>

be revenue-neutral? They are there to change behaviour, and therefore

There are two issues here. One is whether the use of an additional
green tax will be offset in another area. The other is that in
formulating financial projections of the revenue to be raised from a
green tax there is the issue that it will alter behaviour. Depending on
the circumstances, such a tax may ultimately result in reduced revenue
over the years. My hon. Friend made an important point. I would be

						</b> I shall briefly explain&#151;because we have not
yet done so&#151;exactly what clause 17 does. Simply, it legislates
for the revalorisation of the climate change levy rates announced in
the Budget 2008. As stated in the Red Book at the time, that maintains
the environmental effect of the tax after taking account of
inflation.</div>
					<a name="0805163000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
delighted to be able to answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. When
the climate change levy was introduced in April 2001, it was made clear
that the purpose was to recycle the revenue back to business, primarily
through the 0.3 per cent. reduction in employers national insurance
contributions introduced at the same time as the
levy.</div>
					<a name="0805163000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned &#147;stealth taxes&#148;. Like the
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, it always makes me laugh when
people start talking about stealth taxes because, by definition, if
they are talking about them, they cannot be very secret. Cab drivers
have a particular habit of cornering me on that one, and I am always
tempted to say, &#147;If it is so secret, how do you know about
it?&#148;. I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that no extra revenues
are secretly being siphoned off elsewhere. I do not know if this has
been said before, but the levy has consistently raised less than the
value of the national insurance contributions cuts that it was designed
to fund, so quite the opposite is the case. I hope that that will be
sufficient to reassure the hon. Gentleman.</div>

					<a name="0805163000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805163000373"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> I would like to raise a number of points on
aggregates tax, which are part of clause 18. The first is on the issue
of neutrality and what the funds raised by the aggregates tax will be
used for, which continues from where we left off on the climate change
levy and the landfill tax. The clause results in a small increase in
the aggregates tax per tonne from &#163;1.95 to &#163;2, which we
could say was broadly inflationary. Last year&#146;s increase was
more significant; I think that it was 30p per
tonne.</div>
					<a name="0805163000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
the issue when that was introduced was that there was an aggregates
levy sustainability fund that was going to use the proceeds of the
aggregates tax. My understanding is that in the fund&#146;s first
four years of operation, only 70 per cent. of the nominal &#163;117
million allocation went into the aggregates levy sustainability fund.
Can the Minister confirm whether that is right? Can she also provide
details as to what the fund is there to achieve, and details of the
funding
formula?</div>
					<a name="0805163000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
had this debate in the Public Bill Committee last year. The Minister
for Local Government was Financial Secretary then. I asked him whether
last year&#146;s increase could be said to have been revenue neutral.
Although it could be said that it was introduced alongside a 0.1 per
cent. reduction in the rate of employers national insurance
contribution, there did not appear to be an equivalent tax cut last
year. He pointed out that business taxes were being cut last year, but
he confirmed in a letter to me on 5 June 2007 that the increase in the
aggregates levy last year, which we saw come into effect last month,
was not part of that business tax package. What is the Government
policy on recycling the aggregates
levy?</div>
					<a name="0805163000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
my hon. Friend the Member for Putney has met industry representatives
and experts in this sector and it is a great pity for all concerned
that she is not able to fully express all their concerns this
afternoon. There are concerns about the precise workings of the
aggregates tax. I put that to probe the Government. There are
exemptions; for example, slate is not subject to the levy. A number of
new slate quarries have opened up since the levy was introduced. They
have a competitive advantage over granite quarries, which are closing
down. Why is slate not subject to the levy? That is a genuine
inquiry.</div>
					<a name="0805163000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, I
understand that china clay aggregate is not subject to the levy either
and nor is shale or aggregate that is exported. Are there any EU law
implications, as there so often are, for the fact that exported
aggregate is not subject to the levy and would that cause difficulties
under the treaty of Rome? I understand that limestone for agricultural
use is not subject to the levy but the same limestone if used in
construction is. Equally, a limestone quarry that produces aggregates
to make cement is not subject to the levy, but a limestone quarry that
produces aggregate for concrete is. There may well be very good reasons
for those distinctions and I look forward to hearing
them.</div>
					<a name="0805163000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805163000374"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I will be extremely brief. The
hon. Gentleman raised many interesting questions. I am looking forward
to hearing the Minister&#146;s response, not least because it will
help me to decide whether to refit some of my house with slate rather
than granite surfaces, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div>if I can afford either. My understanding is that the levy raises
something in the region of &#163;300 million a year, but only
&#163;35 million goes into the aggregates levy sustainability fund. I
do not know whether those were the numbers that the hon. Gentleman used
as I did not quite catch them. He used quite a few numbers in a short
space of time. If that is the case, why does only 10 per cent.
of the revenue raised go into the environmental fund and what is the
Government&#146;s thinking on the appropriate proportion of the
revenue raised that should go into that
fund?</div>
					<a name="0805163000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805163000375"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> The clause increases the rate of aggregates levy
from &#163;1.95 per tonne to &#163;2 per tonne. The new rate will
apply to any aggregate commercially exploited on or after 1 April 2009.
We have always said that we would make sure that the levy kept pace
with inflation over time. That is broadly what we are doing today.
There is strong evidence that the levy is achieving its environmental
objectives. Between 2001 and 2005 sales of virgin aggregate in the UK
fell by 8 per cent., while there was an increase of nearly 6 million
tonnes of recycled
aggregate.</div>
					<a name="0805163000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall now deal with the types of material as it follows on from that
point. Exemptions are granted to certain materials such as slate waste
and china clay waste to promote their use as alternatives to so-called
virgin aggregate. That policy stems from our broad minerals planning
policy, which seeks to encourage the use of these materials as
alternatives to virgin aggregate. I do not know whether either are
available from John Lewis, and whether that will help the hon. Member
for Taunton to decide how to redo his house. In terms of the fund, he
is entirely right. The levy raises around &#163;300 million a year.
The budget for the sustainability fund is &#163;35 million a year.
The difference is used to fund roughly a 0.1 per cent. employers
national insurance contributions cut, which was made when the levy was
introduced. Even if one includes what we discussed on the previous
clause, it still does not fund all the mixed concessions. Therefore,
there were no stealth taxes involved in this.</div>
					<a name="0805163000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire wanted to know a bit more about the
sustainability fund. It is administered by the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and it aims to minimise demand for
primary aggregates, to promote environmentally friendly extraction and
to reduce the effect of local aggregate extraction. Outside England it
is up to the devolved Administrations to decide how to spend their
allocation. However, in the spirit of co-operation, the Government have
helpfully suggested that it should be used in six areas: overcoming
market barriers; promoting increased use of alternative materials as
aggregates; funding and research into more sustainable construction and
demolition; promoting conservation and increased biodiversity;
restoring the natural landscape and promoting environmentally friendly
quarrying practices; and supporting local community
projects.</div>
					<a name="0805163000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The value of
the sustainability fund was set at its introduction and continues to
offer value for money. Our internal estimates suggest that 10 per cent.
of the total amount raised is the maximum scope for such spending. I
hope that that is sufficient to encourage the Committee to agree to the
clause.</div>

authorises the Government to produce on the carbon reduction trading

					<a name="0805163000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is
that the European Union&#146;s emissions trading scheme has received
a great deal of criticism. Some say that it has been ineffective in
reducing carbon emissions, that it set carbon at the wrong price and
that it has been used too easily. This is an important point for the
development of the Government&#146;s own carbon reduction trading
scheme. How does the Government see the EU ETS? Does the Minister
believe that the criticisms that it is deeply flawed are fair and
accurate? If so, what will she do about it? I appreciate that this is
not the time for a detailed debate on the matter, but in formulating
the regulations under clause 19, how will the Government avoid some of
the difficulties? How will the Minister distinguish between what the UK
will do and what has happened under the EU to ensure that we are not
left with an ineffective scheme that imposes a bureaucratic burden but
does nothing to reduce carbon emissions?</div>

							<a name="0805163000383"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> Thank you for your wisdom and
patience in calling me, Sir Nicholas. I hope to reward both of them in
the next few seconds. It is worth putting on record the fact that I am
extremely supportive of the principle of carbon trading. We need to
explore the potential of market mechanisms for reducing carbon
emissions. Simply banning more and more activities&#151;or, in some
cases, pricing people out of activities that they may need to
undertake&#151;is a blunt instrument. It is a necessary instrument
for dealing with the problem of climate change, but it is quite
limited. The theory of carbon trading is worth developing
further.</div>
					<a name="0805163000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a few
brief questions for the Minister to answer. The first follows on from
previous clauses but is directly relevant to this one. The
Government&#146;s overall approach lacks coherence. There is a little
bit here and a little bit there, but it is difficult for somebody
trying to understand the Government&#146;s aim in their entire policy
to work out why they have chosen to adopt such a confusing array of
policies. Does she believe that they could be consolidated into
something more
coherent?</div>
					<a name="0805163000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point was raised with me in representations from the Carbon
Trust. As I understand it, the Government will produce a league table
of the best and worst companies for CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions. Depending
on where companies come in the table, they will receive payments from
the Government. Assuming that I have understood that correctly, will
the Minister expand on how much revenue will come in, how much will go
out and what companies have to do to become financial beneficiaries of
the scheme? To take an alternative approach, it may be possible that
the incentive is to lose less, rather than gain financially, under the
proposals. Obviously, that could have revenue
implications.</div>
					<a name="0805163000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
why is primary legislation not being used to set the charge levels? I
think that everybody in the House is a bit uncomfortable when we are
asked to buy into a policy in broad-brush terms. We are reassured that
the details will all be filled in later, when we will not necessarily
be scrutinising matters in such detail, and told that we do not need to
worry ourselves too much about them. As the Government have learned to
their cost in many other matters, the details can be the most
controversial aspect of any proposal. I should be grateful if the
Minister explained why the Government cannot bring forward a full
package of proposals so that Committee members can satisfy themselves
that they have agreed to them in their
entirety.</div>

Simon:
						</b> I want only 30 seconds to assure you, Sir
Nicholas, that lauding you from a sedentary position for having the
wisdom of Job was not biblical ignorance in my case&#151;I pride
myself on my biblical knowledge&#151;but a Freudian
slip.</div>

							<a name="0805163000386"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> I shall try to be Job-like and
full of wisdom at the same time. I shall answer a specific point and
then move to the more general ones. The Opposition&#146;s amendment
seeks to remove the flexibility that we have deliberately put into the
clause, because we want to ensure that we have all the tools at our
disposal to adapt to the market as it evolves in years to come without
having to return to primary legislation. We will not necessarily use
all our powers but, if we accepted the Opposition amendment, we might
take away a power that we may need subsequently. That is why I
encourage members of the Committee to resist
it.</div>
					<a name="0805163000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the general points about the EU emissions trading scheme, I do not
accept that it is deeply flawed and is a disaster. In fact, as an
economist by training&#151;Lord, forgive me&#151;there is a
beautiful simplicity to carbon auctions and trading. I share the view
of the hon. Member for Taunton about that. However, there is a
consensus that, as a global leader of its kind, the EU emissions
trading scheme perhaps started a little too lightly and will have more
of an effect as it is ratcheted up&#151;the position that we are now
in. The hon. Gentleman asked what my colleagues at DEFRA are doing
about matters. They are negotiating hard to achieve that precise result
and simply to reach an agreement, because those innovative traders in
the City who want to make a liquid market in carbon permits need
certainty beyond the current time frame for that to happen and,
obviously, the policy will be more successful if there are liquid
secondary
markets.</div>
					<a name="0805163000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a fundamental difference between our proposal and the EU emissions
trading scheme. First, it has been designed deliberately to apply to
different organisations and, secondly, it will start charging for
permits and thus will have a faster effect than the EU emissions
trading scheme, even though that scheme is now proving extremely
useful. I reject the suggestion that we are incoherent. We have a wide
range of measures to combat climate change, and they reinforce each
other in a positive way. As for the question of precisely how firms can
apply for grants to offset the cost, the hon. Member for Taunton was
right that they will be charged for the permits and will then receive
grants to support the innovative changes that they will have to make to
reduce their emissions. I do not have the precise details. I am not
sure that it would be a good idea to set them out in the Bill, but I
shall make sure that they are made publicly available to members of the
Committee. Furthermore, setting out in the Bill the level of charges is
neither necessary nor desirable. Since the power is a regulating one, I
presume that there will be an opportunity for hon. Members to make
their feelings known in the usual way.</div>

emissions trading scheme. I did not use the word,
&#147;disaster&#148;. For example, Open Europe, of which I suspect

industry. She has done a lot of research and had meetings with industry
members. I am sure that she regrets her inability to raise her points
in person. The bingo industry is struggling, for a number of reasons,
but particularly because of the Gambling Act 2005, which I accept is
going to be reviewed, and various changes such as the smoking ban and
so on. Times are difficult for bingo halls, which play an important
role in many communities. They have been very popular. I am sure that
we would all agree that it would be a great pity if bingo halls started
going out of

					<a name="0805163000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government will set out their policy on gambling, particularly on

of bingo halls going out of business. Secondly, in evaluating gaming
duty, will the Government consider some reform or take any action to
assist bingo halls? When considering clause 21, the Committee of the

similar area. A popular and traditional industry, which provides a

					<a name="0805163000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point was made to me on that occasion, and has been made to me on many

commonly known as double taxation. That is problematic, given that the
industry faces other pressures as a business. I am the last person to
think that businesses should be propped up if they are unable to
attract customers. It is for the bingo industry to appeal to people to

<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 267</div>going for a walk in the countryside or whatever else people might choose
to spend their free time doing, but there are pressures on the bingo
industry as a result of the smoking ban, most obviously, and other
considerations. The sector is important, as it employs significant
numbers of people. Bingo is also enjoyed as a leisure activity by many
thousands of our fellow citizens. The point is constantly made that the
taxation arrangements are disadvantageous compared with other forms of
leisure pursuits with a gambling dimension. I would be grateful if the
Minister responded to those
concerns.</div>

						</b> As the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire
said, the purpose of the clause is to increase gaming duty bands in
line with inflation for accounting periods starting on or after 1 April
2007. Such revalorising is in accordance with Government practice in
recent years. I trust that that will be
uncontroversial.</div>
					<a name="0805163000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the bingo industry, I, too, have had the pleasure of calling the
numbers in my local bingo hall&#151;congratulations to Gala Bingo
Burnley, for giving me that opportunity. My constituents remarked that
I was extremely bad at it, although I hope shortly to have the
opportunity to practise further. I shall take lessons from the hon.
Member for Taunton on style. I am intrigued, too, to know what type of
research the hon. Member for Putney has undertaken on the bingo
industry. The Committee should be told about her number-calling
technique.</div>
					<a name="0805163000288"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45

					<a name="0805163000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are in close dialogue with the bingo industry. I congratulate the Bingo
Association on the effective way in which it represents its members,
with a strong voice. We very much hope that the dialogue will continue.
In the Finance Act 2003, we made a point of reducing the average
effective rate of bingo taxation from about 35 per cent. to nearer to
25 per cent. That was partly in response to the well-documented trend
of bingo establishments closing. There are a number of factors behind
that. Obviously the smoking ban&#151;which is the right thing to do
for the country&#151;has played a part, producing that side effect.
Demographic and social trends, too, are leading people to switch away
from bingo, although many people still devote considerable leisure time
to
it.</div>
					<a name="0805163000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Taunton mentioned participation fees. The existence of
those fees is not necessarily unfair, given the effective rates of
taxation in comparable industries. Lottery operators face an effective
tax rate of 24 per cent. For casinos, it is roughly 25 per cent., and
the figure for bingo duty is similar. Amusement machine licence
duty&#151;discussed elsewhere&#151;is about 21 per cent. Removing
the participation fees would reduce to about 15 per cent. the effective
rate for bingo, which would be out of line. There are other reasons why
we have not bought the argument for removing participation fees,
although we have considered it. When someone pays those fees, they are
buying a service, and the fees should therefore be taxed at the
appropriate rate. We have considered seriously all the points that the
bingo industry raised, but we decided not to make any changes in the
taxation of bingo in this Budget. The Bingo Association has made it
clear that it will continue to lobby. We welcome that, and we welcome
the conversation.</div>

							<a name="0805163000395"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> I do not know whether you are able to enlighten us,
Sir Nicholas, as to whether it is easier to chair a Finance Bill
Committee or call the numbers in a bingo hall. I do not know whether
anyone has done both, but I expect that if anyone has done, it is
probably your good
self.</div>
					<a name="0805163000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 24 is the
first of four clauses relating to research and development relief and
vaccine research relief. Clause 24 incorporates schedule 8, which makes
changes to the rates of those reliefs. Given that the Government are
changing the rates, I would like to probe their policy in that area. I
am sure that there is common ground across the Committee on the belief
that research and development are an important element of our economic
policy and the way in which the UK will prosper in the coming years.
The question is how we go about ensuring that that happens. The context
in which the Government seek to increase the rates of research and
development relief is one in which manufacturing is not having the best
of times. I recently became aware of OECD figures that showed that in
manufacturing growth in the past 10 years, the UK comes second from
bottom, above only Norway. All other countries have done
better.</div>
					<a name="0805163000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mention
that, because if manufacturing is to prosper in the years ahead, it
will do so in the highly developed value-added area. That will not be
achieved by doing things on the cheap because of increased
international competition. Research and development play an important
role. The question I want to probe&#151;I stress,
&#147;probe&#148;&#151;is how effective the Government&#146;s
approach to research and development is, and how effective taxation
incentives are in developing research and development in the UK, given
that manufacturing industry, which is presumably its ultimate
objective, has not grown substantially.</div>
					<a name="0805163000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should be
aware, and I do not want to digress, other than very briefly, that many
other aspects of the taxation system have an impact on manufacturing.
We have already debated the fact that the likes of Shire
Pharmaceuticals appear to have been driven out of the UK by taxation
matters and the headline rate. The Committee has already debated the
balance between exemptions and reliefs, and the need for a lower
headline rate. We all have to address that matter, but I should be
grateful if the Minister told us what assessment the Treasury has made
of the effectiveness of research and development reliefs and credits,
as opposed to a policy of lowering rates.</div>
					<a name="0805163000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a
number of reasons why research and development reliefs and credits have
not been as effective as they might have been, including administrative
costs involved in making a claim. We will come back to this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div>point in other clauses, but I am conscious that there are always issues
of state aid in this context, which limit the actions that the
Government may take. Do they consider that an impediment to the action
that would be necessary for a more effective regime? To give one
example, in the Finance Act 2007, we legislated for an extension of the
small and medium-sized enterprise definition so that it would
incorporate more companies. As of a few weeks ago, that had not come
into effect. Has agreement now been received from the European
Commission to do that? There are other examples too. In 2006, I think,
we legislated so that payment to clinical trial volunteers was eligible
for these reliefs and credits. Again, I should be grateful for an
update from the Minister. I should like to hear what assessment the
Government have made as to the effectiveness of this area, given that
we are going to increase the rates available to
businesses.</div>
					<a name="0805163000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to make a specific point about the circumstances in which large
companies pay mainstream corporation tax. It perhaps relates to the
detail in schedule 8, but it would prevent my having to make any
further comments. We have seen a reduction in corporation tax from 30
per cent. to 28 per cent., yet for large companies, the relevant rate
has gone up from 125 per cent. to 130 per cent. To save time, I shall
not set out all of the numbers of a worked example, but an example I
have seen suggests that to have retained the position regarding the
amount of tax relief available for a large company, the rate would have
had to increase to 133.5 per cent., because corporation tax has been
reduced. I would be grateful for confirmation from the Minister that
that is the case.</div>
					<a name="0805163000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is always
necessary to consider these reliefs and credits critically, by which I
mean assessing sensibly whether they are working. I wonder, given that
UK businesses appear to be very critical of the tax system and a number
of them are seeking to move abroad, because our headline rates are not
as low as those of some of our competitors, particularly Ireland,
whether the Government have looked at reducing some of these reliefs,
which would enable them to fund a reduction in rates. I should say for
the sake of clarification that I do not particularly advocate that
policy. It was set out&#151;and no doubt the Minister will refer to
this&#151;by the tax reform commission led by Lord Forsyth. It is a
recommendation that he made, but it is not one that my party has
adopted as such, and our policies will become clearer nearer the time
of the next election. It is a legitimate area for debate, whether for
the Opposition or the Government, to keep these matters under review
and I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s assessment of where
we
are.</div>

sure that if hon. Members who are going to participate in the debate
wish to refer to the schedule when dealing with the clause, that will
be sensible and will remove the necessity of a separate debate on the

							<a name="0805163000397"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> The 2007 Budget announced a
package of reforms to the business tax system, including changes to the
rate of corporation tax and the capital allowances 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div>system. As part of those reforms, the Government intended to promote
innovation by increasing the generosity of enhanced tax deductions
available to companies undertaking research and development that
qualified for the research and development tax credits, which were
introduced by the Government in 2000 for small and medium-sized
enterprises and in 2002 for large companies.</div>
					<a name="0805163000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means making changes to the
vaccine research relief, which allows companies to claim an additional
tax relief on top of R and D tax credits. The small and medium-sized
enterprises scheme and the VRR are both notified state aids and are
subject to the requirements of the framework for aids for research,
development and innovation. That is the combined effect of clause 24
and schedule
8.</div>
					<a name="0805163000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn to the points that have been raised, including the more general
point raised by the hon. Gentleman. We think and all the analysis
shows&#151;which I shall lay out to him as briefly as
possible&#151;that the R and D tax credits are having a positive
effect on R and D spending. It is with some amusement that I listened
to him waxing lyrical about the manufacturing industry, given what
happened to it when his party was in power. If future manufacturing
success depends on research, development and innovation, why was it
that the previous Government slashed the science budget, which has now
doubled under our Government? I am slightly resistant, in the
friendliest possible way, to taking lessons from the Conservative party
on these matters.</div>
					<a name="0805163000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
the hon. Gentleman will be delighted to know that the 2005 independent
survey of almost 1,000 R and D performing companies&#151;the largest
survey of its kind&#151;showed that three quarters of companies that
had claimed R and D tax credits found the process fairly or very easy.
The survey found positive signs of the early impact of the scheme,
bearing in mind that the legislation was introduced for large companies
only three years previously, in 2002. Some 55 per cent. of the
companies that had successfully claimed reported that they had been
able to change the amount or type of R and D activity that they
undertook as a result of claiming R and D tax credits.</div>
					<a name="0805163000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those results and the highly
successful take-up of R and D tax credits to date suggest that the
scheme was of sufficient value to influence R and D investment, and
that is why we are expanding it. The full effects of the fiscal
incentives are known to emerge only over the long term. The Institute
for Fiscal Studies has said that it could be as long as 10 years, but
the results have been encouraging so far, which is why we are proud of
the policy. International work by the OECD has led to a general
consensus about the positive relationship between R and D tax credits
and the amount of R and D, and we are comfortable with
that.</div>

hon. Gentleman made some broader points about competitiveness in
taxation that, strictly speaking, are not within the scope of this part
of the Bill. It is something that we are always extremely aware of, and
that is why my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has set up a
new group of people in industry to look at such issues more broadly. It
is not our policy to raise R and D tax relief to fund a
reduction in corporation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div>tax, which is at an historically low level&#151;indeed, much lower

							<a name="0805163000400"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> I wish to ask some brief questions about the clause
and follow the precedent set under the previous clause and address them
equally to schedule 9. SMEs in difficulty will no longer be able to
apply for R and D relief and vaccine research relief. The
clause requires them to be going concerns. If a company is in
difficulty, but has a legitimate expectation of succeeding, why should
it not be able to claim R and D relief and vaccine research relief?
Directors are personally liable for trading while insolvent, so why is
that not sufficient to prevent companies from claiming if they are in
difficulty? Within VAT regulations, there is already a regime that
restricts what companies may do so that they are not insolvent or in
liquidation. Why should the test be that they are a going concern, as
opposed to not being insolvent or in
liquidation?</div>
					<a name="0805163000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
the Minister consider that the clause will affect many companies?
Perhaps she can give an historical analysis of any companies that have
claimed R and D or VRR, when they were not a going concern. Having
asked for an analysis, however, we must appreciate that the economic
conditions might be somewhat bumpy, to use the words that the Governor
of the Bank of England used yesterday. In a downturn in the economy,
the provision might become increasingly important. The main point is
that the last accounts show that the company is a going concern. Does
the Minister anticipate that some companies may be seeking to make
applications for R and D relief or vaccine research relief slightly
earlier in the process than they would otherwise do in order to ensure
that they put the applications in before accounts are
published?</div>
					<a name="0805163000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">A point
made, perhaps not surprisingly, by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales is that the measure may create certain
pressures on auditors, who may be placed in a slightly more responsible
position than they were previously. Does the Minister think that that
an issue of any concern?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>
					<a name="0805163000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">My main concern is: why is the
clause particular? Was there not an alternative formulation on the
basis of companies not being insolvent or in liquidation that would
have perhaps been clearer for companies and perhaps not distort
behaviour, as there may be a danger that this clause and schedule will
do?</div>
					<a name="0805163000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805163000401"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman gets to the point in his
questions and I am grateful to him for that. Perhaps I can explain why
these changes are being introduced, which will answer his questions.
During the notification of changes announced in the 2006 and 2007
Budgets, the EU introduced a new framework for state aid for research,
development and innovation. That has led to a longer notification
process than might otherwise have occurred and the Commission has
looked more at the fundamentals of the scheme and how they comply with
the framework.</div>
					<a name="0805163000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
requirements is that state aid should not be used to support firms that
are in need of rescuing or restructuring, which this measure meets.
Recent examples from elsewhere in Europe have seen illegal aids
challenged and withdrawn. Therefore, it is obviously in our interest to
make sure that we meet the requirements of the framework, which we are
now seeking to do.</div>
					<a name="0805163000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tax
relief is designed to encourage and support companies to invest in and
undertake R and D. If a company is no longer a going concern any tax
relief paid to it will be used to meet creditor liabilities rather than
being used to invest in and undertake R and D. That is effectively
British taxpayers&#146; money and should not happen. A company must
make a claim for R and D relief in its annual tax return and in doing
so must consider its eligibility, including the eligibility criteria
around a going concern, in line with the scheme rules. If that places
an extra burden on auditors, that is not necessarily a bad thing. I
welcome my relationship with the ICAEW. Auditors need to exercise their
duties with responsibility. We can keep talking about that perhaps.

							<a name="0805163000402"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> Clause 26 places a cap of €7.5 million on
research and development aid on particular projects. I have a few
questions for the Minister, in order to understand the reasons behind
the clause and also to ask whether it will impose an additional
bureaucratic burden on firms. I will start with the second
point.</div>
					<a name="0805163000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that there are different rules as far as the relief is concerned for
research and development for small and medium-sized enterprises and
larger companies. In calculating the cost of a particular project, as I
understand it, under clause 26 it will be necessary for an SME to
calculate the various reliefs and tax credits that it has received in
respect of that project, both under the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div>rules that apply to SMEs and those that apply to larger companies, to
ensure that the cap threshold is not exceeded. Is that a correct
interpretation of what clause 26 will require? Does the Minister think
that that is a burden that may create
difficulties?</div>
					<a name="0805163000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that the Treasury assessment is that this particular cap is
likely to affect only 25 companies. However, given that the definition
of SME is being extended&#151;a point that I raised a moment
ago&#151;is it possible that it may apply more widely than that? In
addition to the complexity, my other concern is with regard to clause
26(1), which states
that:</div>
					<a name="0805163000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A company
is only entitled to R&amp;D relief in respect of expenditure
attributable to a research and development project&#148;.
</div>
					<a name="0805163000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to
set out the limits. However, what constitutes a research and
development project? I do not think that there is any further
definition. If one can break up a project into different elements and
define it in that way, the cap will be ineffective. Is there a commonly
accepted definition of a project? If there is not, it is an ineffective
clause, given what it is intended to
do.</div>
					<a name="0805163000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is the Government&#146;s intention in this area and why are they
introducing the clause? I believe that it is to comply with EU state
aid rules. That may not be a surprise to you, Sir Nicholas. Could we
have some clarification as to precisely why the Government are
introducing the cap? If relief for research and development is a good
thing, why is it only a good thing up to a certain amount? I seek the
Minister&#145;s clarification on those
issues.</div>

							<a name="0805163000403"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> In answer to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s final point, as with clause 25 and schedule 9,
clause 26 is concerned with ensuring that the SME R and D tax credit
and vaccine research relief continue to meet the requirements of the
European framework for state aid for research, development and
innovation. The clause introduces a cap on the amount of aid that
companies can claim under the SME R and D tax credit and VRR schemes in
respect of any one R and D project. That is because the EU&#146;s
framework requires that aid of more than €7.5 million needs to
be notified to the Commission separately and the incentive effect of
the aid shown. The Government believe that that would place a
significant administrative burden on businesses and seriously reduce
their certainty. If the incentive could not be demonstrated, all the
aid would be disallowed, not just the aid over €7.5
million.</div>
					<a name="0805163000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">A cap, which
applies to each project, is administratively less burdensome and gives
more certainly to claimants where their project is not close to
reaching that level of aid. We do not think that the changes will
affect many of the 5,000 companies that claim each year for the
reliefs. An alternative to introducing the cap would have been to
require companies claiming more than €7.5 million in aid in
respect of a particular project to individually notify that aid and its
effect on their R and D expenditure to the European Commission. I am
sure that Opposition Members and, if I may dare add, perhaps even
yourself, Sir Nicholas, would not have approved of that. It would have
resulted in considerably less certainty and more administrative
complexity for claimants. That is why we are proposing to do it in this
way&#151;precisely for the reasons that the hon. Gentleman
mentioned.</div>
					<a name="0805163000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">No single

estimate of the number of companies

would need to make a calculation only if they came close to that

have, of course, undertaken and published an impact assessment on that

asked whether the measure was burdensome. I have explained that it is
the most efficient way to do this. The impact assessment published with
this year&#146;s Budget estimated that the impact of the change would
be an additional total cost of &#163;12,500 per year, for all the
companies affected. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will realise that
that is a small amount per firm. I hope that that answers his

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805163000408"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> Clause 27 requires claimants of vaccine research
relief to make a declaration about the effects of that relief. That
declaration would state that the relief resulted in more expenditure on
research and development. I simplify, but that is the
gist.</div>
					<a name="0805163000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be grateful if the Economic Secretary confirmed the purpose of
the clause. Again, I think that the answer is, to comply with EU state
aid obligations. This point applies equally to clause 26. Will the
Government provide some reassurance that the UK will not be at a
competitive disadvantage, and that other member states either do not
have the research and development regime that we have or are required
to have in place the same restrictions and requirements that appear in
clauses 26 and
27?</div>
					<a name="0805163000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a curious requirement in the UK that a declaration must be made that
research and development has increased as a result of the reliefs
provided. I do not know whether there are any precedents, and whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>recipients of tax reliefs in other areas are required to make a
declaration. If there are, I would be grateful if the Economic
Secretary informed the Committee. How such a declaration would be
enforced and assessed raises one or two questions. Will recipients of
tax relief for research and development have to produce evidence to
support their declaration? What sort of evidence would be expected?
Will Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs police the declarations?
Will HMRC seek to review whether the declarations are correct? If it
does, how will it make that assessment, and what will happen if it
comes to a view that is different from that of the recipient? Or will
it be the case that as long as the recipient says the words that are
required, that is the end of the matter and there will be no further
investigation? Is the declaration intended to cause an increase in the
amount claimed for vaccine research relief, or will it increase the
amount of vaccine research carried out? In view of the declaration,
will companies change their behaviour and do more research, so that we
see greater spending?</div>
					<a name="0805163000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not aware of other parts of
the tax system in which recipients of relief make a statement of this
sort. Do the Government consider this a precedent that could be used in
other areas? Will future Finance Bills contain divisions whereby
companies make such statements? It is not entirely clear what the
purpose of such a declaration is other than, once again, satisfying the
EU state aid rules, and I would be grateful if the Minister provided
some clarification.</div>

Ussher:
						</b> Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman by setting
out a little context. Vaccine research relief is a closely targeted
scheme providing extra incentives, on top of R and D tax
credits, for research and development into vaccines and medicine for
the prevention and treatment of TB, malaria, HIV and certain types of
AIDS, which occur predominantly in the developing world. Such a
specialised scheme will, by its nature, have a small take-up. Because
it is a new scheme, and given the time lags inherent in the tax system
and the small number of large companies that make claims, there
is insufficient evidence&#151;we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div>have only anecdotal evidence&#151;to demonstrate the incentive effect
of the scheme as a whole. We cannot demonstrate the necessary incentive
effect to the European Commission at this point, because we are at an
early stage.</div>
					<a name="0805163000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
why we have introduced this self-declaration system, which applies only
to large companies. We presume that the additional administrative
burden is miniscule, and we do not think that it will have an incentive
effect for or against incurring the actual spend in the first place. We
anticipate that in due course there will be sufficient time-series data
to make our own evaluation, and it may be possible to return to the
Committee and say that the measure is no longer required. For the
moment, we feel that it is the simplest way to ensure that we do not
end up in complicated proceedings against the European
Commission.</div>
					<a name="0805163000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
answers the point about whether this puts us at a competitive
disadvantage&#151;absolutely not. Every country is subject to the
same framework. To give some context, the Spanish Government recently
lost a case at the European Court of Justice because their R and D tax
credit system was in breach of European rules. We think that by doing
this simple thing, we can ensure that we are not in that situation with
vaccine research relief. On the contrary, by having a European state
aid-approved system like VRR, our companies will be at a comparative
advantage, and that is obviously in the interests of all.</div>
