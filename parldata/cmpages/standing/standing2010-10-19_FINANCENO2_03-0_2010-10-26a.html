Leslie</strong> (Nottingham East) (Lab/Co-op):<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000338">&#160;</a>
                           </span> Good morning, Mr
Chope. What a pleasure it is to be back at the apex of our national
debate on financial
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is an honour to have the opportunity to talk about clause 11, which
refers to the financing costs and income of group companies. Hon.
Members will be aware that the worldwide debt cap rules came into
effect on 1 January 2010. They overhaul the taxation of
multinationals, restricting the UK tax deduction for interest costs of
UK companies that form part of a large group. Broadly, the purpose of
the rules is to ensure that the aggregate UK corporation tax deductions
for financing costs do not exceed a group’s external financing
costs on a worldwide basis. As far as I can tell, the rules are
primarily aimed at cash-rich, non-UK parented groups that fund their UK
operations via debt, and UK-parented groups with upstream loans into
the UK from overseas subsidiaries. Of course, as with many changes,
other groups of companies may also be affected.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Specialist
lawyers and accountants have pointed out that the debt cap rules will
result in additional administration, or perhaps a significant change in
tax costs for many large groups, although, quite rightly, it is a
measure designed to guard against excessive debt funding of UK
companies. Obviously, the measure was framed and devised when we were
under a different Administration—a happier Administration under
which the sun tended to shine far more frequently than it does
today.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
application of the rules can be complex. I am told that the basic
working of the debt cap remains unaltered from the 2009 changes. As I
said, the changes take effect from the beginning of the calendar year,
which is the start date for the debt cap rules as a whole.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
makes about 14 separate changes to the worldwide debt cap rules,
perhaps the most important of which is the new addition to the proposal
of a gateway test. In essence, if a group passes the gateway test, it
will not suffer any restriction of interest expense due to the debt
cap, and it will not have to prepare debt cap calculations. The gateway
is passed when the net debt of the UK-resident members of the group is
less than 75% of the group’s worldwide gross debt. However, the
gateway test is limited in its application. For instance, it is
unlikely to exempt wholly UK groups with intra-group debt from the
rules.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 70<a class="bkMark" name="Column70">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Further
changes are made in the clause, such as ensuring that when a UK figure
is being compared with a worldwide figure, the same amount is included
in both figures in respect of the same borrowing. There are exclusions
for certain securitisation companies. Another change ensures that
long-term arrangements that have the economic effect of loans are taken
into account for the gateway test. Those arrangements have been made in
the clause as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand that there are specific arrangements for industrial and
provident societies, which are of particular interest to me. From my
perspective, they are companies that the Treasury should encourage and
support. Will the Minster tell the Committee what those differential
arrangements for industrial and provident societies will be? As a
Labour and Co-operative Member, I am particularly interested in those,
and other Members might be similarly
interested.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
gather that all but one of the rules will apply retrospectively, and
issues always crop up when legislation applies retrospectively.
Schedule 5, which is linked to the clause, contains a lot of detail. I
will not dwell on the Government amendments to schedule 5, but they
might address the concerns raised by organisations such as Deloitte,
which is concerned that the amendments proposed under clause 11 and
schedule 5 offer only a partial solution. Deloitte has been
disappointed that Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs has not
addressed what it regards as some of the consequential issues regarding
the retrospective nature of the legislation. What further areas of
improvement might the Minister consider for future finance legislation,
because the Government amendments might not deal with all the concerns
that Deloitte has
raised?<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given
that the measure represents significant tax changes, I wonder whether
there has been a regulatory assessment of the accountancy and legal
advice costs to the affected companies. On balance, the changes are
probably favourable rather than burdensome but, setting aside the net
tax impact of the changes, company treasurers and directors of finance
are bound to face a steep learning curve, so I wonder whether the
provision has undergone a regulatory impact assessment, as used to be
the case under the previous Administration.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister consider passive income, which is when multinational foreign
subsidiaries generate income from assets that
are—arguably—UK assets, but are artificially located
offshore for tax reasons? We are discussing the global movement of
capital, and many of our constituents who have written to us recently
about tax changes and tax avoidance in general might not know the
intricacies of such arrangements. Whenever offshore tax sheltering is
raised, however, they are interested. There might be a loophole here
that the Treasury has considered in the past, and I should be grateful
if the Minister sets out the thought he has given to targeting passive
income.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My final
question for the Minister concerns whether financial services groups
are to be excluded from the debt cap rules. I understand that HMRC has
accepted that the proposed legislation would be
“unworkable” in respect of financial services companies.
That raises an eyebrow, however, because if it is unworkable for one
set of companies and in one set of circumstances, why is it not so for
others? There was a rumour or suggestion—I do not know where I
picked this up from—that there might be another attempt to
produce legislation to 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>bring financial services groups into the debt cap rules. If so, when
will that happen? Is such a measure likely to crop up as early as
Report, or will it be for general future
legislation?<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000036">&#160;</a>

Member for Nottingham East. They ranged broadly over the debt cap and
concerned clause 11 and schedule 5, both of which I hope to
address in my remarks, although we will deal with the Government
amendments in a separate debate.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 11
introduces schedule 5, which makes a number of changes to the worldwide
debt cap legislation that was introduced last year. The basic working
of the debt cap rules remains unaltered by such changes. The
consultation with businesses and their advisers identified a number of
situations in which the debt cap rules do not easily apply. The
amendments made by the Bill can be divided into four main categories:
to address mismatches between the worldwide and the UK measure of the
same debt; to address the effect of the debt cap on securitisation
companies; to deal with transactions that have the economic effect of
loans but are not lending; and some miscellaneous, minor changes. The
amendments will have effect from 1 January 2010, which was the start
date of the debt cap rules. They are a response to ongoing consultation
with a working group of interested parties and separate discussions
with the private finance initiative
industry.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall go through the schedule in more detail. Paragraphs 3
to 7 set out changes to the gateway test to which the hon. Gentleman
referred. It is the initial calculation undertaken by the worldwide
group each year to establish whether the debt cap rules apply. The main
changes are the inclusion of financial arrangements that provide a
return that is economically equivalent to interest and the exclusion of
share capital. Paragraph 7 of the schedule removes a mismatch when
different amounts are taken into account for the same liability by the
worldwide group and a United Kingdom company. Paragraphs 8 and 9 amend
the qualifying financial services group exemption and clarify the
meaning of “financial instrument”. Paragraph 12 defines a
group securitisation company and is one of the amendments that work to
exclude securitisation companies from main debt cap
rules.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Dual-resident
investing companies are dealt with under paragraphs 13 to 16. Such
companies are prevented from surrendering losses as group relief, and
restricting the debt cap disallowance prevents them from using the
disallowance to replicate the effects of group relief. The amendment in
the schedule prevents the group from voluntarily allocating a
disallowance to a dual-resident investing company and ensures that a
default allocation is made first to other group companies. Paragraphs
18 and 19 include as financing income guarantee fees paid or imputed
between companies. Guarantee fees are already included as a financing
expense. Paragraph 21 amends the test for group treasury companies so
that it applies to each company separately rather than to the financing
income of the companies that is being
aggregated.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Paragraph
22 prevents certain distributions of profit by industrial and provident
societies from being treated as financing expense or income. Paragraph
23 removes

                           </div>a regulation-making power concerned with short-term debt, which was not
practicable because it did not set up machinery to govern its use.
Paragraph 24 adds relevant public bodies to those excluded from the
debt cap rules. Paragraph 25 provides a new regulation-making power to
amend the calculation of the tested expense or tested income amount if
there is a mismatch between the accounts amount and the tax amount.
Paragraph 26 clarifies the meaning of ancillary expenses in the
available amount. The computation of the available amount is amended by
paragraph 27, which excludes securitisation companies from the
worldwide group while dealing with mismatches on interest and costs
paid by a member of the worldwide group that is also a partner in a
partnership.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Paragraph
28 provides a new regulation-making power to amend the available amount
if there is a mismatch between the accounts amount and the tax amount.
We shall return to that issue under the next group of amendments.
Paragraph 30 excludes as the ultimate parent of a worldwide group
limited liability partnerships and some collective investment schemes.
Paragraph 31 amends the definitions of “UK group company”
and “relevant group company” to accommodate
securitisation companies. Paragraph 33 deals with companies that are
party to capital market arrangements. It provides a regulation-making
power so that such a company can jointly elect with another company to
transfer its tax
liability.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000043">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Paragraphs
36 and 37 provide that the commencement date for the amendments is 1
January 2010. Regulations made under the powers in paragraph 33 can
apply only to tax liabilities due and payable after Royal Assent. A
group may elect that certain amendments to the gateway test apply only
prospectively. I hope that it was of help to the Committee for me to
provide an outline of the
schedule.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000044">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
turn now to some of the questions asked by the hon. Member for
Nottingham East, such as whether any thought has been given to
targeting passive income. It is worth highlighting the fact that the
Government are looking more broadly at corporation tax reform. Later in
the autumn, we will publish further details on possible areas of its
reform. We might look at that among our consideration of many issues,
and any further changes will be considered as part of that wider
corporation tax reform programme. I note his concerns, and he will be
aware that the Government are keen to reduce avoidance at every
opportunity.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000045">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of financial groups not being part
of the debt cap rules. There are no plans to make further changes this
year, but we will keep the matter under review. There is an issue with
financial services companies and interest, because of course interest
is part of what they do, as opposed to being merely a means of
financing their own business. That is why there have always been
particular complications in that area. As I have said, we do not intend
to make any changes at the moment, but we will keep the matter under
review.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000046">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is useful to know that the Minister will keep
the matter under review. Clearly, there have been concerns about
certain quarters of the financial services sector that have been highly
leveraged or have

                           </div>debt-finance arrangements that swirl around into complex sets of
circumstances. If the clause is designed to guard against cash-rich,
non-UK parented groups funding UK operations in a debt context, that
would seem to be relevant in many ways to parts of the financial
services sector. Will he give a commitment not only that this is a
matter for review, but that there is a broad intention at some point to
extend such rules to financial services, because that would give a
useful indication of his direction of travel? I entirely understand the
complexity, but it would be worth knowing whether such complexity makes
it impossible to cover the sector, or whether the Treasury will
endeavour to find ways to settle the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000047">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not want to go any further than I already have
this morning. There will be a wider review of corporation tax and how
we go forward on this area. With the treatment of debt, there are
particular issues with financial services companies and groups
containing them that mean that we need to look at the issue carefully.
I note the hon. Gentleman’s comments and we will take them into
account.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the retrospective nature of the legislation.
The original commencement date of the debt cap legislation was 1
January 2010. The regulations are made under the regulation-making
power contained in that legislation, and so have the same commencement
date as the primary legislation. That provides certainty and reduces
the need for transitional arrangements. Because some of the legislative
changes were announced in November 2009, there was an expectation that
the rules would apply from 1 January 2010. To ensure that that does not
add unfairly to the compliance burdens of groups, there is an
opportunity to elect that those parts of the debt cap rules affected by
the regulations do not apply until the regulations are
laid.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the regulatory burdens more generally, and
whether businesses and HMRC would have additional costs as a
consequence of the changes. The cost of the changes in the debt cap
legislation are negligible for both businesses and HMRC, which reflects
the fact that the proposed changes do not fundamentally alter the
operation of the debt cap rules, but ensure that they operate in the
way originally intended. Most of the changes do not make a difference
at all to the costs for groups, while others provide a small saving,
such as the exclusion of securitisation companies from the debt cap and
the changes to partnership
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman raised the issue of the debt cap working group. It will
meet before the end of the year to continue discussions. It is made up
of tax professionals and representatives from business, including the
big four accountancy firms, major commercial law firms and the CBI. He
also asked about further areas of improvement and highlighted concerns
raised by Deloitte. HMRC will continue to work with Deloitte and other
representatives, via the debt cap working group, to identify concerns
and
solutions.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked about industrial and provident societies. There is
a question of why payments by industrial and provident societies are
not already treated as interest under a loan relationship. There is a
special rule for industrial and provident societies that treats the
payments that they make to shareholders as 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 74<a class="bkMark" name="Column74">&#160;</a>
                           </div>interest under a loan relationship, whether or not those payments are
legally interest. That means that, for an industrial and provident
society, dividends and bonuses paid to shareholders are treated as
interest. A company’s relationship with its shareholder is not
one of borrower and lender, and so it is not correct that such payments
are included as financing expense or income in the debt cap
calculations of the company, and hence the changes contained within the
schedule. I hope that that is a helpful summary of the contents of not
only clause 11, but schedule
5.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000052">&#160;</a>

wider range of changes, and I am interested that further thought will
be given to corporation tax applicability and reforms more generally in
the autumn. I look forward to debating that with the Minister. I am
particularly pleased with his helpful explanation of industrial and
provident society arrangements. I have no objections to clause

                           </strong> These amendments are to paragraphs 25 and 28 and
both use the same wording. Those paragraphs contain powers enabling
regulations to be made where there is a mismatch between the amount
disclosed in the accounts of the worldwide group, which is known as the
accounts amount, and that shown as the tax amount by a UK company.
While drafting the regulations, it was discovered that the current
powers did not allow us to lay regulations to correct a mismatch when
an amount has been eliminated from the accounts of a worldwide group
and so has not been disclosed. That might be significant, because if
the interest arises on a loan between the members of the worldwide
group, the interest will not be included in the consolidated accounts
of the worldwide group, but it will appear as part of the tax amount of
the UK company. Before an amount of interest is included in a debt cap
calculation, other tax

			Column number: 75<a class="bkMark" name="Column75">&#160;</a>
                           </div>rules will have applied to it. As a result, there can be a
disproportionate effect on the debt cap and the UK company may be at a
disadvantage.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This is a
somewhat complicated matter, so it might help the Committee if I give a
simple example—I say “simple”, but the Committee
will be the judge of that. Let us take a group of two companies named A
and B that both prepare accounts to 31 December 2011.
Company A pays bank interest of £10 million, while
company B pays bank interest of £2 million, but also has a loan
from company A and pays that company £6 million. The
consolidated accounts for the group would ignore the loan between
company A and company B and would therefore show only the
£12 million interest paid by both companies to the banks. That
£12 million would be the accounts amount under paragraphs 25 and
28 of the schedule. The £6 million paid by company B
to company A is not disclosed in the accounts of the worldwide group
and so cannot be part of the accounts amount. The tax amount for
company B would the £2 million interest that is paid
to the bank and the £6 million paid to company A,
which makes £8 million in total. Because the £6 million
paid by company B to company A is not disclosed in the accounts of the
worldwide group, it is not possible to make an adjustment under
paragraphs 25 or 28 to mitigate the impact on company B’s debt
cap computation of other tax rules that apply to the
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
of those tax rules is the late interest rule, which states that in
certain circumstances a company paying interest to a connected person
can have a tax deduction for the interest only when it is paid and not,
as is usually the case, as it accrues. For example, therefore, of the
£6 million interest paid by company B to company A,
£4 million of it accrued from 2003 to 2006, but was not paid
until 2011. Including several years’ interest in the debt cap
computation of company B might have an adverse effect on the
computation of the debt cap disallowance. As I said, that intra-group
interest is not disclosed in the accounts of the worldwide group, so we
cannot make an adjustment to the debt cap computation to deal with it
at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
8 and 9 extend the definition of “accounts amount” so
that if no amount is disclosed in the accounts of the worldwide group
in respect of a matter, the accounts amount is nil. Conversely, the
definition of  the “tax amount” of the UK company
is also amended so that if no member of the worldwide group is entitled
to a deduction under UK corporation tax, the tax amount will be nil.
The amendments also allow for the possibility that more than one UK
company will be entitled to a deduction and, if so, the tax amount in
respect of the matter is the total of such deductions. The amendments
enable one immediate issue to be addressed, and allow for similar
issues to be resolved as they
arise.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000061">&#160;</a>

forgiven if they did not. I hope, however, that it proves to have been
a helpful explanation. The area is very technical, and I hope that the
Committee is to some extent enlightened as to the need for the
amendments, which support the position of representative bodies. It did
not become clear that the amendments were needed until relatively
recently, which was why their content was not included in the original

relates in part to the amendments. Paragraph 25 of schedule 5 cites a
series of regulation-making powers that the commissioners have. I am
not au fait with the mechanism for making such regulations. I presume
that there is some delegation to the commissioners to make regulations.
Alternatively, is there a statutory instrument, passed through either
the negative or affirmative procedure? Will the Minister indicate the
point at which those regulations might surface in the public domain and
tell us whether Parliament will have any say over them? Otherwise, I am
content with the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000064">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I welcome the hon. Lady to her position on the
Opposition Front Bench. I am grateful for her remarks about the clause,
which concerns consortium claims for group relief. It widens the
circumstances in which a loss arising in a UK consortium can be set
against the profits of a company that is subject to UK tax. It also
separately counters avoidance by tightening rules that allocate losses
to a member in proportion to its
interests.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
may be helpful to say a word or two about the background. The purpose
of the consortium claims regime is to support enterprise when joint
trading projects are undertaken, which may be too large, too risky or
too complicated to be undertaken by one company on its own. This is
achieved by enabling losses and other reliefs to be claimed or
surrendered, in proportion to ownership, between a corporate member of
a consortium and a consortium company. A consortium claim represents
one of the two types of claim covered by the UK group relief system,
the other being a group claim when a parent company owns at least 75%
of a subsidiary’s share
capital.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
rules governing the two types of claim differ in various ways,
particularly in respect of the ownership requirements. A consortium
claim is possible when a consortium member holds as little as 5% of a
consortium company’s ordinary share capital. If a consortium
member is part of a corporate group, another member of that group may
claim the losses to which the consortium member is entitled. That is
commonly known as the “link company rule”. Under current
rules, the link company must be UK-resident. Those provisions extend
the rules to permit a claim where a link company is established in the
European economic area. In such circumstances, a UK tax loss may then
be set against a profit subject to UK
tax.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Separately,
a consortium relief avoidance scheme has recently been identified. It
enables companies to manipulate the rules and obtain relief for a
proportion of the consortium’s losses that exceeds their actual
involvement in it. The provisions in clause 12 amend the rules. They
allocate a consortium’s losses among its members by ensuring, in
addition to existing requirements, that loss relief is proportionate to
a member’s voting power, and that voting power is an effective
means of controlling the consortium company. To address the avoidance
scheme as quickly as possible, we announced that we would legislate
from the date of publication of the draft clause on 12 July
2010.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
measure reflects the Government’s commitment to preventing tax
avoidance while ensuring that the tax regime shows that the UK is open
to business. I hope that the Committee will agree to allow the clause
to stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000075">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As I said, we broadly welcome the changes to the
consortium conditions in the Corporation Tax Act 2010 through the
relaxation of the definition of a link company so that it includes
companies established in the EEA. As the Minister has explained, that
currently applies only to linked companies that are established in the
UK, so I have tabled a number of probing amendments with regard to the
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000084">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am
particularly querying why the Government decided to limit the extension
to companies established in the EEA, rather than to worldwide link
companies. Is there a specific policy reason why the restriction
applies to companies established in the EEA? Is it because there would
be an unacceptable cost if it were extended  on a
worldwide basis? Is restricting it to companies established
in the EEA consistent with EU law? It has been suggested to us that the
issue might give rise to legal
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the policy side, it has been said that the proposed amendment to the
consortium claim rules is inconsistent with the rules relating to group
relief that permit the tracing of groups throughout worldwide
companies. Under the changes introduced in the Finance Act 2000,
following the ICI <em>v </em>Colmer decision, the Government took the
approach of allowing group relief eligibility to be traced through
non-resident companies, whether based in the EEA or outside it. That
was seen generally by the corporate world as a helpful development.
Against that background, it is surprising that, in the much less common
situation of consortium claims made via link companies, a more narrow
approach has been adopted. Will the Minister explain why the Government
have decided to go down that
path?<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
suggest that the limited relaxation of the rules to EEA companies only
complicates the group relief rules overall and possibly provides a trap
for the unwary. If there is no or a minimal cost to doing so, I should
be grateful if the Minister explained what the predicted costs are
likely to be and said whether there was a financial reason for imposing
the limitation. If no cost is involved, we recommend that the
relaxation should be extended to worldwide link
companies.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">More
importantly, we believe that the provision could be in breach of EU
law. I accept that it is always difficult to follow oral examples of
companies when discussing complex arrangements, but let us take a
situation in which a UK company owns 100% of a US company, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 79<a class="bkMark" name="Column79">&#160;</a>
                           </div>which owns 100% of an EU company, which owns 50% of a UK
trading company and assume that the other conditions for a consortium
claim, with the UK company being the claimant and the UK trading
company being the surrenderer, are satisfied. As it stands under
section 133(6), a consortium claim would be denied. It has been
suggested that that is clearly discriminatory against the EU company
because it treats an investment by the EU company in the consortium
less favourably than if the EU company had been resident in the UK. As
such, that is a clear breach of the freedom of establishment of that EU
company.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000088">&#160;</a>

challenge? Will he also answer my earlier question about whether there
is a public policy reason or financial reason for establishing the

                           </strong> I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to this
group of amendments and I appreciate the probing nature in which they
were tabled and introduced by the hon. Lady. The issue being raised is
about whether the proposed changes in the Bill might not go far enough
to ensure EU compliance. That view is not shared by the Government.
Broadly, our position is clear: direct tax policy is a matter in
respect of which individual EU member states have sovereignty over
their own regimes, but we accept that that sovereignty must be
exercised in a manner consistent with EU law, including the fundamental
freedoms. The Government are clear that the legislation should be
sufficient to comply with EU law, but go no
further.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments seek to go further than what we believe is necessary to
comply with EU law. They seek to extend the scope for consortium relief
claims to be made. First, the changes would allow claims whenever a
link company was resident, which goes beyond the requirement that a
link company must be UK-related or established in the EEA.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
they would remove the requirement, under the intended extension for EEA
link companies, that a link company and a UK claim or surrender company
that is a member of the link company’s group must be connected
through a group relationship that does not extend outside the EEA. The
hon. Lady gave a helpful example, which I know the Committee always
appreciates. The combination of those two changes would significantly
extend the range of situations in which claims would be
permitted.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government considered those issues when they were raised during the
consultation, and we do not accept that such changes are required to
ensure compliance with EU law. EU law does not extend the freedom of
establishment to companies outside the EEA, and the amendments would do
that, in going further than EU law requires by gold-plating compliance
at the Exchequer’s
expense.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000093">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Certainly. By “gold-plating”, I mean
that were we to agree to the amendments—I accept they are of a
probing nature—we would be going further than the minimum
requirement for meeting our EU obligations, by extending the measure to
include link companies

			Column number: 80<a class="bkMark" name="Column80">&#160;</a>
                           </div>outside the EEA. That would have a cost, which the hon. Lady
specifically asked about. There is a potential cost of £5
million in tax arising from the discontinuing of litigation from
earlier periods in three known cases, and there is potential for
additional claims to be made. There are also likely to be consequences
for HMRC’s position on wider group-relief EU litigation, with
additional cost implications. So there would be a
cost.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady raised the issue of UK group relief, and highlighted a case
from 2000. The UK group relief rules were amended in 2006 to reflect
the decision in the European Court of Justice on the Marks and Spencer
case, which concerned group claims to group relief. The Government do
not accept that that decision means that the consortium relief rules
are non-compliant with EU law.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The rules
relating to group and consortium claims are different, not least in
that companies within a group are under common control, whereas a
holding of only 5% can be sufficient to give entitlement to consortium
relief. Therefore, we do not think that it follows that the analysis
applied to group structures in the Marks and Spencer case also applies
to consortium
structures.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000097">&#160;</a>

may have said “£5 million” on the potential cost;
I meant to say £50 million, so my apologies for that. I am sure
that the hon. Lady is aware that a cost would be involved were we to
accept the amendments. We do not think that they are necessary to
comply with our EU obligations; we are successfully doing that as the
clause currently stands, and also minimising the cost to the UK
Exchequer. For those reasons, I hope that she will withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000098">&#160;</a>

amendment looks at the limitation of group relief based on the
proportion of voting power held by a company. In tabling probing
amendment 21, which simply adds the words “or indirectly”
after “directly”, we pose the question as to why there
should be limitations on group relief based on the proportion of voting
power held by a company. It has been suggested that the schedule as
drafted, which includes only directly possessed companies, could deny
consortium claims in many legitimate circumstances and possibly in
every case where there is a holding company.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000102">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
will illustrate my point with another example. I apologise in advance
for its complexity, but it is unavoidable if I am to try to get the
point across and get on the record how this would work in practice.
Suppose that company A is a member of a consortium and owns
50% of company B, which is a holding company, and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 81<a class="bkMark" name="Column81">&#160;</a>
                           </div>company B owns 100% of company C, which is a trading company. Company A
wants to claim losses from company C.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Even if all
the other conditions for the claim are satisfied, the new condition in
section 143(3)(d) will arguably always deny a consortium claim, because
the claimant company, company A, will not directly possess—as
the wording in the schedule as drafted states—any of the voting
powers of the surrendering company, company C. The same
issue arises when A is the surrendering company and C is the claimant
company, hence this probing amendment, which states that indirectly
owned companies should be included in the
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister may argue that section 153(3) of the Corporation Tax Act 2010
deems the consortium members to possess directly already the voting
power in company C. It is by no means clear, however, that
that would be accepted if it was subjected to legal challenge. I would
suggest, therefore, that rather than using the term “directly
possessed”, the schedule should use “directly or
indirectly possessed”, so that the voting power can be traced
through the holding company.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Alternatively,
“directly possessed” should be explicitly defined, with a
reference to section 153(3), to put the point beyond doubt. I would be
grateful if the Minister clarified whether he has taken legal advice on
that point, and whether he believes that the provision as currently
drafted serves the purpose that it is intended to
serve.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000107">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As we have heard, amendment 21 would alter the test
limit of the allocation of losses that may be claimed or surrendered
between a consortium company and a consortium member. It would extend
the new test so that it included both indirectly and directly held
voting power.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are introducing the measure to counter avoidance. HMRC has
been made aware of several schemes that have taken advantage of the
rules as they stand. As with all anti-avoidance legislation, the
Government are committed to ensuring that genuine commercial
transactions are not affected. We have taken on board comments received
during the consultation period over the summer to make sure of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment, however, would loosen the legislation unnecessarily and
weaken the avoidance rules. Including indirect voting power would mean
that the voting power held by subsidiary companies could be attributed
to a consortium member. While that would extend the percentage
entitlement to losses in some limited situations, it would open the
avoidance window that we are looking to close. Tax avoidance
opportunities would continue, and I am sure that that is not the
intention of Opposition Members, although I understand that this is a
probing
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
we were not to tighten this particular area, the cost would be likely
to be somewhere in the region of £30 million a year.
Amendment 21 would broaden the entitlement to losses for some
consortium members in complicated situations, but it would also allow
the continuation of the avoidance schemes that we wish to close.
Extending the measure to indirect voting power would prevent the
attribution of a subsidiary’s holding. A subsidiary can, if
conditions are met, make its own claim and, in such situations, there
is no disadvantage. We have made

                           </strong> We support the clause, which extends research
and development tax relief for corporation tax to situations in which a
company does not hold intellectual property rights relating to such R
and D.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The previous
Labour Government recognised the importance of providing incentives to
companies to encourage research and development, so we introduced a
scheme for small and medium-sized enterprises in 2000. That provided an
extra tax deduction of 75% on qualifying R and D expenditure that was
incurred either in house or on a contracted-out basis. If the SME was
loss-making, we provided that the relief could be exchanged for a
payable credit from HMRC. There was a sister scheme for large companies
that SMEs could claim under if they did not meet the criteria for
eligibility under their own scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The relief
applies when an R and D project has the aim of achieving an advance in
overall knowledge or capability in the field of science or technology
through the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty,
rather than simply an advance in the company’s own knowledge or
capability. It therefore concerns R and D that will benefit not only a
particular company or organisation, but the scientific or technological
sector as a whole and, indeed, the wider British economy. That was why
we thought that it was important to introduce such reliefs and tax
credits.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The relief
also applies when a company intends to start up a business as a result
of the R and D. It therefore also acts as an incubator for new
companies, which is important if Britain wants to compete, to be
innovative and to succeed in the global
marketplace.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Until
now, legislation has required the intellectual property that is created
as a result of the R and D to which expenditure is attributable to be
vested in the company in question. In other words, if a company or
organisation wishes to claim relief under the SME scheme, it must own
any intellectual property that might arise from the project. The then
Labour Chancellor announced in his pre-Budget report on 9 December 2009
that the condition relating to intellectual property would be abolished
from that date, meaning that that would take effect for accounting
periods ending on or after 9 December 2009. This provision gives effect
to that announcement, which the Labour Government instigated. It was
part of the broader picture of how we 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 83<a class="bkMark" name="Column83">&#160;</a>
                           </div>wanted to promote innovation and investment in
R and D and a result of listening to what SMEs
and start-ups said that they needed. As such, we wholeheartedly support
the measure and the fact that it will be effective in relation to
expenditure that has been incurred since the date on which the change
was originally announced.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister tell us what analysis has been made of the consequences of
removing the condition relating to intellectual property? What
additional benefits does he think that that will bring in helping SMEs
with R and D and encouraging them to invest in more of that?
Will it encourage greater take-up of R and D relief, as we believe that
it will, and will that be kept under review? Are there other measures
that could usefully have been considered and included in the Bill to
help SMEs at this difficult time? Could we introduce measures to ensure
that investment in R and D—investment in the future of not just
a business itself, but the whole sector—does not fall victim to
economic circumstances in which belts are being tightened? The clause
is quite narrow, but we would appreciate it if the Minister would
indicate the Government’s thinking about wider support, and tell
us whether there is a reason why more measures were not introduced in
the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000121">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Again, I welcome the hon. Lady’s broad
support for the clause. The Budget confirmed the introduction of a
measure that will make it easier for innovative small and medium-sized
companies to claim research and development tax relief. R and D tax
credits provide an enhanced deduction for qualifying expenditure. The
system addresses the market failure reducing the levels of R and D
activity undertaken by UK companies. Since their introduction, the
schemes have incentivised more than £40 billion of R and D
activity by more than 18,500 companies.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
removes the requirement that an SME must hold the intellectual property
created as a result of the R and D. That means that SMEs undertaking
R and D activity are able to claim without considering their
IP ownership. In addition, those SMEs carrying out subsidised R and D
that have been prevented from making R and D claims under the large
company scheme by the IP condition are now able to claim the large
company R and D relief. A number of companies undertaking R and D found
that the IP condition effectively barred them from being able to claim
the relief, which prevented them from making valuable investment in R
and
D.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about the impact of this. Approximately 5,700 companies
a year claim SME R and D relief, and the change will mean
that such companies will be able to claim without distorting commercial
arrangements in relation to IP. It will enable innovative companies to
access R and D tax relief more
easily.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000124">&#160;</a>

to the question raised by the hon. Member for Bristol East about R and
D tax credits, a consultation to be published later in the autumn will
look at the tax treatment of R and D tax credits and intellectual
property more generally, and this will form part of the
Government’s aim to create the most competitive corporation tax
system in the G20. The SME R and D tax credit scheme has been in place
for 10 years. The consultation will provide an opportunity to take
stock of the impact and effectiveness of the schemes. It will look at
the options for re-focusing to ensure that they are effective and
provide value for money while giving certainty and stability within the
context of the five-year corporation tax road map. The Government
certainly recognise the importance that companies place on the schemes,

broader question of investment allowances? That is of great concern to
businesses in my constituency, especially those that are trying to
invest in the high-tech equipment that enables them to have a global

tax system to build on what has already happened in R and D tax credits
and ensure that we have a corporate tax system that encourages
enterprise and innovation and is the best in the G20. We did believe,
however, that we should proceed, in advance of the consultation, with

years of Labour Governments we took great strides in supporting the
British film industry, attested to by the success of a lot of British
films, both at the box office and at an artistic level, in winning
awards. I am a Bristol MP, and the film industry in Bristol is a
thriving creative sector. I think that three films are being filmed in
Bristol in the near future, funded with support from some of these
measures. We have Aardman Animations, which manages to scoop awards at
the Oscars most years. It is important, therefore, that we continue to
support the production of British
films.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000138">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Measures
to support the production of culturally British films were introduced
in the Finance Bill 2006 and came into effect on 1 January 2007. The
relief allows an additional deduction based on UK expenditure by
companies on the production of films qualifying as culturally British,
which is determined by a culture test. That raises various interesting
issues that are not the subject for debate today, but the idea that we
can define “culturally British” is an interesting
concept.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
rules also provide that losses sustained in production can be
surrendered for a payable tax credit. The key features of the support
are that it is provided directly to the film production company, not
only to those whose only involvement is that of providing
finance.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000140">&#160;</a>

We have a situation in which the British Film Council is being axed and
there are question marks over what will happen to support for the
British film industry because of that. It is important that we
recognise the incredibly valuable contribution that it makes
economically as well as to the cultural life of this country and to how
Britain is perceived overseas. It also has an effect on tourism in this
country. It is important that we look at the wider

come now to the existing relief provided to companies that make
culturally British films to be shown in cinemas, when at least 25% of
qualifying expenditure will take place within the UK. Qualifying
British expenditure is defined as services performed or goods supplied
in the UK. I have referred to when the House of Lords Committee took
evidence on that a few years ago. Most witnesses who gave evidence saw
the relief as absolutely essential to the future and health of the
British film industry. Tim Bevan, who was co-chairman of Working Title
and went on to become chairman of the UK Film Council, said that the
film tax credit

                           </div>was also noted that the rates were more generous in places such as
Australia, Canada and Ireland. The Lords recommended that the rate of
the tax credit be kept under review by the Government, in consultation
with the industry, to ensure that the UK does not become uncompetitive
as a venue for international film making. Can the Minister say a few
words on whether the Government intend to revisit that issue in
future?<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000149">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
specific provision in the Bill is a small, but still important, measure
that will help to support the continuing success of the British film
industry. Currently, film production companies that make films in which
production spans two or more accounting periods, including some
overseas expenditure, may suffer from an unintended restriction on
their ability to surrender a loss for a tax credit if there is
increased spending in the UK in the second or subsequent accounting
periods. The clause introduces a revision to how the amount of the loss
that is surrenderable for the tax credit is calculated, and thus
removes the anomaly in the amount of tax credit claimable. As intended,
the amount of film tax credit available is the same, regardless of the
profile of the UK
expenditure.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000150">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
such, we welcome the provision, but can the Minister say more about
what he thinks the likely consequences of it will be? Are there any
plans to do more to support the UK film industry and to keep the
situation under review in years to
come?<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000151">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 14 corrects an unintended anomaly in how
payable film tax credit is calculated. It ensures that the amount of
credit given will depend only on the total UK and foreign expenditure,
regardless of the order in which the expenditure is
incurred.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new film tax relief was introduced in 2007 and, as we have heard, it
has been widely welcomed. Undoubtedly, the 2007 version was an
improvement on earlier versions, which were too widely used for
purposes of tax avoidance and were not, perhaps, focused on providing
support to film makers. To date, about £300 million
has been given to companies making British films, mainly in the form of
payable tax credits, so more than 400 films have been
supported.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
became clear that the rules give a slightly different outcome depending
on the order in which UK and foreign expenditure is incurred. The
effect has been to restrict relief when UK expenditure increased in
later periods. That was never the intention, and the clause corrects
the problem. It brings the rules into line with the scheme as it was
originally announced, which will benefit the hundreds of companies that
claim the relief and will help to maintain the creative industries in
the UK as a success

legislative change on the film tax credit has to be to help the

the proposed changes are for the betterment of the industry. How will
they ensure that the industry will grow and that opportunities will
continue to exist? In my constituency of Strangford, and in Northern
Ireland as a whole, the film industry brings a large proportion of
revenue and provides jobs off that as well. Obviously, we want to

Middle Earth, the hon. Gentleman has highlighted the importance of the
film industry to the UK economy as a whole and to individual areas. I
confess that I am not as familiar with the constituency of Strangford
as I am with my neighbouring constituency of Watford, but in both cases
the film industry is important, as hon. Members have
highlighted.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000156">&#160;</a>

encourage film production in the UK. The relief that is in place helped
to secure investment into the UK of about £900 million in
2009-10, which is significant. There will be fluctuations from year to
year—film is an international business and some films can
involve substantial investment, which may create such fluctuations. The
film relief state aid approval runs out in 2012, and that will be an
appropriate time to review the effectiveness of the existing film tax
relief. We will look at that. Hon. Members’ points on the
significance of the film industry to the UK have been well made. As a
Government, we will look at what we can do to support that industry in
the most effective way
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000157">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 15 deals with the situation where there
is a transfer of insurance contracts from a UK company to another
company that is carrying on the insurance business but does not have a
permanent UK establishment, and where the assets, immediately after
their transfer, are not part of a fund equivalent to the with-profit
fund for the insurance company. Currently, as I understand it, the
company to which the business is being transferred will not fall within
the tax law definition of an insurance company and the provision that
we are looking at prevents the loss of tax in such circumstances. As
such, we welcome the
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000161">&#160;</a>

if the business is transferred to what is deemed to be a non-insurance
company and is an exclusively non-profit business, no account is taken
of the transferred liabilities’ value as the transfer charge is
computed. If the fair value of the assets transferred exceeds the
amount brought into the account of the transferor by those transferred
assets, this provision will allow the excess, plus the value of certain
liabilities transferred, to be treated as an amount brought into
account, and the transferor will be taxed accordingly. That is my
understanding of the reasons behind this provision, and I would be
grateful if the Minister elaborated. If I am correct, we are in favour
of the provisions in the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000162">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
the hon. Member for Bristol East pointed out, clause 15 modifies the
rules that apply when liabilities under long-term insurance contracts
are transferred from one company to another. Such a transfer of
business will involve not only the transfer of liabilities, but the
transfer of assets held to meet those liabilities. The current tax
rules are necessary because transferring assets in excess of
liabilities could allow taxable profits to escape tax. Current rules,
however, do not always give the right result.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
attempts to address an unintentional tax charge. A UK company wishing
to transfer insurance contracts to a company outside the European
economic area, or to an EEA company without a UK permanent
establishment, could be taxed more than it should be. As the hon. Lady
pointed out, the tax would be on the full market value of assets
transferred, without any deduction for the value of the liabilities
that the assets are intended to meet.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In addition,
the solvency II directive will introduce significant changes to the
regulation of insurance companies in 2012. It aims to produce a
modernised, risk-based approach to such regulation while ensuring that
there is appropriate protection for policyholders. In preparation for
that change, insurers are considering whether business that is written
in non-EEA countries should continue to be administered, and thus
regulated, in the EEA. The prospect of a significant unwarranted tax
charge inhibits what should be a commercial decision, which is bad for
fostering the insurance business within our country. Accordingly, we
are modifying the rules to remove inhibition to making commercial
decisions. Critically, however, we are still ensuring that profits
cannot escape the UK untaxed.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The rule
changes have been made following discussion and full consultation with
the life insurance industry. The clause fixes an unintentional tax
charge that inhibits commercial
transactions.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000169">&#160;</a>

me try to address the points that the hon. Member for Bristol East
raised. The revenue will be negligible because there is no scorecard
impact. On fair value, the rules will be consistent with those that
apply across the rest of the insurance industry, while the date she
mentioned is simply the date of the emergency

                           </strong> Such costs would be minimal because we have
well-established methods of assessing fair value. I have set out how
HMRC can play its role in benchmarking whether that fair value seems
reasonable. We do not expect a significant cost. The provision will
correct an anomaly in the current system that we want to remove, and I

                           </strong> The clause is straightforward and welcome. It
addresses the situation of a private dwelling house in which an adult
placement carer is living. At present, an individual who owns a
dwelling house that has been his or her residence for some time is
entitled to private residence relief from capital gains tax when they
dispose of the property. That means that if it has been categorised for
capital gains tax purposes as their only—or their
main—home, they will not have to pay capital gains tax when they
sell it. There are certain limitations to that. If the house has been
occupied as the sole or main residence for only part of the period of
ownership, it is possible that the profit on disposal would be partly
taxed. If part of the property has been used for other purposes during
all or part of the period of ownership, any gain on the whole house
will be apportioned accordingly. For example, if it was assessed that
someone had used 50% of a property as their only or main dwelling
house, they would not have to pay capital gains tax on 50% of the
profits, but if the other half of the property had been used for
another purpose—for example if it had been sub-let—they
might have to.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That raises a
problem for adult placement carers, who provide accommodation and
support to adults in need of care who are placed in their properties.
That is obviously something important that we want to encourage,
because people in that situation might well prefer to be placed in
someone’s private residence, rather than in a larger facility
that is shared with others. Such people might have become unable to
continue living in their own homes. However, it is possible that the
arrangement could give rise to a capital gains charge because part of
the property could be deemed to have been used for semi-commercial
purposes.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000179">&#160;</a>

official channels.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000181">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The situation
to which my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral South refers raises some
complicated concerns, because such an arrangement is almost like a
semi-family situation. The property could be deemed to be being used as
someone’s dwelling house, particularly if someone has been
living with the family as a foster child for a long time. If such an
arrangement had been made on a semi-commercial basis—for example
if the adult who had been placed in the property was paying
rent—that would raise some questions. I would be grateful if the
Minister addressed those and stated whether the clause is restricted to
people who come through the adult placement service, which is the
regulated process, or whether it has wider
implications.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000182">&#160;</a>

disincentives for people who are worried that they will be subject to
capital gains tax on the profits arising from the disposal of their own

having an adult placed in their home. We broadly welcome the clause,
but I would be grateful if the Minister clarified the parameters of the
provision and stated the situations in which it would apply. What could

way of background, I should say that private residence relief is
available to individuals who make a gain on selling or disposing of
their only or main homes. In most cases, the relief ensures that people
have no capital gains tax to pay when they dispose of their homes. It
is possible that some adult placement carers are losing part of the
relief on their homes. The risk arises because private residence relief
is not available for any part of the home that is used exclusively for
business purposes.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000186">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
limitation could have an impact on some carers. The terms of an adult
placement scheme may require the carer to set aside part of their home
exclusively for the use of the person in their care. That part of their

                           </div>home could be in use exclusively for business purposes and private
residence relief might then not be available on that part of the home.
As a result, the carer could face a capital gains tax bill on part of
any gain that they make on disposing of their
home.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000187">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Hon.
Members asked whether this measure was just restricted to adult
placement carers. It is, but the point is that other shared-life
carers—foster carers, for instance—do not face the same
issue because a part of their homes is not set aside exclusively for
caring and, therefore, for business purposes. The issue arises only in
the circumstance that I have
described.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000188">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Will the Minister clarify that? I am sure that
Committee members are familiar with people taking an elderly relative
into their home and having what is colloquially known as a
“granny flat”—a separate part of the accommodation
that is used solely by that relative.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000189">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Often these
days, with people finding it difficult to get on the housing ladder,
young couples move in with their parents—they may have had a
child when young—and might live in accommodation that is
similarly ring-fenced, with its own bathroom and kitchen. They may pay
rent, so that there is a semi-commercial relationship with the owners
of the property as well as the family relationship.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Would that
also create problems in respect of people’s capital gains
situation? If so, can anything be done to deal with that? The spirit of
the provisions on capital gains tax properties is that they are
designed more for people who own lots of dwelling houses
commercially—buy-to-let or whatever; they are not designed to
discourage people from taking in family members and giving them a roof
over their heads when they need
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000191">&#160;</a>

predominantly by someone for whom care is being provided, under the

where part of the home is used exclusively for that individual. It is
in those circumstances that we run into this difficulty, whereas foster
carers, for example, are not deemed to use a part of the home, or to
set part of it aside, exclusively for business. We do not believe that
the restrictions on private residence relief would cause a

schemes. In such a scheme, part of a home—a room, for
example—might be designated exclusively as being for the person
to whom the care is provided. We do not believe that that issue applies
more widely in foster care, for example. If that experience arose, we
would consider it, but we are not conscious that it has ever been an
issue. The problem arises in the context of adult placement schemes,
where there is a degree of exclusivity in respect of part of a

generously. I assume that the reason why the provision has been
introduced is that situations have arisen in which what we are
discussing has been a problem for people in the adult placement carer
scheme and they have been subject to capital gains liability. I assume
that the provision is not intended to be retrospective.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000196">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We believe that 100 or so people may benefit from
the clarification of the law and that therefore it is the right thing
to do. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee recognise the
valuable and much-appreciated service that carers provide to the
community and to the individuals receiving care. The whole Committee
would agree that it is not right that a carer under an adult placement
scheme should lose private residence relief or that it should be at
risk. Although other reliefs may shield the carer from a tax charge,
the protection is not
certain.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
fundamental point is that the property is still the carer’s home
and they should be entitled to the normal relief. Clause 16 responds to
the concerns. It removes any doubt that adult placement carers are
entitled to the full benefits of private residence relief, including
relief on any part of their home that they use for the care of an adult
under the scheme. The important point is that the clause provides
certainty. That certainty will be welcomed and ensure that carers are
not unfairly penalised or put off providing care by the worry of a
possible capital gains tax
bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are no current cases of which we are aware in which people are not
going to benefit from the change because of the historical position,
but the important point is that we have a clause that provides clarity
in the future. We do not want to put people off providing care. That
would be unfortunate and it is not the intention behind private
residence relief. Therefore, we think that this is a useful
step.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000200">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Is there any possibility of the
provision’s being abused? I assume that in most cases when
people participate in the adult placement carer scheme, just one person
is placed in their home, so it is fairly clear that they are just
taking part in what we all agree is a very worthwhile venture. Would
the exemption from capital gains tax apply to those who have several
people and for whom the situation is almost equivalent to running a
nursing home or care home but the person who owns the property happens
also to live in part of that property as their dwelling
house?<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000201">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Are there
limitations on the extent to which the provision would apply? Let us
say, for example, that someone has three or four people living in the

of it as their private dwelling house.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000202">&#160;</a>

providing in the clause relates only to adult placement carers—a
point that the hon. Lady raised herself. It is relatively narrow, so we
do not particularly see vulnerability. She outlines perfectly
reasonable circumstances that we do not think will fall within the
circumstances outlined in the clause, because it relates to adult
placement carers. That means, by and large, circumstances in which an
individual uses their home in providing support to a small number of
people. We are not talking about big nursing homes, equivalent care
homes or anything of that sort. We are talking about individuals using
their home to provide that support. I am sure that hon. Members on both
sides of the Committee will support this clarification, which I hope
will prevent any uncertainty about how the capital gains tax relief

clause extends the scope of the chargeable gains ring fence
reinvestment relief legislation. Reinvestment relief was originally
introduced in the Finance Act 2009. It allows companies to
remove a chargeable gain arising on the sale of an asset, provided that
the proceeds from the sale are reinvested in oil and gas assets in the
UK or the UK continental shelf, subject to certain conditions being
met.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000208">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
relief was intended to be available in a group context when the
disposal is made by one company in a group and the reinvestment is made
by another company in the same group. Amendments tabled in Committee
when the legislation was introduced sought to ensure that. However, a

in such

relief is now extended by the clause to include those cases where
disposal and acquisition are made by different companies in the same
group of companies. The clause thus ensures that the original policy
intention of the reinvestment relief legislation is achieved. The
legislation was intended to apply in those circumstances when it was
introduced in 2009 and, to reflect that, the clause has effect in
respect of disposals made on or after 22 April 2009, the day from which

overenthusiastic welcome from my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham
East; I think he is probably expecting to hear something slightly more
exciting about the provision than he will actually
hear.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000212">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
the Minister explained, the clause addresses a problem with the
drafting of the original legislation and reinstates what was always
intended. Ring fence reinvestment relief provides that when a company
disposes of assets used for the company’s UK or UK continental
shelf oil and gas trade, it can claim that any gain arising shall not
be a chargeable gain, subject to certain other conditions being
met.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
existing legislation was designed to ensure that the relief applied to
circumstances where the new asset was acquired by a different company
in the group to which the company disposing of the old asset belonged.
The clause has been introduced to ensure that that result will be
achieved.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
legislation was badly drafted in the first place and did not achieve
the effect that was intended. I would appreciate it if the Minister
outlined whether that has had consequences. I understand that the new
provision will be backdated to the date of the original legislation and
that people will therefore be able to rely on it as if it had taken
effect on that date, but are there other consequences that we need to
address?<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000215">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Can
the Minister tell the Committee a little more about the revenue
implications of ring fence reinvestment relief more generally, given
the importance of the UK oil and gas trade and in view of expected
trends that may occur as the industry changes over time? What modelling

a particular example—it had been owned by BP, but its licence
has now been bought by a company called Apache, which has in many
respects given it a new lease of life. As a result, the reserves that
we continue to get out of Forties are probably far more than if that
licence had been retained by BP. Such changes are important because
they remove the barriers that stop licence trading transactions from

things did not occur as my hon. Friends and I would have liked. None
the less, our Bill, and the clause that we proposed in our initial

                        <p class="tabbed">I would
welcome public discussion on a couple of key points. First, we have set
an €85 million cap on the scheme. In three or four years’
time, that might or might not be appropriate. I recognise that the
Treasury can, under schedule 7, introduce regulations to make changes,
but it is important to produce a report saying how the cap has operated
over the three years to 6 April 2013. Have currency fluctuations meant
that the cap is worth less or more than it was at the start of the
scheme in 2010? Is the cap in 2013 appropriate for the last two years
of the scheme? I recognise that there will be constant monitoring and
evaluation, but it is important that we publish a report looking at
these issues and do not just have a stand-alone piece of secondary
legislation, which might be passed in a Committee like this one at some
point in future, irrespective of what has happened overall in the
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am
interested in the definition of “Firms in Difficulty”. We
need some assessment of how many firms in potential
difficulty—particularly in what might be economically
challenging times over the next two to three years—would 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 98<a class="bkMark" name="Column98">&#160;</a>
                           </div>be, could be, or are applying for the scheme. How many would have got
the allowance, are getting it, or could be turned down? That needs to
be reflected on, in relation to the definition of firms in difficulty.
There will be constant monitoring of that issue, but I would be
interested—this is why a mid-point report is particularly
valid—to know how many firms were turned down, and whether the
definition was still appropriate at that time.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000236">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We need some
public facts and figures, which, as the amendment sets out, would form
a report for publication on the operation and take-up of the scheme. It
is important to look at the conditions in proposed new section 45DB,
which is set out in schedule 7. That new section lists a range of
exclusions from the allowance. It is important to monitor, look at and
develop that, taking into account the regulations at the time. I want
the scheme to succeed, and it is a good scheme, but it is important to
monitor it constantly.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000237">&#160;</a>

have been made. Will those exclusions continue for the duration of the
scheme? Will representations be made on them in due course? If 
the Minister looks at page 61, as my hon. Friend the Member for

point is that, under the legislation, we are talking about a five-year,
limited scheme. Organisations outside this House have welcomed the fact
that the clause enables companies to plan ahead and look at the capital
expenditure for goods vehicles for the future. As part of that
commitment to planning ahead, the Minister could, through the
amendment, examine the success, operation and take-up of the scheme at
year 3, and all the issues that I have mentioned. She could indicate
whether the scheme will come to an end in 2015, as proposed in the
Bill, or whether it could, based on the assessment, continue.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000241">&#160;</a>

valuable, with regard to forward planning, to build in a test mark at

scheme will end in 2015, or whether it will be considered for
continuation. What views do the manufacturers and purchasers of said

purpose of the amendment is to bring about a formal review—for
formal publication and for formal consideration—at the mid-point
of the scheme so that we can take account of the many changes that
might occur between now and 6 April 2013 in the manufacturing of, and
the demand for, vehicles that produce lower emissions. I want to
encourage the manufacture and purchase of such vehicles. I hope that
the clause will bring about both those things, and by encouraging
purchase, we will encourage

18 and schedule 7 provide for a 100% first-year capital allowance for
expenditure on zero-emission goods vehicles such as electric vans. This

is a sense of being careful to ensure that it is targeted. On the one
hand, we are keen to stimulate the market in this area. It has been
clearly shown that similar measures have led to a decrease in emissions
from cars over time because investment in technology has improved. We
are now keen to look at what we can do to achieve a similar improvement
on van emissions which, as I am sure the hon. Lady is aware, are still
a significant part of motor vehicle emissions in the UK. On the other
hand, however, we need to ensure that any relief is appropriately
targeted. The measure will hopefully not only kick-start the electric
van market and send a signal that people have a time frame within which
they can invest, but—and the amendment refers to
this—give the Government the ability to look at the continued
targeting of such relief and ensure that it remains appropriate and of
good value to the
taxpayer.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000253">&#160;</a>

many respects, our debate is getting ahead of where the market is at
the moment. Last year, only about 175 electric vans were purchased. The
measure is aimed at stimulating that initial purchase, rather than any
secondary

vans are an emerging technology, and their uptake will help to reduce
CO2 emissions in the transport sector. Current sales are
low, with only 175 new registrations of electric vans in
2009, and the Government are committed to making the transport sector
greener. The scheme is aimed at supporting nascent and innovative
transport technologies—not only electric vans but hydrogen fuel
cell-powered vehicles. It will encourage the further development of
such technologies and increase the size of the electric van market,
thus bearing down on CO2
emissions.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000256">&#160;</a>

is right to point out that although we are talking very much about
vans, the provision relates to goods vehicles. That is because some of
the technology is literally very heavy, and we therefore needed a

would require the Treasury to produce a report for publication by 2013
on the operation and take-up of the first-year allowance for
zero-emission goods vehicles provided by clause 18. It is, of course,
important to ensure that any tax measure is implemented properly and
has the desired effect. The Chancellor keeps all taxes and
reliefs—including this one—under review precisely to
ensure that they are achieving their aims. It is unnecessary to put the
commitment in amendment 12 into primary legislation, mainly because we
will be able to see the registration of electric vans within details of
the registration of new vehicles, and also because industry bodies,
such as the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, are obviously
very keen to monitor the

right hon. Member for Delyn talked about reviewing progress. When
comparable measures have gone through the House—one that springs
to mind is the relief on stamp duty for zero-carbon homes—people
have been able to establish the progress of the relief and how widely
it is used through parliamentary questions. There is therefore no
danger that we will somehow be unaware of the effectiveness of the
relief, and I assure the right hon. Gentleman that the Government hope
to ensure that it is effective, because that is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000260">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the important point about exemptions, the reason for them is that we
have to comply with state aid rules. Due to its narrow focus, the
scheme is a notifiable state aid, so the legislation has to comply
fully with state aid rules and we have to reflect that in the Bill. Due
to its environmental nature, the scheme can be introduced under the
terms of the general block exemption, but that requires restrictions to
be placed on certain trade groups benefiting from the allowances and,
as we have heard, a cap on the amount of aid that businesses can
obtain. Designing the scheme to comply with those conditions has
avoided the need to undertake a lengthy process of negotiation with the
Commission. The legislation is designed to comply fully with the state
aid
rules.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000261">&#160;</a>

Strangford—Portavogie village—is one of the biggest
fishing ports in Northern Ireland. Many van salesmen face increasing
costs and wish to consider the use of electric vans, but they do not
always have the capacity to cover sufficient distance due to lack of
progress and technology. I am concerned that the clause means that
those people will not be able to participate. I understand the reasons
given by the Minister, but will she review whether there are
concessions available under European law—under the de minimis
clause, for example—that would enable provisions to be
made?<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000262">&#160;</a>

kind of measure’s relationship with Europe, but that is more a
matter of debate for Europe than it is for us today. On the one hand,
we want to ensure free competition across Europe, and the state aid
rules help to ensure that. On the other hand, we want to make progress
on bearing down on emissions. The clause and schedule stay within the
scope of European Union legislation. As I said, the scheme constitutes
a notifiable state aid, so we had to be

midway review was so that we could test the impact that she expects.
She has helpfully mentioned that about 175 electric
vehicles are in current use. Under the clause, how many vehicles would
there be in 2011-12, 2012-13 or 2014-15? There is a five-year proposal,

establish first-year allowances for zero-emission

built up into a case to prove it would work. Hence the need for a

that time, rather than bizarrely putting this requirement into primary
legislation. As far as I am aware, this kind of requirement is never
put into primary legislation; we hold Ministers to account on the Floor

60 vehicles have been purchased, how do we know what the

have to consider whether the exclusions that my hon. Friend the Member

factories and businesses that are being developed, which my hon. Friend
the Member for Wirral South has mentioned, are still in the same
situation. If we know clearly what the Minister wants to achieve now,
we can review with certainty in 2013 whether those objectives have been
reached. We will be able to amend the scheme or advance proposals
before it ends in 2015, and/or we can give businesses clarity about

objectives of the scheme on his own Benches, because presumably his
colleagues the former Ministers generated and brought forward the
measure. It is a measure that we are happy to endorse because we are so

Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism, so I was not dealing with the
matter at that stage. At some point, it is our job as the Opposition to
ask the Minister what the clause will achieve. What outcomes is she
seeking? Are they the same outcomes that my colleagues were seeking
previously? What outcomes are the Government trying to achieve? I want

over the previous three years, how many vehicles have been purchased
because of the scheme, the cost to the taxpayer, the benefit in respect
of CO2 emissions, details of the current operation and
whether people have found the scheme to be worth while. The report
should note that there are two years left of the scheme and state
whether the Government intend to continue its operation or pull the
scheme because it has not proved successful.<a class="bkMark" name="10102632000289">&#160;</a>
