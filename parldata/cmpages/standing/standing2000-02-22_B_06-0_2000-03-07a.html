<H4><center>Tuesday 7 March 2000</center></H4>
<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. John Butterfill in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/054/2000054.htm">Postal Services Bill</a></center></H3>
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Consumer Council for Postal Services</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competitiveness </B>(Mr. Alan Johnson):  Clause 2 creates a new consumer body, to be known as the Consumer Council for Postal Services, which will represent the interests of consumers of the universal postal service. It replaces the Post Office Users National Council and the three national councils for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales that were established under section 14 of the Post Office Act 1969, and which the Bill abolishes. The clause gives effect to schedule 2, which contains detailed provisions relating to the membership and consultation of the council.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page </B>(South-West Hertfordshire): As the Minister says, the clause creates the son or daughter of POUNC. I must confess that I feel a little sorrow that we shall witness the end of a clear acronym. Many a business, having spent tens of thousands of pounds establishing the brand, would be most reluctant to see it go and be replaced by the CCPS, which sounds like a subset of the old Soviet Union.
<P>
Much of the detail is specified in schedule 2. We shall want to probe the status and independence of the new organisation. The Minister will recall that in discussing clause 1 and schedule 1 he went out of his way to explain how independent the regulator will be, but when we examined clauses 32 and 33, we found phrases such as, "the Secretary of State may give directions", so we shall be most interested to examine related provisions later in the Bill.
<P>
It took a little time to drag out of the Minister the estimated cost of the new commission and the regulator. I hope that he will be able to say a little sooner how much it will cost to run the new consumer council. Schedule 2 will give us the opportunity to probe the details.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> We appreciate all the work that that splendid body POUNC has done over the years. The name had to change, because we are no longer dealing only with the Post Office but with the regulator, the new consumer body and universal service obligation providers, which may not always mean the Post Office, although initially it probably will. The estimated cost did not have to be dragged out of me; clearer questions would have been clearly answered in the previous debate. The estimated annual cost of the CCPS is between £2 million and £2.5 million.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Consumer Council for Postal Services</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Duncan </B>(Rutland and Melton): I beg to move amendment No. 50, in page 59, line 8, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'after consultations with the Trade and Industry Select Committee of the House of Commons'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Reflecting on the previous debate, we could have created the Postal Users National Council, which would have been PUNC.
<P>
The amendment is a replay of an amendment that we tabled to schedule 1, so we shall repeat the exchange that we had on that. However, the amendment remains valid. We should like the Bill to include recognition of the fact that, in making such appointments, the Secretary of State should consult the Select Committee on Trade and Industry. An established working relationship between the two would be only for the best. Will the Government reconsider the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): The Minister rejected the previous amendment on this point, but I do not understand what he has against the Select Committee on Trade and Industry. After all, the hon. Members for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) and for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton) are members of that Committee and it is difficult to think of two colleagues from whom it would be better to take advice. He is happy to have them here supporting him and, given that all three of us are members of the Select Committee, we would be an excellent body of people to consult. It would be disappointing if the Minister did not hold his hon. Friends in sufficiently high regard to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lindsay Hoyle </B>(Chorley): Some people might go along with that, but given the attendance rate of some members of the Committee, perhaps they should reconsider what they are saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> We need consistency in the Committee. I shall give you an example, Mr. Butterfill, of how that desired state is being reached. Last week, Mr. Hood gave permission for members of the Committee to remove their jackets. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am amused that your first contribution should be to allow us to take off our jackets. I take the view of former President Reagan, who always refused, out of respect for his office, to take off his jacket in the Oval Office, so I shall keep mine on.<P>
</UL></FONT>--[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 2 March 2000; c. 101.]<P>

<P>
The amendment is a rerun of a debate that we had last week on the commission. I do not think that the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) was present, but I said that I bowed to no one in my respect and admiration for the Trade and Industry Committee. I was a member of it for six happy months. I am talking not about its competence or otherwise to carry out such a splendid job, but about the amendment being an impractical and unnecessary obstacle. Never in the history of POUNC did the Trade and Industry Committee suggest in its numerous reports that it should have an input into the selection of its chair or secretary. Therefore, there should be no question of its being concerned with how we propose to appoint the chair or members of the CCPS.
The amendment makes no provision for what happens if there is disagreement between the Secretary of State and the Trade and Industry Committee. Given all the procedures set out in Nolan, it is ludicrous that the Trade and Industry Committee, having not been party to any of the various procedures adopted to reach the final selection, should have a say in the final selection. We will be consistent with last week's decision and reject the amendment if the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton cannot be encouraged to withdraw it, although he was not encouraged to remove his jacket at our previous sitting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Every now and then, out of respect to my shirt maker, I shall display the brilliance and style of his craft. We have rehearsed the argument. It is a replay. We remain unconvinced of the Minister's argument, but none the less, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 61, in page 59, line 14, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> '( ) In appointing persons under this paragraph or paragraph 2(1)(a), the Secretary of State shall have regard to the desirability of including among the members of the Council one or more persons who--
(a) have experience of work among, and the special needs of, disabled people, or
(b) have or have had a disability.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is uncontentious. We want to make it clear that the Secretary of State must have regard to the desirability that council members include persons who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>have experience of work among, and the special needs of, disabled people, or . . . have or have had a disability.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is similar to an existing requirement for POUNC, but that is contained in the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970; on reflection, we thought that it should be included in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I did not understand the hon. Gentleman's point; is he saying that there is provision in that Act for such an appointment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Yes, it is an existing requirement for POUNC in the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. For the sake of consistency, it should be included in the Bill; it would be ludicrous for it not to be included.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I have concerns about the amendment. I understand that it is required to make the Bill consistent with existing legislation. We may need the provision if an inconsistency subsequently arose--but I suspect that it would not.
<P>
The amendment strikes a rather patronising attitude that I find disconcerting. Members of the Committee are as one in wanting proper provision for the disabled. Indeed, one reason why that is not only possible but compulsory in Britain is the disability legislation introduced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) when he was Minister for Social Security and Disabled People, before he was elected Leader of the Opposition. He felt deeply and personally involved in that legislation, which he oversaw through the House. However, in securing that proper provision for the disabled, I question whether there has to be such a quota; the amendment effectively states that the Secretary of State must fill that slot on the new body with, if not a disabled person, then someone who has worked with the disabled. We should encourage--particularly in the wake of the evident success of the disability legislation introduced by my right hon. Friend--the treatment, wherever possible, of the disabled as normal members of society who are not to be patronised or treated any differently, except inasmuch as their disability means that they require help.
<P>
The element of tokenism in the amendment concerns me. In other processes of decision-making, particularly in the House, one does not have to be personally involved in an area to understand it--one does not have to be a murderer to understand legislation about murder, for example. An organisation of the sort proposed does not have to include a disabled person; it is more important to ensure that our entire legislation is properly directed so that in all areas, not just the Post Office or postal communications, the disabled are properly catered for in the design and the equipment of buildings and in the way in which they are treated.
<P>
The amendment suggests that the sector requires special attention, but I would like to think that disabled people throughout the country already enjoy the sort of special attention that any civilised society should rightfully give to them. Our standards have risen and our disability legislation is--thank goodness--working well, so the amendment is superfluous and risks being nothing more than a slightly patronising and unnecessary gesture. If the legislation works well, the amendment should not be necessary.

<P>

<B>Mr. Colin Breed  </B>(South-East Comwall): I have some sympathy with that approach because other interests should perhaps also be represented in the legislation. During the Committee stage of the Regional Development Agencies Bill, we included on the boards of the regional development agencies representatives of environmental, rural and other interests. To pick out one interest on this occasion emphasises that we are either making it a special case or not recognising that there could be wider representation on the council. For instance, a case could be made for people who represent the elderly or those in rural areas. We are talking about access to postal services. Two or three groups with various special needs require access to postal services and we are trying to ensure that all groups are represented. Either we should not accept the amendment or we should expand it to ensure that those with special requirements for access to postal services are also considered.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I have no particular quarrel with this amendment. I think that it is a further example of the parliamentary draftsmen trying to keep up with the Bill. It was spotted that the provision in the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 needed to be incorporated into this Bill. I suspect that we will see that happen a great deal when we consider the 200 or so further Government amendments. I suspect that the parliamentary draftsmen are working hard on similar provisions. My point follows on from that made by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed). Under the schedule, the only specific group that will be required to be represented will be the disabled. It could be said in parenthesis that the Minister previously refused to include the homeless as a category to be considered. What is the difference?
<P>
 The schedule does not give any indication of who should be included on the Consumer Council for Post Services. There are many different consumers of postal services--the business community, private individuals such as those living in rural areas, and the elderly. I urge the Minister to consider including on the council at least one sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress.
<P>
Like other hon. Members, I have spent the past couple of weeks visiting post offices in my constituency. It was an interesting exercise. It brought home the diversity of rural post offices and the wide range of services that they provide. They have to provide a combination of interacting services in order to survive. One postmaster told me that he was now as dependent on the national lottery terminal in his post office as he was on the benefit cheques that he encashed during the week. He also has an off-licence so that he is able to sell whisky. He is providing a valuable community service.
<P>
The amendments tabled to schedule 2 are of a technical nature. I see that there will be no other opportunity to deal with this subject, so it will be helpful if the Minister can tell the Committee now what it will look like. Will it just be POUNC under another name? When considering whom he puts on this committee, I urge him to include a representative of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, not as a statutory obligation but because it provides an enormous service to the Post Office and to the community as a whole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I do not want to make a great deal of this because I understand the arguments about tokenism and the suspicion that we might be patronising a certain group of people. I merely point out that the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 contains a requirement for POUNC to include a person who has experience of disabled issues. We are saying not that the Secretary of State must appoint a disabled person or someone who has experience of working with the disabled, but that the Secretary of State shall have regard to the desirability of including among the members of the Council such a person. Whatever we do this morning, the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act will continue to contain that requirement for POUNC. We could amend the Act and change the reference to POUNC to a reference to CCPS, or delete it altogether. It is more open to amend the Bill as we propose. Things have changed since 1970, but it would send the wrong signal if we dropped the representation of a group that is currently required to be represented on POUNC when we change it to the CCPS.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall spoke about the elderly and people in rural areas. I do not think that there is any chance of the elderly not being represented; with all due respect to the people whom we appoint, at least one of them will probably be categorised as elderly. People in rural areas will be specifically represented, because subsequent clauses contain the right to set up committees and sub-committees on certain subjects. Similarly, post office advisory committees now cover rural areas, and I have no doubt that that will be the case after the change.
<P>
Last week, the hon. Member for Banbury drew attention to the argument about the homeless when we talked about the commission having responsibilities towards certain categories of people. No representations have been made by organisations such as Shelter or Centrepoint to express specific concerns about the homeless and postal services, but there is enormous concern about the disabled and postal services.
<P>
The articles for the blind service allows any item up to 7 kg to be posted free anywhere in the world. The service is crucial because, as was once pointed out to me, a copy of "Gone with the Wind" in braille would run to something like 10 volumes and would be enormoulsy difficult to move around the country. People who are blind and visually disabled depend heavily on braille, talking books and other services provided by post.
<P>
The Post Office network is ubiquitous, with 28 million people a week visiting post offices. It is important that post offices have access facilities for the disabled, especially as the disabled rely on them more than many other groups. Although we do not discount arguments for representation of other groups, it is the disabled--the group currently represented on POUNC through different legislation--whom we are concerned about in relation to postal services.
<P>
The hon. Member for Banbury made an argument about including sub-postmasters or sub-postmistresses on the CCPS. Such people are not ruled out from serving on the council, but we must draw a distinct line. As high as my regard is for sub-postmasters all over the country, there will sometimes be a conflict of interests between the consumer, sub-postmasters and members of the Communication Workers Union. There is bound to be tension. I can think of a couple of cases in which it would arise, but I shall not go into them.
<P>
We are not saying that people from fixed categories must be on the CCPS, such as a postwoman, a sub-postmaster or a supervisor from a major processing centre. We want to represent consumers. I ask the Committee to support the amendment, although I recognise the points that have been made. I hope that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton accepts that we are talking about a specific difficulty in terms of existing requirements under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I beg to move amendment No. 85, in page 60, line 27, at end insert 'is reasonable'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments:
<P>
No. 86, in page 60, line 34. at end insert 'is reasonable'.
<P>
No. 87, in page 60, line 37, after 'such', insert 'reasonable'.
No. 88, in page 60, line 42, at beginning insert 'reasonable'.
<P>
No. 89, in page 60, line 48, after 'receive', insert 'reasonable'.
<P>
No. 90, in page 60, line 50, at end insert 'is reasonable'.
<P>
No. 54, in page 62, leave out lines 6 and 7.
<P>
 No. 92, in page 62, line 7, at end add 'is reasonable'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I do not want to start the Committee on a jarring note by being reasonable, but the amendments relate to the use of the word "reasonable". They are similar to some that we have previously tabled in that they are designed to provide a limit on, or definition of, rather general language. In considering bills, we often encounter a problem in trying to make provisions more specific and explicit.
<P>
Amendment No. 86 relates to the provision that covers approval by the council of allowances and travel expenses, to which we feel should be added the word "reasonable". Amendment No. 87 relates to the pensions, allowances and gratuities that the council will determine, as does amendment No. 88. Amendment No. 89 relates to compensation, as does amendment No. 90, and amendment No. 92 relates to expenses.
<P>
The amendments relate to the assessment and agreement of expenditure. It seems rather unsatisfactory not to include the words "as reasonable" in each case, or to specify a limit or procedure to ensure that what is arrived at is reasonble, acceptable or open to discussion and examination. The wording as drafted,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "as the Secretary of State may determine"<P>
</UL></FONT>,
<P>
is rather loose.
<P>
We should be worried, because, as I have said previously, no cost or impact assessment has been made of the Bill. Many items will be involved, some of which will be quite large, such as pensions. The procedure seems to lack transparency, and the Bill does not seem to acknowledge the importance of ensuring that such expenses are reasonable. Perhaps the Minister will propose another way of dealing with the matter at a later stage. Having considered the various items involved--expenses, pensions, allowances and gratutities--I believe that a long list of payments and costs will be involved that are subject to no definition or limit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> You will have noticed, Mr. Butterfill, that amendment No. 54 nestles in the middle of the Liberal Democrat amendments like a jewel in the sea. I shall return to it in a moment.
<P>
We all want to be reasonable, and when challenged we always like to believe that we are being reasonable and that the other person is being unreasonable. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) sets a tone with his amendments. We have general sympathy with his objective, but I doubt whether inserting the word "reasonable" would succeed in achieving it, because the word is like a piece of string. It is of indeterminate length. I hope that the amendment will encourage the Minister to flesh out a little the various costs of running the son of POUNC.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 54 would leave out lines 6 and 7 on page 62 of the Bill. Let me make it clear that we do not want to remove from the new organisation its source of funding. That would cripple it immediately and make it inoperative. An effective monitoring council is necessary. We wish to probe the Minister--I was about to say to come clean, but that would be unfair--to be a little more expansive about how the system will operate. The new consumers council will be an independent body, but paragraph 7 of the schedule is redolent with phrases such as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> the council may--with the approval of the Secretary of State, pay any member of the committee . . . The Council may, with the approval of the Secretary of State . . . pay to or in respect of any person who is or has been a chairman . . . to make such payments, with the approval of the Secretary of State".
<P>
As for the provision covering staff, the Bill states:
<P>
 The Council shall, after consulting the Secretary of State, appoint a person as principal officer.
<P>
All such provisions will cost money. The Minister can see that the hand of the Secretary of State is firmly on the tiller of the organisation. Yet we expect it to be an independent body, act on complaints and ensure that consumers are represented adequately. I have noticed in life that he who pays the piper calls the tune. If the consumer council is to be so dependent on the financial decisions of the Secretary of State that run through the schedule in great detail, will will the new council be able to play a full independent part in protecting the interests of the consumers of postal services? With that in mind, I hope that the Minister will not accuse me or my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton of wanting to remove all forms of finance from the body. We do not. We want to know how it will be controlled and how reasonable its decisions will be.

<P>

<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Weston-Super-Mare can safely be described as reasonable. I understand his argument. Clearly, licence holders who are expected to bear the cost of the council should expect payments that are made with their money to be reasonable. However, the amendments would not achieve anything of practical value. Even if it were asserted that the council of the Secretary of State might act unreasonably, what does "reasonable" mean? If they act unreasonably, they will be open to challenge on the grounds of public law anyway. The amendments do not offer a specific test of reasonableness or a requirement for expenditure to be referred to a third party if a conflict arises about reasonableness. There are checks and balances in the system of public finances that are designed to ensure that such expenditure is reasonable without inserting spurious qualifications in the Bill.
<P>
The budget for the council will have to be compiled in accordance with the fees and charges guidelines. Sometimes, with hindsight, expenditure is seen as unreasonable, and there are different views on what is 129 130 reasonable, but the amendments do not deal with either of those problems. The Bill was drafted in accordance with other legislation, such as schedule 2 of the Gas Act 1986 and schedule 1 of the Post Office Act 1969, in which there are no specific references to "reasonableness". The Bill creates a tier of controls; there is Parliament's control over the funding voted to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State's control over the membership of the council and the council's powers relating to anyone other than council members. The Bill accords with common good practice.
<P>
Later, we will debate Government amendments Nos. 93 and 94, which will ensure that the accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. His staff are keen to search out any unreasonable expenditure, and anyone making decisions on the payments will have regard to that. The Opposition amendments would add nothing to the Bill and create confusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Sir John Bourn, is not to question policy. The schedule also relates to the commission, but I shall not dwell on the draft guidance on social and environmental policy again. If I did, you would rightly call me to order, Mr. Butterfill. The Comptroller and Auditor General would not be able to query any of the Minister's policy decisions, some of which may be very expensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> We are not talking about policy; we are talking about the "reasonableness" of the expenditure. All the amendments relate to that. Not only is our drafting consistent with all the other legislation, and not only would it be difficult to include the word "reasonable" without defining what it meant, but we shall propose later that the accounts be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who will consider the reasonableness of the expenditure, not in terms of the policy, much of which is set out in the Bill, but in terms of the abstract notion of "reasonableness". I hope that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare will withdraw his "reasonable" amendments.
<P>
I understand that amendment No. 54 is a probing amendment, If it were accepted, there would be no funding for the CCPS. Last week, in another debate, I explained that we would table an amendment that could be debated only under the money resolution. We intend that the commission will raise funding for the council through licences. That is not explicit in the Bill, and we intend that our amendments will make it so, as set out in last July's White Paper.
<P>
The mechanism will operate via the Secretary of State, who will need to keep a close eye on costs, and the functions will be exercised independently by the CCPS. The money will go into the Consolidated Fund, and we will propose an amendment that provides for a vote for the commission, while making it clear that the money going to the consumers' representative comes from the licence fee. In all but the most extraordinary unforeseen circumstances, the £2 million to £2.5 million that it will cost this year will be paid for by the Post Office. That is in line with the proposals for the other utilities. We will tease out more of this on further amendments, but that is our idea of how the funding system should work. I hope that hon. Members will not press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I thank the Minister for being reasonable--to use that word again. I accept that the word "reasonable" is not really defined. The Minister understands that the objective of the amendment was to raise that issue. I was interested in what he said about the Comptroller and Auditor General and about general legislative practice. We accept the requirement that, by implication, the payments must be reasonable. I hope that we have demonstrated the need to question the amounts being paid. Not having been, like the Minister, a Member of Parliament for long, I do not know whether other committees look at the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, to assess whether his conclusions are correct. As it has been common practice to examine the costs of new organisations and legislation, I am happy to leave the issue. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 52, in page 61, line 17, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(including quorum)', and insert 'but such procedures must specify a quorum of either 50 per cent. of its membership or three, whichever is the greater.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am inclined to say, "Here we go again". We have had more repeats than the BBC on this issue. It is marginally more important the second time around because we are dealing with a slightly different body, although the amendment is identical to one that we moved to schedule 1. We wish to establish clarity in the Bill on the quorum for any decision-making process or important meeting of the Consumer Council for Postal Services, just as we attempted to do for the Postal Services Commission. I accept that the commission, which is effectively the regulator, will have strict rules. I do not say that it will have a greater sense of responsibility, but it will be inclined to behave much more like a business, with all the scrutiny that businesses face. A consumer body, in this case the CCPS or POUNC, or whatever one calls it, will quite rightly have a strong consumer agenda. We welcome that. It is what one might call the original, balancing purpose; that is why it exists. However, there may be vying factions within the CCPS that are legitimate but none the less different, with different priorities and approaches to the task that they have been set under the Bill. There might, for example, be regional differences and one might see a marked contrast between the priorities of those who look particularly to urban areas and those who look particularly to rural areas. The make-up of the CCPS may therefore be less homogeneous than that of the commission and there would be the risk that any small faction of the CCPS could be excluded from an important decision. Even if there were no great manoeuvrings, plotting or mischief in the matter--no ragging behind the bike sheds, as it were--proper representation of a small body of opinion may none the less be denied. That possibility makes establishing a quorum all the more important. I can envisage a course of events whereby the CCPS might--to make the point well but perhaps too strongly--be hijacked by a body of opinion that could exclude alternative opinions.
<P>
The quorum required to make a decision is therefore more important for the CCPS than for the commission. We are debating the same concept a second time. We have moved the same amendment as we moved to schedule 1, asking for a quorum of three, or 50 per cent., whichever is the larger. That quorum should apply to the consumer council in order to avoid any faction of the council pushing forward an agenda that would not meet with the approval of its other members. We need a united front, a cohesive point of view and a broad measure of unity and approval across the various parts of the consumer council, so I hope that this time the Minister will reconsider his view that a quorum should not be specified in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> As the hon. Gentleman says, this is a rerun of a previous debate. He argued that there was a better case for this amendment.
<P>
Our argument is that we should not set a quorum for the CCPS. As paragraph 10 of schedule 2 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The Council may regulate its own procedure (including quorum).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are saying not that a quorum should not be set but that the council should set its own quorum, and that we should not set the quorum in the Bill. That is the same argument as we had about the Postal Services Commission--the regulator--last week. Although the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton said that there was a better argument in favour of setting a quorum for the consumer representatives than for the regulators, I would argue that the argument is worse.
<P>
Last week we discussed the commission, which has the power to set the limit of the reserved area, or the monopoly limit, and the absolute power to set tariffs. It reports to the Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman knows how to marshal an argument, and last week he made the point that the commission would make crucial decisions and would hold some crunch meetings, and that if we did not impose a quorum, its decisions might be made without proper representation.
<P>
The council will also perform invaluable work, but it will not have the same powers to make crunch decisions. For example, it will not have to make a decision on the Thursday of the last week in March that is crucial to the future of the Post Office. It will offer advice and infon--nation, and publish its annual report. There is, therefore, a weaker argument for setting a quorum for the council.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The composition of the council will be different from that of the commission. Can the Minister say what the council's composition will be, roughly how many people it will consist of, and whether there will be regional representation? If the bloke from Scotland, for instance, never turned up, one might find that when a decision was taken the Scottish dimension had been missed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> That is an important point, and I will come to it. Another difference between the two bodies is that we have no precedent for the regulator, but we do have a precedent for the consumer body. POUNC is already in existence, and although it will be strengthened and beefed up, it provides a precedent.
<P>
POUNC has 16 members. The CCPS must have at least five members, because it must include the chairs from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Chairmen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Okay, chairmen. It must include the chairman and the secretary--[Laughter.] Hon. Members may laugh, but I always try to cater to their whims and fancies. How many more members are introduced is up to the CCPS, but let us say that there will be 16 in total. The council also has the power to establish other committees for groups in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. A rural group, or a London group created to tackle the particular problems of the postal service in London, where a third of mail is generated, would not be inconceivable.
<P>
Imposing such a quorum on the CCPS might mean that the eight people present do not include the chair of Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales even though the council may be discussing a Welsh, Scottish or Northern Ireland issue. At the moment, such circumstances do not arise, because those countries have separate councils. When CCPS sets its quorum, as it undoubtedly will--I am arguing not about whether it should set a quorum but about whether we should impose one on it--it will take cognisance of the new circumstances of different countries and regions being represented on the council. To use the hon. Gentleman's analogy, there would be more chance of the commission being hijacked if we imposed a quorum from above.
<P>
No precedent exists for imposing a quorum on a consumer body, although plenty of consumer bodies have been created. As I said last week, for all the quorums that I can think of, the people involved have the power to influence them. It was suggested that the quorum for Standing Committees is set by the House, but members of Standing Committees are Members of the House, and therefore have a chance to influence the quorum. I cannot think of a body that has a quorum imposed on it and is not left to make the decision itself. The people involved are the best people to do that. We expect a quorum to be set, and it may be 50 per cent., although I imagine that it will include extras to safeguard the different countries and regions. A late wire from the course tells me that under the Post Office Act 1969 POUNC sets its own quorum, and I see no reason to change that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I am about to.
<P>
Indeed, I see less of a reason in this case than in our debate last week, and I hope that the Committee will reach the same decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> What is the quorum for POUNC? That might put the Committee's mind at rest and allow us to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> POUNC sets its own quorum, which at the moment is 50 per cent. However, POUNC does not have the country representation that the new body will include.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Given that the established practice of POUNC seems almost exactly to reflect the amendment, and given that that practice is likely to be continued under the new body, with the reasonable caveats that the Minister has given, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 53, in page 61, leave out lines 36 to 38.
<P>
We have sort of been around this track before, but not quite. The amendment would remove in toto paragraph 14, which gives the council supplementary powers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>do anything (except borrow money) which is calculated to facilitate, or is incidental or conducive to, the performance of any of its functions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is designed to define more closely the scope of the supplementary powers, and enables us to assess how sweeping or all-embracing they might be.
<P>
The schedule refers to matters that are incidental or conducive to the performance of any of the council's functions. Under clause 41, the couticil's functions include providing advice and information. How far can that advice and information stretch? In the conventional sense, we understand that it could comprise simply of a written brief, an established policy document, a communication or response that expresses an opinion to the commission or the Secretary of State. However, the mechanism for doing that may stretch further and, under the supplementary powers, there would be more scope for the consumer council to take significant action.
<P>
Could the consumer council adopt a particular point of view and pay for such a strategy with the money that came from licence holders? Could it mount a massive advertising campaign, be it on television, on posters, in leaflets in post offices, by a mail drop or in the newspapers as part of its role of giving advice and information? Could it do so, for example, to give weight to the advice and information with which it wants to persuade the commission or the Secretary of State? Under the supplementary powers, there is considerable scope for the council to become a serious lobbying body and to exercise its statutory functions in public at considerable expense as if it were the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children or the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
<P>
I sense that the Bill is designed to make the council a body that collects information and expresses its opinion in a more head-to-head private, but obviously publicly revealed, way. Will the consumer council be able to spend money to promote its case in the public domain and, if so, how? I shall draw an analogy with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It might be argued that the council was self-financing, but let us suppose that it spends money to set up a quasi-legal arbitration service for disputes between a consumer and participating company. Could it take on the role of a consumer representative body and carry out many of the functions undertaken by the Automobile Association and the SMMT, for example? It may even provide an insurance service. Who knows what might follow? Will there be a limit to the rubric of its duties or is the clause so open ended that it can take on an identity that none of us can envisage, but one that its imaginative chairman may lead it towards? It will be in a powerful position. It will have millions of customers and will be of interest to all people of all ages throughout the country for many purposes.
<P>
The consumer council could become a different organisation from that which was envisaged. Will the Minister explain its limits and say what the supplementary powers clause will allow and disallow? Does he believe that the consumer council will be confined merely to being an advisory body that gives an occasional good brief and well-researched proper opinions to the commission and the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I understand the concerns that prompted the tabling of the amendment and accept that it is well intentioned. However, such fears are unfounded. As the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton well knows, the schedule concerns administration and, if the amendment were accepted, there would be doubt whether the CCPS could order its own office furniture. It would not have a beneficial effect on what will be a powerful consumer voice.
<P>
The supplementary powers set out in paragraph 11 simply give the council the means to carry out its functions effectively. They ensure that it is not unable to operate because of too narrow a range of powers, and are for day-to-day administrative tasks only. The power in paragraph 15 enables the Secretary of State to fund the council. Given that Opposition Members understand what the amendment's effects would be, I must ask for it to be withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Perfectly valid points were raised about how far the consumer council is expected to go. The council's annual budget will be subject to negotiation and agreement with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Its accounts will also be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, so there is no reason to believe that the powers can or will be misused to justify vast expenses. The council can spend the money only to further the performance of its functions. That would be written into the agreed budgets, and clause 50 requires the council to publish its forward work programme and set out a general description of projects other than routine activities that it intends to undertake.
<P>
The argument made by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton was about the appointment to the chair of an egomaniac--a few names spring to mind, but I shall not mention them--who decided to use the council as a huge lobbying body, through television advertising and so on. I hasten to add that he did not mean the current chair, whose appointment was a good one. Clause 50, and the need for the council to negotiate its budget and submit its accounts to parliamentary scrutiny, would be a sufficient brake to ensure that the council represents the views of users of relevant postal services effectively and in line with the statutory provisions in the Bill. I believe that Opposition Members have nothing to worry about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Will the Minister confirm that the council could not have a widespread national advertising campaign or something of the sort?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I am not prepared to do that, because of the need to be cautious in such circumstances. It would be wrong for me to say no in Hansard to something of which we have no details. We expect that the council's role will be the provision of information and reports, so it is difficult to imagine an advertising campaign falling within that, but I would not discount it. I remind the hon. Gentleman again that the council can spend money only to further the performance of its functions. That would need to be written into agreed budgets. Clause 50 requires the council to publish its forward work programme for scrutiny. It seems inconceivable that a frivolous use of licence holders' money would be allowed to continue to the stage where the advertising campaign took off. However, there might be unlikely circumstances in which such a campaign would be in accordance with the council's duties, so I would not definitely rule it out. We agree with the hon. Gentleman's definition of what is expected.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Let me put it slightly differently. Does the Minister believe that the council is entitled to have a campaign distinct from its role as a body that simply makes a submission to the commission or the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I do not think that it is inconceivable that the consumer council could campaign. One would not have expected that from POUNC, purely because it was a shoestring-budget affair. It was never given the opportunity to effectively represent the consumer, but the CCPS will be a powerful consumer representative. We must accept that sometimes that might be uncomfortable for Governments, licence holders, the Post Office and everyone else. The hon. Gentleman can safely withdraw the amendment and allow the CCPS to order a couple of desks and a photocopier based on my assurances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The Minister brings a degree of levity to our proceedings by saying that the council could not order desks and necessary furniture if the catch-all phrase were removed. Obviously, we would not want to prevent those operating the son of POUNC from being able to sit down while working.
<P>
The Minister has been less than convincing in reply to the probing questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton. The catch-all phrase can allow activities to take place that may not be regarded as being in the national interest. I shall ask the Minister a straight and direct question. Could a Secretary of State--obviously not the present Secretary of State, or while the Minister holds his office--use the son of POUNC as a publicity vehicle, perhaps for party political purposes? We all know that on occasions the line has been severely pushed and bent, if not breached. Under paragraph 17, which was mentioned a few moments ago and about which the Minister gave such fulsome assurances, could the council be encouraged to carry out the type of activity to which my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton referred?
<P>
<B> Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> Yes, it could. I do not see anything wrong with the consumer representative campaigning for better postal services. However, there are checks and balances in the legislation, especially in clause 50. It is better for the avoidance of doubt, to make powers of statutory bodies corporate such as the council explicit in legislation. It is assumed that a single regulatory body can do things, irrespective of whether they are in the Bill, but that is not the case for bodies corporate. The provision has precedents: schedule 2 of the Gas Act 1986, which was made law by the previous Government in relation to the gas consumers council, and part II of schedule 1 of the National Lottery Act 1998 under this Administration in relation to the National Lottery Commission.
<P>
The words have been used before. We used them in schedule 1, to which a similar amendment was withdrawn last week. There is no reason for them to be removed from schedule 2, least of all in relation to concern about the CCPS campaigning to protect and advance postal services. It is legitimate for us to be concerned about how the council campaigns in respect of expenditure, but the fact that it will campaign should be welcomed on both sides of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> As we do not want such an important consumer body to be working off bare floorboards, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B>  I beg to move amendment No. 91, in page 62, line 2, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(2A) The statement of accounts shall be as transparent and accessible as is reasonably practicable.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>We are again in the area of strengthening and clarifying the Bill. We discussed adding "reasonable" to the schedule. I accept the Minister's argument that such a word was not definite; none the less, it opened up the general debate about openness. We are asking now for the accounts to be fully transparent and accessible. The hon. Gentleman may not agree with putting those words in the Bill, but I am sure that he would have difficulty in disagreeing with the aspirations behind them.
<P>
The National Consumer Council, which deals with all consumer affairs, would welcome the amendment. The Bill states that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>statement of accounts shall comply with any requirement,
<P>
</UL></FONT>so I cannot understand an objection to adding a provision that would characterise, strengthen and open out such measures. We have talked about costs and it is important that members of the public know that there will be nothing other than full transparency and access to the accounts of the consumer council. My argument stands on its own, and if the Minister cannot accept the amendment, I should be interested to know why. As a general comment, particularly on consumer affairs, accounts should be accessible and transparent, especially when we are endeavouring to bring in open government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I want to take the argument one step further. There is no mention of who will appoint the auditors. Will it be the council or the Secretary of State? That is an interesting point in itself when talking about how the accounts will be prepared and for whom they 137 138 will be prepared. I accept that they will be prepared under the normal accounting standards, so that there is a true and fair view of the state of affairs. The curious sentence in the schedule states:
 <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The statement of accounts shall comply with any requirement notified to the Council by the Secretary of State with the approval of the Treasury.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that provision apply before the auditors have finished their job and say that the accounts represent a true and fair view of the situation, or is such notification to take place after they have been prepared? I want to ensure that the Secretary of State or the Treasury does not intervene in the independence of the auditors to present a properly transparent, true and fair view of the position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I agree with the hon. Member for Weston-Super-Mare that information should be accessible to those who need it. There is not problem with our desire for transparency, clarity and so on. However, precision is needed in such Bills and, if words are added, we must know what we are doing and how to ensure that they are complied with. I have listened to the hon. Gentleman, but I am not convinced that the amendment would achieve anything. How would the qualifications be interpreted? What would make the statement of accounts transparent? Perhaps specifying that items must not be unduly grouped would make it transparent, but the amendment does not do so. How would accessibility be tested? To a chartered accountant, accessibility might mean something completely different from what it means to a man on the famous Clapham omnibus.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Paragraph 16(1) requires the statement of accounts to provide a true and fair view. Paragraph 16(2) requires the statement of accounts to comply with a notice given to the council by the Secretary of State with Treasury approval, which gives ample opportunity to influence the format of the accounts without the need for the amendments. We have not yet decided what the format of the statement of accounts will be, but we expect it to be a conventional format of a balance sheet that provides an account of expenditure throughout the year, and includes debtors, creditors and assets. It will be consistent with the rules for non-governmental public bodies.
<P>
We shall also introduce amendments Nos. 93 and 94, which require the accounts to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and which I hope will deal with the anxieties of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare about transparency and accessibility. I cannot envisage a way of including those words in the Bill that will allow us subsequently to say that we have provided precision for those who must act under the terms of the provision. On that basis, I ask the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare to withdraw the amendment; if he cannot, I shall ask the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I believe that we have marked our card again about the need for transparency and accessibility in considering Bills in general. Electronic communication will make information more accessible for the general public. Precision always presents a problem of compliance, but we have dealt with the issue as I hope that we shall increasingly in future. Perhaps Governments might be prevailed upon to establish clear ways to accessibility and transparency in future. People have not always been able to acquire the necessary information. Freedom of information initiatives are now being introduced.
<P>
In light of the Minister's comments about the difficulties of precision, I want to mark the card to the effect that people should be absolutely clear about what the expenditure relates to, especially bearing in mind the amendments that I tabled earlier about reasonable expenditure. On the basis that the Minister accepts the importance of accessibility and transparency, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 93, in page 62, line 3, after 'send' insert 'a copy of'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 94.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I am sure that hon. Members will agree that we need to ensure that the accounts of the CCPS will be subject to proper scrutiny. The amendments insert into the Bill a requirement that the accounts of the CCPS will be audited by the CAG, and that a copy of the accounts and his report to CCPS will be laid by him before each House of Parliament. We originally intended to achieve that through a notice given by the Secretary of State under paragraph 15, but on further reflection the Government concluded that the right course was to specify the requirement in the Bill, which the amendments do.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee for long, but wish merely to draw its attention to the importance of the definitions within the clause. As we shall discover, I am worried that the good definitions in the clause will end up at odds with the scope that has been granted under clause 41. Relevant postal issues and services are sensibly defined as activities that may be regulated by the commission or the council and, helpfully, those who are going about their business not requiring to be licensed, but who should be left alone, are excluded from such a definition. Having helpfully excluded such people from the definition in clause 40, there is a risk that they may become included subsequently in clause 41. I welcome clause 40 and its definitions in the hope that they will not be extended to any other aspect of the Bill's activity.

<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 79, in page 23, line 8, after 'represent', insert 'and promote'.
<P>
The reasoning behind the amendment is to ensure that the views of consumers are not merely represented--in other words, passively passed on as information--but actively promoted. Consumers want to ensure that the council not only represents their views, but takes up the cudgels on their behalf. In that way, certain issues can be dealt with vigorously. POUNC does an excellent job in representing the views of consumers and taking up issues. It has not always done as well as we might have expected, but now that the Government have said that they want to put consumers' interests at the forefront of legislation, we want to add "promote" to the Bill to strengthen it, so that it gives the council the right message about what consumers want it to do.
<P>
We want the council not only to take on board the views of consumers, but to promote them and to make those at the highest levels in the Government or the Competition Commission aware of them, so that consumers really believe that the council is a real champion for their causes and represents a real voice. We want it to be independent and to be able to take up actively the issues that are presented to it. I hope that I have explained our somewhat modest amendment, behind which is the intention to ensure that the council can actively promote consumer interests rather than passively pass on information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The amendment is modest but, to paraphrase Churchill, it has much to be modest about. The clause requires the council, among other things, to represent the views of users of relevant postal services--meaning services connected with the universal service obligation or licensed postal service. That is a proper function of the CCPS. Under the amendment, it would be required not only to represent users but to promote all users' views, regardless of their validity or of whether they contradicted each other. There is a difference between representation and promotion. Former union representatives will remember that they represented their members, but that did not mean, thank goodness, that they promoted all their views. The dictionary definition of "promote" is to support actively.
<P>
Users' different needs and views can be reflected by the CCPS, which also has the duty to make proposals in its representational role. It is not as though the clause does not give the council any teeth. However, users will have conflicting views--for example, people who believe that they should have a 6p postal service for mail that is delivered from one side of a city to another, and those in rural areas who would be concerned that that would encroach on their services. There is the tension between those who believe that businesses that discount for volume undermine the universal service at a uniform tariff and those who do not. It would be impossible for the council to promote all those users' views and to do so could work to the detriment of other users.
<P>
The amendment adds nothing to the Bill; it would only make the job of the CCPS and the clear representation of postal users' views much more difficult. I ask for it to be withdrawn or rejected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I accept what the Minister said, although much of it could also be said about "represent". A number of views will exist and the council will presumably be honour bound to represent each one, even if it does not agree. We seem to be getting ourselves into difficulty with "promote", not only in this but in other Bills.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman represents people in south-east Cornwall; he has no obligation to promote their views. There is an obvious difference between representing and promoting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I certainly promote their interests. It is a difficult area--I do not know whether it can be examined at some stage. We, and consumers, need to ensure that the council will act vigorously and I want to convey that in the wording of the Bill so that the council is given that sort of championing role. The council will not be just a talking shop to which an awful lot of people will write letters that will be looked at and conveyed on--it will be more than, dare I say, a sort of post box. If views are considered worthwhile, the council will take them up vigorously.
<P>
However, I will not push the amendment to a vote. I hope that as the issue was explored in what was a probing amendment it will ensure that the council is at least as good, if not better, than the organisation it replaces. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 23, line 13, at end insert 'and'.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> This is the amendment to which I alluded in the clause 40 stand part debate. It explains our concern that the scope of the council may be allowed to stretch too far. As we understand,

To whom will it do all those? In whose daily business will it have the right to stick its well-meaning nose? At the moment, the Bill states that the relevant persons are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Secretary of State, the Commission, the Competition Commission and any other public authority.
<P>
 That is fine, as far as it goes. The clause also refers to
<P>
any licence holder under Part II.
<P>
That is also fine. However, subsection 2(c) specifies
 <P>
any other person whose activities may affect the interests of users of relevant postal services.
<P>
</UL></FONT> <P>
The implication is that anyone engaged in any kind of commercial activity in the sector could suddenly find the council knocking on his door to express its opinion, to which many such people would be inclined to say, "Push off." The amendment would restrict the council to a narrower field.
<P>
I want to exclude from the scope of the provision postal operators who do not provide a licensed service. That is consistent with the Govermnent's original approach to the reconstitution of POUNC into the council. The July 1999 White Paper set out the role of the council in some detail. On page 30, it said that the council's key roles would be

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to act as the public advocate on behalf of all users of Post Office services. . .to handle and invstigate consumer complaints not satisfactorily resolved by the Post Office (or other licensed postal operators), mediating as appropriate. . .to work constructively with the Post Office (and other licensed postal operators) to reduce the causes of complaints. . .to ensure that licensed postal operators have an effective complaints handling and compensation system.
<P>
It goes on to state that
<P>
The Government wants to see a strong consumer body at the heart of the regulatory system.
<P>
</UL></FONT>We agree with that. Paragraph 51 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government proposes to designate POUNC as that body. The new POUNC will provide focal point for consumers for unresolved complaints, championing their interests and ensuing that their voice is heard by the Post Office, the Regulator and the Government.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In all those detailed descriptions of the council's role, it was clear and specifically stated that the role of the council would relate only to the licensed area. The White Paper also said:
 <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As with the Regulator, it is intended that POUNC will be funded by a contribution from the Post Office, and in due course any other licensees as appropriate.
<P>
That funding structure further demonstrates that the council's role is to offer advice and guidance to those operating in the licensed area, as it is only postal operators operating in that area who will pay for the council.
<P>
The Bill has considerably extended the role of the council from that set out in the White Paper, so that its remit now includes both the regulated and the unregulated parts of the industry. The amendment would restore the role of the council to that originally proposed in the White Paper. If the Minister can persuade me that my understanding of the Bill is erroneous, we would reconsider our position, but our concern is significant, given that the council can fulfil its duties by reference not only to those inside the licensed area, but to
<P>
 any other person whose activities may affect the interests of users of relevant postal services,
<P>
according to subsection (2)(c). The council will have the right to offer its advice to and intrude on the business of anyone operating in the sector outside the licensed area. That is unacceptable, as it gives the council too wide a remit. I seek the Minister's assurance that the scope of the council will, as the White Paper stated so clearly, be confined only to the licensed area.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> The purpose of the clause is to define the scope and work of the consumer council by giving it power to offer advice and information, to represent the views of users, to make proposals relating to the operations of the Post Office and other service providers and the unregulated part of the industry. Therein lies the rub, and the explanatory notes make it clear how much the power will be extended. Our two amendments were drafted without fear or embarrassment and we wish to make it clear that we want to reduce the role of the proposed consumer council to that envisaged in the White Paper, which was published in July 1999.
<P>
Our aim is to exclude from the scope of the provision postal operators who do not provide a licensed service. We are against that extension of activity by the council. I shall say only a little about the Government amendments to the clause, which are to be taken next. They are a quid pro quo for the extension of the council's power. Amendment No. 63 would place a duty on the council to advise and inform licence holders who are not universal service providers. Amendment No. 64 would make a consequential change to subsection (3), which again would impose an obligation to provide information. I hope that the Minister will accept our amendment and not persist with his amendments. A balance can be achieved, but if the Minister does not accept our amendment, no doubt he will want to go ahead with his amendments.
<P>
It is clear that the Department considers that it is the duty of the consumer council to offer advice and information to any postal service provider. It wants to compel private sector postal operators to receive advice and information. The private operators may be au fait with running their business and may not need advice.
<P>
Moreover, they will not want to be tied into the loop of being forced to provide advice. The clause will extend the role of the consumer council from acting as an advocate for consumers in the regulated area to acting in the unregulated part of the industry, too.
<P>
In July 1999, the Government right in their original aim to ensure that the consumers' voice was heard by the Post Office, the regulator and the Government. The son of POUNC should cover all those involved in the licensed area. The deletion of subsection (2)(c) would confirm the council's right to make proposals to the Secretary of State, the Postal Services Commission, the Competition Commission--if it is still in existence, bearing in mind the article in The Economist last Friday--and any other public authority or licence holder. We do not believe that the powers of the consumer council should be extended to cover private postal operators outside the reserved area. I hope that the Minister will seriously consider our representations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I have seriously considered the hon. Gentleman's representations and I am sure that I can persuade him to withdraw the amendment. He has nothing to fear. There has perhaps been a misunderstanding about what the clause is designed to do. It specifies some important duties for the council that help it fulfil its role of representing users' views, providing advice and information and making proposals. It does not require anything in return.
<P>
The council should be required to make representations to all relevant people who might find such information useful. In particular, it seems reasonable to require the council to provide advice and information and to make representations and proposals to everyone involved in providing a postal service, not only licence holders. It is significant that the clause does not place any duties or onus on the people who receive the representations. The push-off provision that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton mentioned, saying that he was not interested in it, is part of the clause. The flow of information is from the CCPS to other people.
<P>
The example that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton cited involved people who operate outside the reserved area and are not universal service providers. I shall give further examples in a moment. The onus is not on them to do anything except receive help, advice and representation from the consumer representatives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> That is all very well, but the CCPS will be a serious statutory body that might ultimately tell a company that it is so good at operating outside the licensed area that it is detrimental to operators inside the licensed area. It might end up damning the reputation of a company over which it has no proper business, by using its authority as a statutory consumer body to express an opinion that is unhelpful to that business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Such organisations might be grateful that the council has provided some free market research. The clause relates to their receiving information. An example, which does not involve private couriers, of an operator who falls within the proposed category is a provider of transport used for the conveyance of mail. To quote an old Burt Bacharach song, trains and boats and planes move mail around the country to an extraordinary extent. Boats take mail to islands such as the Isle of Man, and planes are increasingly being used. The consumer representatives may have done some research or may need to represent consumers' views to airlines, as in the recent case that involved landing rights at Heathrow or Gatwick for mail from Jersey, and it may want to send information to such groups. It is not akin to the Spanish inquisition. We are discussing not the powers of the CCPS to require information to be given but the people to whom it will provide advice and information and make representation.
<P>
The amendment would hinder the work of consumer representatives. Unlicensed postal operators may become responsible for an increasing part of the postal market in future if the reserved area decreases. Many operators that provide postal services for parcels are not and never will be licensed. It makes sense for the council to be able to make representations to such operators, which may be grateful for the free market research. It is significant that unlicensed operators will be required to provide information to the council only if they are USO providers. Clause 47 states clearly that only USO providers and licence holders will be required to provide information to the council.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Clause 46 states that the council may investigate
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> any matter . . . which it considers to be a matter relating to the interests of users of relevant postal services.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Does not have a bearing on what the Minister is saying?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B>  No, this debate is similar to the one that we had last week about possible breaches of the monopoly and other issues. We are talking about information. The nub of the argument is that, under clause 41, if we include a catch-all provision, private couriers--those outside the USO area--will be inundated with people snooping around their businesses. We have deliberately ensured that only the USO and the reserved area will be regulated. The powers set out in clause 47 make it clear that only those organisations will be required to give information to the council.
 <P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are talking about to whom the council can give information and when it can advise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> No, the Minister is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Yes, we are. We are saying that the council shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> provide advice and information,
represent the views of users of relevant postal services, and
make proposals,
about relevant postal issues to any person mentioned.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The council will not be requiring information or feedback from such bodies. It will be making proposals in relation to postal services, an example of which I have already cited, which related to the transportation of mail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Let me give an example. Let us suppose that the licence condition given to universal postal service providers, taking account of environmental matters and so on, states that motorbikes of more than 250 cc should not be used in rural areas. Will the council be allowed to tell those private courier operators who whiz around on their filthy gas-guzzling big bikes weaving in and out of traffic that its proposal to people outside the universal service area was that their motor bikes were too big? It is none of its business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> That is not a relevant postal issue. I am trying to think of another example of private couriers' motorbikes interfering with the provision of service. Let us suppose that they were parked in front of the door of a sorting office and stopped postal delivery staff getting 145 146 out in the morning. That would be a relevant postal issue to the quality of service. The example cited by the hon. Gentleman would not be a relevant postal issue. I understand his concerns, but private couriers would be pleased to receive information--a bit of free market research--that the consumer representative was distributing. They feel part of the postal industry and would want to receive such information without onerous obligations to provide information or being subject to the regulator or to all other aspects of the Bill that apply purely to the reserved area and the USO. I am talking simply about the council having the ability to provide advice and information, not only to private couriers but to transport organisations, local authorities and any group that it feels needs to be aware of the work of consumer representatives on relevant postal issues.
<P>
There is no real difference between clauses 40 and 41, other than that the council will provide advice and information, represent views and makes proposals to other persons whose activities may affect the interests of users of relevant postal services. Opposition Members will be pleased to know that operators, whether licensees or universal service obligation providers, will not be bound to take heed of the information provided. Reference was made to the amendments that I shall be moving formally. It was a mistake to say that they were relevant to the clause, given that we debated them last week, at which time they were accepted. We need to ensure that a universal service obligation is still being considered by the council even if the reserved area goes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I do not want to be churlish, because the Minister has genuinely gone out of his way to be helpful in describing the effect of the amendments and of the clause. However, I remain concerned that the clause hides potential extensions of the council's scope that could constitute state-sponsored busybodying. While I applaud the spirit of the Minister's comments, we will press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Again, these are modest amendments, the purpose of which is to ensure as much transparency and information as possible, so that the provision is not caught between two tests. Under the amendments, there would be only one test of whether information should be made available namely, if it did not "seriously prejudice" the interests of the affected person. That would provide greater transparency. In dealing with regulators, a fair bit of information has sometimes been caught by the problem of commercial confidence. We need transparency because information has not always been easy to obtain. It would be wrong for people to be seriously prejudiced and we want to ensure that they are not, but where there is no danger of that, we want it to be clear that information should be available, especially to the consumer groups that will no doubt make representations to the council. Our modest amendments are designed to reduce the two tests to one, and to make it clear that such information ought to be available unless that test is seriously prejudicial to anyone's interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The important word is "might". The amendment would unnecessarily and disadvantageously widen the council's powers to disclose information. The council may not disclose information if it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> considers that its disclosure would or might seriously and prejudicially affect the interests of the person to whom it relates.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman clearly thinks that that test of the council's power to disclose information is too restrictive, so he wants to remove the word "might", but the wording is necessary for two reasons. First, it sets a proper balance between the individual's rights as opposed to the council's rights to disclose information. Secondly, it allows the council to do its job properly. Greater powers to disclose information, as the amendment proposes, could lead to mistrust between the council and some people whom it attempts to represent. It could mean that the council has greater difficulties in acquiring information.
<P>
We need to consider what the effect of the amendment would be. It could do a lot of harm if the council could disclose information that might seriously and prejudicially affect a person's interests, as the amendment would allow. It could lead to the disclosure of information that is commercially sensitive or relates to someone's business affairs. For example, it could seriously disadvantage the person to whom the information relates if it were disclosed to other USO providers or licence holders.
<P>
We have to strike a careful balance between the needs of the council to disclose information as opposed to the needs of the person to whom the information relates. Too great a power to disclose information may lead to the council being mistrusted by some of the people with whom it has to work, such as postal operators. The council may find it more difficult to acquire information in the first place if people feel that they cannot trust the council not to disclose it.
<P>
 We must also remember that the council has the power in the clause to decide for itself--the wording is "if the Council considers"--whether the disclosure of information would or might seriously and prejudicially affect the person's interest. I believe that that gives the council enough discretion over what to disclose. Any more power could be damaging to people to whose affairs the information relates and to the council.
<P>
We also think that the wording currently used is easier to understand. It is easier to assess whether someone's interests are "seriously and prejudicially affected" than whether they are seriously prejudiced.
<P>
For those reasons, I ask the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall to withdraw the amendment. If he does not, I ask the Committee to reject it.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Breed:</B> Where the balance of interests lies is a matter of judgment. Between regulators, the competition commission and the Office of Fair Trading, there is inevitably experience of dealing with people who are asked to provide information. Before information is provided, it is often agreed that it will not be disclosed. I accept that the use of the little word "might" is an attempt to predict something that might be a long way ahead, so the tendency is to say that information might prejudice someone's interests, and if it might, it will not be disclosed. Almost any information might at some stage be prejudicial to someone's interests, or may be seriously prejudicial.
<P>
The amendment was an attempt to tip the balance slightly in favour of those organisations genuinely seeking to obtain information. If commercially confidential information is requested by the council, agreement is often reached before its receipt so that people know straight away that it will not be disclosed. Therefore, mistrust would not often be relevant. Information could be genuinely available to consumer organisations that would help them present cases in the most effective way, and we wanted to prevent the council, the regulator or anyone else from forming the habit of hiding behind wording that protects them by saying that information might at some stage be seriously prejudicial. They would not know whether it might be, but they would not make it available for that reason.
<P>
I think that we have made our point and that the Minister will be glad to hear that I shall not press the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Opposition welcome the development of a proper consumer body attached to the Post Office sector. By and large, its structure is okay but, as the Committee knows, we have some concerns about the possible scope of the council to intrude into activity outside the licensed area. None the less, we take note of the Minister's assurances on the matter. We support the clause and want to see it stand part of the Bill.
