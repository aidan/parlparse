						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000320"></a>The
Minister for Pensions Reform (Mr. Mike
O'Brien):
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Given that we are starting this chapter
of the Bill, it would be useful if I set out what it will do. It has a
substantial importance in relation to how divorce and pension
settlements are arrived at. If I explain the broad background to that,
we may be able to proceed fairly briskly through the other
clauses.</div>
					<a name="08021969000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 1999, when
the Government legislated to allow divorcing couples to share pensions,
we made it clear that we were committed to ensuring that divorcing
couples reach fair and equitable settlements. Those provisions were
extended to civil partnerships under the Civil Partnership Act 2004.
Although I shall refer mainly in my speech to divorce, the provisions
that we are introducing apply equally to divorce or the dissolution of
a civil partnership. We have ensured that, when couples divorce, they
have the choice to share their pensions like other assets in a way that
ensures a clean break, independence and income in later
life.</div>
					<a name="08021969000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the Pension Protection Fund compensation is not a pension and the
existing pension-sharing law does not apply to it. The PPF was created
in 2004 to pay compensation to people whose sponsoring employer has
experienced an insolvency event and whose defined benefit pension
scheme cannot pay a pension at a level that is at least equivalent to
the pension paid by the PPF. The fund compensation can be taken into
account when reaching financial settlements, but unlike cash, property
or pensions, compensation cannot be shared when the couple or a court
decide that that would be the best way in which to divide their
assets.</div>
					<a name="08021969000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a member
of a divorcing couple has pension rights, the court can transfer the
value of some or all of those rights to the other member of the couple.
That person can then buy a pension of their own to ensure their
independence and security. The courts can also do that while a pension
scheme is being assessed for transfer to the PPF. However, when a
pension scheme has actually been transferred to the PPF, it is not
possible to make an order to divide the compensation payments to which
people are entitled. That means that PPF compensation could not be
shared even if that compensation were the only significant asset
belonging to a divorcing couple.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 470</div>
					<a name="08021969000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">While there is
no evidence that up to now a person has lost out, clauses 82 to 95 will
ensure that sharing compensation is an option. The provisions allow the
courts to treat PPF compensation in a similar way to pensions on
divorce or dissolution of a civil partnership. A group of amendments
that we shall discuss shortly would extend the provisions to
Scotland.</div>
					<a name="08021969000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 82
describes the scope of the compensation-sharing provisions. It sets out
the key principle for what follows and explains that PPF compensation
is shareable&#151;a principle that is fundamental to the
compensation-sharing provisions&#151;unless regulations make an
exception such as when compensation is being paid to a survivor in
respect of a previous
marriage.</div>
					<a name="08021969000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08021969000321"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Nigel Waterson</b> (Eastbourne) (Con): I am grateful to the
Minister for setting out the thinking behind the clause. When he talks
about PPF compensation, will he confirm whether the provisions will
apply also to the financial assistance
scheme?</div>
					<a name="08021969000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000322"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> No. We shall have to look at the way in which the
financial assistance scheme applies and the provisions under which it
will operate.</div>
					<a name="08021969000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
82, like the rest of the chapter, has been drafted so that, as far as
possible, compensation sharing follows the same principles and uses the
same mechanics that currently apply to pension sharing. In that way, we
have sought to capitalise on familiarity and avoid unnecessary
additional
complexity.</div>
					<a name="08021969000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000323"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>As I have said, I am grateful to the
Minister for setting out the thinking behind this set of clauses. It is
useful to make a few general comments on clause 82 before we discuss
some of the detail. It was Lord Nicholls in the case of Brooks <i class="I">v
</i>Brooks, to which I referred earlier, who
said:</div>
					<a name="08021969000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For many
married people their two single assets of greatest value are the house
in which they live and, as time passes, the accumulating pension of the
money-earner.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08021969000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a
previous debate about safeguarded rights, we looked at how the law has
developed on pensions and their treatment in matrimonial proceedings.
There was a time when they could be taken into account, but there was
no power to make an order in respect of pensions specifically, and what
happened is what currently happens for PPF payments&#151;the court
could, in certain circumstances, broadly take into account the
entitlement in dividing up other assets of the marriage. The 1995
legislation first gave the power to attach or earmark pensions. As the
Minister has said, the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 amended the
Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 such that what could happen from then on
was the sharing of pensions. That was based on a consultation carried
out under the previous Conservative Government, so clearly there was an
element of consensus.</div>
					<a name="08021969000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 1999 Act made it clear that
from then on, pensions sharing could take place. As I understand it, it
is not compulsory and will always remain a matter of discretion for the
courts at any given time and applies to occupational pensions, personal
pensions, SERPS and the state pension. It is something that has come to
be applied a great deal in our courts. There are some 200,000 divorce
cases a year, at least, and it would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div>worth knowing in how many cases pension sharing takes place already. In
2000 it was thought that earmarking only took place in 300 of the then
150,000 cases per year, but I suspect that the figure for pension
sharing is now a great deal
higher.</div>
					<a name="08021969000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is puzzling how this anomaly came to be. It is perhaps the fault of all
of us, but perhaps the Government more than us, that nobody spotted it
during the passage of what became the 2004 legislation. It is clear
that in certain circumstances a husband who has accumulated a
significant pension in a company that then has an insolvency event
could, if the timing was right, by receiving compensation payments
under the PPF, avoid giving his wife a fair share of that substantial
asset in the divorce proceedings. I give considerable credit to the
Baroness Hollis, who, in her usual indefatigable way, raised this issue
during the passage of the most recent pensions Bill&#151;what became
the 2007 Act. She tabled an amendment to deal with the issue, making
the point in the House of Lords that, although it is perfectly possible
to make pension-sharing orders based on the 1999 legislation, the
courts cannot make any kind of order relating to PPF compensation. It
strikes me as bizarre that that was not spotted at the time, but there
we are. She
said:</div>
					<a name="08021969000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Technically
this was done because moneys from the PPF or
FAS&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08021969000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will come
back to that in a minute, if I
may&#151;</div>
					<a name="08021969000054"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;were
compensation or a contribution to loss rather than the original
pension.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 6 June
2007; Vol. 692, c.
1121.]</div>
					<a name="08021969000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
pause there, I suppose that they were treated legally as if the husband
had had a road traffic accident, for example, and received damages by
way of compensation, which I assume would not normally be taken into
account in a matrimonial proceeding. As the Baroness went on to point
out, that may represent a significant asset; she gave the example of a
PPF pension of &#163;20,000, requiring a pension pot of nearly
&#163;300,000. She
said:</div>
					<a name="08021969000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
spouse&#146;s access to a share of the pension, which may be more
valuable than the home, is determined not by the circumstances of the
divorce, not by the size of the assets involved, and not by any
offsetting that may have taken place, but by the timing of the
company&#146;s fortunes. I do not think that that is
fair.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 6 June
2007; Vol. 692, c.
1121.]</div>
					<a name="08021969000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Responding for the
Government, Baroness Morgan of Drefelin said that the Government would
give the matter further consideration, hence clause 82 and following.
She made the point, which the Minister touched on, that the legislation
already allows that the value of any PPF compensation may be taken into
account as an asset. That is a throwback to what used to be the case
prior to pension splitting and pension sharing being placed on a
statutory footing. In passing, I also mention that my hon. Friend the
Member for South-West Bedfordshire has tabled a new clause dealing with
the sharing of personal accounts. We will no doubt debate that later
on.</div>
					<a name="08021969000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s response to my intervention about the relevance or
otherwise of the financial assistance scheme is very interesting. Yet
again there has been an oversight. From the Minister&#146;s response
it seems clear that the clauses do not apply to the financial
assistance scheme. However, it is statistically likely that of the
150,000 people potentially affected by the FAS, some may sadly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column472" />Column number: 472</div>go through matrimonial proceedings. As a result of the lacunae in
clauses 82 and following, compensation&#151;or perhaps we should call
it assistance&#151;could be disregarded from the point of view of any
matrimonial settlement.</div>
					<a name="08021969000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister will no doubt say
that the holding position on that is what used to happen before pension
splitting and pension sharing came in: when dividing up the matrimonial
assets, the courts could take some account of any entitlement to
assistance under the FAS. However, with the greatest of respect, that
is not good enough. I would like to tease out from the Minister a bit
more of his current thinking on how to deal with that issue. On our
first morning back after a pleasant break, I hope that it will not
sound too churlish to say that this problem is entirely of the
Government&#146;s own making. It was a political decision to set up
the FAS as a wholly separate organisation at the other end of the
country, so as not to underline too heavily the fact that it was paying
out to claimants at a much lower level across the board than the PPF
was paying to claimants under the scheme. Purely because of an accident
of timing, it has always been the case that FAS claimants have been
treated more shabbily in all sorts of ways than PPF claimants. I am
sure that we will debate the matter in more detail later on.</div>
					<a name="08021969000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have always been
at pains to say that under PPF, people receive compensation&#151;100
per cent., 90 per cent., depending on the situation&#151;whereas the
FAS merely provides assistance. As we said when I was growing up in
Yorkshire, &#147;As cold as charity&#148;. That is why we have a
problem with the clause. Therefore, I press the Minister to say a
little more about to what extent he and his officials have addressed
that obvious gap in the legislation, and what he thinks are the options
to deal with the need to bring the financial assistance scheme into the
fold, not only in terms of compensation, which we will debate in more
detail, but about how entitlement to those payments will be dealt with
during the course of matrimonial
proceedings.</div>
					<a name="08021969000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08021969000324"></a>
							<b class="B">Danny
Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): It is a pleasure to be back once again under your
chairmanship, Mrs Anderson, after our short recess. I am grateful for
the opportunity to make a few general comments about this chapter of
the Bill. Clearly, the idea of extending pension-sharing provisions to
people receiving benefits under the pension protection fund seems to be
absolutely right. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne observed, pension
sharing generally on divorce has been common practice for a number of
years. Plainly, there was an oversight at some stage that led to it not
being included in the initial PPF legislation.</div>
					<a name="08021969000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to know whether
the solving of this problem has been prompted mainly by the comments
made in the Lords under the last Pension Bill&#151;and I pay tribute
to Baroness Hollis&#151;or whether particular cases have come up. Is
the Minister aware of people who are currently receiving compensation
under the PPF, who have been in that situation and have not been able
to have the pension sharing that they wished in the unfortunate event
of a divorce or separation? If so, how is he prepared to deal with such
cases? It may be that no such thing has arisen, in which case it is
perhaps fortunate that this is being dealt with
now.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column473" />Column number: 473</div>

am</div>
					<a name="08021969000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would want to echo, at least as strongly, the comments made by the hon.
Member for Eastbourne about the financial assistance scheme. Surely,
given the recent changes made to the financial assistance scheme, which
have finally brought it onto a more level footing with the pension
protection fund, the provisions to allow sharing of benefits under the
financial assistance scheme on divorce should be extended to the
financial assistance scheme. Given the way in which the Government have
at long last, and rightly, moved away from the concept of a core
pension under the financial assistance scheme to allow wider benefits
to be paid, all the rules and regulations that apply to pensions more
generally and which we are seeking to extend under these clauses to the
pension protection fund should apply to the financial assistance
scheme. I note in passing that I have been one of those who have
advocated that the administration of the financial assistance scheme
should be handed over to the pension protection fund for reasons of
efficiency. It is clear that the management of the pension protection
fund has a good track record in getting things done quickly with cases
so far. The rules that it has enables things to be done quickly, and it
seems to make sense that it should take responsibility for
this.</div>
					<a name="08021969000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000325"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> There is a saying that failure is an orphan and
success has many fathers, but I remind the hon. Gentleman that in the
passage of the 2004 pensions legislation, I argued for an amendment
that would have set up a mini PPF within the PPF that would have dealt
with the claims that arose prior to the cut-off date for the PPF. I
have always felt, from then onwards, that it would have made far more
sense to have one single administration, and I am delighted that the
hon. Gentleman takes the same
view.</div>
					<a name="08021969000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000326"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has the advantage over me in
respect of legislation passed in 2004, as I was not a member of the
House then, but I am very happy to take his word for that and to
commend him for his foresight in 2004. That seems to be quite right. I
am sure that we will not always proceed in this spirit of consensus
between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, but on that point,
we are in agreement. I hope that the Minister can explain a bit more of
the background as to why so far in the Bill the Government have chosen
not to extend this to the financial assistance scheme, and at what
stage he intends to bring that measure forward, o that the benefit can
be shared more widely.</div>

						<a name="08021969000327"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
John Greenway</b> (Ryedale) (Con): I want to intervene briefly
to correct my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne: the financial
assistance scheme office is at Monks Cross in York in my constituency
and it does not regard itself as being at the wrong end of the country.
In fact, but for an accident of history, we would be at the wrong end
of the country and our Parliament would be based in
York.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000328"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I think that the record will show that I said
&#147;the other end&#148; of the country, and as someone who was
born and brought up in Leeds, nor could I possibly be thought of as
someone who thinks that Yorkshire is the &#147;wrong&#148; end of
the country&#151;quite the reverse.</div>

							<a name="08021969000329"></a>Mr.
Greenway:
						</b> I stand corrected, but I plead in aid of myself
the fact that I have a very dodgy right ear. As you can see,
Mrs. Anderson, I have had a good week away, and I am afraid
that I got too much water in my ear, so I did not quite hear my hon.
Friend correctly. However, there is an important issue here. I have
listened to what my hon. Friend, the Minister, and the spokesman for
the Liberal Democrats have said, and I think without question that the
financial assistance scheme entitlements should be included in divorce
settlements. However, for that to happen, the courts need certainty,
because when marriages break up&#151;and as many hon. Members know, I
have been through that experience, although I am now gladly
remarried&#151;there has to be fairness between both sides. For there
to be fairness, there has to be certainty, so I think that we can
conclude in this debate that it is right that financial assistance
scheme entitlements should be part of divorce settlements. For that to
happen, we need to see these new arrangements clearly bedded down, and
we need that degree of certainty as to what individuals are entitled to
and therefore what they can reasonably be expected to award to their
spouse.</div>
					<a name="08021969000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a sense, I
am making two pleas to the Minister. First, it would represent progress
if a provision covering the FAS were included in this part of the Bill.
More generally, there is still much to be done to ensure that the FAS
is the effective system of support for people who have lost their
pension and that it can be shared between couples when their marriages
have broken down.</div>
					<a name="08021969000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that our exchange has been useful to the Committee. The issue goes
slightly beyond the measures under the Bill and you have been extremely
generous, Mrs. Anderson, in allowing us to have a more
general debate so I shall not trespass on your courtesy even further.
However, given his reaction to what I and other members of the
Committee have said, the Minister seems to have grasped our
point.</div>

							<a name="08021969000330"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I wish first to deal with a couple of extraneous
points and then move to the FAS division of payments on divorce. I was
asked for the number of cases of pension sharing. That is difficult to
identify due to the different jurisdictions involved and how details of
judgments are recorded. We do not know the number of cases, but the
hon. Member for Eastbourne is probably right that it is likely to be in
excess of the figure he quoted, and that it is increasing year on
year.</div>
					<a name="08021969000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey asked whether we had
identified any cases. There is none that we are aware of, but that does
not mean that there are not any because they could have been dealt with
through the courts, between lawyers or in some other way. There may
well be cases, but they have not come to the notice of the officials in
my Department. In a sense, we are discussing unfinished business from
2004 but, as members of this Committee more than any other Committee
will know, the financial assistance scheme has been undergoing a whole
series of transitions in recent years, and it has not yet completed its
current transition. Indeed, we shall be tabling amendments that we
shall probably consider today or Thursday to deal with the financial
assistance scheme.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column475" />Column number: 475</div>
					<a name="08021969000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Ryedale is
exactly right. The law, particularly in the area under discussion,
requires certainty. What the financial assistance scheme does not have
is certainty because we have not laid down its regulations, details and
provisions as the scheme will stand within six months from now. We
therefore need to get those provisions in place and then make reference
to them by setting out the way in which we intend to bring forward
pension-sharing arrangements for those who are affected by divorce and
are part of the financial assistance
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08021969000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to bring forward similar provisions to those that apply to the PPF
in due course for those affected by the financial assistance scheme.
There is the possibility of a welfare reform Bill in the next Session,
so we are looking for the ability to introduce such provisions in that
Bill. If I were able now to put together the provisions in respect of
the financial assistance scheme, I could draft amendments for
discussion in the other place, but we cannot do that because we do not
know the precise provisions of the financial assistance scheme when
considering how to divide up the pension-sharing arrangements in due
course. The matter is about certainty and we must make progress, first,
by creating the provisions of the financial assistance scheme and,
secondly, by setting out the circumstances under which we would allow
the pension-sharing provisions that we want for the PPF. We cannot do
that in regulations; we will have to do it in primary legislation
because it will directly affect provisions in relation to divorce. That
is how we intend to proceed, and I hope that that
helps.</div>

Waterson:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way and
for his assurances. I take his point, and the point made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Ryedale, about the current uncertainties in the
FAS. Will he confirm whether, in bringing forward similar proposals on
the FAS to the ones that he has introduced on the PPF, he might look at
some element of
retrospectivity&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i>&#151;Retrospection. If
so, people could look back and apply those measures to cases that arise
now. Will he also confirm that a smart divorce lawyer could read our
debates, particularly our debates on the changes to the FAS, and have a
reasonable idea of the funds that might be made available, so that it
is possible, even now, to take them into account, in a rough and ready
way, in a matrimonial settlement or a court
judgment?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000332"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> Let me first defend the hon. Member for
Eastbourne on whether it is retrospection or retrospectivity. I think
that it is retrospectivity because retrospection means looking
backwards and we are not looking for the legislation to look backwards,
we want it to affect things going back with. That would be
retrospective legislation, and therefore I think that the hon. Member
for Eastbourne is right, it is retrospectivity. No doubt we will have
<i class="I">Guardian</i> editorials on that point in due course. In any event,
we would obviously need the consent of law officers to look at this
sort of issue. They are, quite rightly, reluctant to allow
retrospective legislation for all sorts of reasons that people are
aware of. Essentially, it is wrong in normal circumstances for people
to be subject to laws that they were not aware would be in place at the
time that they behaved in a particular way. None 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 476</div>the less, retrospectivity happens on occasion, particularly when people
have been warned that legislation will be brought forward and they are
on notice that it may affect them.</div>
					<a name="08021969000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hear what the hon. Gentleman
says about the need to enable any retrospective legislative change to
affect people from here on in. I will have to make enquiries about that
and I will comment in due course on whether I can do that.</div>

Minister confirm that the current rules about pension-sharing apply in
absolutely the same way in Scotland as they do here? Looking at some of
the words that we do not tend to use in English law, I wonder whether
they have a wider range of powers and whether he can give the Committee
any idea of what those might be; &#147;declarator of nullity&#148;
sounds quite dramatic, but he may have some other information on that.
Most importantly, I wonder whether the 1999 legislation applies in
exactly the same way in Scotland, or whether there is some strange
variant of it that we need to know
about.</div>

Alexander:
						</b> The first thing that I want to say, as a Member
representing a Scottish constituency, is that it is good that the
Government have decided to extend this benefit to cases applying in
Scotland, of which there are a substantial number under the PPF and the
FAS. It is perhaps a little much to expect the Minister to be a Scots
lawyer as well as an English one. I am certainly neither. However, I
have had no representations from legal authorities or others in
Scotland wishing to object to this. Given that Scots law differs, quite
markedly in some respects, to the law in England, it seems to be a
sensible way to extend the provisions in a way that is broadly similar.
From my reading, the effect is broadly the same as that of the
legislation proposed for England and Wales. I hope that is of some help
to the Minister in responding to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
questions.</div>

					<a name="08021969000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as I am aware, the provisions will have broadly the same effect,
although divorce law is devolved in certain respects in Scotland and
therefore there are some differences. Qualifying agreements are used in
Scotland, but not in England and Wales. At present, couples in Scotland
can make a qualifying agreement to set out how a pension is to be
shared. We seek to extend that to pension compensation sharing.
Qualifying agreements differ from court orders in that they are not
orders of the court. However, they still activate pension sharing. The
mechanism for the implementation of a qualifying agreement is to effect
pension sharing, as set out in section 28 of the Welfare Reform and
Pensions Act 1999. Once the agreement has been made in the prescribed
form in Scotland, it has the same effect with regard to pension sharing
as a court order. That seems to be the main
difference.</div>

Committee that that is not regarded as a court order because it is not
an order made by the court. Even in Scots law, that must be a fairly
simple concept to grapple with. I would like to be sure about this. Do
the qualifying agreements have all the status and enforceability of
court orders? This issue that will clearly keep me awake at

Waterson:
						</b> I have some queries, but I am sure that now the
Minister is back on his home territory of English law he will have no
difficulty in answering them. These issues are mainly to do with the
business of the cash equivalent. Perhaps I can deal with clauses 85 and
86 rather than raising points regarding clause 86
specifically.</div>
					<a name="08021969000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">According
to clause 86, regulations are yet again to be made for the calculation
and verification by the board of the cash equivalent. May I ask the
Minister, perhaps with growing plaintiveness, whether there is the
slightest prospect of these draft regulations, or any draft
regulations, being available to the Committee as we plough through our
proceedings? For example, it is pretty well nigh impossible to make any
judgment about how clause 85 is going to work without seeing the draft
regulations. This might be a useful opportunity for the Minister to
give us a reality check on where we are with all the other draft
regulations under this Bill.</div>
					<a name="08021969000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I also ask a specific
question about subsection (5)? It talks about &#147;the valuation
day&#148; being such day within the implementation period as the
board may specify. Again, it would be interesting to get some concept
of how such a valuation day is going to be established, and what
criteria the board would use in making such a determination. Obviously,
if there is a big variation in the valuation day, it could make a
significant difference to the amount of compensation payable under
these provisions. In my habitual spirit of constructive debate, may I
ask the Minister to help me on any of those
issues?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000344"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am afraid that the particular regulations to
which the hon. Gentleman refers are not likely to be available during
the passage of the Bill, so we will have to deal with them in due
course. More generally, we are seeking to bring forward regulations as
soon as possible, but we do not expect regulations on many of these
issues to be available during the course of the Bill. Regulations on
Bills are normally drafted after the Bill has completed its progress.
On particular occasions, we are able to provide drafts of regulations,
but with this Bill, which is enormously complex, we believe that it is
right that when regulations are brought forward, they should be
available for the normal period of consultation with various
stakeholder groups. That is not likely to be the case between now and
June, when I hope that the Bill will complete its progress through the
two Houses.</div>
					<a name="08021969000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
other issue that the hon. Gentleman raised, the valuation day is going
to be set by the board. The clause provides for the rights to be valued
on the valuation day, and that is just the day that the board of the
PPF uses to determine the value of the rights. The board will have to
take a view, and the way in which it does so will have to be set out in
regulations, as will what that valuation day will be. He is quite right
that that could be quite an important event for individuals, because if
the valuation day is either side of a particular date, it could affect
the amount of money that people are entitled to receive. However, the
best way of dealing with that is by setting it out in regulations,
rather than trying to deal with it in detail. The aim of the
legislation is to set out parameters, and more detailed guidance will
be available in
regulations.</div>
					<a name="08021969000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we
are doing through these clauses, in essence, is to set out a framework.
This is divorce law, and divorce law is inherently there to resolve
conflict. There is thus likely to be quite a lot of contesting of the
detail of what that law says, so it is important that the detail is
there. That means that we are setting out the skeleton framework here
in legislation. In due course, we will fill that in with both
regulations and guidance so that we get the level of detail required to
deal with divorce conflicts. I am afraid that that will take more
time.</div>
					<a name="08021969000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry that
I cannot give the hon. Gentleman more detail about the valuation day,
but I have set out the way in which we propose to deal with it. He is
right to say that it is important, but the definition of the valuation
day provides scope for the board of the PPF to choose the day when the
valuation will be made, provided that it falls within the
implementation period. That flexibility broadly follows existing
provisions on the calculation of cash equivalent values for early
leavers and pension
sharing.</div>
					<a name="08021969000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
that is a less than fulsome description of the measure, but I cannot
say much more about it. A fixed valuation day might make it
unnecessarily complex for the rights to be valued, for example, which
is why we think that it is better&#151;as with pension
sharing&#151;that whoever is carrying out the sharing exercise uses a
convenient date during the period set out in
legislation.</div>

Waterson:
						</b> I am again on a search for knowledge. A lot of
issues will be raised with the PPF and a lot of calculations will have
to be made, some of them in respect of relatively small claims. After
analysing some of the figures, it is clear that, for both the PPF and
the FAS, the size of payments will range dramatically, from relatively
small to relatively large. Has any work been done on the extra
administrative cost to the PPF of the provisions? There will clearly be
a significant administrative cost. One could establish a likely cost
based on the number of divorces a year, which is sadly increasing all
the time, the claims on the PPF and the number of sharing orders a
year. How might that impact on the administrative levy that pays for
the PPF? The Minister might not have such facts at his fingertips, so I
am happy for him to write to me about them. It strikes me that there
may be a not insignificant extra cost on the
PPF.</div>
					<a name="08021969000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000346"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> Usually, the administrative costs to carry out
such an exercise would be levied on the couple in a divorce settlement.
The cost of the exercise would be something for them to identify. The
PPF will need to work out the cost to it of the exercise and then
charge for it. The hon. Gentleman referred rightly to the relatively
high level of divorce in this country, but in most cases&#151;not
all, because some will be pre-retirement matters&#151;we will be
dealing with pensioners, and the divorce rate among pensioners is not
as high as it is
otherwise.</div>
					<a name="08021969000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
a very large number of people will be affected, so it is unlikely that
the administrative costs to the PPF will be substantial and, thus, the
cost to individuals who request an administrative processing of their
claim is not likely to be great. The cost of having a pension share
carried out by the PPF will depend on exactly what activities the board
will have to undertake, but it is expected to be in the region of up to
&#163;3,000, which means that a couple undergoing a divorce or
dissolution of a civil partnership will pay similar costs whether they
are sharing a pension or PPF
compensation.</div>

board of the PPF intends to charge divorcing couples similar rates as

Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): May I apologise to
the Committee and to you, Mrs. Anderson, for not being here
earlier? I was not here because Mr. Speaker granted me an
Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall, which ended at only  11
o&#146;clock. I know that this side of the Committee was in the very
capable and experienced hands of my hon. Friend the Member for
Eastbourne.</div>
					<a name="08021969000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
make a small point about clause 88, which will shadow some of the
discussion that we will have about the amendment tabled to clause 89. I
notice that there is provision in clause 88(3) for regulations to
extend the implementation period, but not to open up the possibility of
shortening it. I wonder whether the regulations could be worded to
allow for the implementation period to be varied, rather than just
extended. Will the Minister comment on
that?</div>

Selous:
						</b> On the same theme that I raised on clause 88, I am
curious about where the figure of four months for the implementation
period has come from, given that four months is quite a long time for
someone on a low income to be without money that they  should
regard as rightfully theirs. This is a probing amendment&#151;we have
not alighted on a specific period of two months. I will be grateful if
the Minister will comment on whether that period of four months could
be reduced.</div>
					<a name="08021969000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 10 is another probing amendment to find out why the implementation
period can be postponed in prescribed circumstances and why that is
necessary. Again, we are looking at the matter from the point of view
of people who are in straitened financial circumstances and hardship
and do not have the share of a pension that is rightfully
theirs.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000352"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> I echo the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point and
query why four months is deemed to be a reasonable time period in such
cases. The Minister might have a good reason for alighting on the
particular period of four months, but it seems appropriate that in such
cases&#151;particularly for those on low incomes who might need that
money more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column482" />Column number: 482</div>quickly, such as people who are already in receipt of
pensions&#151;four months, if that is to be the period, should be the
longest period and there should be an aspiration to get these things
done more quickly. Perhaps the Minister has picked up on the four-month
period due to the way in which arrangements work in other cases. For
some people, four months could be a significant period of time and a
cause of hardship, so I hope that the Minister will at least take that
point on board when he
responds.</div>
					<a name="08021969000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000353"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The four-month time limit in the Bill is the same
as that for implementing a normal pension share, so the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey is quite right that we have
looked at arrangements that apply in other areas and taken that as the
standard. That same time limit was arrived at following consultation
involving the judiciary, family lawyers and trustees of pension funds.
It is important that compensation sharing does not depart unnecessarily
from established principles for pension sharing. Inappropriate changes
would lead to additional complexity and create confusion and
uncertainty, and having different time limits would seem to run counter
to our aim. We take the view that this is what would normally be the
case, and therefore we would apply those
criteria.</div>
					<a name="08021969000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000354"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I understand that we might need to have the period
of four months. However, could it be possible&#151;or would the
Minister like it to be best practice&#151;to try to make the
implementation period shorter? I am wary of setting down four months in
legislation so that the solicitors and the PPF think, &#147;We have
four months, so we do not need to worry,&#148; or, &#147;We have
three months, three weeks and three days, and that is our statutory
duty,&#148; when if things could be done quicker, no hardship would
have been caused. That would be a good thing to try and
achieve.</div>
					<a name="08021969000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000355"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> Normally the process would be done more quickly.
Four months is a maximum, and the aim would be to get things done
within that time. However, to implement a compensation share, the PPF
must calculate how the order will reduce the transferor&#146;s
compensation, and calculate the level of compensation due to the
transferee. That will take time and must be done accurately. Once that
is done, the PPF must ensure that correct arrangements are in place so
that the two parties receive the correct payments and are informed of
their new entitlements. They should also have the opportunity to
respond to the figures that they have been given, and to raise any
queries about the accuracy of those figures. In divorce cases, lawyers
want to query just about everything, especially if there is a level of
conflict.</div>
					<a name="08021969000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where the
transferor is already receiving monthly payments when the order, or
qualifying agreement in Scotland, is made, it would be necessary for
the PPF to give the person notice of the date that their payments will
be adjusted and, if appropriate, put in place immediate payments for
the transferee. The PPF makes payments monthly, in advance, on the
first of every month. Therefore it must have enough time to put those
arrangements for payment in place.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column483" />Column number: 483</div>
					<a name="08021969000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that sense, the period is a
maximum. As part of best practice we would want the process to be done
more quickly than the maximum time, and I understand that in most
cases, for pension sharing, it is possible to do so. However, two
months would clearly be too short a period if, for example, a
calculation was made and the amount of that calculation and the way in
which it was arrived at led to a dispute between lawyers. That dispute
has to be resolved, and in the meantime there are lawyers who, with
their usual speed, exchange letters and do the work when something
arrives on their
desk.</div>
					<a name="08021969000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such processes
always take time, and it is unlikely that two months would be
sufficient, although I accept that the amendment is probing. I wish
that we could change the culture of lawyers, but that is, I think, a
bit beyond our ken. We should stick with the current basis upon which
changes are made. In answer to the hon. Gentleman, best practice would
be a shorter period. This is the maximum, and we want to stick with the
rules as they more generally apply to pension
sharing.</div>

best practice, and that he has noted the importance of trying to get

is a maximum, not a target to be aimed for. Having heard that

be informed in writing about what is happening. The Minister might
agree, but we shall

there not being an explanatory note to amendment No. 9, but we tabled

							<a name="08021969000360"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The clause sets out how the board of the PPF
discharges its liability under a compensation-sharing order following a
divorce, annulment, dissolution of a civil partnership or a nullity. It
is important that the board can be certain that it has discharged its
liabilities and that the parties to the divorce or dissolution are
properly notified about how that has been
done.</div>
					<a name="08021969000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause makes it clear that liability is discharged when the
notification is sent to the transferee that the sharing order has been
implemented and that they have compensation rights in the PPF. Clearly,
that cannot happen if the transferee has died, for example. Instead, we
need to look at the rights of others on the death of a person. When
members die, the PPF pays compensation to surviving spouses, civil
partners, unmarried partners and dependent children when the
scheme&#146;s rules make the appropriate provision. That is why we
need to ensure that, when the transferee dies before the transfer is
complete, the correct compensation rights are created for their
surviving partner or children. That is no different from the way in
which the PPF would pay survivors benefits following the death of
members after the transfer was completed. However, because the
implementation is not complete, that is potentially a complex and
somewhat technical matter, which is why the necessary provisions will
be set out in regulations. Amendment No. 9 would remove the power to
make those
regulations.</div>
					<a name="08021969000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 8 would mean that the board would have discharged its liability
only when it had notified both the transferor and the transferee of the
new rights created for the transferee by the compensation share.
Clearly, it is right that both parties receive appropriate notification
of the outcome, but discharging liability is different from merely
providing information. It is right that information should be given to
both parties on the outcome of the compensation-sharing
order.</div>
					<a name="08021969000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulations
made under clause 93, which covers the supply of information about
compensation sharing, can specify the information that the board of the
PPF will have to provide to the parties in consequence of the
implementation of the sharing order. The regulations will make sure
that both parties to the divorce or dissolution receive the appropriate
information about how the sharing order has been
implemented.</div>
					<a name="08021969000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 8 is thus unnecessary and has the potential to create ambiguity. We
need a clear determination of when the legal process for the PPF board
is completed. The clause sets out that legal process. It does not mean
that the other party will not be informed. We intend to ensure under
regulations that the other party will be informed, but it will not be a
necessary part of the legal process for the board to have ensured that
both parties were informed. Someone might have gone abroad or be
difficult to contact. I have known of divorce cases in which someone
has left the country and does not want to be
available.</div>

yes. However, there are circumstances&#151;I am adding a slight
caveat to it&#151;where it is not always possible to get in contact

but I have a couple of questions relating to this clause, about child
use and pension compensation-sharing costs. The clause gives, again,
very broad powers for the Secretary of State to make regulations to
allow the PPF to recover charges, and I guess that that is quite usual
in the cases of pension compensation sharing on divorce. None the less,
it would be useful if the Minister could give at least some reassurance
that these charges will not be excessive, and that they will be in line
with charges in normal such cases, so that anyone reading our
proceedings can be clear that the intention of the clause is not in
anyway to have punitive or excessive charges, and that whether he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column486" />Column number: 486</div>intends through regulations to put any constraints on the PPF in terms
of the range of charges that it may or may not be allowed to levy in

						</b> The board of the PPF intends to charge costs
based upon the National Association of Pension Funds&#146;
recommended scale of charges. It is broadly accepted that that is best,
so that is the basis upon which it will act. That means that divorcing
couples will be charged roughly as the pensions share compensation as
they would be charged to share aid pensions. The sharing order will
normally apportion costs, but the clause provides for the payment by

NAPF charging rates. I have here some quite detailed charging rates
about pension-sharing costs for active and deferred members, which I
can pass onto the hon. Gentleman. I am looking at a table, which talks
about cash equivalent transfer values. Where the cash equivalent cash

discussed that matter. However, the fees set down on the right hand
side of the document that I am handing round the Committee range from
&#163;150 up to &#163;2,550 through a range of different figures.
Those are the figures that run down the right hand side of the column.
I thank the hon. Gentleman for the question, and I hope that with that
reassurance we can move on.</div>

						</b> Again, I have a couple of points that relate
equally to clause 93, so I have the chance to make them twice. Both
clauses relate to provisions to allow the supply and sharing of
information, and therefore presumably the transfer of information
between bodies. I raised that point at an earlier stage when we talked
about transferring information in other circumstances and it is an
obvious one: the Minister may wish to reassure the Committee about the
appropriate security provisions and so on that will be made with regard
to information that is being transferred. There have been
well-publicised problems about information being lost and during the
course of a transfer. Therefore, if regulations are made under the
clause to allow information to be passed from one body to
another&#151;for example, from a pension protection fund to another
body&#151;we must ensure that it is done in the most secure way
possible to avoid any data loss taking place as a result of the

transferees who will receive the payments, we will do all we can to
ensure that information is properly handled. The PPF already has to
handle substantial amounts of personal data, and it is right to
highlight the importance of security. The PPF has managed to do that
with some degree of skill. It is always the case, particularly in the
light of recent events, that we should be more concerned than we have
been that data can be lost. I reassure the hon. Gentleman that as a
result of his comments I will draw to the attention of the board of the

						</b> I do not wish to entangle the Minister in Scots
law&#151;in fact, it is the other Minister&#146;s chance to be
entangled in Scots law, which is welcome. Will the Minister clarify the
intention of the clause? It seems that it allows the Court of Session,
as well as the sheriff, to be involved in decisions about extending
time limits, but it does not extend time limits. Is that interpretation
correct?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000373"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mr. James Plaskitt):
						</b> Broadly, yes, but I will
clarify for the hon. Gentleman to get it straight on the record. The
clause amends sections 28 and 48 of the 1999 Act, which deal with the
orders that activate pension sharing on pension arrangements and on
shareable state scheme rights respectively. The amendments deal with
orders made in Scottish
courts.</div>
					<a name="08021969000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
a couple divorce or civil partners dissolve their relationship, they
can ask for a financial settlement. One of the options open to the
court is to make a pension-sharing or corresponding order. Such an
order can be made against a pension arrangement or the shareable state
scheme rights. For orders made under the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985
or a corresponding provision to have effect, the person responsible for
the pension arrangement must receive the order and the matrimonial
documents within two months of the date of the order. If the order is
not received within that period it is deemed never to have taken
effect.</div>
					<a name="08021969000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">A party with
an interest in the order may apply to extend the two-month period if it
has expired and the order and the matrimonial documents have not been
received by the person responsible for the pension arrangement.
Applications for extensions can currently only be made to the sheriff.
However, as I am sure the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch
and Strathspey knows, some divorces in Scotland are heard in the Court
of Session. Currently, there is no provision for applications to be
made to the Court of Session to extend the two-month period and there
is no reason why the Court of Session should not consider those
applications. Otherwise, such an application would have to be remitted
to the sheriff. The clause gives the Court of Session in Scotland the
same powers as the sheriff to extend the two-month period. That will be
a modest but worthwhile improvement, which should help the
pension-sharing process. I hope that that explains the clause and that
the hon. Gentleman will agree that it should stand part of the

Waterson:
						</b> The purpose of clause 98 and accompanying
schedule 7 is to allow for interest to be charged on late payment and
levies to the PPF. That proposition is so obvious and reasonable that
one wonders 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column489" />Column number: 489</div>why it was not included in the original legislation. No doubt the
Minister will explain that apparent
oversight.</div>
					<a name="08021969000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes, to which I like to refer from time to time, just to
ensure that the person who drafted them was not completely wasting
their time,
says:</div>
					<a name="08021969000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
may be circumstances in which it would be inappropriate to charge
interest on late payment of
levies&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08021969000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that there
would be</div>
					<a name="08021969000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;power to
prescribe such circumstances in
regulations&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08021969000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
waste my breath by asking whether the draft regulations are available,
but it would be helpful if the Minister said what circumstances would
constitute a good reason or an excuse for not paying on time. After
all, a payment not made on time is costing money to all the people who
pay the levies on
time.</div>
					<a name="08021969000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear that
the Pensions Act 2004 does not contain a power for the board of the PPF
to make a charge of interest. The impact assessment makes the obvious
point, which is that if these monies&#151;these interest
payments&#151;were available, they could be used for investment and,
presumably, to defray the overall costs of the levy to British
industry. The research paper
says:</div>
					<a name="08021969000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we would expect
the fact that interest would be charged on late payments would reduce
the incidence of late
payment&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08021969000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">although
I suspect that that would depend on the interest rate and how it
compared with how much the company had to pay for its own
borrowings&#151;</div>
					<a name="08021969000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as
schemes would aim to pay Levy bills more promptly to avoid paying
interest.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08021969000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
calculated, on a particular rate of interest, that that would have
brought in about &#163;600,000, which is, as the saying goes, better
than a poke in the eye with a sharp
stick.</div>
					<a name="08021969000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">This matter is
certainly worth pursuing. I will be interested to hear the Minister's
explanation, or apology, for not putting such a provision in the
previous legislation, although I appreciate that he was not the
Minister responsible at the time, and I should like to know in what
circumstances it would be inappropriate to charge interest in
particular
cases.</div>

Alexander:
						</b> Further to those comments, again, I agree with
the hon. Gentleman that it is sensible to have provisions allowing
interest on late payment of levies relating to the PPF. Such provision
should probably have been included in the 2004 Act, deliberations on
which the hon. Member for Eastbourne was also involved in, as he said
in response to an earlier point. Of course, for the sake of
completeness, I am sure that Liberal Democrats were also involved in
that legislation, too, so we cannot be wholly blameless in this regard
either. None the less, the Government have the resources, as has been
said
before.</div>
					<a name="08021969000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like the Minister to clarify whether this provision has been
advanced to rectify an omission, whether there have been cases where
levies have been paid late and whether there is a particular problem
with late payment which the Pension Protection Fund has drawn to his
attention. It will be interesting to know what information the Minister
has, if any, about the extent of the problem of late payment, how late
payments 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column490" />Column number: 490</div>are being made and whether that is causing a problem for the PPF
carrying out its business. In other words, having introduced these
powers, does he expect that the PPF will need to use them regularly?
What is the proportion of companies making late payment of levies to
the PPF? Does the provision answer a significant practical problem that
is currently being experienced or does the Minister regard it more as
an insurance policy to ensure that it does not happen in
future?</div>
					<a name="08021969000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000376"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> First, I am assured that some of the levies were
set in the Pension Schemes Act 1993. The 2004 Act merely created the
PPF, but some of the levies were set out in the 1993 Act, for which
another Government may wish to claim
responsibility.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000377"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I am sure that the Minister is
desperately trying to shift the blame, but if the levies were being
levied from 1993 onwards, what were they for if there was no PPF until
2004?</div>
					<a name="08021969000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000378"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> When we came into office, we felt that protection
under the Pension Schemes Act 1993 was not adequate. Given that there
was broad support for the PPF, I presume that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s party also felt that the provisions that it had put
in place were inadequate. However, when it put them in place, it did
not have in that Act, which provides that interest may be charged on
late payment and makes sure that there is coverage for the Office of
the Pensions Advisory Service and the pensions ombudsman, a provision
for the levy to have interest if it is paid late. Perhaps the better
argument would be that we should have spotted in 2004 the mistake made
by the previous Conservative Government. As the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey said, the hon. Member for
Eastbourne was a member of the Committee considering the Bill at that
time, while I was not, so perhaps he should have spotted the mistake
that his Government had made in 1993. However, perhaps we can all share
the
blame.</div>
					<a name="08021969000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me be clear. I mentioned that the levy covers the Office of the
Pensions Advisory Service and the pensions ombudsman. The total general
levy from occupational and personal pension schemes for 2008-09, for
example, is expected to collect &#163;42 million, but that will be
divided. It will not all go to the PPF. About &#163;7 million is
earmarked to recoup one third of the deficit that has built up over the
past three years. I shall return to that issue in a moment. The
bulk&#151;84 per cent.&#151;of the ongoing &#163;35.6 million is
to pay for the Pensions Regulator, with the balance being split roughly
between the  Office of the Pensions Advisory Service and the
pensions ombudsman. The general levy has not increased  since
2005, when the Pensions Regulator replaced  the Occupational
Pensions Regulatory Authority, because of a ministerial commitment that
we would not  increase
it.</div>
					<a name="08021969000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to the
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, we need the
power to tackle the late payment levies and 40 per cent. of the pension
protection levy collected for 2006-07 was paid after  28 days,
which accounted for about &#163;114 million of the &#163;271
million collected. We had quite a bit of late payment. The hon. Member
for Eastbourne rightly asked whether there are circumstances in which
it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column491" />Column number: 491</div>justifiable to pay late. One of the reasons why we have had a lot of
late payment in recent years is that there has been a dispute about the
amount of levy. A number of the funds involved have said that the level
of risk, for example, that is included in the calculation of the levy
is wrong and that they are not as risky as all that. The funds have had
it looked at again and, in many cases, it has been agreed that the levy
can be reduced.</div>
					<a name="08021969000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems that there was some justifiable reason for a late payment and, in
such circumstances, it would be open not to charge interest on the late
payments because that was justified; the original levy that was imposed
was not right. There are circumstances in which it may be right not to
charge interest. Obviously, there are circumstances in which there is
no dispute about the level of the levy and payments just arrive late
when it would be appropriate to charge interest. I hope that I have
answered the various issues that have been
raised.</div>

							<a name="08021969000379"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> When I first looked at the clause, I thought
that it was very techie and that we did not need to say anything about
it. All it seemed to do was to clarify the technical issues surrounding
the powers of the Pensions Regulator under the Occupational Pension
Schemes (Scheme Funding) Regulations 2005.
</div>
					<a name="08021969000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the things
that drives the regulator is the principle that the methods and
assumptions used by pension fund trustees are chosen prudently. For
example, if they assumed that their members would live to the age of
36, that would clearly be a bit imprudent. All of this&#151;surprise,
surprise&#151;emanates from the European occupational pensions
directive of 2003. So far, so good. The clause, as I read it, does what
it says on the tin and clarifies that the regulator can use their
powers under section 231(2) of the 2004 Act, where the sole ground of
concern is that the actuarial methods or assumptions do not appear to
be prudent. However, what gives that topical salience is the flurry of
press comment in the past few days about the changes in assumptions on
longevity figures being proposed by the regulator. I gather that those
changes are now out for consultation until May sometime. No doubt the
Minister will be able to tell us a bit more about that. Potentially,
those changes could have a dramatic effect on pension scheme deficits.
I have seen one estimate that adds an extra &#163;75 billion to the
burden on existing schemes. Sometime this week, we will get on to risk
sharing and how we can encourage various schemes to stay in business,
as it were. The need for those measures is given extra urgency by these
proposals.</div>
					<a name="08021969000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
might say that it will cost &#163;75 billion extra simply to reflect
the fact that, for example, under the PPF&#146;s current assumption a
man will live to 87.9 years on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column492" />Column number: 492</div>average, which is up from 86.8 in its 2006 report and accounts. The
figure being bandied around at the moment by the Pensions Regulator is
89. That is very encouraging if you are a man and, presumably, no
doubt, even more encouraging if you are a
woman&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I should tell my hon. Friend the
Member for Bromsgrove, who makes a comment from a sedentary position,
that the gap between the sexes is narrowing quite rapidly, although I
will not speculate why that is so. Those figures raise some important
issues that go way beyond the technical issue in the
clause.</div>
					<a name="08021969000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulators
have been worried that schemes have been understating or
underestimating the rate at which life expectancy continues to
increase. I have read some statistics, which will no doubt perk up
Committee members who may not have volunteered to sit on the Committee,
that say that for every hour they spend here, their life expectancy
increases by a quarter of an hour. That is quite
dramatic.</div>

						</b> Time moves more slowly in this Committee. I
think that Albert Einstein would have said something about serving on a
pensions Bill Committee. Time appears to move slowly here. However,
broadly speaking, we all end up in the same place, whether we are
sitting in a Committee, in the Chamber or in our offices, which would
make a nice change from sitting
here.</div>
					<a name="08021969000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The big issue is
how we deal with this new development. It is very encouraging that,
thanks to the foresight and wisdom of successive Governments, life
expectancy has increased. Of course, we know that the state pension age
of 65 for men was borrowed from Bismarck, who came up with it in the
middle of the 19th century. That was a time when few people made it to
the age of 65 and certainly not far beyond it, although I think that
Bismarck did. How do we  factor that
in?</div>

					<a name="08021969000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was about
to say that one could argue that, if the extra costs are &#163;75
billion, so be it. That fact must be built in to pension schemes more
generally. However, it is bound to be a factor in the attitude of
sponsoring employers to keeping their existing pension schemes open to
new or existing members. In the same way, to take an example, FRS 17,
introduced at exactly the wrong point in the economic cycle in my
opinion, had an effect on undermining that commitment.</div>
					<a name="08021969000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yes, it is important that we
clarify that the regulator has those powers, but it is not the
Committee&#146;s job to argue whether the EU directive was sensible
in the first place. As a Committee, we need to put all this in a
broader context, which is the dramatic increase in life expectancy.
Ultimately, matters such as obesity and selling off playing fields will
have an impact on slowing the increase in longevity, but short of a

better nutrition. It also brings a different reality with it, which is
how we pay for the very long periods of retirement that people will

					<a name="08021969000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, the
clause seems relatively modest and inoffensive, but behind it lurks the
elephant in the room&#151;to use a marvellous and much over-used
analogy&#151;which is the question of rapidly increasing life

Alexander:
						</b> I am sorry to hear that the hon. Member for
Eastbourne is not enjoying the Committee&#146;s deliberations.
Perhaps time slowing down means that he wants to spend more time in
these sittings. Certainly, the record of the number of 100th birthdays
in his constituency suggests that time there is speeding up, so there
is a balance to be struck
somewhere.</div>
					<a name="08021969000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dressed up
as a technical clause, this raises an important point, rightly lighted
upon by the hon. Gentleman. I do not wish to repeat his remarks, as he
made many of the points that I had intended to make. However, the key
word in relation to the clause is
&#147;prudent&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08021969000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
report released this week, which is now a matter out for consultation
from the regulator, suggests that the regulator is doing its own work
on what it considers to be prudent. Does that mean, should the clause
be enacted, that the regulator will therefore effectively determine the
actuarial considerations each scheme should make? Or is it a slightly
looser arrangement, under which the regulator has the power to
determine the prudence of the actuarial considerations? That does not
mean that they have to be exactly along the lines of the examples that
the hon. Gentleman gave, which have been reported quite widely this
week. But, for example, a pension scheme, that made actuarial
assumptions higher or lower than those made on the national average
could, none the less, justify those assumptions as being prudent on the
basis of its team members&#146;
knowledge.</div>
					<a name="08021969000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would seem not quite right that uniform actuarial assumptions should be
imposed by the regulator across all pension schemes. However, it is
sensible and necessary, given the content of the European law, that
there should be an ability to determine whether the actuarial
assumptions made by the scheme are prudent.</div>
					<a name="08021969000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note, in closing, that the
work of the Pensions Regulator on understanding the extent to which
life expectancy is increasing has not only an implication for pension
schemes in the private sector, which the clause refers to, but a
significant effect on the liabilities of public sector pension schemes.
That is a matter that is debated and highlighted all too rarely by
Ministers. Information was recently brought forward, or at least
endorsed, by the Government on the work of the Institute for Fiscal
Studies on a rough estimate of unfunded public sector pension
liabilities. Given that, if the new actuarial considerations were
applied to public 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column494" />Column number: 494</div>sector pension liabilities what greater extent would the Minister see
those liabilities taking? There is also a massive implication for the
public purse that is being swept under the carpet, and I would welcome
his comments on that. While the debate concerns a technical point, it
has much broader implications across the public and private
sectors.</div>

							<a name="08021969000383"></a>Mr.
Greenway:
						</b> This is an important issue and my hon. Friend
the Member for Eastbourne is on to something in raising it, but
listening to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey reminds me what the issue was about originally, which is not
quite what we are discussing. My understanding is that it is about
ensuring that members of schemes have reassurance and confidence that
the funding of their schemes by employers is adequate. Of course, in
the great debate about public sector pensions that does not quite apply
in the same way. Many public sector pensions are unfunded; one thinks
particularly of the police service. What to do about the burgeoning
liabilities of public sector pensions is a major political issue for
this Government and any future Government. The Minister will remember a
point I made on Second Reading, which is that it will be a huge tragedy
if we continue to move away, right across the piste, from final salary
schemes, simply on the argument about what is affordable. I have real
concerns about what future generations may be entitled to in
retirement, which in a sense is linked up with this issue.</div>
					<a name="08021969000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the issues that my hon.
Friend the Member for Eastbourne has raised, there must be a concern if
the regulator is to use the new power in clause 99 to impose an
actuarial calculation regime on schemes that until now everybody has
regarded as being well-managed, prudent and properly funded. I would
share his concern if that were the case, however, my reading&#151;I
may have it completely wrong&#151;is that this is actually a
provision to assist members of schemes who feel that employers are not
contributing sufficiently. That has been a major scandal in many
schemes. The new power would enable the Pensions Regulator, which is
the watchdog on behalf of scheme members, to make an intervention even
if the cosy relationship between trustees and employers means that they
think that all is well, which has also gone on in the past.</div>
					<a name="08021969000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
critical issue. For the reasons I have stated, we need this power in
the Bill. What we need from the Minister is a reassurance it will not
be used across the board to impose new funding requirements on all
kinds of schemes, in response to the longevity information that my hon.
Friend the Member for Eastbourne rightly drew attention to. Those two
points are different. Those schemes that the regulator feels are
underfunded can now be dealt with even if the trustees and the
employers think that they are funded sufficiently.</div>
					<a name="08021969000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">My understanding is that at the
moment, the regulator cannot intervene&#151;with this power he could,
and that is important. I entirely share the concern of my hon. Friend
the Member for Eastbourne. If the provision enables the regulator to
interfere right across the board in employer pension schemes,
particularly in the private sector, that could potentially impose
funding requirements which would drive even more schemes into defined
contribution arrangements and away from defined benefit arrangements.
That would add to the problem of levelling down about which we are all
concerned.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000384"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I thank the hon. Member for Ryedale; he has
encapsulated the argument well. We must ensure that members of a
pension scheme can be sure that the funding of their pension scheme is
adequate. On occasion, sometimes after discussions with employers,
trustees have accepted that a particular level of funding is adequate
when circumstances have changed. Over recent decades we have seen
actuaries who calculate the amount of liability a pension fund has
based upon the data that they look at. That data is about how long
people are living. Over the last decade or so we have recognised that
data about how long people have lived for the last few decades will no
longer reflect how long they live in the decades to come. That has
implications for pension funds, which will have to provide for greater
funding if people are living longer&#151;there must be more money to
pay their pensions for longer.</div>
					<a name="08021969000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Actuaries have made various
calculations and shared views about projections for life expectancy,
and therefore how much money pension funds have to have. However, many
of the calculations established, particularly during the late 1990s,
were wrong and the amounts that needed to be put in were higher than
expected. The result of that is that a lot of work has been done by
actuaries over the last decade, seeking to get a better fix on how long
people are likely to live. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to
deal with the point raised by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey. People in different types of occupations have
longer life expectancies than others.</div>
					<a name="08021969000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I represent a mining area. We
still have a working pit and I am a miners&#146; MP&#151;a rarity
these days. In my area there are many people who have pneumoconiosis
and other pit-related diseases, and life expectancy is therefore
reduced as a result. The mortality rate in my local hospital, the
George Eliot hospital, is very high. Various figures have suggested
that that is due to a poor hospital&#151;actually it is due to the
fact that it represents an area where there is a history of particular
types of disease. Therefore, if we make projections in a particular
industry about how much funding we will need, we must have data about
the nature of the life spans of people in that industry. The life span
of a miner is now greater than in was in the past: care for their
health and safety is greater, and the general health benefits and the
lifestyles that people lead are better than they were in the
past.</div>
					<a name="08021969000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
miners&#146; pension funds must make calculations based not on how
long miners lived in the 1970s, 80s and 90, but how long they are
likely to live in the 2020s, 30s and 40s and decades to come. Provision
in the fund must be made for those sorts of life expectancies. Some
trustees&#151;not in that particular fund, but in some&#151;have
taken somewhat conservative views about life expectancies. I use the
word &#147;conservative&#148; with a small &#147;c&#148;. The
result is that the fund is underfunded, or at least that there is some
concern among members about its adequacy.</div>
					<a name="08021969000298"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08021969000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulator
has a specific ability to intervene, as the hon. Member for Ryedale
suggests, but there is also a more general issue, to which the hon.
Members for Eastbourne and for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey have referred: what about the concerns that the regulator
may have that some pension funds may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column496" />Column number: 496</div>well not have made adequate provision, and how do we ensure that there
is adequate provision in pension funds and that trustees are properly
advised about how to approach such issues of increased
longevity?</div>
					<a name="08021969000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
addresses an uncertainty that has arisen about the circumstances in
which the pensions regulator can use its powers to regulate a scheme
funding requirement for private sector defined benefit schemes. The
regulator has a range of scheme funding powers that it can use where
there has been a breach of the legislation, or where the trustees and
sponsoring employers cannot reach agreement on a key aspect of the
scheme&#146;s funding arrangements.</div>
					<a name="08021969000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the duties of a pension
scheme&#146;s trustees is to decide which actuarial assumptions to
use. They can look at particular actuarial valuations of their scheme
as a result of that. Legislation requires that those assumptions must
be chosen prudently. Where it appears that the trustees have not
complied with that requirement the regulator has the power to specify
what assumptions must be used.</div>
					<a name="08021969000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulator has recently
faced challenges to its power to intervene where the actuarial
assumptions used in a valuation do not appear to have been chosen
prudently by the trustees. The actuarial assumptions used in a
valuation are crucial to establishing the scheme&#146;s correct
funding position, and therefore the level of contributions payable by
the sponsoring
employer.</div>
					<a name="08021969000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
does not give the regulator any new powers. It clarifies what powers we
assumed the regulator had. It simply ensures that the regulator can use
its scheme funding powers, thereby protecting both members&#146;
benefits and the PPF, where the assumptions chosen by trustees do not
appear to be prudent. In that sense, the hon. Member for Ryedale is
entirely right.</div>
					<a name="08021969000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Eastbourne has however raised the broader issue about
the recent consultation document, which was published yesterday. I want
to tell him clearly and candidly that the regulator takes its
independence very much to heart and is clear that it has a role to look
after the general security of the industry and make sure that trustees
consider appropriate actuarial assumptions. Therefore it took a view
that it wanted to publish the consultation document.</div>
					<a name="08021969000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I was made aware that the
regulator was about to do that&#151;and I saw some of the
media&#151;I approached it, and we considered the matter. Once
pension fund representatives examine the document they will see that it
is essentially a consultation document, to ask them their views on how
those issues of increased longevity should be dealt with. It is not a
diktat from on high. It is an attempt by the pensions regulator to
engage in a serious process of examining actuarial projections, which
are constantly changing.</div>
					<a name="08021969000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">That has implications for
pension funds. We do not know quite what those are yet. Some of the
headlines that I saw in the <i class="I">Daily Express</i> and elsewhere are
lurid, fanciful projections based on journalists seeking to get a
headline from an issue that would probably be seen as more technical
than anything else. The implications are profound and important; but
they are also technical. The question is how best to make the
calculations, and by what means to deal with a major change in society.
It is a very welcome change: on average we are living 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column497" />Column number: 497</div>longer. That is great, but it has to be paid for,
and that sometimes is not so great, because it leads to problems over
where to find the money.</div>
					<a name="08021969000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need a way
to gauge how much we must pay, and that is why those actuarial issues
require broad discussion. What the regulator has sought to do is set
out a consultation document that says, &#147;Look, we have an issue
here. Let&#146;s talk about it and discuss how we can best calculate
this. These are our ideas, what are yours? Let&#146;s have a proper
consultation discussion about the best way in which trustees can deal
with the issue and have appropriate actuarial calculations for your
particular industry and, more broadly, for pension funds as a
whole.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08021969000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
condemn some of the lurid headlines. I do not think that they are
helpful. They are raising fears among pensioners, which is unnecessary.
At the same time, however, this is a genuine issue that needs to be
dealt with in a technical and serious way. What the regulator has done,
independently of Government, is to put forward the idea of having a
broad-based consultation on an enormously important issue to see
whether we can get a consensus between trustees and actuaries about how
to proceed.</div>

Selous:
						</b> I am listening with great interest to the
Minister. We are all grateful to him for his very discursive and useful
analysis of this very important matter. However, I am not aware that he
has responded to the point that was raised by my hon. Friend the Member
for Eastbourne about the big increase in childhood obesity and type 2
diabetes. Are those conditions feeding into the life expectancy
figures? While I accept that people are living longer, we are all aware
of the increase in childhood obesity and I wonder whether that has been
factored into the actuarial figures. Perhaps the Minister could get
back to the Committee at a later stage on that important
issue.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000386"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> Actuaries will have to take into account
projections of the possible impact. I do not know whether they have
decided on the projections. The extent to which they need to take them
into account will depend on the type of industry in question. There are
some occupations in which obesity is unlikely to be a problem. However,
other occupations might need to take into account issues related to
obesity. This is not a one-size-fits-all issue. It is about getting
trustees in particular areas and particular occupations to be able to
project what sort of longevity members of particular schemes might have
and therefore what the adequacy of funding will be. One of the issues
that they will consider when they make their calculations is the
projections offered by the Office of National Statistics, which will
deal with the sorts of points raised by the hon.
Gentleman.</div>

							<b class="B">Miss
Julie Kirkbride</b> (Bromsgrove) (Con): In terms of
affordability and what is set out in the Bill that we are currently
looking at as opposed to the consultation exercise that is now going
on, what kind of options for affordability is at the behest of the
regulator? Is it simply to increase employers&#146; contribution, to
change the amount of pension that will be paid out, or to stop pension
holidays? In determining affordability, what kind of issues can the
regulator decide upon? Can it increase employers&#146; contributions
to beyond 3 per cent. that is set out in the regulations for lower paid
workers?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000388"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> In terms of personal accounts, projections about
life expectancy will obviously have a relevance. However, we are
dealing with defined benefit schemes rather than defined contributions
schemes. In defined contributions schemes, such as personal accounts,
the amount that is built up in the pot will determine the amount that
the person gets. Although it is a relevant consideration, it does not
have the crucial importance that it does in the defined benefit scheme,
which is, in effect, a final salary scheme. In such a scheme, the
employer may well have the obligation, but it may, in some
circumstances, be shared with the employee to ensure that the scheme is
adequately and properly funded. If a projection by an actuary employed
by a scheme says that they expect a defined benefit scheme to have a
longer life expectancy, in some cases, depending on the terms of the
scheme, it will sometimes predominantly affect the employer because
they will have to properly fund the scheme. The hon. Lady asked whether
it would affect issues such as holidays and so on, which employers
might take as contributions&#151;the answer is yes. If it looks like
there is a surplus, and if new projections suggest that the surplus is
not that great, a holiday or whatever the employer may have felt
possible may not be possible. The level of adequacy of the funding will
have been increased, because of new projections on longevity. Holidays
and other things will be
affected.</div>
					<a name="08021969000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
why I am concerned about lurid headlines on whether some pension
schemes are able to be paid is that in the vast majority of cases, they
are not justified. In some cases, the headlines are about life
expectancies some decades into the future. The provisions that must be
put in place now will deal with a problem that will occur in 2050, say.
The problem does not exist now, so there is plenty of time to make
provisions to deal with it. When the consultation document was
published, the journalists said, &#147;We could have this problem
now&#151;the schemes are underfunded&#148;, but that is not the
case. The problem may well appear only in decades to come, so there is
plenty of time between now and then to make adequate provision to deal
with it.</div>
					<a name="08021969000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Ryedale, with his usual precision, touched on the broader
issue of the move away from final salary schemes, which has been going
on since the 1960s. Some 8 million people were in private final salary
schemes in the 1960s; the number fell to about 5 million by 1995; and
it has now gone down to about 3 million. Only some of those are open
schemes. There has been a major change, and one of the things that that
the Bill does more broadly is bring about deregulation changes that
will encourage people to stay in, and employers to stay with, final
salary schemes. I am not claiming that the Bill will reverse the
process to which the hon. Gentleman referred, whereby employers move
away from final salary schemes, but I hope that it will slow or steady
it. In the past two or three years, the movement away from final salary
schemes has steadied, and employers tend to stay with them more than
before. I hope that we will further be able to steady the
process&#151;I do not think that we will reverse it&#151;but,
hopefully, we will be able to extend final salary schemes for longer.
They are good schemes, so we should keep them if we can. No doubt we
will have the opportunity to discuss that further when we debate shared
risk.</div>

Waterson:
						</b> I am slightly puzzled by the clause, which is
tucked away all on its ownsome. We had significant, substantive debates
earlier in our proceedings about transfers in and out of personal
accounts, and I wonder what the clause is for. As I read it, it seems
to deal only with transfers out of schemes set up under clause 50, but
it harks back to the Pension Schemes  Act 1993, so perhaps I am
wrong about that. It seems to give the Secretary of State a power to
make regulations under that Act to prevent transfers out of a clause 50
scheme. On what basis would that power apply, and in what
circumstances?</div>
					<a name="08021969000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concerns that we have expressed in previous debates have been about
transfers into personal accounts and trying to retain a Berlin wall
between existing provision and personal accounts&#151;in other words,
trying to ensure that personal accounts do not undermine good and more
generous existing provision. The clause seems to be about only
transfers the other way, and I am I sure that the Minister can explain
it&#151;in a sentence, if he is so
minded.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000392"></a>Mr.
Greenway:
						</b> I will be brief, because we want to make some
progress. I agree with my hon. Friend and would like the Minister to
tell us what the prescribed circumstances are. I may have this wrong,
as if so I apologise to the Committee and the
Minister&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>The other Minister, the
Under-Secretary. Not having been able to be in the Committee throughout
the whole process, I apologise if this has already been discussed and
debated.</div>
					<a name="08021969000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
reading of the clause is that it enables the Secretary of State,
through regulations, to effectively prohibit transfers out of clause
50-type personal account schemes. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column500" />Column number: 500</div>If that is the case, we also need to consider what limited exceptions
there may be in which transfers out are permitted. The Under-Secretary
will recall that, during the public evidence sessions, I raised the
question whether, when and to what extent it might be prudent to allow
limited transfers out, for example in respect of migrant labour. I
mentioned the importance of ensuring that a personal accounts scheme is
not eventually cluttered up with literally millions of relatively
small, insubstantial contributions.</div>
					<a name="08021969000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary is nodding reassuringly to say that I am on the right
point. In that case, I shall take  30 seconds longer to say
that if what I have said is the case, we need him to clarify precisely
what the prescribed circumstances will be and what time frame he
envisages. If I remember correctly from the questions that we put to
both Ministers on when transfers out might be permitted, it will
probably be 2017&#151;five years into the personal account
arrangement&#151;before that will be allowed. That is nine years
away. For the purposes of the record and proper scrutiny, we ought to
have something on the record to clarify the position. We cannot just
leave it where it was at the end of the public evidence sessions when
the Minister for Pensions Reform was one of the
witnesses.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08021969000393"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I know that the hon. Member for Eastbourne hoped
that I might dispense with the clause in a sentence. Alas, no, because
it is important to clarify exactly what it does. It is right to see it
as, in essence, a paving power; that is its purpose. Let me explain how
it relates to the earlier clauses to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
It is right to say that there is a linkage, but the clause is there for
a good
reason.</div>
					<a name="08021969000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
discussed our commitment to banning most transfers into and out of
personal accounts when we debated clause 53. Clause 100 enables the
Secretary of State to prohibit personal account members from
transferring pension funds to other pension schemes. Our rationale for
banning pension fund transfers is to position personal accounts as an
effective, complementary addition to the existing private pensions
market. The Government&#146;s policy on transfers, and their
commitment to review it in 2017&#151;that is important&#151;was
widely supported by all stakeholders, as I am sure hon. Members will
recall.</div>
					<a name="08021969000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me explain
in some detail why the clause is structured as it is. I think that that
will answer the points that have been raised. Chapter IV of part
IV  of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 gives members of pension
schemes the general right to transfer out of their scheme into another
one, but section 93(1B) of that chapter contains a limited
regulation-making power that enables schemes to ban transfers out in
some limited circumstances. However, the power is not broad enough to
allow a ban on transfer out of personal accounts, and therefore clause
100(2) widens its
scope.</div>
					<a name="08021969000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 100(3)
amends section 101F of the 1993 Act to enable the Secretary of State to
introduce regulations to prevent members from transferring their
pension credit benefit, which we discussed earlier, out of the personal
accounts scheme. We plan to exercise the regulatory power in
subsections (2) and (3) only in respect of the personal accounts
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08021969000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may be
some minor specific circumstances where we will want to allow a certain
amount of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column501" />Column number: 501</div>flexibility. The hon. Member for Ryedale asked for a bit more
information about them. It is important to stress that this will be
looked at in 2017, at the time of the review, but we can already see
circumstances for which it might be appropriate to make exceptions. Of
three that have been identified, one is the stranded pots issue, which
we touched on before. That is where someone who is over 55 wants to
aggregate all their pension pots in different schemes into one fund in
order to purchase an annuity. We might want to allow some flexibility
in that area when introducing the transfer out
regulations.</div>
					<a name="08021969000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">A second
identified example is unvested pension funds. If an individual leaves
an exempt scheme during the pre-vesting period, they may be allowed to
transfer their accrued funds into personal accounts. Those will be cash
transfers, not standard pension transfers of the type that would be
prohibited, and the amounts will not count toward the annual
contribution limit. The third example, which we discussed earlier, is
the discharge of pension shares. That, too, would be appropriate in
some
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="08021969000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
as I said, the fundamental opportunity to review the matter in its
entirety will come with the 2017 review, which is a long way off from
now but not so long after the start of personal pensions. That would be
the appropriate time to look at it. We will specify in legislation the
prescribed circumstances in which personal account members will be
prevented from transferring out of the scheme. The legislation will not
prevent other transfers between existing pension schemes from taking
place. It is important to stress that. The wider position on transfers
will be kept under review until
later.</div>
					<a name="08021969000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
integral to the design of personal accounts schemes. It will allow the
Secretary of State to make regulations which will do three essential
things: first, keep the scheme focused on serving the needs of the
target market; secondly, facilitate the smooth introduction of the new
scheme, reducing any risk of market turbulence; and, thirdly, promote
simplicity for employers, individuals and the personal accounts
administration.</div>
					<a name="08021969000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is why the clause was included. I hope that I have answered hon.
Members&#146; questions and that they will agree to clause stand
part.</div>

							<a name="08021969000394"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> Ever since I first saw the Bill, I have been
fascinated by this clause and been determined to say something about
it. I initially wondered whether the official printer had not made a
mistake and incorporated something from wholly different legislation
into the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column502" />Column number: 502</div>Bill, so I am keen to find out what lies behind it. I am sure that there
is a story, and it is important that the Minister shares it. Why just
the Poles for a start? What is the magic significance of 1 May 2004?
Indeed, for that matter, what is the magic significance of 1947? I
assume that the provision was designed to stop payments being made to
former members of Polish forces who fought valiantly and alongside us
in many theatres of the second world war, but who decided to chose to
return to communist post-war Poland. I may have got it completely
wrong, but there is a chunk of history here that deserves its moment in
the sun&#151;in Committee Room 10.</div>

Plaskitt:
						</b> Almost. I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman
for giving us the opportunity to visit the question, and I shall give
him the history that he asks for.</div>
					<a name="08021969000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Polish Resettlement Act
1947, which is why the clause refers only to Poland, permitted a scheme
to be made to award pensions to members of the Polish forces injured or
killed during service under British command in the second world war. It
provides an equivalent to the main war pension scheme for those forces.
The current Pensions (Polish Forces) Scheme 1964 was set up on the
basis that at some point after the end of the war, the Polish
Government would take responsibility for members of the Polish forces.
No Polish Government have, therefore pensions continue in payment for
those individuals.</div>
					<a name="08021969000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">A European
Court of Justice ruling in October 2006, on a reference from a Dutch
court, found that similar residence restrictions in a Dutch scheme for
paying benefits to second world war civilians were contrary to the
principle of EU citizens&#146; freedom of movement between member
states, as set out in article 18 of the European convention on human
rights. That was notwithstanding member-state competence to make rules
for the payment of war pensions. The ECJ held that although the
objective of the residence condition of restricting benefits to those
connected to Netherlands society was legitimate in principle, the
condition was not a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate
objective. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is following
this.</div>
					<a name="08021969000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Advice received
from Ministry of Defence lawyers and Cabinet Office legal advisers
confirmed that the residency provision in the 1947 Act cannot be
justified in relation to beneficiaries who were EU citizens and had
moved to Poland after Polish accession to the European Union on 1 May
2004, unless they received the same amount from Poland as they used to
receive in the United Kingdom. The Polish system of war pensions is
more restrictive than that provided under the 1964 Scheme, and it
therefore does not provide the same benefits. The number of
beneficiaries under the Polish scheme is, unfortunately, shrinking
fast. It was 730 in 2007, and most beneficiaries are elderly and well
settled in the UK. They may be in Eastbourne, in which case they will
live quite a long time. It is highly unlikely, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column503" />Column number: 503</div>therefore, that significant numbers will chose to return to Poland in
the remaining years of the scheme. However, some might, which is why
the clause is important. The number of beneficiaries who have moved to
Poland since 1 May 2004, and who have had their pensions withdrawn, is
understood to be fewer than 10. That is the history. That is the
reason. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Member for Eastbourne will
understand why the clause is in the
Bill.</div>
