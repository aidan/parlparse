                           </span> Clause 51 and the
subsequent clauses in this chapter remove Monitor’s
responsibility for regulating foundation trusts and turn it into an
economic regulator. Labour Members oppose that change for reasons that
I will set out in our consideration of subsequent amendments and
clauses. In this clause stand part debate, I want to highlight one
crucial issue, which is the risk associated with removing
Monitor’s responsibility for foundation
trusts.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000023">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Committee will be aware that currently Monitor has to agree that a
hospital, ambulance service or other NHS provider has effective
governance arrangements before it may become a foundation trust. Once
an FT is established, it is up to the board of directors, backed up by
the board of governors, to ensure the FT is effectively governed. If a
trust has problems and does not have effective governance arrangements
in place to deal with those problems, Monitor may, and on many
occasions does, step in. It has the power to direct a trust to do or to
stop doing something and it has the power to add or remove individuals
from the leadership of the trust. It often works in close collaboration
with the Care Quality Commission. Strategic health authorities also
play an important role, for example, by putting in teams to provide
support or drive improvements within a hospital, which they often do to
prevent a hospital from beginning to fail in the first
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000024">&#160;</a>

happen. Under the existing arrangements, or at least the arrangements

                           </div>between Monitor and the CQC did not put in place the sort of
infrastructure that might have helped the trust to stop some of those
terrible failings. Monitor and the CQC have taken a real look at what
happened in that trust, and I am sure they will do more when the
findings of the independent review come
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us be clear about what the Government’s proposals, by which
Monitor will lose its responsibility for foundation trusts, will mean.
I think that by 2016, when all NHS providers have become foundation
trusts, they will be entirely on their own. The safety net currently
provided by Monitor and the SHAs will no longer be there and FT
governors alone will act as the back-stop in dealing with problems if
and when they arise.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
shakes his head at that, but the new chairman of Monitor, David
Bennett, recently told a meeting of the Westminster health forum that
that is a major change to the system. He said that there are concerns
about whether the governors of FTs in every hospital in every part of
the country will be ready to take on that responsibility or capable of
doing so with no external help and support and without any checks or
balances in the system. What assessment have the Government made of the
ability of every remaining trust to achieve foundation trust status?
Can the Minister guarantee that they will all be ready to achieve
foundation trust status within the time frame? Why have the Government
refused to publish the list of some 20 trusts that David
Nicholson told the Public Accounts Committee will not be able to
achieve foundation trust status? Could the Minister give a firm
guarantee that every foundation trust will have governors with the
necessary quality and experience to ensure that there are no serious
problems within their organisation? Who will make sure that they do,
and how?<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000027">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the hon. Lady rightly identifies, clause 51
deals with the establishment of Monitor. It provides for Monitor to
continue to exist as a body corporate and changes its legal title. The
Government believe that for providers to be able to exercise their
freedoms to improve services, the environment within which they operate
must be fair, stable and transparent. The policy aims to liberate
providers from hierarchical management and to create a consistent
framework of regulation across all types of providers. Monitor will
become an economic regulator for health services for the purposes of
the NHS, which is, as the hon. Lady has suggested, a fundamental change
from its current role as the regulator of NHS FTs. Monitor will license
all providers of NHS-funded services in a similar way to other economic
regulators in other sectors. Monitor has been successful as the
independent regulator of foundation trusts and is extremely well placed
to take on the broader responsibilities of an economic regulator. That
avoids the need to establish a new arm’s length body, in line
with the Department’s arm’s length body review, and
results in substantial administrative savings.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
also introduces schedule 7, which sets out the organisational
infrastructure and governance arrangements that Monitor will need to
become the economic regulator for the NHS-funded health sector. We will
be able to discuss that in greater detail when we reach that schedule.
A common approach has been taken across other arm’s length
bodies, including the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 691<a class="bkMark" name="Column691">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the NHS commissioning board and the NHS Information Centre. The schedule
makes provision concerning Monitor’s members, including their
tenure and remuneration. It details how Monitor will carry out its
functions and go about its business; allows Monitor to borrow money,
with the Secretary of State’s permission; obliges Monitor to
prepare annual accounts, consolidating the annual accounts of all
foundation trusts; sets out provisions concerning Monitor’s own
accounts and reports; and details how Monitor will report and account
to Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor will
be a key part of the new system and it will protect and promote the
interests of people who use health care services, by promoting
competition in quality where appropriate, and through regulation where
necessary. The hon. Lady posed several questions about the role of
Monitor, starting with Monitor’s regulatory regime for
foundation trusts and asking whether that would not be rather risky in
the context of giving foundation trusts greater freedoms. I believe
that the removal of Monitor’s foundation trust-specific
compliance framework should be seen in the context of Monitor’s
changing role from an FT-specific regulator to one that is responsible
for all types of provider as the sector-wide economic
regulator.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The purpose
of the current compliance framework is to ensure that each foundation
trust complies with its terms of authorisation, which include ensuring
the effective governance and the continuing financial viability of
individual FTs; however, no equivalent regulation exists for other
types of provider. Under our reforms, all types of provider will be
licensed by Monitor. Regulation will be focused on protecting the
services that are important for the NHS, wherever they are provided,
rather than on any one type of organisation. In turn, the Bill
significantly strengthens the internal governance of foundation trusts
and makes them more directly accountable for the results that they
achieve by strengthening the role of local governors and members and
placing clear duties on foundation trust directors. To my mind, that
will reduce the need for external oversight from Monitor and free
foundation trusts to innovate and respond to the needs of
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government recognise, however, that completing our reforms to providers
will be challenging. In the light of consultation, we decided to create
a longer and more phased transition period, to which the hon. Member
for Leicester West alluded. As a result, Monitor will retain some of
its current controls over some foundation trusts while the new system
of economic regulation is being introduced.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We will be
able to discuss the hon. Lady’s question about the quality and
experience of the trusts’ directors in greater detail as we go
through the amendments to schedule 7, but at this point, before our
detailed discussion of the system’s governance and its
operations, I will say as a generalisation that I am confident that we
will have people of quality and experience, who will be fit to carry
out their duties to ensure that the system runs well.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000033">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
asked whether all the trusts will be ready and in place to receive
foundation trust status within the time scale required. I assure her
that the NHS is working hard to achieve that aim. Between now and,
potentially, 2016 we will ensure that all the necessary actions are
taken to sort that matter out, so that trusts have foundation trust
status.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000034">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister started to set out the fundamental
change in Monitor’s role from being the regulator of foundation
trusts to being an economic regulator. As I said, Labour Members
fundamentally disagree with that change. We will discuss that under
clause 52, which sets out Monitor’s main duties, including
promoting competition. Although I will make our main arguments then, I
want to say now that the Minister has assured the Committee that every
district general hospital, ambulance service, or community service that
becomes an FT will have governors of the quality and experience needed
to make sure that they can handle all the real challenges that such
services will face, the financial consequences of working in a
genuinely competitive market and the consequences of all the changes in
health care. I would like more detail and reassurance, however. Will he
set out the process by which he will ensure that the governors of FTs
have the quality and experience necessary? I am not the only person to
have raised that question. David Bennett, the new chairman of Monitor,
said that there is a “very real challenge”. Members of
this Committee and across the House, who have hospitals and providers
in our constituencies, need some detail on how that will be
achieved.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
did not answer my question about what the chief executive of the NHS
said about there being 20 hospitals that will not
achieve foundation trust status. They will have to merge, be
taken over, or indeed close. I have asked parliamentary questions to
require the chief executive to publish that information. He knows it,
as does the Department; unfortunately, however, the people elected to
represent those who use the services do not know which hospitals are
involved. I hope that the Minister will now agree to publish that
information.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000036">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> To clarify that specific point about some trusts
that face significant challenges and are unlikely to achieve foundation
trust status in their current organisational form: for NHS trusts that
are unable to do that on their own, other innovative options will be
considered—for example, acquisition by an existing foundation
trust, merger with another organisation, or franchise arrangements to
help to deal with those issues. In the event that a few organisations
fail to deliver on their plans to become a foundation trust, and where
the NHS trust is unsustainable, we may use the trust administration
regime introduced by the Health Act 2006—a regime
with which the hon. Lady will be familiar, through her work as a
special adviser to Patricia Hewitt.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000037">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendments are designed to ensure that
Monitor, which as the new economic regulator will be a hugely powerful
organisation, has a degree of accountability to patients and the
public. At the moment that is completely lacking. Let us be clear what
its powers will be. Monitor will be the economic regulator based on the
same model that is used in the privatised utilities, railways and
telecoms sectors. It will have powers to promote competition throughout
the NHS. It will use the powers that the Office of Fair Trading has
under UK and EU competition law. Monitor will be able to make serious
demands of both the commissioners

                           </div>and the providers of services, yet patients and the public are not
required to be involved and it has virtually no accountability to the
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 483
would ensure that Monitor consists of not only a chair, chief
executive, non-executive members and directors, as schedule 7 states,
but a patient representative appointed by HealthWatch England.
Amendment 484 would ensure that Monitor’s management board meets
in public. It would require Monitor to have an annual board meeting
that is open the public; at least one member of the management board
would have to attend the meeting and present Monitor’s annual
accounts and annual report. That arrangement specifically mirrors
clause 142, which places the same requirements on foundation
trusts.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
480, which relates to clause 52, would ensure that when performing its
functions, Monitor must involve and engage patients and the public.
That is crucial. I find it astonishing that a Government who claim that
they want a health service where patients are at the heart and where
there is “no decision about me without me” want Monitor
to have powers to require both the new national NHS commissioning board
and commissioning consortia to put services out to tender. As we will
discuss under the clauses on competition, forcing services to be put
out to tender will have a real effect on which services patients use,
but Monitor is not required to involve or engage patients in any way,
shape or
form.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
do not agree with the Government’s proposals to turn Monitor
into an economic regulator based on the model of the utilities, rail
and telecoms, but in those sectors quite strong bodies that been set up
to represent consumers and ensure that regulators take their
preferences into account. The Government will claim that that is what
HealthWatch England does—that it is the NHS equivalent to those
consumer bodies—but we have said that setting HealthWatch
England up as a sub-committee of the CQC creates nothing like as strong
and independent a consumer body as other regulators are. The
King’s Fund issued a briefing on part 3 of the Bill yesterday
because it is so concerned about the provisions, in which it
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000083">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the spirit of helping the Minister—I shall be far less helpful
later—and to try to ensure that Monitor has a strong voice for
users and the public, I urge him to accept amendment 480. I cannot see
how he could object to Monitor being required to involve and engage
patients and the public. If foundation trusts, which are very important
and provide services in a local area, are required to have
an annual board meeting and to meet in public, why should a huge and
powerful organisation such as Monitor not be required to do the same?
If HealthWatch England is as powerful as he believes, why would he not
agree to have one of its members appointed to the board of Monitor?
That is the purpose that underlies the amendments. I am trying to help
the Government to achieve what they want to with Monitor. We will
oppose the overall approach later on, but I would be grateful if the
Minister answered my questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000085">&#160;</a>

(Admission to Meetings) Act 1960, meaning that it must hold board
meetings in public. I hope that reassures her. I assume she accepts
that there will be times when it is inappropriate for the board
meetings to be held in public—for example, when discussing
issues of confidentiality—but the 1960 Act makes provision for
such cases. I hope that that reassures hon.

480 would place a general duty on Monitor to involve and engage
patients and the public. We have previously discussed the range of
measures in the Bill that increase the involvement of patients and the
public in running the health service; none the less, I feel that
amendment 480 is unnecessary. To deliver its general duties to protect
and promote the interests of people who use health services, Monitor
will be expected to take into account the views of patients and the
public. It will also have duties to engage with HealthWatch on its
functions relating to designated services and licensing.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000088">&#160;</a>

the Bill and listened to the debates led by my hon. Friend the Minister

under its own auspices to represent the interests of patients and the

                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor
also has a duty to engage with HealthWatch England on its functions
related to designated services and licensing. I want to set out four of
those aspects, because they relate both to amendment 480 and
amendment
483.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
clause 69 details a requirement on Monitor to give notice of
designation of services
to<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“every
local Healthwatch organisation in whose area the service is
provided”.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000494">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Giving
notice is appropriate because commissioners will already have consulted
locally. Monitor will need, however, to satisfy itself that
commissioners have carried out the required
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
clause 73(3)(b) establishes a duty on Monitor to consult HealthWatch
England before publishing guidance on designated services. Thirdly,
clause 76 requires Monitor to give notice to HealthWatch England before
making exemption regulations in respect of licensing and to consult
with HealthWatch England before proposing to revoke exemption
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
HealthWatch England has, as one of its functions, the ability to advise
other bodies, including Monitor. As we discussed last week, on
receiving advice Monitor would have to respond and HealthWatch England
could make public the nature of the exchange in its annual report. That
is stated in proposed new section 45A(3)(a) of the Health
and Social Care Act 2008, as set out in clause
166.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
issues relating to service provision, it is the role of commissioning
consortia and the NHS commissioning board, not the regulator, to engage
and consult. Clause 69, for example, states that, before
applying to designate services, commissioners must
consult<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“every
local Healthwatch organisation in whose area the service is provided
for those purposes”.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000495">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 698<a class="bkMark" name="Column698">&#160;</a>
                        </div>Local
commissioners, not Monitor, are best placed to consider and respond to
local patient and public views before making a designation application
to Monitor. Imposing a duty on Monitor to consult patients and the
public on applications would duplicate and, to my mind, unnecessarily
devalue the local consultations. Such consultation is better achieved
at the local level before an application is made to Monitor. I feel,
therefore, that the Bill makes adequate provision for such matters.
There is no need for a further specific duty on Monitor to involve and
engage patients and the public.
<p class="tabbed">Again, I do
not believe that amendment 483 is necessary for the reasons I have
described. HealthWatch England is already involved where necessary. It
will be the role of the non-executive directors appointed to the board
to act as independent experts to ensure that Monitor’s primary
duties to protect and promote the interests of people who use health
care services are fulfilled. The expertise of non-executive directors
will enable meaningful independent scrutiny and challenge at board
level. A patient representative from HealthWatch is unlikely to have
the required level of expertise in economic regulation to provide
scrutiny and challenge in a way that adds value. For those reasons, I
urge the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment. If she presses it to a
vote, I invite my hon. Friends to join me in opposing
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000109">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> Eloquent though the Minister is, the Opposition
and many organisations are simply not convinced that HealthWatch will
be a strong, powerful and independent body. We can have arguments about
committees within the overall architecture, but people want a strong
and independent voice for patients and the public. HealthWatch does not
deliver that. Its structure does not deliver it. Its resources do not
deliver it. That is why we are so concerned to include a requirement to
involve and engage with patients and the public in Monitor’s
general duties, not through consultations, which will be very
complicated, but as a primary duty of that organisation. Just as
commissioning consortia, albeit weak, have a requirement to involve and
engage the public, if this economic regulator will drive the future of
health service provision in this country, which the Opposition believe,
it needs a primary and central duty to involve and engage members of
the
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister’s final point was that someone from HealthWatch England
appointed to the board of Monitor would not have the knowledge needed
to understand economic regulation. That really is the heart of the
problem. Having competition law and economic regulation driving our
system of health care will not deliver the best outcomes for patients
and the public. If it is something that they cannot understand, why is
the Minister putting it in law? If a member of the public cannot
understand what implications competition law will have for their NHS
and care, why is he introducing it into the system? That is why I wish
to press the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000111">&#160;</a>

must remember the context. The NHS faces the tightest ever period of

efficiency savings of more than 4.4% during each of the next four

four. Hospitals are already starting to set out plans for millions of
pounds of savings, jobs are already being cut and waiting times for
treatment are already starting to rise.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000142">&#160;</a>

been given strict limits for the amount of money that they can spend,
not only on patient care but on administration, and the same is true
for commissioning consortia. I remember the Minister telling me last
week—or it may have been even longer ago—that they will
not be allowed to overspend. He did not explain how consortia will be
prevented from overspending; primary care trusts

Despite that, the Government will allow Monitor to live beyond its
means. They will allow it to have an overdraft. Do GP commissioning
consortia get such overdrafts? The Bill allows the Secretary of State
to make any payment to Monitor, at any time, as he or she sees

feeling in the pit of my stomach, because I actually thought that we
were going to hear a constructive contribution. If that is the best
that she can do, I strongly advise her, in the nicest possible way, to
leave things to her hon. Friend the Member for Leicester

                        <p class="tabbed">The
provision is to be used in rare, but important, cases. Monitor might,
for example, need to borrow money when there were delays in its being
able to collect its licence fees. Monitor, as the economic regulator
for NHS-funded care, needs to be able to respond to its sector’s
needs. It needs the option of some financial flexibility to be able to
manage any cash-flow problems that it may encounter.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000160">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The power
does not enable Monitor to take on loans for that purpose. It is only
able to borrow money temporarily, by way of an overdraft, with the
Secretary of State’s consent. I have said this before, but let
us have it on the record, so that there is no misunderstanding. The
provision replicates an existing power that Monitor has under paragraph

progress, I will address both his concerns and those of his hon. Friend
the Member for Leicester West. We believe that the provision continues
so as to enable Monitor to be able to carry out its functions
effectively. We also believe that the power includes sufficient
safeguards and controls—accountable to the Secretary of
State—to ensure that any risk is minimised as far as possible,
which strikes the right
balance.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000163">&#160;</a>

487 would in effect cut any funding the Government would need to
provide to Monitor to enable it to exist and carry out its duties and
functions. Were the amendment to be accepted, Monitor’s only
source of revenue would be what it collected through licence fees. It
is good regulatory practice that revenue raised from regulated bodies
should be proportionate to the service that the regulator is providing
to the regulated body.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000164">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
grant-in-aid funding from the Government funds Monitor’s
activities in regard to, for example, its competition function and
other non-licence activities such as designating services. The
amendment would result in Monitor’s being unable to carry out
the full extent of its functions. For the economic regulator to be
effective in ensuring that the social market for provision of NHS
services operates in the public interest, it is necessary to fund all
its functions—promoting competition on quality where necessary,
setting and regulating prices, and supporting continuity of service.
Other economic regulators are funded in that way. The amendment would
prevent Monitor from delivering all its important functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Members for Leicester West, for Easington and for Middlesbrough South

set out publicly in the impact assessment; we are not trying to hide
it. I am sure that all three Members will have read the impact
assessment from cover to cover and will know what the future running
costs are likely to be.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000169">&#160;</a>

misinterpret what I am about to say; Opposition Members like to
interpret what they hear as they wish it had been said rather than as
it was actually said. Future running costs are likely to be somewhere
between £40 million and £130 million. It is currently
£21 million. Before the hon. Member for Leicester West goes into
synthetic shock-horror—she is not too convincing, but she goes
through the motions—she will know and she should accept, as the
reasonable person I have reason to believe she is, that the role of the
new Monitor is significantly greater than the current one, so one would
expect a difference in the level of

another point. Hon. Members have argued that Monitor has no constraints
on its spending, unlike other ALBs. Monitor has a clear duty to act
efficiently and provisions in the Bill are standard and the same as for
other ALBs. They already exist for Monitor.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000172">&#160;</a>

Minister’s own words, and those of his hard-working civil
servants who conducted an impact assessment on the Bill. The
Government’s figures say that the costs of bringing an economic
regulator into the system will at least double, and possibly rise by
600%. That does not take into consideration the costs to the
commissioners and providers of services of attempting to manage the
Government’s new NHS
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000180">&#160;</a>

Minister says that the Bill is based on “good regulatory
practice”, in terms of how regulators are funded. We do not
believe in changing Monitor into an economic regulator for the reasons
that I set out under clause 52. We want to delete the powers in

patients—and, crucially, to

I know he will always be rightly concerned about the good use of
taxpayers’ money. I do not believe that this new system will
save money; there are additional costs that the Government have not
taken into account, in both the reorganisation and introduction of this
market-based system. As I think David Nicholson said to this Committee
and the Public Accounts Committee, we are yet to see what the final
costs of the reorganisation will

record. The impact assessment shows that the cost of NHS modernisation
is £1.4 billion, but the savings through greater efficiency, the
abolition of SHAs and PCTs, and the driving out of excessive
management, will bring savings of £1.7 billion by 2012-13. By
the end of the lifetime of this Parliament, that figure will be
£5.1 billion, and by the end of the decade—because it is
£1.7 billion a year—that amount will be £13.6
billion. Every single penny of that will be reinvested in front-line
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000192">&#160;</a>

are very hard to deliver. I urge him to take heed of the more cautious
approach taken by David Nicholson in his comments to the Public
Accounts Committee. He was clear that the final costs of the
reorganisation are far from certain, as are the final savings. The
point I am raising in this debate is not about the costs of
reorganisation, but about the costs of introducing the new

love Labour’s new-found conversion to frugality and its concern
about costs to the taxpayer? In 2002-03, the previous Labour Government
allowed the costs of SHAs and PCTs to increase by more than £1
billion—120%. There was no concern about saving money for the
taxpayer, or about saving money to reinvest in vital front-line
services for patients and our

in all public services, every penny of taxpayers’ money possible
goes to the front line. Of course, there should be changes, as we said
earlier in this debate. What the Minister fails to address is whether
it is worth spending up to £130 million a year on Monitor, for
introducing a new market-based system. As I will go on to suggest, it
is not clear whether that will improve either quality or patient care,

range—and that is only for Monitor. I argue that there will be
costs for a whole range of other bodies, which is why we do not believe
that Monitor should have the power to have an overdraft, or that the
Secretary of State should be able to give it any money that he or she
sees fit. I am not convinced by the Minister’s arguments, and I

                        <p class="tabbed">I
will not spend long discussing the amendment, as it is important that

                        <p>Turning
Monitor into an economic regulator, and explicitly adding UK and EU
competition law to the NHS in primary legislation for the first time,
already represents a sweeping set of powers. It is astonishing that the
Government should be proposing to give Monitor an even more unfettered
remit to use its powers for any purposes that appear to be
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000231">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I humbly
suggest that the clue may be in the word “appears.” Have
the Government thought through all the implications of Monitor’s
role? Have they taken any advice on the consequences of applying that
competition law to the NHS for the first time and on what that would
mean for an economic regulator? The Government have probably thought
through those implications, because they want to open up the market to
the NHS as part of their ideological conviction, but we will move on to
that debate later.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000232">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady says, quite validly, that she does
not want to dwell on the amendment at length, and I will reciprocate. I
could start by saying that this is another provision that has been
carried across from the previous Government’s legislation. The
wording of paragraph 15 is identical to paragraph 8(1) of schedule 8 to
the National Health Service Act 2006. It is totally, word for word,
identical.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me return
to setting out what Monitor, as the economic regulator, is there to do.
The economic regulator is being developed to promote efficient,
financially sustainable service provision. We want to create a stable,
rules-based system for economic regulation in areas such as price
setting and avoiding anti-competitive behaviour, without the risk of
political interference.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000236">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor needs
to be independent to be able to deliver that. It needs the flexibility
to act in the way that it considers necessary to exercise its duties
and functions. This general power enables Monitor to do that; it
enables Monitor to do anything that is necessary or expedient in
respect of exercising its functions when there is not express provision
for it to do so. This standard provision for statutory bodies would
enable Monitor to pursue routine business matters such as the
acquisition and disposal of property and entering contracts. Without
that power, Monitor’s exercise of its functions would be
hindered, which would undermine the effectiveness of economic
regulation.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000237">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
paragraph does not give Monitor free rein to do as it pleases. Monitor
would be accountable for ensuring that regulatory intervention was
proportionate and only undertaken when necessary. The Bill places a
duty on 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 707<a class="bkMark" name="Column707">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Monitor to review its regulatory burdens and to conduct and consult on
impact assessments on any significant proposals. That supports the
cross-Government principles on better regulation adopted by the
previous Administration. The general power is necessary, and, for the
reasons I have outlined, I ask my hon. Friends to join me in opposing
the amendment if it is pressed to a
Division.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000238">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I simply repeat my response to the
Minister’s previous comments. This is not the same organisation.
Monitor was responsible for regulating foundation trusts, but now it is
going to be an economic regulator. Simply cutting and pasting one bit
of legislation and applying it to another indicates the
Government’s lack of attention to detail in thinking through the
implications of their
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000239">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will press the amendment to a Division as an indication of my real
concerns about the Minister’s response. Given the degree to
which Monitor will be independent of the Government, it will need to
set its own policies and roles. At the heart of people’s
concerns about Monitor is who is going to take decisions about where
competition does and does not apply in the NHS. That is currently the
responsibility of Ministers, but under the Bill will it be Monitor or
lawyers in the courts, both in this country and in Europe?<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000240">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The concern
is that the NHS will be driven not by Government policy, but by
competition law, lawyers and Monitor’s roles and
responsibilities. That is why Opposition Members are so keen to delete
this paragraph of schedule 7, which allows Monitor to do anything it
sees fit to pursue its functions and roles. Later, we will come back to
a more fundamental debate about Monitor. As I have said, I would like
to press the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000241">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 479
would delete those references to competition and regulation. With the
amendment, we are trying to remove the worst aspects of
Monitor’s new role. Even if we did support the goal, the
Government’s policy seems completely unclear. As the
King’s Fund briefing on part 3 of the Bill rightly argues,
competition and regulation are means, not ends. As the duty currently
stands, it appears that competition and regulation are viewed as
alternatives, with the inference that regulation should somehow be used
where competition is not deemed
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000300">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Experience
in other sectors shows that regulation is a necessary prerequisite if
competition is to be beneficial to service users. It is striking, and
members of the Committee should be aware, that the way in which
Monitor’s duty is framed is similar to the original duty of
Ofgem, as set out in the Utilities Act 2000, in that it has a duty to
promote competition and that is linked to protecting and promoting the
interests of users.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000301">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Hon. Members
may recall that, during the previous Parliament, Ofgem was widely
criticised for interpreting its functions too narrowly and for placing
too much emphasis on promoting competition. Its principal duty was
actually amended by the Energy Act 2010 to make it clear that its main
objective should be to promote the interests of consumers and that
competition should be used only to achieve that
goal.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000302">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope—perhaps it is not a great hope—that the Committee
will agree to vote against clause 52, which is fundamental to
establishing Monitor’s new role. If Monitor becomes an economic
regulator, the definition of its duty, particularly the definition of
“promoting competition where appropriate”, will be
critical.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000303">&#160;</a>

one of his trademark quizzical looks; I think that is what it
was.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000304">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is clear
that once competition law is explicitly added and applied to the NHS,
it will not be GPs—let alone patients—who make decisions
about which services are put out to tender. Whether competition is
appropriate will not be up to health policy and the Secretary of State
or the national commissioning board. The evidence is clear about where
competition is and is not appropriate. It will be up to competition law
and to lawyers.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000305">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Not being a
lawyer myself, I have looked into this and taken advice from lawyers.
Once UK competition law, which is modelled on EU competition
law—the explanatory notes explicitly state that this is built on
articles 101 and 102 of the treaty of the European Union—has
specifically been added, the full force of competition law could apply
across the NHS. It will not be up to GPs or the national commissioning
board, based on the evidence of what improves care for patients, to
decide where that competition happens; that will be based on what
lawyers decide in our courts or in Europe. I will explain that in far
greater detail during our discussions about later clauses. But it is
important at this early stage, when we discuss the fundamental purpose
of Monitor, that the Committee should be aware of what the changes
might
entail.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000306">&#160;</a>

finger on the pulse of developments across the country. As people
increasingly understand what is at the heart of the Bill, they are
concerned about its implications. In a moment, I will ask the Minister
specific questions about the advice that he has sought and received on
the implications of these changes. At this stage, I have given the
reasons why the amendment should delete that primary duty on Monitor to
promote competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000308">&#160;</a>

                           </span> The issue goes to the fundamentals
of the Bill. As I understand it, the clause is designed to give Monitor
a role in ensuring competition. That does not mean ensuring competition
in the health service because there already is competition in the
health service; there is Bupa and so on. We have a market in health
services. Nor is the clause necessarily about allowing private
providers to put in for NHS services, because they do that quite
extensively already.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000309">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">While reading
a written question to which the Minister replied the other day, I
noticed that PCTs have dramatically increased their use of non-NHS
providers. The out-of-hours service in my area is provided not by the
NHS or GPs, as it once was, but by a social enterprise. Hon. Members
from the previous Government will know that Mr Blair suggested that
space should be created for the private sector to flourish, in order to
challenge NHS provision. He presumably took the view, which seems quite
common, that certain cosy cartels occur and need to be
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000310">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The real
objective of the clause and the change to the role of Monitor, as I
understand it, is to ensure competition for taxpayer-funded health
care—either from charities or providers, or between NHS
providers. It is believed that that is the way to get better value for
the public pound. That is what I understand the objective to be. It is
not necessarily the most natural way to achieve that objective, but
that is what I understand to be the thrust of the substantial change to
the role of Monitor. Monitor is being employed to achieve an objective.
We must question whether it is employed in the right way and whether it
is the best vehicle for achieving that objective.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000311">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
arguments against, and I am sure that hon. Members will be fairly
familiar with them. One is that there is also a drive afoot to get
health services to collaborate for a range of purposes, most of them
wholly good, and there are arguments of efficiency against encouraging
too much competition, as it precludes the efficient use of scarce
health resources; I am thinking of manpower resources, buildings and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000312">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
also objections on the grounds that fragmentation might result if
patients are looked after by a variety of institutions as opposed to
relatively few. That is not necessarily a fatal objection to the
objective. I am aware that at the moment, people can duck back and
forth between Specsavers and the ophthalmic department of their local
hospital without obvious detriment to the services that they receive,
which co-operate relatively well. They need not always co-operate well,
but sometimes they can.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000313">&#160;</a>

is where the cherry-picking argument comes to the fore—there is
an argument about service collapse. When an element of a service is
competed for and a local hospital loses it, the net effect may be that
the local hospital can no longer sustain its specialist service, which
the competitor does not provide. That is a genuine issue, and I think
that Ministers are aware of it. They have certainly been reminded of it
by many people during this debate. It is a difficulty in a constituency
such as mine, where many people have chronic ailments—poor
hearing, poor limb movement or something similar—and need
sustained health care over a long period. We do not want to end up in a
situation where providers do what they must, rather than what the
patients want them to do, to survive.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000314">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I do not
think that there is any disagreement in the Committee about what I have
said. I genuinely think that Ministers and the Government are mindful
of the concerns that I have raised and have made some effort to get the
balance right in the Bill to ensure that we get the advantages of both
collaboration and competition. We can clearly see the effort being made
in clauses 52, 54 and 55. However, the key question is whether the
current drafting will produce the wanted outcome, and it is not clear
whether creating an economic regulator is necessary to achieve those
objectives. That is the key point.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000315">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
always concerns about regulators, particularly the leadership of the
regulator at particular times. We have seen different regulators take
different stances. Royal Mail was assisted by a recent change of
regulator, and the impact of the previous regulator was partly a
product of the personality and interpretation of the legislation of
which it was
master.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000316">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Leicester West voiced concerns about the responsibility of
Monitor. Through its decision-making powers, Monitor will have the
capacity fundamentally to reshape local services without giving people
much of a say. Essentially, everybody else will have to deal with
Monitor’s decision. If Monitor opens a service to competition
but people say that they do not want to open it to competition, that
will be the end of the matter. All the organisations can perform as
much scrutiny as they want, or do whatever consultation they like, but
Monitor will have made its decision. As the Minister has said, that
decision will be independent, and I assume that it will also be
irrevocable.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000317">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I cannot help
wondering why Monitor has been chosen for this role. After all, we have
other feasts in existence as a result of the legislation; there are the
health and well-being boards, for example. Surely, those boards are
interested in good access, the efficient use of scarce local
resources—they are, in fact, very interested in that—as
well as collaboration, which the legislation stresses. Therefore, the
health and well-being boards are interested in all the same things that
Monitor is supposed to be interested in, and they are more publicly
accessible, too. There are lots of drivers that lead in precisely the
direction that the Government want to take us, and provide the sort of
challenges to what we might call the cosy cartels of
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000318">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
people do not believe me, and they think that the democratic pressures,
the transparency, and the clinical engagement that the legislation will
provide will not have some effects, they should look at what happened
in social care. At one stage, that was provided in a relatively
efficient way, almost exclusively by councils. My first experience of
Richmond house was coming down as a council leader at the start of the
Labour Government, when I, along with my Labour and Conservative
colleagues, was soundly told off by the Minister—then Mr
Boateng—because we were not using our resources as efficiently
as he thought we could. We did not realise that we were being set up,
but as soon as we left the building, a press release went out which
said that Mr Boateng had just told a lot of us off.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000319">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am well
aware, therefore, that there has been a similar debate in social care,
but look at how it was resolved. After Mr Boateng had given us all a
dressing down, we then had to look at our costs and see what was the
most efficient way to operate. Now, in the same borough, there is not
an absence of a mixed economy in social care; there is a mixed economy
in social care where that is efficient, because there are the drivers
within the local council to make that happen. I suggest that this is a
well-trodden path, which can help to achieve some of the
Government’s objectives without the innovation or novelty of an
economic regulator.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000320">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> To be honest, there are probably differences of
opinion, as in all coalitions. There are some people, and I will not
attach this to any particular party, who may be very comfortable with a
market-driven health service. There may be others, however, who are
more comfortable with the concept of challenge to existing provision,
so that it will sharpen up existing provision. I will not speak,
however, for anybody other than myself.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000322">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
can put my mind at rest on this matter very easily, because there is a
straightforward way of doing so. We are introducing a novel way of
increasing efficiency within a public service and there are
well-trodden paths that we could take. If best-value legislation is
imposed on health authorities in the same way that it is on councils,
we will see some of the effects that the Ministers and Government want.
I would, however, be comforted if they can show me an instance
somewhere—anywhere in the world—where there is a health
market, public provision, and a regulator for that public provision, so
that we can see the effects that the Government anticipate will flow
from the proposals. We would then be working on the basis of evidence,
rather than faith.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000323">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I do not
think that the experience of other regulators is actually very helpful.
Other regulators, by and large, deal with consumers, but patients are
not consumers. If I get knocked over outside this building and end up
in an ambulance, I am not consuming anything. I am not making any
choices. The nature of the service is different. I think that the
Minister would put a lot of people at ease by simply saying that this
is an interesting innovation in public policy that is untried in the
United Kingdom, but that there is evidence somewhere that shows clearly
that it is the sort of thing that works and that will have the effects
for which we hope, which are similar to those that we already have in,
for example, local authority and social care, where we have used
remedies and methods that have proven themselves over
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000324">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for
Southport on that excellent speech highlighting many of the issues that
arise from Monitor. I should like to make two points. The first centres
on my concern about how competition law will be applied within the NHS,
and I should like to address it from the point of view of the
individuals who work in the NHS, particularly those who are responsible
for the treatment of patients. They commonly discuss among themselves
in many different forums—perhaps privately—their concerns
about individual patients. They meet socially and in work contexts. My
concern about the introduction of a more strict, competitive regime is
that those kinds of discussions will be overshadowed by the concerns of
individual health practitioners that they might, in some way, be in
breach of competition laws. For instance, a general practitioner might
talk privately in a social context to a consultant about a particular
patient about whom they are both concerned, but they might feel that,
because they work for two different providers—one for a general
practice, the other for a hospital—and because there is another
provider on the scene who could provide the same service, that might be
seen to be anti-competitive behaviour. I would like reassurance about
that from the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000325">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Co-operation
is an essential part of the health service in this country, as is
competition. As my hon. Friend the Member for Southport has mentioned,
there are 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 713<a class="bkMark" name="Column713">&#160;</a>
                           </div>many examples of competition in the health service as it stands, but
co-operation is also fundamental. I want an assurance from the Minister
that the normal co-operation between clinicians of all kinds within the
health service—that is the oil that lubricates health services
in this country—will not be affected by people being afraid to
talk because they might be accused of being
anti-competitive.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000326">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
other point relates almost to the other side of the argument and
derives from my personal experience of undergoing a reasonably serious
procedure a couple of years ago. I was offered it within the NHS, where
it would have been a very long wait—in fact, there did not
appear to be any hurry to do it at all—but at the same time, the
same consultant indicated to me that it would be extremely swift if I
underwent it privately. For me, that is an example of precisely why we
need a level playing field in the operation of the health service. It
seems fundamentally wrong that the person responsible for a service
within an NHS institution that seems unable to offer it
quickly—as happened in my case—is also able to offer the
same service, at a price, outside the NHS. Will the Minister comment on
how the clause might address that problem? I am sure that I am not the
only one to have faced
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000327">&#160;</a>

gives a painful sigh, but my hon. Friend the Minister of State and I
have become so used to the misrepresentation of what we have said, and
its meaning being turned, that we must be very cautious. Even the tweet
has suffered from that. So I say that the effect of this
amendment—not of what the Government want to do—would be
that the Bill would say nothing about how Monitor would be expected to
pursue its overarching objectives to protect and promote the interests
of people who use health care services. As a result, Monitor would be
free to use regulation wherever it considered it appropriate, even
where this would be at the expense of promoting patient choice and
competition. I do not feel that this is the intention of the
Opposition, but it is a point worth being aware of. To put it into
context so that there can be no misunderstanding, I have just been

embed these principles in the description of Monitor’s general

ensuring that regulatory intervention is only undertaken where
necessary. This is an important principle for avoiding unnecessary

innovation, which would not be in the best interests of patients and

a later date, but if I may, I will answer his question beforehand so
that he need not intervene. Commissioning for several providers to
compete on quality would not always be appropriate, such as in highly
specialised surgery, for example, where concentrating services in
specialist centres may be necessary to ensure patient safety, or where
additional regulation may be needed to secure access to essential
hospital services where there is no alternative provider. Our proposed
approach would ensure that Monitor is under an express obligation to
strike a balance between promoting competition on quality, where
appropriate, and intervening through regulation only where
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000346">&#160;</a>

Members have raised a number of points and I will start with those
raised by the hon. Member for Southport. I hope to provide reassuring
answers to some of the issues he raised in what was an interesting
contribution. He made a point about cherry-picking and asked whether
Ministers would strengthen the rules to prevent non-NHS providers from
targeting profitable procedures while leaving the less lucrative work
to the NHS. The answer is yes. We are establishing the economic
regulator to ensure that NHS-funded health care works in the best
interests of patients and taxpayers. That will include ensuring that
prices are set fairly and do not allow any one type of provider a
particular advantage. The key to avoiding cherry-picking is to set
accurate prices that fairly reflect costs, and clear and transparent
rules that require providers to accept any patient who has chosen to be
referred to them, unless there are clear and justifiable clinical
grounds to do otherwise. We expect Monitor to do both and for the
national commissioning board to enforce the rules through
contracts.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000347">&#160;</a>

Gentleman asked about the benefits of establishing Monitor as the
economic regulator, and why it had been chosen for that role. Monitor
has been successful as the independent regulator of foundation trusts.
It is extremely well placed to take on the broader responsibilities of
an economic regulator, thus avoiding the establishment of a new
organisation. As I have said, we propose to develop Monitor into the
economic regulator for all providers, rather than establish a

Paper states, the private sector’s potential for getting into
the services provided by the national health service. My reading of the
White Paper, and, indeed, my reading of the Bill, is that what is
envisaged is completely different from the way that the previous
Government encouraged the independent sector to come in to
help with some of the workloads and to better the quality of patient
care.

I will put it another way. The Minister is saying that it is all about
competition on quality. So, for the record, could he say that at no
time will Monitor take account of price? I will give an example. Two
organisations are competing for a service. Both offer good quality, but
one might cost a bit more and, therefore, offers additions to that
service. So, just for the record, is he saying that at no time will
Monitor take account of price and that it will be quality first and
first

                           </strong> Monitor is there. On the question of competition,
the issue is quality—enhancing and improving
provision—and ensuring that there is a level playing field so
that we do not see an unfair advantage given to the private sector. Let
me give the hon. Gentleman an example, which we have had cited before
during our debates. With the independent sector treatment centres
established in the previous decade, there was an unfair and, many would
argue, anti-competitive situation in favour of the private sector. Not
only could ISTCs cherry-pick which medical conditions they would treat,
but they were paid more for that than NNS providers. It is as simple as
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000366">&#160;</a>

Southport asked where the evidence base is for the approach taken in
the Bill. There are established models of economic deregulation in
other UK public services and in health systems in the Netherlands,
Germany and parts of the USA. Evidence of the benefits of competition
in the NHS includes increased evening and weekend openings in primary
care and the use of minimally invasive procedures in elective treatment
centres, which I hope goes some way to answering the hon.

and British competition law was also raised in the debate. All the Bill

                           </strong> May I just explain this first? As NHS providers
develop and begin to compete actively with other NHS providers and with
private and voluntary providers, UK and EU competition laws will
increasingly become applicable. The safeguards offered by those laws
will therefore apply equally to all providers. In the health care
sector, 90% of health care provision has been delivered by public
providers fulfilling a largely social function. Organisations
fulfilling a purely social function are not for profit and are not
considered to fall within the definition of undertakings, so they are
not subject to EU competition rules. Markets have been developing only
in certain limited sectors over the past decade, as, for example, in
elective care. However, in a future where the majority of providers are
likely to be classed as undertakings for the purposes of EU competition
law, that law and the protections it offers against anti-competitive
behaviour will apply.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000378">&#160;</a>

to the Committee, that has not been done before. On this point,

                           </strong> I have been seeking an answer to this for some
time, and I do not believe that I have received one. Perhaps I have,
and I have not understood it. If the Minister is promoting a new system
under the legislation where decisions will be made on the basis of
competition on quality, not on price, given that the role of CQC is
simply to maintain a basic standard and Monitor is there to ensure that
there is proper competition on something other than quality, who will
decide what is quality and what is not? Who will make sure that
competition is taking place on the basis of quality and not of
money?<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000393">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There will be a range of ways of determining what
quality is. First, it will be determined by patient choice. That will
be a driver, because patients, having the choice of which provider to
go to, or which consultant to use—or, on another level, which GP
they want to have—will be a driver of quality. That is one way
in which quality will be driven. Secondly, any willing provider, with
which the hon. Lady will be familiar because it was in the Labour
party’s election manifesto last year, will also drive up quality
and improve outcomes. Thirdly, CQC has a clear role to inspect and to
ensure that standards and quality are maintained—whether that be
in the social care area, through residential homes, through dental
practices or through the hospital trusts—and Monitor is there as
the new economic regulator.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000394">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We will come back to many of the points that have
been raised in the clause stand part debate, but I wish briefly to
address some of them now in response to the comments made by the
Minister and other members of the Committee. The Minister began by
saying that we have a mindset that is opposed to everything. We are not
opposed for the sake of pure opposition. We believe that health and
health care is not the same as gas, electricity, a need for a railway,
an internet provider or anything that might enable one to tweet. Health
and health care is fundamentally different. The Government propose to
bring in economic regulation and we do not believe that that is the
right way forward to improve health and health care. That belief is not
based on opposition for opposition’s sake, but from a belief
that those sectors are very different. That is what I will address in
more detail in the clause stand part debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000397">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Southport raised the issue about the aims and objectives of
giving patients more choice, clinicians a greater role and allowing
competition where the evidence shows that it works. I am sure
that there will debates about that. Evidence from the
King’s Fund and the Nuffield Trust shows that that may work in
particular and very selective areas, such as elective operations in
each market, but that that does not work in areas where co-operation
and collaboration needs to improve. My answer to the hon. Gentleman is
that, yes, they could be achieved without introducing an economic
regulator, which would be both hugely costly and, I will argue in the
clause stand part debate, damaging. In fact, it will not improve
patient choice, but decrease it. It will not improve the quality of
care, but actually harm it.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000398">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That leads me
to the second point, which was raised by the hon. Member for Stafford,
about which many doctors are concerned. Doctors will be really nervous
about all sorts of things. Hospital doctors will be nervous about
talking to their primary care colleagues or doctors in other hospitals
about how they might reorganise services, because that might be
considered as providers collaborating with one another, and because
they could 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 721<a class="bkMark" name="Column721">&#160;</a>
                           </div>be subject to competition law. That issue has been raised by the BMA and
the Royal College of General Practitioners, and I know many doctors who
have talked to me about that concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000399">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">They are also
concerned that GP commissioners will be worried about working together.
Opposition Members have raised real concerns about the abolition of
strategic health authorities. Who will do the big service
reconfigurations if they go? The Minister has said that the GPs could
do that—the GP commissioners working together. If, however,
commissioners are considered to be an undertaking under EU
law—many are concerned that they will be, because they are
corporate bodies—would sharing information between those
commissioners be allowed, or would that be challenged? I hope the
Minister will publish the legal advice, because hon. Members need to
see the legal implications and consequences of the Bill. I have been in
discussions with several groups of lawyers who are rubbing their hands
looking at the Bill and thinking about what it will mean for both
commissioners and providers of care. I know that that is moving on to
issues covered by clauses 60 and 61 onwards, but since hon. Members
raised those issues I wanted to talk about them.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000400">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Other
concerns will arise about the consequences for care, particularly the
fragmentation of services and where responsibility lies. That is a big
issue at the heart of the Bill. As always, I listened attentively to
the Minister’s explanation about who is responsible for
promoting the quality of care. Patients are doing it, because they know
that information. GPs are doing it, the CQCs are doing it, and the
national commissioning board is doing it. When we come on to pricing,
we will no doubt hear that the national commissioning board will set
the structure or possibly, in the Minister’s new tone, the
architecture. Monitor will then decide the price, but it must consult
with commissioners, who may object. It is as clear as mud. That is the
real concern. Where does responsibility lie? In this section of the
Bill, where is it appropriate to apply
competition?<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000401">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
evidence for all of this is open to questioning and debate, but, as we
will argue, if competition law is applied to the NHS across the board,
as the Bill proposes, it will not be GPs who take that decision, and it
will certainly not be patients; it will be Monitor. If it is not
Monitor, it could end up in the courts. That is why the amendment would
remove that function from Monitor. The Minister said that he does not
understand that that is what the amendment would do, and he said that
Monitor would have no role. We do not want Monitor to take on the role
that the Minister is suggesting. As I said, we shall return to those
arguments in the clause stand part debate. This is the start of an
extremely important debate for the Committee, and I want to put the
amendment to a

is a minor amendment, which clarifies an aspect of the Bill’s

                           </strong> Again, these are technical amendments that clarify
that Monitor’s remit extends to health care services that could
also be included in packages of adult social care. The Bill already
provides that adult social care services would generally be outwith
Monitor’s remit and that secondary legislation would be required
to extend Monitor’s functions to adult social care. The effect
of the amendment is to clarify that a health care service should not be
outside Monitor’s remit just because its services could also
form part of social care. Such services should not be excluded from
Monitor’s remit through a technicality. For example, specialist
nursing for frail elderly people and health services for people with
learning disabilities, which could form part of social care and may be
commissioned by local authorities, would fall within Monitor’s
remit.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000434">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am certain that we will come to the issue
during debate on clause 53 stand part, but will the Minister confirm
that the Bill will bring the entire adult social care system under
Monitor’s remit? Monitor is not even up and running for health
services; there is no evidence yet whether it will work or what the
implications will be—and now, as we will see in clause 53, all
social care will be brought into the system. Will he confirm that that
is what the Bill does?<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000435">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The way in which the hon. Lady puts it suggests
something sinister and outrageous, which of course it is not. The
amendment will simply tidy up a technicality so that a health care
service that could also form part of social care should not, just for
that reason, be outside Monitor’s remit. In that respect, the
answer to her question is yes. Such services should not be excluded
from Monitor’s remit. I then gave two examples to illustrate.
That is the purpose of the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000436">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As I said, I am sure that we will return to this
matter during debate on clause 53, but as we are debating the
amendment, will the Minister tell us what discussions he has had with
providers of adult social care and local councils? Has he had a
consultation with local councils about what it will mean if Monitor
extends its remit and EU and UK competition law drives competition in
adult social care? Has he talked to users of adult social care services
and their carers? What public discussion has there been? Why, for
example, was none of this mentioned on Second Reading? Has he assessed
any costs involved? I realise that this is a series of interventions,
but I thought that I would take the

                           </strong> I think that I can reassure the hon. Lady on this
technical amendment. The Bill, the White Paper and last summer’s
consultation make it clear that any future extension of
Monitor’s functions to adult social care will be subject to
consultations. The answer to her question within a question about what
consultations we have had is that that is premature, but if we did
decide to move forward, we would hold a full consultation process.
Obviously, the Government would consider the responses to that
consultation. Then, through secondary legislation subject to the
affirmative procedure, we would or would not move forward, depending on
the results of any consultation process. As she will agree, that is a
normal procedure.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000441">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Does the Minister think that something as
radical as how social care is provided should be decided through
secondary legislation with as little discussion as we have heard? It
seems to me, having listened to how he puts it, that the situation is
quite extraordinary. Are local authorities aware that Monitor might in
future regulate how they provide social

is that of course local authorities are aware of it, because it was in

answer is yes. It will be done, if it is ever done, subject to

because I seek clarification. In the debate on amendment 479, the
Minister said that he would consider whether to publish the legal
advice about Monitor and the effects in terms of competition. Can we be
clear? If a Minister offers to go away and consider such an issue, does
he then have to write to the Committee with the legal advice or with
the reasons why he cannot provide the legal advice? I understand that
there are always issues about confidentiality in relation to legal
advice, but given the real concern and the discussion that we have had,
does the Minister have to write to the Committee to say either yes or
no and, if it is no, his reasons for saying
no?<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000474">&#160;</a>

the hon. Gentleman should take it up with the

given no commitment in any way, shape or form to do anything, apart
from considering whether to do

                           </strong> As always, I take your advice, Mr Hood.
Perhaps the Minister misunderstood. I did not say that he had committed
to doing it but that he would consider it. It was debated and therefore
recorded in <em>Hansard</em>. The point I am trying to make, Mr
Hood—I apologise if I did not make myself clear in my first
point of order—is, if the Minister decides that he does not want
to publish the information, could the Committee expect to have a reply
from him about why he would not publish it? This is a crucial part of
the Bill in which there is massive interest. The Committee should be
aware of that when making its
deliberations.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000478">&#160;</a>

                           </span> The clause
outlines the Government’s intention to reorganise Monitor into
the economic regulator of the whole health sector. As I understand it,
it would have three core functions: to promote competition; to set or
regulate price; and to support the continuation of services.
Clause 52 and chapter 1 more widely embody the key change
that is at the heart of our resistance to the Bill—resistance
that Baroness Williams and many more principled Lib Dem colleagues
loudly voiced at their spring conference last weekend.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000481">&#160;</a>

Monitor new powers to enforce competition is what worries the public
and concerns numerous professional bodies and experts. It is fitting
that today the BMA is holding its first emergency meeting for
19 years. The coalition has lost any support from
professional bodies and will soon lose the support of the public as
well. Two general meetings in the last 19 years, both under
Tory Governments: it is the same old Tory story. They cannot be trusted
with the NHS. The removal of the clause would relieve Monitor of the
statutory duty placed on it to enforce competition
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000482">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Absolutely. My hon. Friend is right. The
Government did indeed make great play of the support that they had
received from professional bodies like the BMA and suggest that GPs
were clambering to get involved and show their support. The reality is
that the ship has been sunk and a dinghy has pulled alongside it and
GPs have to clamber on. That is the analogy that I would use to
describe what is happening. I speak to GPs in my constituency and to
professional bodies. The other day a pharmacist told me that these
provisions are wrong for the health service and are being implemented
at the wrong time.<a class="bkMark" name="11031564000484">&#160;</a>
