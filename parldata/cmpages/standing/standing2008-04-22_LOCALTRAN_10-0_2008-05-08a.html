							<b class="B">Mr.
Greg Knight</b> (East Yorkshire) (Con): I rise to place on
record my dissatisfaction with this flawed procedure. It seems to me
that it would be far more appropriate if the Committee were the master
of its own destiny and if, instead of extending the time limit this
afternoon, we could choose to sit for an extra day on Tuesday. I am
sure that that would be far more convenient to many members of the
Committee, who may have evening engagements back in their
constituencies, particularly as the one thing that was certain from the
outset was that we would finish at 4 o&#146;clock today.
Yet as I understand the position, the Committee has no power to decide
to sit next week, because of a resolution of the House. It is
unfortunate that the Government have placed us in this
position.</div>

							<a name="0805098000647"></a>The
Minister of State, Department for Transport (Ms Rosie
Winterton):
						</b> I listened carefully to the arguments made
this morning by the hon. Member for Wimbledon, and it might help if I
address clauses 80 and 81. Clause 80 allows for the delegation of a
local authority&#146;s highway or traffic functions to an integrated
transport authority to help it to fulfil its strategic responsibility
for developing transport policies and planning transport across the ITA
area.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 336</div>
					<a name="0805098000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 81 offers a lighter-touch
approach. It enables an ITA to influence how an area&#146;s local
road network is managed without the need formally to delegate
functions. Any order giving an ITA the power to give directions would
need to specify the roads in the ITA&#146;s area to which the power
would apply. It could apply just to roads that carry major bus routes,
or the order could list a limited network of the most strategically
important local roads in the area. That decision would be made at the
point at which an order was made, and the order would have to designate
the roads in question. I hope that that helps to clarify the position
of what we are trying to
achieve.</div>

							<b class="B">Stephen
Hammond</b> (Wimbledon) (Con): I was aware of the position
beforehand, but I was seeking reassurance from the Minister that
subsections (8) to (11) would give the local authority the ability to
send a proposed scheme back to the ITA if it did not take account of
local circumstances. Is she saying that those subsections allow that
local
discretion?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000649"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> When making the order, the local authority
would be able to say that it was prepared for the ITA to make
directions over particular roads, but it would be at that point and not
at a later stage. The idea is to decide which roads might fall under
the scheme at the beginning of the process. We will be issuing guidance
on the direction-making powers later in the year. That will obviously
be open to consultation, and some of the points that the hon. Gentleman
makes now could be made then.</div>

						</b> Clause 84 allows the Secretary of State to make
an order to dissolve an integrated transport area and abolish the
integrated transport authority. One or more local authorities will then
be designated to take over as the local transport authority for the
area.</div>
					<a name="0805098000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment,
it requires a majority of the constituent councils to consent in order
to dissolve an ITA. As drafted, the Bill does not require the Secretary
of State to nominate the successor body to be a directly elected
authority for each part of the former ITA area. It could happen that an
authority that formed part of the minority&#151;it might not have
consented to the dissolution&#151;found the functions of the ITA
being transferred to an authority that had no accountability to the
dissenting authority or to the electorate of the area.</div>
					<a name="0805098000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I realise that this is a highly
technical point, and that that eventually might already be covered, but

that area? Under the Bill, the position stated by the Minister is
absolutely correct, but that leaves us in the position that local

							<a name="0805098000655"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> This morning, when I moved amendment No. 275,
part of the Minister&#146;s answer to me was that clause 86 was the
part of the Bill that dealt with section 15 of the Local Government and
Housing Act 1989. As I pointed out, the trouble with that is that
clause 86 is one of those very wide catch-all
clauses.</div>
					<a name="0805098000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 86
deals with incidental, consequential, transitional or supplementary
provisions and the ability of the Secretary of State to make those as
he or she deems necessary. The explanatory notes cite two examples.
First, to provide for</div>
					<a name="0805098000587"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
transfer of property and assets to
an&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805098000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">integrated transport
authority</div>
					<a name="0805098000588"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in consequence
of an order...which has delegated certain functions to an
ITA.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805098000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">So that is clear; it
is a consequential provision. The second example cited is,</div>
					<a name="0805098000589"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in consequence of making an order,
for instance to reflect the fact that a new ITA has been
established.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805098000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, that
is clear; there is a need for a transitional provision. However, one
might argue that though the consequential and transitional examples
that have been given in the explanatory notes are fair, the purpose for
which the provisions under the headings &#147;incidental&#148; or
&#147;supplementary&#148; would be used is not clear.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 338</div>
					<a name="0805098000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am perfectly aware of what
consequential and transitional purposes may be, but I am far from clear
as to exactly how the Secretary of State would want to use those
provisions in an incidental or a supplementary manner, given that we
have throughout the Bill given the Secretary of State extremely wide
powers to do as she sees fit, and to include persons and local
authorities and to undertake consultations as she sees appropriate. The
Secretary of State has wide-ranging discretion already and I cannot see
what these powers will be needed for. I am looking for specific
examples of why the incidental or supplementary powers are needed. It
is an extremely wide-ranging catch-all clause. It implies a potentially
huge transfer of power. I am concerned about exactly what the limits to
that power are and why the Minister or Secretary of State should need
that wide-ranging power.</div>
					<a name="0805098000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000656"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> This goes back to the discussion that we had
earlier about political balance. The idea of clause 86(1) and (4) is
that they would enable a governance order made by the Secretary of
State to apply relevant parts of existing legislation to ITAs,
including, for example, a requirement for their membership to reflect
the political balance of councils in their area. As the hon. Gentleman
said earlier, that duty applies to passenger transport authorities
under section 15 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. The
clause is about giving the Secretary of State the power to put in an
order the other parts of existing legislation.</div>
					<a name="0805098000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to return to the point
that the hon. Gentleman made about political balance, because I
listened to what he said and I think that it may be possible for us
make those issues clearer in the Bill. I would like to take that away
and I may come back to that particular issue on
Report.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000657"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
reassurance. I am delighted that for the first time in a very long
Committee she has accepted that there may be some merit in one of my
amendments. As she heard this morning, it was a wide-ranging concern of
the Committee. It will be extremely welcome to hear back from the
Minister. I have listened to her explanation of incidental and
supplemental. I think that that was where she was going this morning. I
am glad that we will get what I was trying to do this morning in the
Bill. I will reflect whether incidental and supplemental are really
necessary. We may discuss that
later.</div>

					<a name="0805098000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is fairly self-explanatory and there has already been lengthy
debate about ITAs. The reasons behind the amendment relate back to our
discussions about the controversial nature of the ITAs. In line with
previous amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes and
me, this one would afford greater parliamentary scrutiny of any orders
made under this chapter relating to those
ITAs.</div>
					<a name="0805098000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0805098000659"></a>
							<b class="B">Graham
Stringer</b> (Manchester, Blackley) (Lab): I tabled a similar
amendment, which would have the effect of replacing an affirmative
order with a regulatory reform order or the super-affirmative process.
That is a more appropriate way of dealing with a medium-sized local
government reorganisation.</div>
					<a name="0805098000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why is that way better? The
Government are proposing&#151;after local consultations which may or
may not be controversial&#151;to make an affirmative order and local
government will be reorganised, so electors will lose their power to
elect people who will directly implement certain highways and transport
functions. That is a major change in local government.
</div>
					<a name="0805098000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is an affirmative
order, even after thorough and good local consultation, the right way
to do that? Even if there is an hour and half&#146;s debate, it will
be whipped. It is just an opportunity, if the ruling party has a
majority, for people who disagree to make their case and lose a whipped
vote. That does not seem a proper way of dealing with local government
reorganisation.</div>
					<a name="0805098000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
alternative, which I do not think would be appropriate either, would be
to have a Bill, go through the full legislative process and change the
primary legislation. There could be two or three such measures a year,
perhaps more in some years, which would take a huge amount of
parliamentary time.</div>
					<a name="0805098000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the regulatory reform
order answers the question by pointing out the Government&#146;s
proposals and the obvious alternative of primary legislation, because
regulatory reform orders are a different parliamentary pathway for
altering primary legislation. I think that is what we are doing. The
Government have taken powers. One way of looking at the Bill is that it
is one whopping Henry VIII clause that gives the Secretary of State a
lot of power to make orders. That does not seem a sensible way to deal
with local government reorganisation.</div>
					<a name="0805098000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many hon. Members will not be
familiar with the super-affirmative process or regulatory reform order.
The process is similar to making an order, but a Committee sits and it
is possible for individuals to petition and make representations to
alter the order. The Committee is able to call the Secretary of State
or the Minister responsible and to ask for changes, so it is a very
thorough process in both Houses. When it has been used&#151;I think
the process was introduced in 1992&#151;it has almost inevitably led
to better legislation. It is a recognised parliamentary process for
changing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div>primary legislation, rather than just giving the power to
the Secretary of State. That seems to me a more
appropriate way of proceeding than just a straightforward affirmative
resolution.</div>
					<a name="0805098000604"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div>
					<a name="0805098000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friends,
and especially the Minister, need a long perspective when they are
taking Henry VIII powers. It is easy when one party is in control to
think &#147;This is good; this will get things done more
easily&#148;, but the Labour party will not be in control for ever.
People may think that I am referring to last week&#146;s elections,
but if Opposition Members look at similar debates in Committees on
regional assemblies and various other debates in which I have been
involved, they will see that I have made that point repeatedly. It is
better to have proper procedures that do not merely pay lip service but
are part of the democratic process and use the full parliamentary
process properly rather than trying to take short cuts. Everybody
benefits, whether one is in opposition or
government.</div>
					<a name="0805098000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
certainly worth the Minister considering the amendment. It proposes a
thorough parliamentary process which addresses, as I have said
previously, the fact that the Bill is unbalanced, not in its desire to
improve transport but in the way that it treats the local democratic
process. The amendment is one way of re-establishing some of the
balance. We talked about other ways, such as referendums, vetoes for
councils and direct elections earlier this morning. The proposed
parliamentary process would re-balance that part of the Bill. I hope
that my right hon. Friend will look seriously at a well-established
parliamentary procedure for dealing with changes in primary
legislation, rather than taking the power to herself or to the
Secretary of
State.</div>

							<a name="0805098000660"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I know how concerned my hon. Friend is about
the issue, as we have had a number of discussions about it. I accept
that the Bill provides for some quite significant reforms to be made
via secondary legislation, but that is why we have provided for the
affirmative procedure to apply in those cases, so that all such orders
would need to be approved by both Houses of Parliament. That is
completely consistent with the House of Lords Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee, which looked carefully at the issue, but
it noted the procedures and safeguards that were included in the Bill
and concluded that</div>
					<a name="0805098000590"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we do
not consider these delegations
inappropriate&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805098000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
powers in the Bill are not unprecedented. To give another example, the
Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 provides a
power to establish unitary authorities in place of existing local
authority structures. That power, too, is exercised by secondary
legislation subject to affirmative resolution.</div>
					<a name="0805098000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think we have been through the
proper procedures in relation to the points made by the hon. Member for
Manchester, Withington, and we feel that the provisions are

							<a name="0805098000662"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I had tabled an amendment to the clause, but
because of the bank holiday and my misunderstanding of the rules, it
went in too late, so I want to test in the stand-part debate the issues
I would have tested with the Minister in that amendment. They are
similar to those raised in our earlier stand-part debate, and to what
the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley has just been saying. I am
looking for some clarification about the provisions of the clause,
because they enable the Secretary of State to issue guidance about
anything that could be done by a local authority under this chapter;
local authorities must then have regard to such guidance.</div>
					<a name="0805098000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
already discussed the issue several times; the power is extremely wide.
The chapter covers the change of names and areas; the power to
establish; the need for review, which the Secretary of State already
has powers to direct; the review of arrangements; which again the
Secretary of State has powers to direct; the delegation of powers,
which the Secretary of State can direct; the conferral of powers, where
the Secretary of State can intercede; and the changing of
boundaries and dissolution of areas, where again the Secretary of State
can intervene. It seems to me that clause 89 allows the Secretary of
State to issue guidance about
anything.</div>
					<a name="0805098000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
chapter already includes huge powers for the Secretary of State and it
is, once again, a wide-ranging catch-all. In extremis, if the Secretary
of State fails to gain the affirmative order that we were talking about
in relation to the amendment to clause 87, she simply needs to issue
guidance that must be taken regard of. The Secretary of State could
issue guidance to an ITA, completely ignoring the local authority and
the residents&#146; feelings, views or wishes, but, more important,
she could completely ignore the affirmative order. As the Secretary of
State already has huge, wide-ranging powers, can the Minister tell me
why, on top of those powers, this provision is needed and can she give
some specific examples of the issues it is intended to
address?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000663"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> I rise to support my hon. Friend, and to say to
him en passant that if the Committee had the power to sit beyond today,
his amendment would no longer be starred and we could have had a debate
on it, so that adds to my earlier concern about the matter. I would
like to hear from the Minister why she feels it necessary to include
the provision, because it just seems to be a means of providing central
interference in what ought to be local matters. The only possible
justification for the clause would be that a Minister wanted a national
plan or policy to be pretty much followed in every part of the country.
However, when one looks at subsection (3), that supposition is blown
out of the water, because it gives the Minister the power to issue
completely different guidance to different parts of the country. It
states:</div>
					<a name="0805098000591"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
such guidance may make different provision for different cases and
different provision for different areas.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 343</div>
					<a name="0805098000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that case why is she giving Ministers
the power to make completely different recommendations to different
areas? Is the clause nothing more than a provision to enable continued
Whitehall meddling in what ought to be local
issues?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000664"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The right hon. Gentlemen and the hon. Member
for Wimbledon need to reflect back on some of their earlier comments
about their desire that local authorities consult with passenger user
bodies. I have made it very clear that we want to be able to issue
guidance to local authorities about the powers that will be exercised
under these clauses. We cannot put everything on the face of the Bill:
it is a well-established principle that guidance can be issued to
assist local
authorities&#151;</div>

					<a name="0805098000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Guidance can
assist local authorities in deciding how they might carry out
governance reviews, in judging whether existing arrangements are
effective or whether there is a need for a greater strategic overview
of transport in their area, and in issues relating to consultation. The
right hon. Member for East Yorkshire said that, in a sense, there needs
to be a greater degree of control over such things. The hon. Member for
Wimbledon wants to put that on the face of the Bill, but what we need
is the flexibility we can gain through the guidance we are drawing up,
which takes into account the views of local authorities, because they
say they find that a helpful way of operating. I will return to the
right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point when I have taken his hon.
Friend&#146;s
intervention.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000667"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The Minister must concede that we have been
consistent, in the passage of the Bill through Committee, in wanting to
ensure that there is local consultation and that it is dealt with in
the Bill so that all the necessary parties are statutory consultees. It
is only the Minister who says she needs guidance. That is not what we
have been
saying.</div>

for East Yorkshire said that if there was consultation, it would be
appropriate to ensure that people who did not necessarily have access
to the internet could look at proposals to set up an ITA or to make a
quality contracts scheme. That is not the sort of thing that can be put
in the Bill, but it can be put in guidance. The right hon. Gentleman
welcomed my assurance that we would take that sort of thing into
account.</div>
					<a name="0805098000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We issued
draft guidance in December 2007. Local authorities have said they find
it very helpful in deciding how they might prepare for the enactment of
the Bill, and we will be redrafting, revising and expanding that
guidance in light of comments received from local authorities and to
take account of changes to the Bill as it passes through
Parliament.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 344</div>
					<a name="0805098000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon. Gentleman asked
why there might be different guidance for different parts of the
country. Different parts of the country may face different issues. The
guidance might be different if we were talking about establishing a new
ITA in a rural area as opposed to an urban area. It might be different
if we were talking about expanding a different ITA. We have to be able
to reflect the fact that local circumstances might dictate a different
approach in different areas.</div>

&#147;Three cheers for the Local Government Act 2000,&#148; but I
know that at this very moment all the people who know that fabulous Act
will be doing so, because it will shorten dramatically my remarks on
this clause. The Minister and I have many times discussed definitional
issues, and I am sure that, had we not had the benefit of that
wonderful Act, we would be spending hours over the meaning of
&#147;well-being&#148;. As there is now established legal practice
as to what &#147;well-being&#148; might be, I do not intend to
probe that&#151;although we could, of course, have another half

Winterton:
						</b> As the hon. Member for Wimbledon says, this
clause extends the well-being powers that local authorities already
have under the Local Government Act 2000 so that they also apply to
integrated transport authorities. Integrated transport authorities have
to operate within a framework laid down by statute. That means that
they have no powers to take action except where legislation authorises
them to do so.</div>
					<a name="0805098000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a range of statutory duties that they will have to fulfil and a
wider range of permissive powers enabling them to undertake particular
activities if they choose to do so. This clause takes this a stage
further and provides ITAs with the power to take any steps that they
consider likely to promote or improve the economic, social or
environmental well-being of their local community without the need for
there being a specific provision in other legislation.</div>
					<a name="0805098000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Gentleman said,
these powers have already been granted to local authority by means of
the Local Government Act 2000. For example, North Tyneside and
Newcastle City councils have already used them to enter a joint private
finance initiative to replace and repair street lighting in their
areas.</div>
					<a name="0805098000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
financial assistance, this would enable an ITA to give grants to any
person. It would be the ITA&#146;s decision, subject to their
financial abilities, to give the money. This extends to the point that
the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire raised about accommodation. It
is not linked in the Bill to any particular type of
accommodation&#151;it could be staffing accommodation, for example.
It is important to remember that the judgment about whether the power
is properly exercised&#151;I think that that is the point that both
the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman raised&#151;would be
subject to the usual rules for local authorities on proper accounting
for expenditure and acting according to best value criteria. I hope
that that explanation is
helpful.</div>

power?</div>

the Bill so that ITAs in the circumstances that we are discussing can,
if they wish, make proper provision in respect of, for example, staff
accommodation. The right hon. Gentleman gives the specific example of a
grace and favour flat. The question would be whether that was a proper
use of public money. Was it properly accounted for? Was it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 346</div>signed off by the financial director? Was it within the best value
criteria? The right hon. Gentleman knows very well that the Committee
has a choice: do we not give any powers that would cover quite
reasonable expenses and expenditure by a local authority and try to
dictate exactly what every single penny should be spent on? Frankly, I
do not think that we can do that. This is about striking the right

Hammond:
						</b> We have considered the wide-ranging powers to
promote well-being, and that is fair and understood. Clause 93 provides
that these wide-ranging powers cannot override the constraints already
put in place by the legislation. The powers do not include the power to
raise moneys, and the Secretary of State can make orders to prevent the
powers to promote well-being from being used by an ITA. Two issues
arise from that. First, it has been established in Committee that we
all believe the consultation principle to be a good one, but it seems
slightly odd that when the Secretary of State wishes to make an order
that prevents an ITA from using the power to promote well-being, she
has to consult that ITA. Presumably, she already knows what it is going
to do; it has already stated that. It therefore seems slightly odd that
that is what
happens.</div>
					<a name="0805098000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
subsections (7) and (8) say that before exercising a power to promote
well-being, the ITA must consult some people specified, but not
everybody, and not everybody specified in previous provisions of the
Bill. I again bring to the Minister&#146;s attention the
inconsistency throughout the Bill in respect of people who are
consulted. There seems to be no consistency at all&#151;a point that
this clause highlights yet
again.</div>

							<a name="0805098000675"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Clause 93 gives more detail on how the new
well-being powers for ITAs will work. As the hon. Gentleman says, it
allows the Secretary of State to make an order listing certain actions
that one or more ITAs would not be able to do under the well-being
powers, subject to representatives of ITAs, local authorities and other
relevant people being consulted. I emphasise that we certainly do not
expect that such an order will have to be made often, if at all.
However, in the case of the Transport Act 2000, Parliament decided that
it would be sensible to take such a reserve power in case such
circumstances arose, and we think that it is wise to make similar
provision in this Bill. Any order would be subject to the affirmative
procedure in both
Houses.</div>

							<a name="0805098000676"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> On a point of order, Lady Winterton. The Prime
Minister recently announced a new Government initiative of listening
and learning where there is public concern. The Bill was published
before that policy announcement was made and before a recent poll,
carried out by the Automobile Association, which showed that 90 per
cent. of all motorists did not trust the Government in respect of road
charging. In view of that, I wondered whether as part of the listening
and learning process the Minister had decided not to move any of the
clauses relating to road charging.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000678"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The reason I wanted to speak on clause 96 is that
it brings us into a new part of the Bill that concerns local and London
charging schemes, which we need to examine in some detail. The
Government were once wedded to a national road pricing scheme. The then
Secretary of State for Transport made positive noises and the then
Prime Minister appeared to support it; the new Secretary of State
appointed by the new Prime Minister then started to withdraw from that
view and it seems to have disappeared, so the Government have dithered.
We then had 1 million people voting on the Downing street website
against national road pricing in the poll to which my right hon. Friend
refers.</div>

it is

							<a name="0805098000682"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I apologise profusely, Lady Winterton. I have
managed to get through nine sittings without making that error. The
point that the hon. Gentleman was making was that the
Government&#146;s position is confused, which was the point that I
was starting to outlay. It is only fair that at the start of this major
new part we explore the Government&#146;s position and ask the
Minister for clarification. I do not know what the Government&#146;s
policy is, and the hon. Gentleman has just said that he does not know
either.</div>
					<a name="0805098000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
Machiavellian figures than I might wonder whether part 6 is nothing
more than an attempt by the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div>Government to reintroduce national road pricing by the back door, by
allowing integrated transport authorities to make charging schemes
singly. Evidence for that view is that the recent round of applications
to the transport innovation fund was available only to local
authorities that had plans to implement a road charging scheme
contained within their bid. Whether or not a local authority wanted a
road charging scheme or thought that it was appropriate, it had to
include one in its bid if it were to receive any funds. I fail to see
that investment in a local transport infrastructure should necessarily
be linked or dependent on a road pricing scheme.</div>
					<a name="0805098000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second piece of evidence of
an attempt at national road pricing by the back door is that there are
several clauses in the Bill where the provisions could be used to
impose road user charging on local authorities, even if they decided
that they did not want it. Here at the outset, it would be helpful for
the Government to lay out their position in some detail. I often find
when discussing the whole aspect of road user charging that there is a
confusion between road user charging and congestion charging or low
emission zones. The former, road user charging, is a continuous toll on
a road, the latter allows for variable rates at variable times of
travel. We want to be clear that, if the Government are going to
introduce blank road user charging, they must ensure that it is
cost-effective.</div>
				
					<a name="0805098000606"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div>
					<a name="0805098000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">In London, where
the initial scheme was set up, 47 per cent. of the revenues go to the
cost of running the scheme. The <i class="I">Evening Standard</i> produced
evidence last year that adding together the operating expenditure and
the capital expenditure repayments, together with the depreciation,
accounted for 97 per cent. of the revenues. One needs to be pretty
cautious. The hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley will want to talk
later about the scheme in Greater Manchester, but that scheme was
clearly dependent upon the first point that I made&#151;it came about
as a result of the need for TIF. That position seems to be put forward
regularly by various local authorities in that
area.</div>
					<a name="0805098000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also clear
that we need to be absolutely certain about the definitional aspects of
road user pricing, congestion charging and low emission zones. I am
absolutely clear&#151;for the benefit of the hon. Member for
Manchester, Withington&#151;that there should not be a national road
pricing scheme. I am absolutely clear that local schemes, be they road
user pricing, congestion charging or low emission zones, need local
validation&#151;consent&#151;before they are introduced. I am also
clear that if there is the possibility at local level of using road
user pricing to supplement or increase funding, or in conjunction with
the building of local transport infrastructure, then that road user
pricing should also have local
validation.</div>
					<a name="0805098000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
is a clear exposition of my party&#146;s position. As I started out
by saying, the Government&#146;s position seems entirely muddled. It
is only fair to the Committee, at the start of this important part of
the Bill, that the Minister give us some
indications.</div>

							<a name="0805098000684"></a>Stephen

						</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. When we
discuss amendment No. 14, with which I have a lot of sympathy, he will
see that I have followed his line of argument&#151;there is a problem
with referendums as local validation. However, in other countries, they
allow validation to be at the time of, or at some stage within a
certain period after, the introduction of a charging scheme. In some
cases, after the introduction of a scheme, when the validation process
has been sought by referendums, the scheme has remained in place, while
in other places it has been taken away. I want to explore that point
more when we discuss amendment No. 14. However, it is probably only
fair that I now give the Minister a chance to reply and to explain in
detail and with clarity the Government&#146;s position on national
road user
pricing.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000685"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> I support my hon. Friend in what he has to say
about those charging schemes. One can perhaps acknowledge that the
Government are at least being honest&#151;they have dropped all
reference to &#147;congestion&#148;, and have simply included a
number of clauses giving councils power to introduce charging schemes.
I, too, am interested to know where the Government now stand in respect
of that policy.</div>
					<a name="0805098000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">On 6
May <i class="I">The Times</i> carried a report with the headline
&#147;Manchester polls deal blow to congestion charge
expansion&#148;. The report
stated:</div>
					<a name="0805098000593"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Plans
to extend congestion charging to cities across Britain are in disarray
after the policy&#146;s strongest supporter lost his council seat to
an anti-charging candidate. Roger Jones, the Labour chairman of the
Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority, was pushed into third
place in Salford. His seat was won by the Community Action Party (CAP),
which ran a campaign based on opposition to the &#163;5 daily peak
period congestion charge that was proposed by Mr.
Jones. With the Conservatives coming second in what was a safe Labour
seat, the result will make other councillors cautious about supporting
congestion charging.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805098000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
report quotes Mr. Jones, who
said:</div>
					<a name="0805098000594"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I have
got to get myself a job because I&#146;m unemployed for the first
time since I left
school.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805098000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear that
there is overwhelming public opposition to further charging
schemes.</div>
					<a name="0805098000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I heard what
the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe had to say&#151;that such
opposition should never be the sole test when assessing new policy
initiatives. To be fair, he has a point; there are other issues that
one should take into account, but at the end of the day, we have to
remember that we are democratically elected politicians, and if we go
so far in one direction against the wishes of those who elect us, we
cannot complain if we are turfed out on our ear for so doing.</div>
					<a name="0805098000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the hon. Gentleman
should spend some time in the centre of Sheffield speaking to people
there, some of whom may not be his constituents but visitors to
Sheffield wanting to spend their money and create wealth and jobs in
the city. He could then find out what they think of the proposal to
introduce widespread road user charging. It is a betrayal of the pledge
that the House gave when it introduced vehicle excise duty.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 350</div>
					<a name="0805098000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument used when vehicle
excise duty was introduced&#151;I think it was in 1908&#151;was
that motorists were fed up with having to pay tolls and charges as they
moved around the country. The duty allows motorists to pay up front a
flat fee in tax to the Government for the privilege of using their
vehicles on our roads. The new policy runs counter to that
pledge.</div>
					<a name="0805098000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000686"></a>Mr.
Leech:
						</b> Would the right hon. Gentleman not accept that a
charging scheme could be introduced if people around the country
thought that there would be some significant benefits? For instance, a
cost-neutral charging scheme could be introduced under which there
would be a significant number of winners as well as some losers. If we
introduced the polluter pays concept, people who used their car on an
irregular basis on uncongested roads in towns, villages and rural areas
could benefit financially from the introduction of a national road user
pricing
scheme.</div>
					<a name="0805098000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000687"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> I do not want to stray too far from the provisions
in the Bill, but the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention was very
sensible.</div>
					<a name="0805098000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a
national user charging scheme were to replace other taxes&#151;for
instance, if fuel duty was cut and vehicle excise duty was
abolished&#151;there are arguments in its favour. It would encourage
people to use the roads at different times of day and thereby reduce
congestion; for example, by making it cheaper to drive in the evening
than in the early morning. A national road pricing scheme would have
some attractions if it replaced other motoring taxes.</div>
					<a name="0805098000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that such a policy
would be supported by the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington.
However, we are dealing with the power to introduce charging schemes
with no rebate on other motoring taxes. In other words&#151;I will
use the phrase&#151;it is a stealth tax. That is what the Committee
is being asked to support. If the charging schemes were coupled with
local fuel duty reductions, one could make a good fist of a case for
introducing them, but the Government propose no such thing. Some people
may say, &#147;Ah, but we must think of the environment. If we exempt
electric cars, it will further help in our campaign against
emissions.&#148; To those who might put forward that argument I say,
read the recent report published by Professor David Newbery of
Cambridge university. He looked at the question of the environmental
cost of motoring and concluded that if motorists were asked to pay for
their share of the emissions they caused they should be paying tax at
the rate of 20p a litre of fuel. Tax is currently 60p a
litre.</div>

Betts:
						</b> To move on to the matter in hand, I accept some of
the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s points. It is a difficult issue to
convince the public about. I am in no doubt about it. I have been vocal
in Sheffield about my support for examining the possibility of
introducing a congestion charging scheme. I have gone public with it
and written articles in the local paper. Generally, the letters in
response are not terribly supportive and sometimes not very
complimentary. That is because the public are not convinced and think
that, somehow, they are being done down and will simply be charged. It
is hardly a stealth tax as it is such a public issue.</div>
					<a name="0805098000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this instance, we are talking
about a power for ITAs to be able to introduce a scheme if they think
it appropriate for their areas. It is right that that power should
exist, because if the right hon. Member feels that there are other
measures for dealing with congestion, this clearly is one potential
method that will have to be considered properly.</div>
					<a name="0805098000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am in no doubt that it will
not come about quickly in cities such as Sheffield because the reality
is that not merely my Labour colleagues but the party that now has a
majority in Sheffield, the Lib Dems, are committed to opposing any
congestion charge scheme, probably because they both believe that it
will be politically unpopular. They are probably right, but sometimes
there is a responsibility on politicians, as democratically elected
representatives, to try to give a lead.</div>
					<a name="0805098000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough raised the point about the local
economy. The fact in Sheffield is that congestion does real damage. We
want people to come to Sheffield to work, to shop and to enjoy the
leisure facilities and the magnificent new city centre, but they cannot
get in and out easily at peak periods. I take the point that a scheme
for charging people for the use of roads can be a way of switching the
tax on motorists from licence or fuel duty to charging for roads, but
it can also be a means of raising money that should be hypothecated for
improving public transport&#151;there is a package there. However, we
will probably have to improve public transport before we bring the
scheme in.</div>
					<a name="0805098000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
done some road building recently to try to improve the inner ring road
but if one talks to the highway engineers, there is spare capacity at
peak periods&#151;it varies slightly&#151;of around 10 to 15 per
cent. We know that traffic is growing at about 2 per cent. per year. It
does not take a genius to work out 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div>that at some point the roads are going to be full. That has happened
over the past two years&#151;there were one or two vehicle breakdowns
in the city centre at key points, the whole city was gridlocked and it
took people an hour to move a couple of hundred
yards.</div>
					<a name="0805098000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
solution in building more and more roads to get us out of that. The
only solution is to try to ensure that people switch to public
transport or travel at different times when they can. The power to
bring in congestion charge schemes, which I accept ought to be
variable&#151;people will not be charged the same amount for
travelling at off-peak periods as at peak periods&#151;linked to some
improvement in public transport is the right way
forward.</div>

							<a name="0805098000699"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> The weakness in the Government&#146;s case is
that there is to be no remission in other taxes paid by motorists. We
would accept a good deal of what the hon. Gentleman said if this was
not an additional tax.
</div>
					<a name="0805098000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000700"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> That is a reasonable point, but my first priority
would be to make a scheme work that reduces congestion and gets the
traffic moving. That means trying to get people on to public transport.
Where the public transport is inadequate, as it is in many of our
cities, which is why we were talking about quality contracts
earlier&#151;&#151;the two go together&#151;then we need to
invest more in public transport, in schemes such as guided buses and
trams, of which I am very supportive. One can anticipate the proceeds
of a congestion charge by tax income and funding, which the new local
government network has been arguing for, and put a package together,
but it must be a total package. Improving public transport alone might
have attracted people out of their cars 20 or 30 years ago, but I do
not think that it would anymore. There have to be two sides to it:
improve public transport to attract people, but at the same time impose
a penalty for travelling at peak periods in congested areas. I just do
not see any other
solution.</div>
					<a name="0805098000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">We at least
have to have the debate, and it is our responsibility as elected
Members, even if things are not immediately popular or obvious with the
public, to raise the issues and bring the arguments forward. On this
occasion, we should vote to give powers to ITAs to use where they think
they are appropriate to address the needs of their
areas.</div>
					<a name="0805098000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000701"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Opposition Members are getting over-excited,
because these are not major changes. Local authorities already have the
power to make local road-pricing schemes under the Transport Act 2000.
The difference here is that, at present, they have to get permission
from the Secretary of State to make one. We are changing that so that
if local authorities believe it is best for their area, they will be
able to do it. The change also allows ITAs to make schemes jointly
with, for example, metropolitan councils, if it is felt to be necessary
for establishing an integrated transport system.</div>
					<a name="0805098000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the provisions allow
revenue from any scheme not just to be put back into public transport
for the first 10 years of a scheme, but during the whole life of a
scheme. This is not about forcing local authorities to introduce road
pricing but about enabling them if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div>they feel it is best. Opposition Front Benchers do not want local
authorities to be able introduce statutory partnership schemes, they do
not want them to be able to introduce quality contracts schemes, and
now they do not want them to be able to introduce road pricing schemes.
Basically, the policy of the Conservatives is the status quo: there is
no problem, let us just bury our heads in the sand and pretend that
congestion is not any part of the problems in our urban areas. Frankly,
I think the public will see straight through that. The Conservatives
are bereft of ideas and out of touch.</div>
					<a name="0805098000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000702"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> After last Thursday, the Minister is in a very
dangerous position accusing anybody of being out of touch. She should
not continually do what she has done several times, which is to
completely misrepresent our position, which is clear. We have said that
we support statutory partnerships, completely contrary to what she
said. Our position on quality contracts is clear, because I prefer
partnerships, and we have gone down that road. I suspect Lady Winterton
is just about to tell me not to go down that road again. Finally, as I
set out at the beginning, we support the ability of local authorities
to make congestion charging schemes, or road-user schemes&#151;they
are different&#151;providing that they have local validation. What
the Minister is saying is nonsense and a complete misrepresentation of
the official Opposition&#146;s position. I hope she will acknowledge
that
point.</div>
					<a name="0805098000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the Minister just said, as if it were a good thing, that the Secretary
of State will no longer have to confirm such schemes. It be a good
thing if that scheme were one subject to extensive local consultation,
local validation or tested and validated by an independent inspector.
She may have opened up the problem that we are going to discuss in a
few minutes&#146; time in clause 104, that without the Secretary of
State confirming it, local authorities may impose these schemes on
local electorates without any consultation whatsoever. That is the
possible consequence of her Bill as it
stands.</div>
					<a name="0805098000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000703"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> That simply is not true. The hon. Gentleman
knows that local authorities will be expected to consult on schemes;
that is absolutely without doubt. I do not think there is much point
pursuing further the alternatives that the Opposition parties are
proposing, because I do not think they are offering any alternatives.
As I have said, this is not an enormous change to the current position.
There is no question of forcing local authorities to take forward
pricing in their areas. Through the transport innovation fund, we have
made additional funding available to local authorities to explore
whether road pricing, complemented by improvements to local transport,
would be the right approach to tackle congestion in their areas. I do
not think there is any problem with doing that. It is about innovation.
It is about looking at new ideas, but the transport innovation fund is
not the only source of funding for local transport. This Government
have invested very heavily in local transport. That is something we can
be very proud of and I hope the Committee will support clause
96.</div>
					<a name="0805098000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000704"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> What the Minister signally failed to do, of
course, is explain the Government&#146;s position on road pricing.
She signally failed to say whether she accepts the Opposition&#146;s
view&#151;a view shared, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div>suspect, by some Labour Members&#151;that these local schemes require
local validation. She signally failed to make any response to my right
hon. Friend, who said that there is the potential for this to be just
an additional tax on motorists. And, despite saying that consultation
is &#147;expected&#148;, she has signally failed to answer the
point that, as the Bill is currently structured, local authorities may
only be &#147;expected&#148; to
consult.</div>
					<a name="0805098000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
are expected or hoped to do all sorts of things. The fact of the matter
is that, as the Bill currently stands, by removing the power of the
Secretary of State to confirm a scheme, local authorities are not
obligated to consult. Therein lies a flaw. Local authorities are not
obligated to validate. I accept the Minister&#146;s point that the
power is already there. We support that power, and we would support
this power if there were local validation. I had intended not to make a
great issue of this. I had certainly not intended to press the point,
but the Minister&#146;s arguments have been so inadequate that I
think it is time to make this point. We fully accept that local
authorities should have the right to make congestion schemes, rather
than the road user schemes that the hon. Member for Sheffield,
Attercliffe was talking about. Congestion schemes are undoubtedly one
weapon that can be used to reduce congestion. We fully
support that, and we fully support that local authorities should have
the chance to do that, provided that there is local validation. We are
going to come on to that in a moment. But the Minister also failed to
give any assurance that the funds that might be raised by such a scheme
as the hon. Gentleman talked about could be reinvested in local
matters.</div>

Stringer:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 14, in
clause 97, page 79, line 16, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3A) A local
charging scheme shall not be made unless a referendum of all electors
within the boundary of the relevant integrated transport area has been
held and a majority of electors are in favour of the establishment of a
local charging
scheme.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0805098000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of this amendment is to ensure that congestion charging schemes
will not go ahead without a referendum of all the people in the area of
the integrated transport authority. However, the real purpose is to
have a debate related to the last debate on what the local validation
process and method of consent should be. I accept that there are all
sorts of flaws with referendums and that people vote on other issues.
They vote on the popularity or unpopularity of local authorities and
the Government. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe
pointed out, voters may not be able to easily envisage the benefits of
a scheme.</div>
					<a name="0805098000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, with something as toxic as imposing a new tax without any relief
in taxation elsewhere, we have to be clear what the method of consent
is, and I have not been very satisfied with the process of the
transport innovation fund bid as it applies to congestion charging in
Manchester. We have heard the Opposition state that the Government have
said that TIF bids will go ahead only where there are congestion
charges. I believe that to be the case, but of course, the last but one
Secretary of State for Transport said on a number of occasions on the
Floor of the House that this absolutely was not to be a condition that
would be looked at. When his successor visited Manchester, he told the
passenger transport executive group<b class="B"> </b>not to bother applying for
extra funds to extend the tram system if it did not have a road charge.
His exact words were that congestion charging was the &#147;only show
in
town&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805098000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the background. The Government say that this is enabling legislation
and how could any reasonable person who supports and believes in local
democracy, be against enabling legislation? I am certainly not, but
that is not the reality that we have experienced in Manchester. The
reality is that this is enabling legislation with the Government behind
it, twisting arms. The Government want to look at Manchester as an
experiment in road pricing congestion charging, having withdrawn
support for a national road pricing scheme. The arguments for doing
that have been various and many. Some have been odd.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 357</div>
					<a name="0805098000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most of the economic damage done
in this country by congestion&#151;distinguishing it from other
countries in Europe, with the possible exception of the
Netherlands&#151;is inter-urban congestion. That is what really puts
the price on. That relies on reports such as the Eddington report,
which in my opinion was heavily influenced by Treasury thinking and not
so much by Eddington himself, having known his views beforehand, read
the report afterwards and been unable to match them. He pointed out
something that is regularly quoted by the Government: there is more
congestion in cities than on the inter-urban network. Well, there is a
surprise. Cities are concentrated, focused places. There is always
going to be congestion in cities, particularly successful cities. That
is not necessarily a complete argument for putting on a congestion
charge and taxing people
extra.</div>
					<a name="0805098000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I disagree, on
an evidential basis, with what my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield,
Attercliffe said about the evidence of people moving to public
transport where public transport is provided. Certainly, over the past
seven years on trains and trams in Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds and
London, as the services have become more frequent, the growth in
passengers has far exceeded the growth in car
traffic.</div>
					<a name="0805098000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case that
has been made for introducing a particular, special tax in Manchester
and nowhere else, as an experiment, has been very dodgy, particularly
considering what the Government are using for their congestion
projections; one thing that we can say is that projections are always
wrong. It was projected the price of petrol would rise to and remain
steady at $50 a barrel. I do not blame the Government for that, because
few economists expected oil to be at $120-plus now. However, that is
where the price is, and that is likely to affect congestion and growth
in traffic; certainly, in the early &#146;90s it affected the growth
in traffic. It would also help if the 2 million vehicles that drive
around our cities and roads unlicensed and uninsured were taken off the
roads&#151;that would be a major contribution to getting rid of
congestion.</div>
					<a name="0805098000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">How are we
going to validate the introduction of a congestion charge? Of course
there will be consultation, said the Minister. However, will it conform
to Cabinet Office standards? There were guidelines for the Manchester
TIF consultation, but when the Manchester TIF bid was put in the
consultation was a sham. It did not conform to Cabinet Office
guidelines, although we were told that it
would.</div>
					<a name="0805098000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the whole process of consultation be transparent? The TIF bids so far
have not been transparent. When I put freedom of information requests
to the Department for Transport&#151;to find out what the
correspondence between the Greater Manchester authorities and the
Department for Transport had been&#151;I am told that it is
commercially sensitive. How is it commercially sensitive? People have a
right to
know.</div>

							<a name="0805098000725"></a>Mr.
Leech:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the vast
majority of people in Greater Manchester do not know the details of the

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000726"></a>Graham
Stringer:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a blindingly obvious
point. The documents are confidential. The TIF bid that has gone in is
not available. I was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>given a copy of the bid, on my honour not to spread it about. I accepted
it on that basis, because I wanted to see what was in it. Perhaps I
should not have accepted it. However, most of the campaigners against a
congestion charge have been unable to get that information, and I have
not given it to them. I can see no reason why that information should
have been kept secret. I do not know why the Department for Transport
does not believe it. It is a bad omen and a bad precedent if we are to
believe that there will be consent of local people before the project
in Manchester goes ahead. I will listen with interest to what the
Minister says, and I want to be assured that if there is not a
referendum&#151;and I do not expect the amendment to be agreed to,
now or on Report&#151;there will be a completely transparent and
independently assessed consultation.</div>
					<a name="0805098000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secretaries of State have said
that we must bring in a congestion charge. Can the Minister tell me
that she expects that, if opinion polls are carried out, they will not
be carried out by the promoters of the scheme, but independently, so
that they can be checked? The client of the polling organisation should
be independent and all the conversations between and documentation from
those bodies should be available to the public.</div>
					<a name="0805098000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say this out of a
party-political vested interest, apart from anything else: the right
hon. Member for East Yorkshire was right. Dr. Roger Jones, the former
Irlam councillor, is a friend of mine even though we disagreed on the
congestion charge, which was the only real issue in the election in
Irlam. It was the worst result in Irlam, a traditional Labour seat, for
the last 35 or 36 years. I do not want my hon. Friends who are Members
of this House, or my friends who are Labour councillors, to lose their
seats.</div>
					<a name="0805098000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most of the
opinion polls show that 80 per cent. of the public in Greater
Manchester are against this scheme, though I accept that no one really
knows the details of it. If the public do not have a referendum or the
chance to be satisfied that there is a thorough consultation that
represents their views, they will take out their anger or disagreement
with the scheme on Labour councillors and MPs. I want to avoid that by
ensuring that integrated transport authorities are not set up or
highway powers transferred without the consent of people and with the
active opposition of some councils.</div>
					<a name="0805098000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">We heard this morning that these
powers could be transferred against the wishes of some councils and
against the wishes of the population, and then a congestion charge
scheme could be imposed, again without complete consent. Politically,
for my Government and for my party in control of four local authorities
in Greater Manchester, to introduce a tax on top of other taxes at the
present time is, quite frankly, bonkers.</div>
					<a name="0805098000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the prices of food, fuel
and other necessities of life are going up, it is not sensible to look
at a new tax on top. That does not invalidate the case for congestion
charges as a principle. That may well exist. However, to have a charge
in one place without any compensation elsewhere would be a huge
mistake. I look forward to my right hon. Friend&#146;s answers about
the transparency of the process and the validation of any process,
whether it be a referendum or a deep
consultation.</div>

Lee Scott</b> (Ilford, North) (Con): I support the hon. Member

extension to the congestion charge in London. The Minister said earlier
that she expected councils to consult, but the then&#151;fortunately
no longer&#151;Mayor of London did consult but ignored the
consultation when it was clearly against the extension. I fully agree
that it is unlikely that a referendum will be put in the Bill, but
there needs to be a mechanism that residents can trust that is not run

political persuasion the people in control of an area may be.</div>

other important factor is the difference between road charging and
congestion charging. People must be able to see that the congestion
charge will ease congestion. Out of interest, yesterday I met a
delegation from the Dutch Parliament, where they are looking at a
national congestion charge or road charging scheme, but intend to scrap
their equivalent of road tax and taxation so that people will not
necessarily pay more unless they are driving substantially longer
distances, so they will not be penalised. That truly is congestion
charging, rather than road charging or extra taxation.</div>
					<a name="0805098000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the points raised by the
hon. Gentleman were perfectly correct. Let us take an area just outside
or on the fringes of London, like my constituency, so we are outside
the congestion charge zone. We were told that the congestion charge
would ease congestion. In fact, congestion has not gone down over the
period of time. It is exactly the same as when the congestion charge
was first brought in. That is with more buses, even after the debacle
of Metronet and the money that was wasted on that. However,
improvements to public transport have not eased congestion whatsoever,
and that is according to official Government statistics, or should I
say Greater London authority statistics?</div>
					<a name="0805098000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully support what the hon.
Member is trying to introduce. There has to be a mechanism that people
will trust. Then they will not feel that the people who they have
elected to represent them, from whatever political party, are letting
them down. When the Minister says that she expects that councils will
do this, it is great to expect it, but it does not necessarily mean
that they are going to do it or that they will listen to the results.
That needs to be enshrined in the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="0805098000728"></a>Mr.
Leech:
						</b> I, too, lend my support to the amendment. I hope
that the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley will choose to push it to
a vote.</div>
					<a name="0805098000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot
resist the temptation to point out that the amendment is in line with
Manchester Liberal Democrat policy and contrary to Manchester Labour
party policy as far as local congestion charging schemes are concerned.
During the elections only last week, members of the Labour party in
Manchester were suggesting that the Liberal Democrats in Manchester
were all over the place on congestion charging. It is completely the
opposite way around. The Manchester Liberal Democrats fully support a
referendum before any local congestion charging scheme is introduced.
It is the Labour party that seems to be completely divided on the
issue.</div>
					<a name="0805098000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
suggesting for one second that the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley
is all over the place on the issue. He has been completely consistent
in his 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div>opposition to the congestion charge in Manchester. However, his
colleagues are not in line with his views on the congestion charge or
with his obvious support for a referendum prior to any charge being
introduced. </div>
					<a name="0805098000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is only
fair to say that Roger Jones fell foul of the congestion charge
proposals in Greater Manchester. It is a great shame that the campaign
was waged against him purely on one issue. It was disappointing to see
the resources put in by the anti-congestion charge lobby to try to
defeat him over the issue. Local government is not just about single
issues, but a whole range of issues. Regardless of one&#146;s
political views or political opinions, Roger Jones served the people of
Salford in Irlam and the PTA very well. I do not always necessarily
agree with the views they espouse but it was very disappointing that
the anti-congestion charge lobby attacked him in the way that it
did.</div>
					<a name="0805098000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">That said,
councillors in Manchester, other parts of Greater Manchester and
anywhere else where a local scheme might be proposed should beware of
what happened to former Councillor Jones in Irlam. In future there
should be full support given locally before a scheme is
introduced.</div>
					<a name="0805098000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the amendment is pressed to a vote and that, hopefully with some
support from Labour Members, we can defeat the Government on this
issue.</div>
					<a name="0805098000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000729"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman may not like it when a single
issue carries a lot of votes but the message is that politicians should
beware if they are seeking to advance policies that the general public
detest. My party has been there. We pushed ahead with the poll tax and
look what happened to my party at the subsequent election. There is a
warning here for Labour Members.</div>
					<a name="0805098000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to the very brave
speech of the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley. He was responsible
for a devastating attack on the Minister. He left the Minister&#146;s
assertions in tatters and left her naked in terms of her
argument.</div>
					<a name="0805098000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea that
this is an enabling provision and that local councillors are free to
apply their judgment with the knowledge of local circumstances to this
issue is just not happening, as he rightly said. On Second Reading, I
referred to a similar case in my constituency where the local council
wished to carry out road improvements in Bridlington and was told
bluntly by the Department for Transport that unless it incorporated a
park-and-ride scheme, it could not have the money.</div>
					<a name="0805098000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know from the report in
<i class="I">The Times </i>and other comments that have been made, including from
the hon. Gentleman, that the Government are doing the same thing on
road charging. They cannot say it is a matter for local councillors
because they are&#151;I was going to say &#147;blackmailing&#148;
but perhaps that is a little unparliamentary&#151;arm-twisting local
councillors into making decisions that they would not otherwise make.
That is why I am pleased to support the amendment.</div>
					<a name="0805098000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to look at what
is happening to the cost of motoring. As the hon. Gentleman said, if
this was an attempt to shift the tax that motorists face from one or
two other sources into road charging, we would be having a totally
different debate. It is not. It is to be an additional imposition on
the motorist against a background where tax on drivers is up
&#163;600 a year. According to yesterday&#146;s <i class="I">Daily
Telegraph</i>:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 361</div>
					<a name="0805098000596"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Figures compiled by the
AA show that the average motorist pays more than &#163;1,800 annually
in fuel duty, car tax, VAT on petrol and other levies&#151;an
increase of more than 50 per cent in little more than a
decade.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805098000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to
say:</div>
					<a name="0805098000597"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
Labour came to power in 1997, the Government raised a total of
&#163;31.3 billion from motoring taxes... By 2006, that had
increased to &#163;45 billion and increases in fuel duty and excise
duty are expected to lead to a tax take of at least &#163;48 billion
this year&#151;a 53 per cent
rise.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805098000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">No wonder
electors are saying, &#147;Enough is enough. We do not want to have
to pay road-user charging as well.&#148; That is why poor
Mr. Jones lost his
seat.</div>
					<a name="0805098000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000730"></a>Mr.
Leech:
						</b> Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that, in real
terms, the cost of motoring has fallen, whereas the cost of travelling
by train or bus has
risen?</div>
				
					<a name="0805098000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000731"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> I do not think the information provided by<i class="I">
T</i>
						<i class="I">he</i>
						<i class="I">Daily Telegraph</i> would bear out that assertion. I
suggest that the hon. Gentleman read yesterday&#146;s paper, which I
am sure is available in the
Library.</div>
					<a name="0805098000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">My only
criticism of the amendment relates to drafting. It might be impossible
ever to get a yes vote, because the amendment
says:</div>
					<a name="0805098000598"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A local
charging scheme shall not be made unless a referendum of all electors
within the boundary of the relevant integrated transport area has been
held and a majority of electors are in
favour&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805098000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Member for Manchester, Blackley had referred to &#147;a majority of
electors voting are in favour&#148; there would not have been a
problem. However, the amendment could be taken to mean that a majority
of electors on the electoral role had to be in favour, and I do not
think that threshold would ever be reached if that test were
applied.</div>
					<a name="0805098000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
minor criticism, however, and I think that the principle of having a
referendum is a good one, particularly in the light of the arm twisting
of local decision-makers that is going on. Someone has to be able to
express a free and unfettered voice on the issue before such a proposal
is introduced. Although many Conservatives feel that referendums are
alien to our system of democracy, for the reasons that I and the three
previous speakers mentioned I think that this is one way to proceed,
which is why I support the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0805098000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000732"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I, too, rise to support the amendment. It is
extremely important and goes some way toward the position that I
outlined earlier&#151;that there is a need for local validation of
these schemes. I accept the argument already made by several Members
that local electors exercise the function of local referendums at local
elections, and Mr. Jones, a week later, is
probably feeling that that is what happened to him. None the less,
there are imperfections to that argument, because in a number of areas
elections are held only once every four years, so the referendum
element of a local election cannot really happen.</div>
					<a name="0805098000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem with the amendment
was outlined by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe when he
challenged me earlier, which is that it is highly likely that there
would be no chance of a scheme being 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 362</div>accepted as people are initially reluctant to vote for a congestion
charging scheme if they are going to have to pay more
money.</div>
					<a name="0805098000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I fully
support and see the need for referendums, no matter how alien the
concept may be, the amendment would have benefited from wording such
that it allowed a referendum to occur either at the time of the
congestion charge being introduced or&#151;as I mentioned happens in
several international cases, where a time limit is set after the
introduction of a congestion charge for the scheme to be
validated&#151;six or 12 months afterwards. There have been cases of
schemes then being
accepted.</div>
					<a name="0805098000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would
have had the benefit of answering the criticism that I am sure the
Minister is about to make, which is that, to all intents and purposes,
the amendment would wreck the ability of local authorities ever to
introduce congestion charges. However, the principle of local
validation is correct, and despite its imperfections the amendment
would take us a huge step forward toward ensuring that local consent
was given to local schemes. I shall certainly support
it.</div>
					<a name="0805098000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000733"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I want to re-emphasise that what is happening
is not a massive change from the situation at the moment. However, we
have had that argument and I will simply address the idea of having a
compulsory
referendum.</div>
					<a name="0805098000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, which
amended the Local Government Act 1999, imposes a duty on local
authorities to involve local persons in the exercise of any of their
functions, where appropriate. The functions to which that duty applies
include establishing a local road charging
scheme.</div>
					<a name="0805098000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local schemes
are tailor made to tackle local problems, and, as such, we believe that
consultation should be appropriate to the scheme proposed and to the
local situation. We have tried to take a flexible approach to the
forward consultation, which local authorities should follow, and do not
feel it appropriate for central Government to impose a specific form,
such as a compulsory referendum. The aim of the Bill is to devolve
responsibility for decision-making to the local level, and it would run
contrary to that to start imposing restraints and inflexible duties
from the centre. For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment and I
hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley will
withdraw
it.</div>

							<a name="0805098000734"></a>Graham
Stringer:
						</b> I am disappointed with that response because,
while I am not totally wedded to the idea of referendums, I think that
reasonable people can see advantages and disadvantages in them. On
something as controversial as this, I would expect a rather better
response as to how validation&#151;the involvement of local
people&#151;should take place, to quote my right hon. Friend the
Minister. There was no answer on the secrecy involved in communications
between the Greater Manchester authorities and the Department for
Transport. There was no answer on why a TIF bid&#151;which has been
with the Government for so long and involves about &#163;3 billion of
public 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 363</div>expenditure&#151;should have remained secret. There was no attempt to
justify whether there was some commercial basis to
this.</div>
					<a name="0805098000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the debate has continued, having raised those issues about referendums,
I became slightly more wedded to the idea of referendums to decide the
principle of a road charging scheme. It would be difficult for two
reasons to do what the hon. Member for Wimbledon wants, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe implied&#151;that is,
have a referendum once the scheme is up and running. First, a lot of
money has to be invested in kit, and that goes away, but secondly, the
nature of the TIF bid on this occasion is that more than &#163;1
billion of taxpayers&#146; money is being tied into funding trams and
train improvements. So, it would not be realistic to vote no at that
stage&#151;once the scheme is in, it is there for 30
years.</div>
					<a name="0805098000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000735"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes absolutely correct
points, but the Bill could deal with circumstances whereby the money
raised from local user charging would not necessarily be connected to a
TIF bid. My circumstances take place without the consequence of a TIF
bid because TIF, although it has been extended, is due to run out in
about 2013, or 2018, after the extension? But there is potentially no
reason why these schemes should necessarily be connected to TIF. My
understanding&#151;I am sure that, thanks to his knowledge of the
Select Committee, the hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am
wrong&#151;is that the proposal I have outlined is exactly what
Stockholm has
done.</div>
					<a name="0805098000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000736"></a>Graham
Stringer:
						</b> I accept that the particular circumstances
applying in Manchester will not necessarily apply everywhere else, but
I do not think that we should take the Stockholm model. The referendum
held by the boroughs just outside Stockholm produced a vote against
having a congestion charge. The conservative parties won an election
opposing a congestion charge, but when they got elected they imposed a
congestion charge because they needed a deal with the Greens. Stockholm
is a particularly bad model for how to respond to the views of local
people. However, I accept that there can be
exceptions.</div>
					<a name="0805098000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Minister did not really make the case for why
referendums are suitable for deciding whether there should be a mayor
in Hartlepool or elsewhere. That, in some ways, represents a less
fundamental change in local democracy than the changes being discussed
here. Why was a referendum appropriate in Scotland to set up the
Scottish Parliament, which has relatively trivial tax-making powers
compared to this proposal? That was a huge change, but if we look at
the taxation side we see that the Scottish Parliament may raise a
relatively small amount&#151;it has never used that
power.</div>
					<a name="0805098000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The recent
history of referendums is much more in line with achieving such
constitutional change than the Minister gave credit for&#151;more
than for tax-raising
changes.</div>

					<a name="0805098000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to discuss two other
points that were brought up in debate. I am not really party political
point scoring, but the Liberal Democrats in Greater Manchester are all
over the place&#151;Liberal Democrats in Rochdale have a totally
different view from Liberal Democrats in Manchester. That it is not
party political point scoring because the same has happened with the
Labour party. The Labour party in Bury has a different view from the
Labour party in
Manchester.</div>
					<a name="0805098000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact is
that a new tax is being forced on people in Manchester to carry out
investment in the tram system that was promised in the Labour party
manifesto&#151;people want the public transport&#151;but this has
been a difficult decision for all political parties in Greater
Manchester. However, I will not have it that the Liberal Democrats have
come through united and integrated. That is simply not
true.</div>

							<a name="0805098000739"></a>Mr.

points.</div>
					<a name="0805098000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">I realise that,
in recognising Roger Jones as a friend of mine, I did not also pay
tribute to his work as chair of the PTA, where he worked closely with
all political parties to the benefit of public transport in Greater
Manchester. He did a good job as a local councillor in Irlam and it is
a pity that he became the focus for anger about the possibility of a
new tax in Manchester. The loss is to the Labour party and to the
people of Irlam.</div>

						</b> The issues surrounding these amendments are
similar to those surrounding amendment No. 14, so I will not repeat the
arguments. The amendments talk about not going ahead with the scheme if
a majority of councils are against it, or not going ahead if all the
councils are against it, which would be possible although
unlikely.</div>
					<a name="0805098000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish now
that I had tabled one or two more amendments along these lines to test
the Government&#146;s view: one to see what would happen if one
council were against, and one taking up the idea put forward in a
different debate by the hon. Member for Lewes, speaking for the Liberal
Democrats, that perhaps the threshold should be a quarter of
councils.</div>
					<a name="0805098000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point of principle is, how far should these schemes be allowed to go if
one, two, three or four councils&#151;or 10, 20, or 30 per cent. of
councils&#151;oppose to them? Should it be up to the integrated
transport authority, or should the integrated transport authority have
the power to take action as an unelected body to repress the views of
elected councillors? There should be a number, although that is open to
debate. Perhaps a majority, or all of them, is too high. If those
councils objected, given the deficiencies we discussed when we came to
secondary representation and possible co-option on to these bodies,
there should be some ability for one council or a number of councils to
have a veto over a proposed scheme. After all, councils are directly
elected.</div>

							<a name="0805098000760"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> May I say first that I think it unlikely that
an ITA will propose a scheme that is opposed by all its constituent
councils, given that at least a majority of the ITA membership is made
up of members from the constituent councils? Where a scheme was to be
made jointly between the ITA and a local authority or authorities, as
allowed for in clauses 96 and 99, those local authorities would need to
consent to the scheme being
made.</div>
					<a name="0805098000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 16
would stop a charging scheme being made in an ITA region if the
majority of the constituent councils agreed that the charging scheme
was wrong for the area. That could damage local accountability and it
could mean that a local authority was prevented from making a charging
scheme just within its own area because the majority of local
authorities within the ITA area
disagreed.</div>
					<a name="0805098000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
know that concerns have been raised about the delegation of road
charging powers to ITAs. I am quite prepared to look at whether, at the
point of delegation, road charging should have to be agreed by a
majority of constituent councils, which answers some of the points made
by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley. I would be
prepared to look further at how the road charging powers could fit with
the governance arrangement and, if necessary, return to it on
Report.</div>

Stringer:
						</b> I thank my right hon. Friend for that helpful
reply. All the authorities are highways authorities, so effectively
each authority has a veto. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 366</div>There is no body&#151;neither the PTA nor the PTE can do
it&#151;that can impose a scheme that charges or changes the traffic
management scheme or the road usage in those areas. Therefore, in
searching for the right figure, we are moving from every authority
having a veto to none having one. There is probably a line somewhere in
between&#151;perhaps a majority is
one.</div>
					<a name="0805098000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may, I will
give my right hon. Friend the arguments back. Although they are not
arithmetically exact, there is a certain political soundness to them
and there would be some relationship between the political make-up of
the integrated transport authority and that of the constituent local
authorities&#151;they would be similar, if not exactly the same. It
might be that a lower figure than 50 per cent. is needed to stop the
Labour party or the Conservative party or whoever it might be
repressing those authorities against their wishes, given that there is
a democratic deficit in the
process.</div>
					<a name="0805098000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Greater
Manchester, the 10 authorities have a rule when they talk to each
other. It is not a statutory rule, but they need a two-thirds majority
of authorities to carry the scheme ahead, so if four&#151;or perhaps
three&#151;authorities are against it will not go ahead. It seems to
me that in an area with 10 authorities, having three opposed should be
sufficient to stop a scheme. That represents an enormous number of
people, and those representing them are directly elected. The figure
might be two in the west midlands. The difficulty with these
percentages is that the nice, round figures never quite correspond to
the situations in the six metropolitan authorities. Some areas, off the
top of my head, have five, seven, four and 10 authorities
involved.</div>
					<a name="0805098000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am thankful
for my right hon. Friend&#146;s reply. I hope that we can discuss

							<a name="0805098000764"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> Earlier, I said quite clearly that a national
scheme is both unpopular and unrealistic. However, I suspected that
some degree of road user charging, or increased use of tolls on our
roads, could be part of the package that tackles congestion and raises
money for infrastructure projects. Such schemes may well be taken up by
local communities on the basis of need and demand, but they require
local validation, as we have just discussed.</div>
					<a name="0805098000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some provisions in the Bill on
local road pricing are broadly to be welcomed. However, it is one thing
to make it easier for local authorities to plan and implement local
road pricing schemes, but quite another to take their arm behind their
back and twist it hard to get the promise of implementing them. That is
what the Government are
doing.</div>
					<a name="0805098000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
should not be using public funds to pressurise local authorities into
introducing these schemes&#151;it should be up to local authorities
to decide how best to structure their bid for Government support to
tackle congestion, according to what they think is going to work best
in their area. If those schemes are local congestion schemes, they
should be locally validated and the funds raised should be reinvested
in local transport infrastructure. They are user charging funds and
technically not taxes. Money raised as a result of road charging
schemes where they are neutral, which is our policy, are user charges.
Therefore, they can be reinvested.</div>
					<a name="0805098000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon. Friend the Leader
of the Opposition recently announced that the Conservative party
proposes to free local authorities from the constraints that the
Government have put on them through funds ring-fenced for local schemes
within the transport innovation fund. Instead of forcing local
authorities to treat this money as a national congestion charging
budget, we will allow local people to use the money for new green
travel initiatives that really suit their communities without imposing
the prior specification on the
schemes.</div>
					<a name="0805098000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend made the point that we will honour the transport innovation fund
commitments to local authorities that we inherit when we take over as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div>Government, but as we reach the end of the process more of those
available funds should be freed up for local communities to use on
initiatives that suit them best. I make that point because my
amendments are designed to ensure that the proceeds of local user
charging schemes are reinvested in local provision. The idea behind
that is very simple.</div>
					<a name="0805098000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept the
argument that one way to get people out of their cars to reduce
congestion is for them to see improvements in public transport
provision. It seems right that the charges that are raised from the
local congestion charging scheme should be reinvested in those local
improvements. I am concerned that these clauses will not necessarily
ensure that that happens. I accept that they go some way towards it,
but the Bill would be greatly improved if my amendments were inserted
in those clauses, stating that the local authority could proceed
towards implementing the scheme only if the proceeds were to be
reinvested in the achievement of the local authority&#146;s transport
plans or in local transport
infrastructure.</div>
					<a name="0805098000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Congestion
charging without the provision of attractive alternatives to the car
will at best merely raise the cost of living and at worst harm the
local economy. I fully support the point made by my right hon. Friend
the Member for East Yorkshire that the scheme should be neutral. It
should be neutral at a local level as well. I support the idea that the
moneys raised by congestion charging must be put towards securing local
improved
alternatives.</div>

					<a name="0805098000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am convinced

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000767"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is quite right&#151;this
is an important issue. Work carried out on the public acceptability of
road pricing has shown that the use of revenues from any local charging
scheme for reinvestment in improvements in local transport is an
important factor. That is why the Transport Act 2000 already requires
that all net revenue from all charging schemes be spent on facilitating
the achievement of local transport policies. It will be amended by the
Bill, because under existing legislation the requirement in schedule 12
to the 2000 Act says that the net revenue to be spent to facilitate the
achievement of local transport policies extends only to schemes made
within 10 years of the 2000 Act, and only for the first 10 years of the
scheme.</div>
					<a name="0805098000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through clause
114, the Bill will remove that restriction so that revenues from all
local schemes are invested in achieving local transport policies, and
not just for the first 10 years of the scheme. That certainly reflects
the importance, which we probably jointly agree on, that the public
attach to the revenue from local charging schemes being certain to be
spent on improving local transport.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> I shall probe the Minister on a matter that we
discussed earlier. The clause removes the ability of the Secretary of
State to engage in consultation on the subject of an English road
pricing scheme, or to hold an inquiry in respect of it. The Government
will claim that this is a localist measure and on one level that is
true, but as have explained before, the problem with removing the
Secretary of State&#146;s power to consult on or approve such a
scheme is that nothing has been put in its place.</div>
					<a name="0805098000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have taken the
first step and put the power to make road pricing schemes in the hands
of local authorities. They must now take the second logical step, to
transfer the whole consultation and inquiry process and power from the
Secretary of State to the local authorities and put those obligations
on the local authorities. A moment ago, the Minister said,
&#147;There is the expectation&#148;, and I am sure that she will
say that it is inconceivable that a local authority would implement
road pricing without consultation, but that is not good enough. I can
see no good reason why local authorities currently have the discretion
not to consult or hold an inquiry, but there is a safeguard in that the
Secretary of State has to confirm the road pricing scheme. It is
crucial that local authorities are obliged to consult and I would
prefer the Bill to go further than that and require local validation,
but there is a robust case to say that the imposition of a local road
pricing scheme can be done only if the local authority is obliged to
consult.</div>
					<a name="0805098000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I accept
the proposition that the Secretary of State no longer has to approve
the scheme, what concerns me about clause 104 is that unless something
else is put 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div>in its place and despite what the Minister said earlier&#151;unless
she will now reassure me that that commitment appears elsewhere in the

						</b> I reassure the hon. Gentleman in the same way
that I have before: changing the power of the Secretary of State does
not have any effect on the ability of local authorities to consult. We
will still expect them to consult in the ways that I outlined
previously&#151;that is, through the Local Government and Public
Involvement in Health Act 2007 and the other ways that I mentioned. The
removal of the power makes no difference to that
whatever.</div>

now.</div>
					<a name="0805098000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister spoke
earlier about leaving local decision making unfettered in some
respects, but, if we have to have charging, there are certain aspects
for which it would make sense to have uniformity. What 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 371</div>are her plans to make it easier for motorists who are likely to enter
two separate charging areas to make one payment in
advance?</div>
					<a name="0805098000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am thinking
of a business man who lives in Derby. If the hon. Member for Derby,
North gets his way, there will be charging in Derby. The business
man&#146;s place of work may be in Birmingham, which, let us say, has
its own scheme. In both cases, the motorist has to travel on roads
subject to charging schemes at times when they are in force. Will there
be provision for that motorist to be able to apply to a single point to
prepay, let us say a year ahead, rather than have to make daily
payments? That would be time-consuming and unnecessary in this age of
technology.</div>

							<a name="0805098000786"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The clause has an innocent title, but behind it
lie a number of issues that need to be explored. It enables the
Secretary of State or other appropriate national authority to make
regulations about fairly specific elements of road charging schemes:
who pays, how they pay, where they pay, how the money is collected and
so on. Given that the intention is to put road pricing decisions in the
hands of local politicians, I do not understand why that power is
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="0805098000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
appears that the Secretary of State, despite giving local authorities
the chance to put a scheme in place, is ensuring that she has the power
to micro-manage road schemes. That prompts the question whether this
whole part of the Bill is just a chance to introduce a national road
pricing scheme by the back door. It seems to me that schemes should be
introduced, defined and implemented by local politicians, after
validation by the local electorate, with the needs of local people in
mind and tailored to local circumstances. If that is the
Government&#146;s intention, as they seem to have stated, I am not
sure why the Secretary of State will make regulations about the
specifics of how, by whom and from whom money is to be collected. Such
things should be defined by the local road pricing
scheme.</div>
					<a name="0805098000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why does the
Minister want that regulation-making power in the Bill, and why does
she want those matters to be set out in regulations rather than in
guidance? Will it be a one-way process of the Secretary of State making
regulations for local authorities, or will local authorities be able to
make representations to the Secretary of State about the regulations
that she intends to
make?</div>

					<a name="0805098000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would like
to see co-operation on achieving that. As the hon. Gentleman said,
there is currently guidance, but we are taking the powers in question
in case they are needed in future for the benefit of the road user. If
we were unable to achieve co-operation, we could make regulations to
ensure the interoperability that the right hon. Gentleman and the hon.

explanation.</div>

that a motorist in the circumstances that I mentioned earlier could pay
up front? To give an example, when I was last in America, I was being
driven by someone who had to go on four different toll roads, not all
operated by the same authority. He had affixed to his windscreen a
disc, which I think had a metallic strip in it. When he went up to a
barrier, it recognised the strip and opened, and he had to take no
further action. There was no time-consuming telephoning or giving of
card details. He had prepaid for the whole year. If we are to have
these schemes, we should have that sort of payment
scheme.</div>

							<a name="0805098000790"></a>Mr.

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 265, in
clause 107, page 84, line 4, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(d) any
specified motor
vehicle.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0805098000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
thinking behind the amendment is as follows. I told the Committee of my
interest as chairman of the all-party historic vehicles group. Across
Britain, many historic rally events take place on a regular basis. In
some towns and cities, they have a heritage festival to celebrate their
long association with transport. Coventry does that and it would not
surprise me if Birmingham did it as well. Fundraising charitable
organisations often have charity parades involving historic or classic
vehicles for fundraising purposes.</div>
					<a name="0805098000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill gives power to
authorities to suspend charging schemes for special occasions. It
allows for part of a charging scheme to be suspended&#151;the
authority could choose to suspend two or three streets down which a
rally was taking place. It also gives permission to exempt any class of
motor vehicle. What it does not do is to give power to suspend the
scheme for any specified motor vehicle. It may well be that there are
vehicles of different classes in a classic parade or rally.</div>
					<a name="0805098000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">In every such case that I have
been made aware of there is a requirement by the organisers that the
vehicles must be pre-booked into the rally. The organisers will have a
list of registration numbers of those cars genuinely taking part in the
charitable event. It would therefore make sense to give the operators
of the scheme a power to exempt only those cars that are taking part in
the rally or parade.</div>
					<a name="0805098000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that the permission to hold the rally could be achieved by
suspending the scheme, but it may well be that those running the scheme
would argue that that would lead to substantial loss of revenue and
they do not particularly want to make the area free to all for a
particular day. They could equally argue that if the scheme was
suspended for a historic rally&#151;an occasion 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 373</div>when older vehicles are going to be on the road&#151;there may be
massive congestion because everyone else who wanted to go shopping
would know that the scheme was being suspended and may decide to go
into the town or city on the day of the suspension. It would be common
sense to allow the operators of a scheme to be able to say, &#147;We
are not going to lose much revenue, we have the list of the 50 vehicles
taking part in the event. It is a good cause, it is supported by the
local population, we will exempt the following vehicles&#148;, and
then publish the list of vehicles so
exempt.</div>
					<a name="0805098000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is what my
amendment would do. It is not by any stretch of the imagination a
wrecking amendment. It is a helpful amendment, because it would allow
the charging of everyday vehicles to continue on the dates when the
rally or festival was taking place. I would be interested to hear what
the Minister has to
say.</div>
					<a name="0805098000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000791"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As the right hon. Gentleman has said, his
amendment would mean that where a charging authority operating a scheme
is partially suspending a scheme, it could do so in respect of specific
vehicles. As currently drafted, the clause allows for the partial
suspension of a scheme in the event of an emergency or to facilitate a
temporary event&#151;for example, a parade, or carnival&#151;to
take place. That means, as he said, certain roads within the charging
scheme could temporarily have the charge suspended to allow traffic to
be diverted down them so as to avoid a road closed for an event such as
a marathon.</div>
					<a name="0805098000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where, for
example, an historic vehicle rally was being held within the charging
area it would already be open to the charging authority, using the
power in clause 107, to suspend charging on the roads that the rally
would use and for the duration of the rally. Under the Transport Act
2000, it is already open to any local charging scheme to provide for
exemptions or to reduce rates of charging which could be applied to
defined events. A scheme could be drafted to exclude from the charging
scheme vehicles taking part in a rally or charitable event. It would be
possible, if vehicles were officially in the rally, for specific
vehicles to be exempted from the charging scheme. I hope that is
helpful.</div>

local authorities&#146; use of their road-user charging powers. We
are already working with authorities that are developing proposals for
road pricing and we hope that that relationship will continue. However,
it may be necessary for the appropriate national authority to request
information beyond what is made available informally. This provision
states clearly that the information should be that which the authority
already has or can reasonably be expected to acquire. Therefore, we
think that this should impose no extra cost on a properly run scheme.
The Government&#146;s intention is to be able to access information

					<a name="0805098000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the moment, Welsh Ministers exercise functions in relation to strategic
Welsh management and they have the power to levy charges on trunk roads
only to support local road pricing schemes. However, clause 115 goes
well beyond that, with a huge extension of the powers. If I read this
clause correctly, which I think I do, it gives Welsh Ministers
tax-raising powers in Wales for the first time, as it allows them to
implement a Wales-wide scheme on all trunk roads in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 375</div>Principality. That equates to a huge tax increase on Welsh citizens. It
is a constitutional matter and should not be introduced through the
back door of a Bill on local transport. It is inconsistent with the
rest of the Bill as it applies to other parts of the country. The
potential effect on the Welsh economy is huge, if tax-raising powers
are to be granted to Welsh Ministers that they did not have
before.</div>

						<a name="0805098000796"></a>
							<b class="B">Mrs.
Si&#226;n C. James</b> (Swansea, East) (Lab): The hon.
Gentleman mentioned tax-raising powers. It is important to point out at
this juncture that the clause does not give tax-raising powers, which
will remain very firmly here at Westminster. What it will be is an
opportunity to put money raised on road pricing back into the local
infrastructure. We heard earlier from my hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield, Hillsborough about concerns the chambers of commerce had in
Sheffield. Similarly, in Cardiff, there are some serious concerns about
traffic congestion and surely there must be local solutions for local
problems.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000797"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> Absolutely, but the trouble is that I am going to
disagree with the hon. Lady. She is wrong in her initial premise. I am
certainly happy with her latter premises about local charging for local
schemes, and that the money raised from a Wales-wide trunk road
charging scheme could be used for Wales-wide schemes. My understanding
of the Bill, and that of many Members of the Welsh Assembly, is that
allowing charges to be made on a Wales-wide basis effectively gives the
Welsh Assembly tax-raising powers. These are not tax-raising powers
they have had before, and therefore this is a constitutional
matter.</div>
					<a name="0805098000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that
the Government&#146;s response will centre on the fact that the
provision has been included at the request of Welsh Ministers, and that
those Welsh Ministers have not yet decided where or how they are going
to use the additional powers. It may well have originated from Welsh
Ministers. I am not sure, therefore, why it has come to us as a
framework power in primary legislation, as opposed to a legislative
competence order. It is my understanding that when the Welsh Assembly
desires a specific matter to be added to its legislative competency,
the legislative competence order is the customary route. The Secretary
of State would lay a draft order in Parliament that would require the
approval of both Houses. That is, again, a different procedure from
what we are being given here. If one looks at this clause, it is clear
that there was a long discussion, much more erudite than any I can
offer
here&#151;</div>

						</b> The clause will allow the National Assembly for
Wales to pass its own legislation, in the form of an Assembly Measure,
on road charging on the trunk road network in Wales. The revenues from
any trunk road pricing scheme would have to be used for transport
purposes, for example to fund new transport infrastructure or provide
new services. Clause 115 has been included at the specific request of
the Welsh Ministers. It is consistent with the devolutionary principles
established in the Government of Wales Act 2006, and framework powers
are being conferred on the National Assembly in a number of other areas
of Government policy. The Welsh Ministers have yet to decide what role,
if any, road charging may play in addressing current and future
transport challenges. They do, however, wish to have the powers
available that would allow them to adopt a coherent approach towards
any road-pricing proposals that local authorities in Wales may bring
forward, or any future UK scheme. The Welsh Ministers have also made it
clear that if they were to introduce road pricing, it would be in the
context of new road developments in those areas with the worst
congestion
problems.</div>

						</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and I
certainly confirm what she has said. As I said before, the clause
simply enables the National Assembly for Wales to pass its own
legislation which, of course, would go through all the normal scrutiny.
The Government of Wales Act 2006 does not allow the transfer of
tax-raising powers to the Welsh Assembly. The powers in the clause are
to do with road user charges. As I said, that is in response to a
request from Welsh Ministers, which is entirely in line with the

that the proposal would affect only 5 per cent. of the roads in Wales,
but my point is that this is for the first time a tax-raising power
that the Welsh Assembly did not have before. There is any amount of
good legal argument that the measure is giving powers by the back door
that were never intended by the 2006 Act. It is clearly a tax-raising
power. It is clearly a constitutional matter. It should not be in the
Local Transport Bill, so on this particular clause, the Minister and I

Knight:
						</b> I want to ask the Minister about the operation of
the provision&#151;its enforcement. We all agree that where a vehicle
is foreign registered, its driver should obey our laws, even if the
laws in the country of origin are different. For example, many German
drivers are used to driving at very high speeds on their autobahns.
Even in France they have a top speed limit of about 80 mph. While they
are over here, at least under the present Government, they ought to
adhere to our limit, which is currently 70
mph.</div>
					<a name="0805098000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, even if
that information is shuffled around, what improvement results from the
enforcement process? That is my concern. Let us say that a driver comes
over to the UK from Cyprus and brings his vehicle with him. He exceeds
the speed limit and the vehicle is photographed by a number of speed
cameras. He parks in parking bays and does not put money in parking
meters. He receives ticket after ticket. When he leaves this country,
taking his vehicle with him, how will those ticketable offences be
pursued?</div>

							<a name="0805098000819"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The clause was inserted because, during our
consultation process leading up to the Bill, we received a number of
representations from public authorities pressing the Government to
allow them to receive information about the owners and keepers of
foreign-registered vehicles. Many councils, especially those in London,
have significant problems with foreign-registered vehicles committing
parking, congestion charge and other traffic offences. The clause will
allow local authorities, Transport for London, the police and others to
seek and receive information from the Secretary of State to enable
penalty notices to be issued to keepers of foreign-registered
vehicles.</div>
					<a name="0805098000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right
to say that, although the provision will let local councils and others
obtain information about foreign-registered vehicles and send a penalty
charge notice, it does not guarantee that such data can be obtained in
all instances, nor does it guarantee payment from evaders driving
foreign-registered vehicles. However, the experience of Transport for
London shows that, of cases where it is possible to obtain information
about foreign-registered vehicles, 38 per cent. of outstanding charges
are collected. It is not the answer to all the problems, as the right
hon. Member for East Yorkshire has probably spotted, but it is at least
a step along the way. We have drafted such a measure in response to
requests from several public bodies that would find it extremely
useful.</div>

							<a name="0805098000823"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The Government&#146;s policy is to encourage
local authorities to take over from the police service the enforcement
of parking restrictions. When a local authority does that, police
resources are released for more serious matters. It means that a single
body, the local authority, is responsible not only for developing
parking policies, but for enforcing them. The parking components of
part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 came into force on 31 March
2008.</div>
					<a name="0805098000456"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has come to
light that the definition of &#147;local authority&#148; in the
Traffic Management Act, read with other provisions of that Act, means
that shire district councils may not be able to make full use of the
new enforcement powers in their off-street car parks and in relation to
any free, on-street parking that they authorise. That anomaly has no
impact on enforcement by London boroughs, unitary authorities or
metropolitan district councils, nor does it affect the enforcement of
yellow bands or pay and display restrictions.</div>
					<a name="0805098000457"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Department considers that
parking attendants appointed before 31 March, under the provisions of
the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, are unaffected by the anomaly, so
district councils that received parking enforcement powers before 31
March 2008 will have civil enforcement officers they can use for
enforcement in off-street car parks and any free on-street
parking.</div>
					<a name="0805098000458"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that local authorities have proper parking enforcement
powers. New clause 13 seeks to make it clear in the legislation that a
shire district council has the power to appoint the civil enforcement
officer who would serve the penalty charge notice to a motorist who is
parked in contravention of the parking regulations in a local authority
owned off-street car park.</div>
					<a name="0805098000459"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 291 seeks to bring
those amendments to the 2004 Act into force automatically two months
after Royal Assent, rather than by a commencement order, so that the
anomaly can be rectified as quickly as possible. Amendment No. 292
amends the long title of the Bill to reflect the subject matter of new
clause 13.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="0805098000472"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause is
very familiar to those who have been following the passage of the Bill
and the arguments surrounding it. As I have said consistently in
Committee, it is my strong belief that we should do as much as we can
to encourage partnership between the local authority and the operator.
The Government recognise partnership as the fundamental driver to
improvements of local bus services, because in &#147;Putting
Passengers First&#148; they said that they regard it as a &#147;key
ingredient of success&#148;. If that is true, it is difficult to
understand why the Government have not done more in the initial phases
to ensure that partnership is encouraged. We should do as much as we
can to ensure that it is encouraged and that is exactly what my new
clause does.</div>
					<a name="0805098000473"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
acknowledge the work done by the Campaign for Better Transport in
relation to the new clause. It has pointed out, quite rightly, that a
new clause offering a way to combine partnership with long-term
planning, in a manner that the Bill currently does not offer, would be
beneficial.</div>
					<a name="0805098000474"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would do nothing other than ensure that local authorities
actively consider how best to utilise partnerships while developing
long-term transport plans. It seems to me especially important that
local authorities should do that, because previous and subsequent
clauses do away with bus
strategies.</div>
					<a name="0805098000475"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
part of the new clause is designed to encourage partnership still
further. It would require that local authorities look at partnership
and produce a &#147;partnership strategy&#148;, which would
encourage local transport authorities and integrated transport
authorities to think more clearly and see that partnership should be
the first route they take. That would encourage them to consider how
they might best arrange and implement partnership schemes.</div>
					<a name="0805098000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">The evidence shows quite clearly
that effective partnership between local authorities and bus operators
in any one area is the key to improving bus services in that area. We
had a long debate previously in Committee about areas where partnership
has worked and I will not return to that debate today. However, in my
opinion the solution is to be found not down the regulation route but
down the partnership route, so we must ensure that partnership is
encouraged and improved, and I believe that the new clause will achieve
that end.</div>

						</b> I understand that the hon. Gentleman is very
keen that partnerships are able to work effectively. However, I must
say that some of the proposals in the new clause are already provided
for elsewhere in the Bill, in the revised provisions on quality
partnership schemes and provisions, including a new competition test,
relating to voluntary partnership agreements. I do not think that the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause would add anything in particular to
what local authorities will already be able to do under those

would give powers to airport operators to introduce congestion charging
on airport roads where the airport operator exercised the functions of

travelling to and from the airport will rise and congestion will
increase.</div>

offers us an ideal opportunity to give airport operators, if they see
fit, the opportunity to tackle congestion and emissions and to
encourage passengers and visitors to airports to travel by public

airport drop-offs, which double the number of necessary journeys,

place the airport operator in the same position as a local authority in
allowing it to exercise the same functions in relation to a charging
scheme, including consulting on and making a scheme, setting charge
levels, charging road users, collecting revenue and enforcing penalty
charges against those who do 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>not pay. For a private company to exercise such powers, appropriate
safeguards would need to be put in place so that the public could have
confidence in the fair operation of such a
scheme.</div>
					<a name="0805098000539"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are
complex issues to work through, including ensuring that the revenue was
reserved so that it could be spent only on transport purposes and that
it did not offset other allocated funding. We would not want a private

the right time to take powers to allow airport operators to charge on
roads for which they are the designated highways authority. Other
measures are in place to tackle congestion problems, and there are a
number of complex issues to be worked through before the public would
accept an airport charging scheme. We therefore cannot accept the new

					<a name="0805098000546"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had a full
debate on this issue earlier in our discussions. It was proposed to
oblige bus operators to inform the authorities of where their buses
were at a particular time, and where they had been, so that it could be
checked whether they were complying with their commitments to run buses
on particular routes and so that their punctuality could be checked. A
lot of the weight of my right hon. Friend the Minister&#146;s
argument against that was that it would be inappropriate to include
global positioning system technology in legislation as a way of doing
that, although it is the most obvious way at the moment. In future,
technological innovations that have not yet been thought of may be
better.</div>
					<a name="0805098000547"></a><div class="hs_Para">If my right
hon. Friend reads the new clause, she will see that, with the help of
officials, I have foreseen that argument. There is no mention of GPS,
so I ask her to reconsider. The basic point of the new clause is that
bus companies should be held to account for their punctuality and
reliability on their route, and that services should be able to be
checked both while they are happening and historically. That must be a
sensible basis for
legislation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000871"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I hope that I can reassure my hon. Friend that
we either already have, or are taking, all the powers that the new
clause is intended to effect. The Transport Act 1985 already allows the
Secretary of State to make regulations to require operators to provide
certain data to traffic commissioners. The new powers in the Bill will
enable traffic commissioners, first, to hold local authorities to
account if they are having an impact on bus punctuality and, secondly,
to impose sanctions on operators who fail to meet statutory
requirements to provide bus punctuality
data.</div>
					<a name="0805098000549"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those new powers
will form part of the new bus punctuality regime, which we are working
on with bus operators and local authorities through the Bus Partnership
Forum. We believe that they will make a real
difference.</div>
					<a name="0805098000550"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
those are sufficient reassurances to persuade my hon. Friend to
withdraw the new clause.</div>

Stringer:
						</b> I shall withdraw the new clause, but I would be
grateful if my right hon. Friend wrote to me so that I could better
understand how the reliability of the data can be checked. This is not
just about the records of the bus companies, which may well have been
fiddled for all sorts of reasons. Buses may not have travelled along
the routes that they said they had done and manually recorded arrival
times can be
fiddled.</div>
					<a name="0805098000552"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of
having something like GPS is that it can be checked independently,
which means that the evidence is more reliable. I would be grateful if
my right hon. Friend wrote to me to reassure me further on that point.

Hammond:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="0805098000556"></a><div class="hs_Para">We live in an age
where people carry less and less cash around with them. That is
obviously due in part to disposable incomes falling owing to the
Government&#146;s huge tax increases. It is also true because we live
an age of chip and pin, so people are becoming increasingly reliant on
debit and credit cards. We can often use those cards throughout our
constituencies in the smallest of corner shops, yet does it not seem
extraordinary that it is not possible for that payment method to be
used for tolls on either of the Severn bridges, the gateway to Wales?
This is a marvel of British engineering and it seems a shame that chip
and pin technology and payment by credit card cannot be used.</div>
					<a name="0805098000557"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr. Andrew
Davies, the Assembly Member for South Wales Central, found that a
particular problem when one of his constituents wrote to him saying
that he had come across the Severn bridge only to be told to go back to
Bristol to get some cash. At that point he wrote to Severn River
Crossing plc and was
told:</div>
					<a name="0805098000599"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I can
advise that the Severn Bridges Act 1992 governs the current Tolling
Operation of both Severn Crossings. Unfortunately, this legislation
does not allow payment by credit or debit cards at the Toll
Booths.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805098000558"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was
confirmed by the Deputy First Minister. That confirmation not only
acknowledged that that Act governs the toll arrangements, but
added:</div>
					<a name="0805098000600"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You will
know that the legislative responsibility for the Severn Crossings rests
with the Department for Transport&#146;s Government Representative in
England and the Highways Agency
(HA).&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805098000559"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems,
therefore, that it is possible for us to make provision that the Severn
bridge be able to use what is common technology everywhere
else.</div>

					<a name="0805098000561"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope, therefore,
that the Minister will, at the tail end of the Committee, agree that
this is an uncontroversial proposal that would bring the Severn bridge

							<a name="0805098000874"></a>Mr.
Leech:
						</b> I support the new clause, as do Liberal Democrat
Members of Parliament from Wales. In this day and age, it seems
ridiculous that people can pay only by cash. The different ways in
which people can pay the M6 toll make it considerably easier to use
that road. On that basis, this is a sensible new
clause.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805098000875"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> I shall be brief. I want to know why we cannot go
all the way with technology on these toll points. For the past decade,
America has had fully automated systems whereby no one is employed at
the toll pay point&#151;people simply throw money into the basket or
swipe a card&#151;yet here in the UK we are still employing people to
sit all day in little booths to take cash off the drivers. Why can we
not just fully automate the toll
points?</div>

						</b> That is an important issue. It has been raised
a number of times, particularly at Transport questions in the House.
The hon. Member for Wimbledon is right to say that there are legal
barriers to using credit card payments. There are also practical and
financial issues that we would need to
resolve.</div>
					<a name="0805098000565"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
November last year, a working group was set up to consider the options
and identify the issues of credit card usage. The group consists of the
Highways Agency, Severn River Crossing plc, the Welsh Assembly
Government and the Government&#146;s representative. We hope to hear
its findings and recommendations in early autumn. I feel that it would
be inappropriate to pre-empt the group&#146;s findings by changing
the legislation now, but I assure the Committee that after the group
presents its recommendations, we will certainly consider its findings
and take any appropriate action. I hope that I have persuaded the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw the new clause.</div>

discussion over the past few weeks. The quality of the debate has been
a clear reflection of the quality of the Committee and the level of
interest in the Bill. We have not always been in agreement, but there
has been a great deal of interest in the Bill from both sides of the
House, as well as in forensic scrutiny of all the clauses. We have been
able to do that; in fact, we have had to go further than the time
allocated for the Bill. I am very grateful to the usual channels,
particularly my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, North, for his
important contribution in driving us through our discussions.</div>

discussing the Bill and have been as helpful as they
can.</div>

and the <i class="I">Hansard </i>reporters. I give special thanks to my
colleagues, who have provided help and advice: my right hon. Friend the
Member for East Yorkshire and my hon. Friends the Members for Rugby and
Kenilworth, for Harwich and for Ilford, North. The Minister was right
to say that this Committee has shown great interest in the Bill. I am
grateful to Government Members for listening to my arguments&#151;I
know that they rarely agreed with them. The Minister was right to say
that we have had interesting and excellent
discussions.</div>
					<a name="0805098000576"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
place on the record my thanks to the Minister&#146;s officials. She
very kindly offered the Opposition the chance to have briefings and to
clarify issues before bringing them to the Committee. I am grateful to
her for that. I also thank her for allowing her officials to speak to
me. That was a great
help.</div>
					<a name="0805098000577"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to
the Confederation of Passenger Transport UK and to the Campaign for
Better Transport, which helped me to frame about four of the 150
amendments that I tabled. More particularly, I place on the record my
thanks to my researcher, Mr. Carlton Jones, who
helped me with the other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column391" />Column number: 391</div>140 or so amendments that we tabled. As the Minister said, we
have had a chance to investigate the Bill in some depth. Clearly, there
were issues about timetabling, but through the good offices of the
usual channels, we have had the chance to deliberate in Committee for
longer than was originally scheduled. I think that the Bill, as it
proceeds to Report, is better for our
scrutiny.</div>

good-humoured, and I pay tribute to the Minister for listening to
discussions on a number of amendments and to contributions from hon.
Members on both sides of the Committee. There is still some work to be
done on the Local Transport Bill. On a number of occasions, there have

further point. Opposition Members are sorry to hear that the

sunshine, so I invite her to come and spend some time in
Bridlington&#151;provided that she does not use the Humber bridge,
she can currently arrive there without having to pay any road tolls or
charges.</div>

on behalf of my co-Chairman, David Taylor, and myself, to thank the
Minister, the Front-Bench spokesmen and other hon. Members for their
kind remarks. This has been a very interesting Bill. At times, the
Committee has had its foot on the accelerator; at times, it has gone
rather slowly in congested areas. It has also taken a few detours, but
we have reached the end of our journey and the end of the Committee
stage and I congratulate all those who have taken part on conducting
themselves in the best traditions of the House of
Commons.</div>
					<a name="0805098000581"></a><div class="hs_Para">In particular,
I thank the Clerks Department and especially our own Clerk, who has
guided me so skilfully through various pitfalls; the <i class="I">Hansard
