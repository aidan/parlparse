                           </strong> Indeed, I have in front of me
the page to which the Minister refers, but the question in my mind
concerns post offices’ viability. We are asking in
paragraph (g) for a report on how the investment will have
been spent, the value of any unspent budget and, most importantly, the
progress toward the expected goals.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000027">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Our
difficulty, as we explained, is that part of the money—indeed,
it looks to be a rather large part, 48%—will inevitably be the
three years’ continuation of the subsidy put in by the last
Labour Government, £150 million or £180
million to 2012. The difficulty is how, with that amount, to make post
offices viable to carry on after the mutualisation. That subsidy is
part of their income and it helps them, but it does not change the
problem that we all know we face, which is how to make the businesses
more viable.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This morning,
we touched briefly on the technology being put in and the network
modernisation that will bring things up to date and make them more
pleasant for customers and the people behind the counter, but that will
still not create the business. Maybe one or two people will pop their
noses in because they think that it would be nice to see what the
spruced-up post office looks like, but it will not provide additional
footfall, beyond the curiosity factor for a week or two.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The key
question is where the business will come from. I note that the project
costs are 5%; what that might mean, I am not sure. Perhaps the Minister
can answer that. Our question is whether any of this money will be
spent to make the network viable. Otherwise, people will be put into
mutualised post offices whose profitability is questionable, and that
is not something that anybody can countenance. The National Federation
of SubPostmasters wants the Post Office to be a going concern, not the
basket case to which Mr George Thomson referred in his evidence to us a
fortnight
ago.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clearly,
we need to ensure that post offices’ viability is good. We need
not just a subsidy but a proper move forward to make them a going
concern. That is why we want some information to indicate that:
information about the programme’s anticipated goals and how it
will work out in practice. That is what the people want who will be
looking after post offices after mutualisation. The last thing they
want is to find that they have been hived off or cut adrift without
access to any Government subsidy, and that lo and behold, they face a
closure programme on an unprecedented
scale.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000031">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Absolutely. There are some very enterprising
post offices. In Llangennech in my constituency there was a local
supermarket just down the road from the post office and so the option
to become a corner shop was very limited. Instead it became a gift shop
with some very nice ladies’ jewellery. Yes, there are
opportunities for post offices and that is certainly something that we
want to look forward to.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000033">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Absolutely. The diversification programme has
been very important and I will come back to that when I talk about
devolved issues. Quite clearly it has had to happen already in our
constituencies because otherwise the income coming in would not have
been sufficient to have kept the place open. So, yes, a lot of
diversification has taken place and certainly we have seen a lot of
amalgamation or putting two businesses together. Another example in my
constituency is Tycroes where there used to be a post office and a
little supermarket owned by the same family. Obviously they have put
the two together so that they can make economies of scale and
interchange staff between the post office and the shop. We are all
familiar with that type of
picture.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Yes,
of course there is a lot that post offices can do but the key issue is
how we can get them to do that. There is a role there for the
Government to spur them on and to demonstrate ways forward, such as
some of the pilot projects that have been mentioned. To make sure that
the Post Office is in a fit state for mutualisation, we want to have
this report and to know about the progress that has been made, whether
by local individual enterprise or a Government initiative, taking on
board the diverse nature of the different types of post offices that we
have.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will not discuss all the amendments in the group because my hon. Friend
the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire will do so. I should
therefore like to move on to one of the new clauses which is directly
linked to what I have been saying. New clause 8 requires the Secretary
of State to report on the future viability of the post office network
before the first relevant disposal is made in relation to Royal Mail.
The report must include details of the inter-business agreement and
plans for any new forms of business for the post office network.
Clearly this is the real worry for post offices. Not only will they be
mutualised, which they may welcome, but they will need to be viable.
They are looking at three distinct streams of business and they are
worrying about each one of them. Not one of them is secure.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
talked about the enterprise. We have talked about the possible
opportunities for post offices to develop as places of great
enterprise. We are aware that the sub-postmasters are trying to get
more business from the Department for Work and Pensions and we are also
aware that there is no guarantee that they will retain their existing
contracts on what are called the green giros. They have put forward
some possibilities but we do not know whether the DWP will want to pay 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 339<a class="bkMark" name="Column339">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the post offices a viable price for some of the transfers that they are
offering to carry out when the DWP itself has been closing front-line
offices. There is the idea of the post office as a front room, a window
on to Government, the place where people can access all sorts of
different services: we would like to have more detail about that if it
is really going to happen.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People are
very worried. In fact, there is talk in the document about the local
post office. That is an interesting concept, but it is frustrating if a
person turns up at one of them and is glossily told that it provides
85% of the services, but of course the person wants one of the services
in the 15% that is not available. They want to apply for something for
which there is not a form. We had that kind of situation with things
such as driving licences, where people had to go to certain post
offices and not to others, and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is concern that the Government’s idea of the shop front will not
necessarily come to fruition because of uncertainty about giros, the
fact that we have not yet heard that sub-postmasters have had any
commitment from the DWP for further services, and the fact that it can
be frustrating if services are not available at every post office. That
can sometimes detract from the availability of the service. People
decide that they will not bother going there, they will go
online—they do not know whether their post office down the road
will have a
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is the issue with the Government part, but all of that makes it even
more important that the IBA is in place. That is why the new clause
asks for details of it. We have already mentioned the IBA, which is the
vital link that guarantees the post office network one third of its
business. Most people cannot conceive of a post office that does not
have a letters and parcels service. The idea of a post office without
postal services is bizarre, but a few years ago many would not have
believed that rivals in the field would snap away from the Post Office
the green giros or the TV licence contract which, of course, were
lost.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those
are the issues that the Post Office faces. The Royal Mail provides
income from not only the counter service but the many other parts of
the IBA which involve things such as sorting office links. Many post
offices, particularly those in the more far-flung rural areas, are
dependent on that for a large proportion of the income that they
receive.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">All
in all, we are asking for the report to make it absolutely clear to
everyone exactly what will be in mutualised post offices. Most people
who buy something want to know exactly what it can do, what its future
prospects are and so on. That is really what we are trying to say. In
order for the mutualisation to be successful, people will want to know
that they have something that will potentially be a success story, not
an unmitigated disaster with a huge amount of blame falling on it for
having to close post offices, and with people possibly feeling that it
is a financial
liability.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
would like to say a little about new clause 9. The essence of the new
clause is that the Secretary of State should report to devolved bodies
in the same way that he would report in new clause 8, to which I have
just spoken. What is the involvement of our devolved bodies? It is
considerable. Many of us will know that post

                           </div>offices in Scotland and Wales have been able to benefit from funds that
were allocated by the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Executive. It is
clear, if we are talking about mutualisation, that there is another
stakeholder: the investment in the post office network that has been
made by the devolved
institutions.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
Wales we have had two programmes. First, the post office development
fund provided £4.1 million in capital grants to 99 sub-post
offices in the most deprived and isolated areas of Wales between 2002
and 2004.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

pm<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000346">&#160;</a>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the post office diversification fund, which opened in December 2008,
has also been open to post offices from the whole of Wales.
Sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses have been able to apply for
capital grants of perhaps £5,000 or so for small projects, or
£20,000 for some of the larger projects.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The first two
rounds of the post office diversification fund attracted 214
applications for grants, and 140 applications totalling
£2.7 million were supported. It is clear that a significant
investment has been made by the Assembly Government in the post office
network. I can give you an example from my constituency, where New Dock
Road post office received £50,000 for refurbishment. It is a
well used post office, which is at the heart of the community. People
can be seen queuing outside at about 8 o’clock on pension
morning, and the queue stretches right down the road. Residents enjoy
the post office as a social outing, and both the current postmaster and
the one who was there at the time of the redevelopment have a
reputation for caring well for their community and looking after their
customers well.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clearly, the Assembly
Government have given a large amount of money. It seems reasonable that
they should receive a report of what is happening to the post offices
in the mutualisation process, and that they should have some idea of
the returns that the post offices can make. When the Post Office is
required to report on how it is getting on and what is happening, the
Assembly Government should have the opportunity to have that report
laid before them. We have mentioned the  other bodies that are
involved, such as the London assembly.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We think that
the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, the Northern Ireland
Assembly and the Greater London authority should have the opportunity
to see exactly what has been going on. They should be able to see
exactly what the plans are, and how the investment that they have made
meshes with the investment that the Government have made and the plans
that the Government have for the future viability. It is important that
such a year-on-year report should be established, detailing exactly how
matters have worked out and how the network is progressing. For that
reason, we propose these two new clauses in addition to the amendments
to which I have just
spoken.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000049">&#160;</a>

suggest that he had such plans. I was about to explain my concerns
about the current plan. I note the promises that have been made on the
record that no more post office closures will occur, and given the
evidence that we have heard I am fascinated to see how that will be
carried through. I wish the Minister luck in that; I hope that he is
correct. I continue to oppose post office closures in my constituency

Post Office Ltd stayed in Government ownership provided that there were
no closures. If the Government proceeded with a mutual, many of us
would support it provided we were assured that it would be established
on a proper footing. However, I am not clear from the clause about
various factors, and I would like to explore them in more

said:<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“In
terms of what is in the Bill, what is important for Post Office is that
we maintain our strong relationship with the Royal Mail Group. Royal
Mail Group is over a third of our revenues but the rest of our revenues
come from Government and we will be looking to Government to grow the
revenues in terms of front-of-office services through Government and
also through financial services. Some 80% of customers now can access
other bank accounts through the Post Office, so there are tremendous
opportunities”.<em>—</em>[<em>Official Report, Postal

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would like
to press the Minister slightly on how much Government and local
government business may be possible. I do not distrust the
Government’s commitment, and I know that he said at a previous
sitting that he is in discussion with various Whitehall Departments and
agencies, to see exactly what business can be put through the Post
Office. However, I foresee some purely practical problems.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In my area of
Angus, most burghs have established local access offices offering a
front-office service for all local authority services. In Abroath,
Brechin, Kirriemuir, Forfar and Montrose they are situated at most
100 yards or so from a post office—and in Kirriemuir,
Forfar and Montrose, those are the only post offices in those large
burghs. It is difficult to see how there is likely to be greater
ability to deliver those local authority services through the post
offices in those burgh areas, given the investment that has already
been made to set up the access offices. It seems that the
Government and the Scottish

			Column number: 342<a class="bkMark" name="Column342">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Parliament would be the only ones to provide services that required such
delivery, but I am not clear how much of a service could be provided by
the post offices. It would be useful if the Minister were to give an
indication of his thinking on the subject.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I welcome the
possibility of such services being delivered in smaller village areas,
but, frankly, in many areas the post offices have already gone. I
wonder whether, under the Post Office local model, it would be possible
for staff who run the shop, pub or whatever along with the post office
to deliver more detailed services.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On local post
office services, the hon. Member for Llanelli touched on the question
of mutuality. In Scotland, a great deal of help has already been given
to local post offices, through a diversification programme. That has
helped post offices with their diversified businesses. Indeed, I
previously cited a post office set up in a fish and chip shop. That
programme has helped post offices to get greater business, as the hon.
Member for Folkestone and Hythe said. The problem that I mentioned in
an intervention was that the process was well advanced in many rural
areas in Scotland, the area that I know best, and it is difficult to
see how much more can be done.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As we heard,
the Scottish Government have introduced a business bonus scheme as well
as a diversification programme. It helps all small businesses, but
particularly post offices; depending on the rateable value, they pay
less rates or no rates. I refer to what George Thomson of the National
Federation of SubPostmasters said in
evidence:<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“When
it comes to the devolved assemblies in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland, in many cases they have been given 100% rates relief to help
them stay in that community. I know that in Scotland, for example, some
people are saving £4,000 or £5,000 a year, which is a
massive help—saving £100 a week—to keep their
business on the local high
street.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Postal
Services Public Bill Committee, </em>9 November 2010; c. 33,
Q76.]<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000326">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That is
a considerable investment in post offices, as the hon. Member for
Llanelli mentioned. On that basis I support new clause 9. The Scottish
Parliament and devolved Assemblies have considerable input into trying
to deal with that problem and to ensure that local post offices
continue.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Llanelli touched on mutuality. Again, as I mentioned
earlier, there is a great deal of support for that concept, but we are
unclear about what the reality is. In our evidence session, it was
clear from witnesses that that there is no way that the Post Office Ltd
could ever be a mutual organisation, prior to being put on a sound
financial footing. The underlying theme of the evidence was that it was
a long way from that point now and that the pathway taking it from
where it is now to where it could become a mutual was not at all clear.
If the Government are to persuade hon. Members and the general public
who use and value post offices, as well as the people who run them,
that a mutual is the way forward, they have an awful lot of explaining
to do and a lot of detail to go
into.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have talked about the relationship between the Royal Mail and Post
Office Ltd. There was a great deal of support for that from the
witnesses from whom we heard. However, the relationship between, say,
two companies in the same group having an agreement to run together and
the realities of a privatised Post Office are different, because the
Government are determined to push down the costs to the taxpayer of
continuing to support Post Office Ltd.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000064">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As has been
mentioned, at present Post Office Ltd gets fully one third of its
business through the inter-business agreement. We have heard a great
deal about that and about the length of the agreement that could be
entered into between Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd. I accept, to an
extent, and I am sure that the Minister will say, that it is impossible
to write a long-term agreement into a Bill. There may be legal problems
with doing that. The Minister will no doubt mention that Moya Greene
spoke about that during the evidence session,
saying:<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“For
me it is unthinkable that we would not have a very long-term
relationship with the Post Office. Here is a group of people—the
best and strongest network in the country, by any yardstick, with
11,900 outlets—who are committed to and want to sell our
products…To me it is unthinkable that we would ever have
anything but the very strong relationship that we have now with the
Post Office. I admire our other partners like WH Smith; of course I do.
But that is not the Post
Office.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Postal

                        <p>Leaving
aside the fact that in many places WH Smith is the post office now,
because of what happened under the previous programmes—many post
offices were moved to become effectively subsidiaries of other
businesses and are not stand-alone businesses—I am slightly
concerned by that remark. However, my real concern about what Ms Greene
said was that a relationship between a fully privatised Royal Mail and
a Government-owned and mutual Post Office Ltd would be different from a
relationship between two companies that are both members of the same
group.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000066">&#160;</a>

Greene may have a considerable attachment to Post Office Ltd, but would
a new owner of the business necessarily feel the same way? What happens

asymmetric power, because it is not in my notes. I
understand what he means, which is basically the point that I was
already making about a large, privatised and profit-driven Royal Mail.
I do not agree with the privatisation, but the rationale behind it is
to make the new company look for efficiency savings and to cut costs.
Is it conceivable that the new company will not look at how it can do
that in its relationship with Post Office Ltd? I think that was the
hon. Gentleman’s point. Any newly privatised company will look
at all its relationships and contracts to see where costs can be cut. I
am sure that we will discuss the universal service and its problems
later.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000069">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
Second Reading, I asked the Minister whether there was any precedent
elsewhere in the world for splitting the delivery service from the post
office network, but I did not receive an answer. I have done some
research and have been unable to find an example, but I have discovered
an interesting situation in New Zealand. During the 1980s and
’90s, New Zealand changed the structure of its postal service.
Prior to that, its system seems to have been much like the old Post
Office Corporation. It had three roles: postal services,
telecommunications and banking. The New Zealand service, as I
understand it, was split into its three constituent parts.
Interestingly, however, it was not privatised and, as far as I can
ascertain, it remains in public ownership and returns a fairly healthy
profit. In parallel to the splitting up of the business, a full
liberalisation of the New Zealand postal services was carried out,
which led to the entry of a large number of new entrants into the
market. At first, the entrants were relatively local, but eventually
larger businesses entered the market, one of which was Fastway Post.
This example is integral to our discussion not because it was a mail
delivery company, but because of what happened
next.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have heard much about the need for the IBA. The Minister and the chief
executive of Royal Mail have said that it would be inconceivable that
anything but Post Office Ltd would be used by Royal Mail. Indeed, if I
remember correctly, the Minister was somewhat dismissive of the idea
that an operator might want to use a major supermarket for the delivery
of postal services. However, that is what has begun to happen in New
Zealand. Fastway Post, which appeared initially to be a business post
provider, has moved into the wider market. It is now involved in what
is effectively a franchise operation in which shops can provide the
services of post offices. It is not unlike the current system of Post
Office Ltd and its small business providers. Fastway Post’s
website states that it has outlets throughout New Zealand and it issues
an invitation to
retailers:<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000073">&#160;</a>

explain—he is really impatient. He has pooh-poohed the idea that
somebody could set up an alternative route for delivering services,
rather than through Post Office Ltd. Fastway Post demonstrates that
that can be done. It happens to have been a competitor of New Zealand
Post that did it, but there is nothing to stop Deutsche Post or TNT
taking over Royal Mail and deciding that to cut costs it will look at
alternatives for delivering services. It might decide to franchise out.

                           </strong> The Minister is getting over-excited. The Committee
has heard ample evidence that only 4,000 post offices are profitable
and that only 7,000 are needed to meet the universal service
obligation. The Minister may laugh, but it is quite conceivable that a
privatised Royal Mail, or somebody who takes over that service, might
decide that that is all it needs to run a universal service and that it
will utilise a supermarket chain, or similar, to deliver the services.
That would make inroads into the viability of Post Office Ltd as a
stand-alone
business.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000085">&#160;</a>

                           </div>Nothing in the Bill writes into statute that there will be a continuing
business or that existing post offices will continue. The Minister must
consider this matter because he has given an assurance that there will
be no more closures and that we will continue with 12,000 post offices,
yet he is pressing through a Bill that may lead to the undermining of
that post office service. We do not know what is a few years down the

                           </strong> The dispute between the two of us may be a
philosophical one, because I do not believe that Governments can write
into legislation that a business will exist in perpetuity because
Parliament has decreed it. That is not how businesses work. Businesses
do not work through sentimentality, because this place has all the
legal power to decree to businesses; they work because they are
commercially viable, with services going through. One does not put that
in the Bill, but in a Post Office policy statement, which we have
done.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000088">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister seems to be throwing Post Office Ltd to
the wolves, to survive or otherwise in the commercial environment in
which a fully privatised Post Office would be found. I do not know if
someone will come along with an alternative to Post Office Ltd, but it
has happened elsewhere—no postal market is exactly the same as
the UK’s and other things might happen, but that is a
possibility. Nothing in the Bill guarantees the future of the post
offices, which is what we have been arguing about for all these years,
through the closure programmes—fighting them. We have been
arguing for the future of our own post offices, in our own communities.
The Minister is saying that the previous Government were awful in
closing all those post offices—they were, and I do not deny
that—but he is also saying that the Post Office will,
effectively, be left to the market. That is what will
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000089">&#160;</a>

offices in Germany and the Netherlands, I do not see why that cannot be
done in this country. We must seriously consider, as the Bill goes
through Parliament, exactly how we ensure the future of our post
offices. I become very worried indeed when I look at what
has happened elsewhere and at the potential future of our post offices
under the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000091">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Going
back to what Paula Vennells said in her evidence, I remind the Minister
that she talked about financial services. The Government have rejected
the idea of a post bank as one of the ways forward, but interestingly,
one of the things that helped the New Zealand postal service get back
on its feet and turn itself around was Kiwibank. Guess what Kiwibank
is—basically, it is a post bank, but the New Zealand
model.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000092">&#160;</a>

to come up with a lot more than the sentimentality of Royal Mail
towards Post Office Ltd. In my experience, there is little sentiment in
big business when the chips are down. Once Royal Mail is privatised and
sold on to Deutsche Post, TNT or whoever, the present chief executive
or the present Minister, neither of whom will be around for
ever—no offence to the Minister—are not sufficient
grounds on which to base the future of our post office network, which
so many of our constituents rely

the amendments in the group, surprisingly enough. I want to talk

4.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000094">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
25 has similar objectives to those of amendment 16, but relates to the
Post Office instead of Royal Mail. I will not go through from proposed
new paragraph (a) to whatever, but a couple of points are important to
pick
out.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Proposed
new paragraph (a) would secure the placing of at least one
representative of those directly employed by the mutualised Post Office
or its successors on the board of the new company. That is important,
because the Minister seemed to say just now that the business would be
mutualised without any real level of information being passed to us, so
we think that is some kind of insurance policy and a safeguard.
Amendment 25 would deliver a natural avenue for developing
relationships between management and the work force in a way that would
strengthen the company moving forward. From the employer’s side,
that would be a sign of faith in the work force as one of the biggest
assets that any company can have, and that would be carried through by
amendment 25. As in amendment 16, amendment 25 does not
restrict such representation to only one, but rather at least one,
directly employed representative, which we think is very
important.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000096">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Proposed
new paragraph (b) mentions the headquarters of the business. One could
argue about whether it is more important for Royal Mail or the Post
Office to have headquarters in the UK. Sadly, we can all see the
possibility of Royal Mail not having its HQ in the UK, which fills us
with some dread, but the possibility of the Post Office not having its
HQ in the UK would fill us with even more
trepidation.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000097">&#160;</a>

the essence is the headquarters, not the operation. It is important
that the Post Office HQ is retained within the UK, and I will develop a
couple of points, similar to those that we developed on amendment 16,
as to why it is important and why we hope that the Minister will take
our arguments on board this time.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000099">&#160;</a>

headquarters in the UK protects the integrity of a brand that is
typically British, typically representative of the United Kingdom and
typically representative of our high streets. Amendment 25 would bind
any successful mutual to recognise the importance of the HQ location as
an integral part of the way forward. It is also important to recognise
the earlier point made by the hon. Member for Angus in relation to
Royal Mail, because the same argument works here. We need to keep not
only the HQ jobs, but the management jobs of the Post Office within the
UK. We need to do that not only so that the work force can relate to
the management, but so that people can work their way up through the
company in a way that would become more difficult if the HQ were
overseas.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000100">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Committee
will remember the history lessons that we heard during the debate on
amendment 16. I will not repeat those here and now, but they
are relevant to this amendment as they are relevant to Royal Mail.
Paragraph (g)(ii) would require the Secretary of State to outline how
he proposes to utilise the £1.34 billion that he has
committed to the Post Office from 2012. My hon. Friend the Member for
Llanelli touched on that, but there comes a point in time when we need
to know what that money will be used for. My hon. Friend asked that
question today. We have not had the answer. What level of new product
development would that £1.34 billion be responsible for? That is
my concern.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We find that
the Government want to engage more with the Post Office for the
delivery of Government services. We have heard that that is an
ambition. Could we find some of that £1.34 billion being used to
develop those new products in a way that actually uses that
£1.34 billion instead of another departmental budget? Might we
find that the Post Office pays for some of the development work for any
potential movement that might relate to additional services from, say,
the Department for Work and Pensions? We would like to see a commitment
that the £1.34 billion is not used in that way and that, if the
DWP delivers services through the Post Office, the DWP budget is
responsible for the development of those services, and the £1.34
billion for the Post Office is kept for other development work, so that
we are not talking about using the £1.34 billion—the
Minister is looking confused, I will try and make it simple for
him—that is committed to, as a route for subsidising DWP
budgets.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000111">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that BIS has no
intention of subsidising DWP and I am sure DWP has no intention of
subsidising BIS. I would simply say that if new services are put
forward by any Government Department, unless there are issues that
prevent a competitive procurement, those Whitehall Departments have to
go through a proper procurement process and Post Office Ltd would have
to compete with them in the way that happened under the previous
Government, because those are European procurement
rules.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000112">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not doubt that, but my concern is to ensure
that if Post Office Ltd were successful in attaining some of these
potential new services—we really do not know what they are; we
hear whispers and gossip as to what they might be—the Post
Office Ltd budget would not be responsible for developing them. If they
come from the DWP, the DWP budget should be responsible for developing
them for delivery through the Post Office, because there will obviously
be some cost-benefit advantage to DWP for moving them from wherever
they may be at present and placing them with the Post Office. I want to
get that point clearly on the record.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 25
is quite large, but it is important because it delivers a level of
security checks and balances and transparency that we think the Bill
does not have. If the Minister feels that amendment 25 is too onerous,
we will give him as an alternative amendment 34. It has a requirement
for the Secretary of State to simply approve the issue of transfer of
ownership, after which it receives  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 350<a class="bkMark" name="Column350">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the support of both Houses of Parliament by way of simple approval. That
is a very simple mechanism, which should not worry the Minister too
much.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 26
calls for the Bill to be amended to leave out the word
“report” and insert the word “Bill”. This
is familiar ground; there are similarities to earlier amendments tabled
to this clause and amendments tabled to other clauses. None the less,
the amendment is just as important and is just another alternative for
the Minister to consider.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 26
would ensure that the Secretary of State had to produce a Bill on the
disposal, presumably via mutualisation, of the Post Office. At present,
the Secretary of State gets his power to dispose of the Post Office in
this way from this Bill, provided that he lays a report before
Parliament. My hon. Friends and I do not consider that that is
appropriate and we feel very much that, just as amendment 16 would
require in the case of Royal Mail, a Bill with the relevant details of
the mutualisation programme should come before Parliament and receive
Parliament’s consent.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Members of
the Committee may ask why we are going to such lengths again, but I
would respond by saying that we have yet to see any real evidence of
what the mutualisation programme would look like and there is not much
information for the Committee on its structure. We do not know what is
being mutualised. Is it the conceptual business, is it the bricks and
mortar, or is it both elements? How will that mutualisation work when
the Post Office is in the premises of a chain, such as WH Smith, as has
been mentioned by the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe? Again, we
do not know. We would argue that a Bill with those complexities
explained, including how the mutualisation will work alongside a
private sector business such as WH Smith, is necessary. Furthermore, we
do not know how the Post Office is to be mutualised, or indeed
when.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
I am not against mutualisation, I want to say at this point that
mutuals can fail too, and we will discuss that when we consider later
amendments. However, for this new mutual to have the best chance of
survival, we must ensure that Parliament has the ability to scrutinise
the position reached by the Secretary of State.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 29
is less onerous for the Minister. By the end of this clause, I am sure
that he will recognise that my generosity knows no bounds, because we
are giving him so many options that he really should be spoilt for
choice. Christmas is coming early to the Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
amendment 29 would place a duty on the Secretary of State to deliver an
oral statement to Parliament, on which he could then be questioned.
Thereafter, the Secretary of State must lay an order on the proposed
disposal, subject to super-affirmative procedures under section 18 of
the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. The Committee will
recall the use of this level of scrutiny being included in the content
of amendment 17, which we discussed earlier. It is just as important
now as it was then, and it is also important to remind Members of the
level of scrutiny that the amendment would impose on the Secretary of
State’s
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
essence, the procedure demands that there is a 60-day period following
the laying of the order by the Minister, during which the relevant
parliamentary committees may report on a draft order, or either House 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 351<a class="bkMark" name="Column351">&#160;</a>
                           </div>may make a resolution with regard to the draft order. The Minister must
have regard to such reports and resolutions, and to any other
representations made about the draft order. Once that 60-day period has
expired, if the Minister wishes to make an order, with no changes, he
must lay a statement and he may then make an order in the terms of the
draft, if it is approved by a resolution of each House of
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
30 is less onerous than amendment 29, but it would still require the
Secretary of State to make an order in terms of the draft, only if
after 40 days of the order being laid before Parliament the draft order
has been approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament. So again
there will be scrutiny, but it will be less demanding.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally in
this little group of what, seeing as the Minister is keen on giving
amendments a name, I will call “the accountability
amendments”—amendment 27 would simply clarify that, by
making the report that is already contained in the Bill, the Secretary
of State indeed has the power to make the disposal, so that in essence
it is that report that confers the power on the Secretary of State and
not the Bill that we are discussing
today.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again,
although we would be less happy with that proposal, it acknowledges
that the Secretary of State must return to Parliament and produce a
report on the disposal in relation to the agreements reached during the
negotiation process before he receives the power to dispose.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Then there
are amendments 28 and 35. The primary aim of amendment 28 is to ensure
consistency throughout the Bill. Members of the Committee will note
that the concepts in amendment 28 closely mirror those in amendment 26,
so I will not bore the Committee too much by repeating what has already
been said.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

pm<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000349">&#160;</a>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
briefly, the clause as it stands means that the only duty on the
Secretary of State when transferring a Post Office company to a
relevant mutual is that he must lay a report. The vagaries and
arguments against that approach are well rehearsed on this side of the
Committee and we believe it is more appropriate for the Secretary of
State to lay a Bill in the first instance, as we have already
argued.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
35 sets out an additional duty on the Secretary of State when reporting
to Parliament that the report must be subject to the approval of both
Houses on the basis of a motion in the name of the Secretary of State.
Again, that would allow for parliamentary scrutiny and transparency in
the process—something that we have been trying to deliver
through many, if not all, of our amendments to date. It is my firm
belief that both Houses deserve a debate and a vote on the proposals
before the Secretary of State has the power to mutualise any Post
Office company, and we have provided many options for the Minister to
deliver such an accomplishment.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New clauses 3
and 4, which have been touched on briefly, are hugely important. Again,
new clauses 3 and 4 are quite similar to each other. They focus on the
IBA between Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd. Labour Members 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 352<a class="bkMark" name="Column352">&#160;</a>
                           </div>would be happy to see an indefinite IBA between the two organisations.
However, recognising from the Minister’s earlier comments that
he would be most unlikely to agree to that, we again, in the spirit of
flexibility and mutuality, have provided him with two options to try to
rectify what we consider to be a problem. I believe that the current
IBA has about three and a half years left to run, and in light of the
total sell-off of Royal Mail the situation needs some attention very
quickly, hence the tabling of these two new
clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Witness
after witness has recognised the importance of the IBA, from Moya
Greene who—as referred to in this section of the
debate—said that it was unthinkable that the link would be
broken, to George Thomson and even the Minister. Separating the Post
Office from Royal Mail is an unprecedented step and is something that
Mr Thomson said the Government must get right. We would support that
position; the Government must get it right if they are going to do it.
We do not think that the Bill gets it right because it makes no
commitment to any long-term IBA. The National Federation of
SubPostmasters expressed its satisfaction with the last five-year deal
because the business was still going to be under public control.
However, that will not be the case now. So we certainly do not want a
five-year deal; we want something much longer than that. We have no
idea what thoughts are going through the Minister’s head in
relation to what he considers to be
tolerable.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
needs to be a level of security for sub-postmasters that is not
contained in the Bill. Many sub-postmasters are running businesses and
they need to see something beyond three and a half years. That period
is now doubtful because, at the end of it, the organisation may no
longer be in public ownership. Therefore, for that individual
investment—both human and financial—to carry on, there
needs to be something in place on a longer-term basis to enable post
offices to
survive.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
federation is pushing hard for a 10-year deal, and I urge it not to
settle for anything less. Ten years is the lesser period mentioned in
the two new clauses we are talking about. However, arguably, if that is
added to the three and a half years that are already left to run, it
provides a considerable level of commitment to post offices across the
country. As I have mentioned, we suggest that there should be an
indefinite IBA or a 15-year period, which is referred to in the other
new clause that we are discussing. A 15-year period is much better and
would allow a real opportunity for the newly mutualised organisation to
look ahead with some degree of surety to the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have heard throughout the Committee, in witness contributions and
line-by-line scrutiny, that a third of the footfall and revenue that
comes to post offices is through this agreement. It is because of the
IBA with Royal Mail, and we want to keep that as a basis for building
the work up in the future. I do not want to see a privatised Royal Mail
changing its high street outlets to, for example, a deal involving all
our high street banks, or to the banks in conjunction with
supermarkets. The hon. Member for Angus has commented on the fact that
although we may not see it as a likelihood now, that does not mean that
it will not occur. We would like to see some security for an extended
period of time—the 15-year period—to ensure that, during
that time, post offices retain the identity of Royal Mail’s high
street outlets.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
all want to see the longevity of post offices in our community. One of
the best ways to ensure that that happens is to make sure that the IBA
is delivered for an extended and extensive period of time, and we can
do that by accepting new clause 3 or new clause 4. Without that, we are
again putting our faith in the management of Royal Mail, who tell us
that they see it as inconceivable that there would not be a link
between Royal Mail and the Post Office. The Minister has alluded to
something similar. However, the current management of Royal Mail and
the Minister may not always be there, so we need something in the Bill
that creates security for businesses. Remember that that is what these
operations are; they are businesses and they need to look forward. We
need to use the IBA, which provides a third of the footfall and revenue
into post offices, as the basis to move forward over the 10 or 15
years.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that
the Minister sees the importance of securing that extended period as a
fundamental building block for the future. Anything else that the
Government want to do in relation to developing new products through
the Post Office will be playing catch-up, and in some ways, it will all
be put at risk—if that core third of the business, a third of
the footfall, or a third of the revenue were not there, because of the
long-term relationship with Royal Mail. It would be detrimental to the
development of new products, whether they come from the Government or
within Post Office Ltd, if that long-term arrangement did not exist. I
hope that the Minister will take the strength of the argument and
feeling from Opposition Members on board, as well as the strength of
the representations that I am sure he has had from the federation on
the importance of a long-term agreement. I am interested to hear what
he will say, particularly on that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000134">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
4 ensures that two extremely important elements of the
Government’s policy are in place. First, it introduces new
ownership restrictions to allow for the introduction of new capital to
Royal Mail while ensuring that the Post Office is not for sale through
a separation of ownership. Secondly, the clause also opens up the
possibility of a move in due course to mutual ownership of the Post
Office.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments fall roughly into three broad categories. The first group
seeks to add preconditions that must be met before ownership of the
Post Office and Royal Mail can be separated. The second group seeks to
add further preconditions for the transfer of the ownership of Post
Office Ltd to a mutual, and the third group seeks to increase the scope
of the Post Office’s annual reporting requirements. I want to
address the three types of amendment, but before I do so it has become
my custom to name each group of amendments. This is a long group, so it
has been particularly difficult to assess, and the tone of the debate
has been particularly interesting. In a previous sitting, the hon.

so lucrative and attractive that any number of private providers will

first at the concerns about the separation of the Post Office and Royal
Mail, new clauses 3, 4 and 8 suggest that taking Post Office Ltd out of
the Royal Mail Group of companies will put the relationship between
Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail, and therefore the post office network,
at risk. That is the main charge that we face. I have stated throughout
the debate that I believe that that is absolutely not the case, and I
am not alone. I take hon. Members back to the witnesses that we heard
just two weeks ago. The evidence from Richard Hooper, Consumer Focus
and Postcomm shows that they all strongly support the separation of
ownership of the two businesses. We had the independent
expert—first employed by the previous Government—the
leading consumer representative body and the regulator all telling us
that they thought that the separation of the two businesses was a good
idea, and I was heartened by

are these different, independent people so convinced that a separation

That is not because they are in the same corporate structure; they work
well together. Post offices carried over 3 billion transactions from
Royal Mail last year, and a long-term contract will continue because of

absolutely right. The Post Office offers unparalleled coverage across
the length and breadth of the country. It offers a broad range of

others—and it is unsurpassed by any global comparator. As a

The figure of 4,000 has been quoted by a number of hon. Members as a
suggestion of the current number of commercially viable post offices.
She is right—that is the position that we have inherited. We
inherited a post office network that not only saw 7,000 post offices
closed, but has only 4,000 post offices that remain commercially
viable. Working with Post Office Ltd, sub-postmasters, and all those
who care about the post office network, we intend to turn the situation
round. The idea that it can be turned round by passing a regulation or
a law, quite frankly, does not come from the real
world.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000155">&#160;</a>

concerns. Surely he must understand that the concern here is that much
of what is needed to make Post Office Ltd viable has to do with
Government putting more business its way and having other businesses
involved in the Post Office. Let us look at the matter from the other
side: if there were a privatised Royal Mail provider whose sole
business was mail provision, what would it want from the Post Office?
It would want something that provided the mail services that it
needed—something like Fastway in New Zealand or, in many ways,
something not unlike post office local.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000158">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The figure of
4,000 refers to main post offices, as I understand it, where all
services are provided. However, there is a real danger of them being
chipped away at the side, with a private provider looking only at
services that it really needs, which could be provided by someone
else.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000159">&#160;</a>

approach will mean that we do not need to have the closure programmes
that we saw under the last Government is that we are taking a realistic
and commercial approach to the matter, albeit within a public sector or
mutualised model. The post office local model that the hon. Gentleman
talked about in his speech, and which he referred to just now, is a key
part of that, as we said in our post office policy statement. When
someone looks at that statement and the results coming from that
experiment, they will begin to see why we think it is such a good
model.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000160">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
clear findings coming from more than 50 pilots out
there—in urban, suburban and rural areas and in different parts
of the country—is that the average opening hours have increased
by six hours a day. If someone is operating a retail network and trying
to provide services and win contract bids from Government, Royal Mail
or someone else, and if they are able to provide the network and on
average are open for an extra six hours a day, they are operating more
commercially. They are enabling customers to have greater
access.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000161">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The people
whom we are talking about—the hon. Gentleman’s
constituents—will, under our proposals, have greater access to
the post office network, yet I have heard no welcome of that. All I
have heard is the Private Frazer approach. I have heard no welcome of
the fact that the Government, working with POL, are not only putting in
£1.34 billion—a major investment—but getting to
grips with our appalling inheritance from the Opposition. Making sure
that post offices are open longer reduces queues and increases access,
so when the post office network tenders for contracts with a
Department, Royal Mail or whoever, it will be in a strong place to win
those contracts, not just because it can compete on price, but because
it can compete on
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000162">&#160;</a>

do not know what world the hon. Member for Angus has been living in,
but the world of service at some—not all—post offices is
not as good as it should be. That is why the sentimentality we
sometimes hear is so misplaced. I hear from my constituents that they
have to queue for too long, and that the post office is not open when
they are away from work. I hear from them that they have to go to the
post office in the lunch hour because it is open neither before work
nor after it, and they have to queue for very long in that hour. It is
not surprising that people are not going to post offices. We have
inherited a disastrous model that is not providing the sort of service
that people have come to expect. I am confident that we will turn
around the business and ensure that it provides services that people
want, with a level of customer service that people are used to in the
21st century. That is why it will be a financial success, and will
transform the problems that we have inherited from the Labour
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000163">&#160;</a>

in a rural area. I live in the real world, and I have seen what has
happened to post offices over the past few years. I can also see what
might happen under the Bill, though he seems determined to ignore it.
He talks about longer hours; many Tescos are open for 24 hours. How
will that help? Again, he is blindly optimistic that everything will be
okay on the day. I cannot speak for the Labour party, but I am looking
for some realisation that we must ensure that our post offices remain
open, and I am not getting it from the

local model. We want to put money behind it, and it is part of the post
office policy statement. I will tell him what the market research tells
us. The hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire, or perhaps it was
the hon. Member for Llanelli, complained that post office local does
not have all the services that they want and has only 86% of the full
suite of post office services, forgetting that many post offices do not

customers are satisfied with the overall experience of going to a post
office local, and 82% are satisfied with the range of services. I refer
the hon. Member for Angus to pages 12 and 13 of the post office policy
statement, which gives more details of the market research. I am happy

Germany, because we have had some discussion about Deutsche Post, as

thought that he had seen the light about the reality of Deutsche Post.
He seems to think, as he told a Scottish newspaper, that our model is
very different from the Deutsche Post model because in Germany, 30% is
still held via a state-owned bank. For the record, so that he is
absolutely clear, what he fails to appreciate is that the German
legislation for Deutsche Post contains no legislative restriction
requiring the German Government, either by bank or by direct
shareholding, to keep any shares. In other words, Germany uses exactly
the model that we are proposing. The Deutsche Post model, which he is
trying to use against us, is exactly the model in the Bill. I am sure
that he will write to <em>The Scotsman </em>to correct the record. Will

terms between two independent businesses. I would be interested if

Opposition proposals only serve to reiterate why the Government should
not impose on commercial negotiations. Contracts of the duration that
Opposition Members are seeking would not necessarily bolster the
commercial partnership between the two businesses, as they argue, but
could harm it. A 15-year contract that charged Royal Mail extortionate
prices while offering Post Office Ltd no indication of the volume of
business it could expect would be no use to either business. A 10-year
contract that was economical for Royal Mail would satisfy new clause 3,
but could mean that each transaction lost loads of money for Post
Office Ltd. Any proposal that might jeopardise Post Office Ltd’s
commercial interests cannot be accepted. I hope that the Committee will
reject the
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000189">&#160;</a>

should impose such a deal on Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail in the
Bill. As I have said, there is no statutory precedent for that. I have
also made it clear that neither the previous Government nor this one
have become involved in the negotiations between two commercial

not saying anything about the content of the agreement other than the
number of years it should last. If a 10-year deal will be viable when
privately negotiated by Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail, that is no
different from our proposal. We are not saying what the agreement

duration in the Bill misses the point. One negotiates the details, not
the duration, of a contract. In many ways, the duration may be a small
matter for the two parties. I echo the very important words of Donald
Brydon, who told the Committee that, before any privatisation of Royal
Mail, a continued, long-term, commercial contract will be in place
between the two businesses for the longest duration that is
“legally permissible”. That is an extremely strong pledge
by the chairman of Royal Mail and I do not see why the Opposition are
not reassured by it. Perhaps it has something to do with
“Dad’s

do not therefore accept the Labour party’s efforts to talk down
Post Office Ltd. The hon. Gentleman invites me to reflect on the
negotiations that formed the coalition and whether they involved
asymmetry. However, tempting as it is to comment on that point, I think
it would lead me into difficult waters and that you would rule me out

for an inter-business agreement are best left to the businesses, which
know far more than we do. They know their customers, markets, services,
products and past historical relationships. The best contract for both
businesses is likely to come from their work together as they
understand and negotiate the complex interaction between the pricing,
the volume of the business, the duration and many other factors. The
idea that we should put that into law, given the lack of any precedent
and the danger of challenge in relation to anti-competitive practice
and so on, is
absurd.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000196">&#160;</a>

will end after Royal Mail has become a fully privately owned company

Mail. By asking for 10 or 15 years, my hon. Friends and I are arguing

While I have not seen the existing contractual arrangements, for the
reasons I have given, I am aware that they stretch to more than 100
pages of highly specific, commercially sensitive material. I think it

conditions in which the businesses can flourish. That is what we are
hoping to do through the Bill. It is what we are hoping to do by
getting private capital into Royal Mail. It is what we are hoping to do
through the major investment that we are making in Post Office Ltd.
Post Office Ltd is modernising its branches and will have the money to
do so. As we heard from Paula Vennells, the Post Office managing
director, it is developing the post office local model, a model where
branches offer customers much longer opening hours. It is therefore
putting itself in a very attractive place to be a very strong partner
to Royal Mail and, indeed, to Government
Departments.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000204">&#160;</a>

regard to the relationship between Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd and
the asymmetry of power, I found out recently that the Post Office Ltd
board has six people on it, four of whom are from Royal Mail. The
notion that these two organisations are relatively balanced in their
respective reach, strength and power is pushing it a bit. Can he

just made the argument for separation. The problem for Post Office Ltd
and thus for the post office network is that it has never been the
first consideration of the board of the Royal Mail Group. It has always
played second fiddle. Those who are running the Royal Mail Group are
worried about the letters business, because it is the biggest part of
the business. They are worried about the parcels business and so on.
They are worried about how the regulator affects that by its decisions.
Their focus and management attention is on that. Inevitably, the post
office network comes next or even later. Having a separate company
where the board is solely for Post Office Ltd and is focused on the
strategic needs of the business will make a really big contribution to
the successful future of the post office network. That is why I believe
the regulator, Consumer Focus and Richard Hooper backed the proposal
for separation.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000206">&#160;</a>

Group have many other things to consider. Because these are very
different businesses, there is a danger—this may well have
happened in the past—that Post Office Ltd has not had the full

can see why in the past the two groups’ being in the same
organisation could have created issues with Post Office Ltd’s
performance. Putting them into contractual negotiation where Royal Mail
is so much more powerful—even if the Minister’s plans for
Post Office Ltd’s growth come off—makes it difficult for
Post Office Ltd. We on this side of the Committee would be much more
comfortable with what he has said about spinning Post Office Ltd out
from Royal Mail if he put statutory provision for post offices in the
Bill. Then some protection for Post Office Ltd would exist in that
relationship, and we could have the advantages of the separation to

Post Office Ltd are part of the same board and that insufficient

                           </strong> Throughout the debate, I have quoted the chief
executive and the chairman of Royal Mail, and I strongly believe that
Royal Mail would be taking leave of its commercial senses to vacate the
network of 11,500 post offices and allow its competitors to come in
there. That is exactly what its competitors want it to do, and that is
exactly why it will not do so.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000212">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I now turn to
the second category of amendment, particularly amendment 34, amendments
25 to 30 and amendment 35. They seek to put further preconditions on
any move to mutual ownership of the Post Office. Chief among the
preconditions are those of amendment 34, proposed new subsection (8)(g)
of clause 4 in amendment 25, amendments 26 to 30 and amendment 35.
Those provisions seek to require the passage of a further Act of
Parliament, a further order subject to either the affirmative or
super-affirmative procedure, or 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 365<a class="bkMark" name="Column365">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the approval of both Houses of Parliament of a report on the transfer
before any transfer to mutual ownership can be made.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not
believe that those requirements are necessary, because we are now
scrutinising a Bill that contains the necessary provisions. Clause 7
lays down clear parameters for any transfer to mutual ownership, and it
will ensure that the mutual operates within those parameters in the
longer term. Those parameters recognise the Post Office’s unique
social role. They will ensure that the Post Office continues to serve
the public benefit, irrespective of whether it is owned by the
Government or by a
mutual.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
seems to be some misunderstanding about these provisions. The hon.
Member for Llanelli is worried about the lack of an asset lock. She
quoted Peter Holbrook, the chief executive of the Social Enterprise
Coalition, who has suggested that it is necessary to ensure that
mutuals cannot be demutualised and the assets appropriated by private
owners. Clause 7(4) requires the Secretary of State to be satisfied
that a mutual Post Office Ltd cannot dispose of property or rights, if
it is inconsistent with its purpose of acting for the public benefit by
promoting the use of post office services. That is an asset lock of
exactly the sort that Peter Holbrook wanted and, alongside the
ownership restrictions in clause 4, it ensures that further legislation
would be needed before any demutualisation could take place. I want to
make it absolutely clear that the post office network could not be sold
off privately. A mutual post office network could not be demutualised
without another piece of legislation. That is what I call a lock, and I
would have thought that Opposition Members would appreciate that it is
a lock. That is why I do not think that their desire for some more
preconditions before a transfer to mutual ownership is necessary. We
have the policy before us, we have the framework for either a 100%
Crown-owned Post Office network or a relevant mutual and that is what
we should be debating rather than further barriers and further
preconditions.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000215">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for giving way and agree
with him that we should be debating what type of mutual is being
proposed; in the Bill, there is not any sort of proposal about any
variables or options for the mutualism. Would there be front-door
mutualism, in that there would be buying-out of independent post office
holders? Would there be back-door mutualism, where there would be a
redistribution of profits from independent post offices to pay for
currently unviable post offices? Would the mutual itself be able to
sell off assets—in other words, 7,000 other post
offices—to pay for the existing
network?<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000216">&#160;</a>

ago, or at least the last part of that question. However, let me make
clear what is in the Bill. I am keen that hon. Members look at what is
in the Bill, because that is what we are here for. The Bill sets out a
very clear legislative framework for future mutual ownership, which

building on that approach by the way in which we are engaging with the
mutual sector to get its ideas about the best specific model for Post
Office Ltd. We have asked Co-operatives UK to explore how a mutualised
structure could work best in the post office sector. Once it has
reported, which we expect to be by April 2011

we will have a consultation led by the mutual sector itself and not by
Government, so that the sector can consider all the different options,
whether it is a John Lewis-type model, a more co-operative society-type
model or some other model. The sector will come up with options, having
discussed those options with all the key stakeholders, particularly the
National Federation of SubPostmasters but other key stakeholders too.
Then the mutual sector will come back to Government and, assuming that
we get Royal Assent for this Bill, we are making an absolute commitment
that we will consult on our proposals for taking forward a mutual
structure.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000219">&#160;</a>

about wonderful schemes, but the question in everybody’s mind
will be, “Is it going to be viable?” Will the Minister
explain what criteria he will have for that viability before the
mutualisation process can take place? Also, will he say what sorts of
guarantees he will be looking

absolutely right, to the extent that there cannot be an unviable

organically.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000221">&#160;</a>

will not sign up—be they sub-postmasters, or community mutuals
that exist at the moment—to be part of the national mutual,
which is proposed in these clauses, if that national mutual is a
loss-making organisation, and we would not expect them to do so. That
is why I have not suggested at any stage that mutualisation is the
process by which we will make the post office network more viable. I
believe, as I have said at length during our exchanges today, that the
way to do that is by getting more Government services through the
network and by ensuring that the Government are putting in serious
investment to modernise the network.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000222">&#160;</a>

process and through ideas such as post office local, we will get the
post office network—this incredibly valuable social and economic
institution—to be viable and put it in a situation where it
could be mutualised. We will not mutualise it by imposing a model,
because the nature of mutualism is not about the top-down imposition of
models in a Bill or by Government fiat. We have to take people with us,
which is why we have set out the consultation process. The process is
the first not to be led by the Government, and it involves the
Government responding to the mutual sector’s
ideas.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000223">&#160;</a>

offices, which we talked about in the policy statement, will enable
them to generate more revenue than they can at the moment. The reforms
of the post office local model will assist as well—we talk about
taking 2,000 post offices along that route in this time

whether we will have transformed the whole network during that time
scale, but we probably will not have. It takes quite some time to
transform everything—the issues are really quite big—but
we are moving at speed despite that challenge. Transforming a network
that has been shrinking year after year—so much in the past
13 years, leaving just 4,000 financially viable post
offices, according to different experts—cannot be done
overnight. It is a long job, which will require a shoulder to the wheel
and all the tools in the box. The prospect of mutualisation might
galvanise people’s attention and enthusiasm—as might the
investment, post office local, the involvement of local authorities as
we described in the Post Office statement or the new
services—but transformation will require a whole-Government
approach. That is one of the reasons why I am spending so much time
talking to Ministers in other Departments, focusing on how we can bring
life to the front office for government model, which we talk about in

considerations, which is one of the reasons why we need to invest in

contracts. We are confident about what we are doing, whether on a
processing role for the Post Office, identity verification or the
pay-out technology now being implemented. Those generic roles will be
attractive and will put the Post Office in the lead in such
competitions.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000232">&#160;</a>

on, I wish to clarify a point that, when I listen to debates, it seems
is not clear in some people’s minds. When we talk about
mutualising the post office, we mean mutualising Post Office Ltd. That
is the overall national body that operates the franchises, holds the
intellectual property, manages the contracts with Royal Mail and
Government Departments and holds the discipline codes and so on. We are
not saying to private individuals who have invested their capital in
their businesses that we will suddenly take those businesses away and
put them in a mutual. The proposed model is a national mutual model
that will have beneath it at the local level many private businesses,
as it does now. At present, 97% of post offices are run by private
individuals or groups, and that will continue. They will have the
option to become part of the national mutual of Post Office Ltd. I hope
that I have made that clear, and that my explanation will have been of
assistance to those that had not quite grasped the point.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Before
turning to the other aspects of amendment 25, I wish to make a general
point about the amendment’s use of the word
“purchaser”. I do not know whether it was the hon. Member
for Llanelli or the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire who
wrote the amendment, but I make it clear that the Post Office is not
for sale. There will not be a purchaser of the Post Office. Clause 4
explicitly states that the only owners of the Post Office can be the
Crown or a relevant mutual within the parameters of clause 7, to whom
ownership of Post Office Ltd will be transferred by the
Crown.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I turn to the
other preconditions to a transfer sought under amendment 25. Proposed
subsection (8)(a) seeks a written commitment that an employee
representative should be on the board of the mutual; and proposed
subsection (8)(f) seeks a majority vote by staff and stakeholders in
favour of a transfer. The amendment rightly places importance on the
engagement of the work force and stakeholders in the operation of the
Post Office, and I commend it. Any move to mutual ownership must put
the views of employees, sub-postmasters, business partners, communities
and customers first. However, I reiterate what I said in previous
debates, that we should be careful about being prescriptive in
legislation on the governance structure of the mutual.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As we heard
in evidence, we should not impose a rigid mutual structure on the Post
Office from the top down, which is what the amendment would do. That is
why we have asked Co-operatives UK, the national trade body for
co-operatives, to consider the proposal in detail and to consult
sub-postmasters, particularly the National Federation of
SubPostmasters, staff and so on. There are a number of questions that
we want answered. For instance, we want to know precisely who would be
the members of a mutual, and how the governance of a mutual should
work. After Co-operatives UK has sought the views of staff,
stakeholders and experts and reported back to the Secretary of State,
we will then have the public consultation to which we are fully
committed.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000236">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I assure the
Committee that there will be nothing mandatory about mutual ownership.
For example, if a member of staff does not want to engage in the
operation of the business, nothing will oblige that staff member to
join committees or to vote on resolutions. It would be a shame if they
did not become involved, but it is not
mandatory.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000237">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It would be quite wrong if a sub-postmaster
employee were to be penalised for not being involved, but I would have
thought that there would be incentives to become involved. The hon.
Gentleman is trying to tempt me to prejudge what Co-operatives UK
decides and what will be said in the public consultation. Experts on
mutualisation say that we have to engage first with those who are going
to be part of it, and not impose it top down. I will not stand here and
give a set of rules. That would be inappropriate. I believe that we
have a framework that safeguards the public benefit, as well as the
assets through the asset lock. We have the framework required for a
mutual structure; now we want to engage all the key stakeholders and
the public.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000239">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Proposed new
paragraphs (d) and (e) of clause 4(8) seek to make a public
consultation an explicit requirement. I can only repeat that we are
committed to a consultation. Proposed new paragraphs (b) and (c) seek
to ensure that the headquarters of the mutual Post Office will be
located in the UK. I do not think that the provisions are necessary, as
it is highly unrealistic to think that a mutual Post Office would be
headquartered anywhere else. After all, it will be a mutual to promote
the UK public’s use of UK post offices. The point of mutual
ownership is that the key stakeholders—staff, sub-postmasters,
customers and business partners—are more engaged in the running
of the business. All those groups will be UK-based and have a vested
interest in the headquarters being in the UK. It is a flight of fancy
to think that a mutualised post office network would want to be
headquartered outside the UK. I hope that hon. Members will withdraw
the amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000240">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, new
clause 9 seeks to add further annual reporting requirements on the Post
Office to cover Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and greater London.
People throughout the UK, whether they are in Eastbourne or
Enniskillen, Aberdeen or Abergavenny, value the role of their local
post office. I remind the Committee of our proposed requirements for
the annual report on the post office network, which go further than
existing statutory duties. Clause 11(2) will require the report to give
details of the number and location of the company’s post offices
or the network of post offices, whether or not they are owned and
operated by the
company.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000241">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
current annual Postcomm report provides the number of post offices in
each region, including the nations—Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland—and the English regions including London. The Postcomm
report also covers what proportion of those post offices are in rural,
urban and urban deprived areas. That is exactly the sort of information
that we envisage the Post Office will provide when it produces its own
report on the post office network. It includes the number and location
of post offices and their accessibility, and that is what people want
to know about.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000242">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
clause 11 requires the annual report to be laid only before Parliament,
it will be a public document, and I have no doubt that it will be sent
to the appropriate people in the other Assemblies, authorities and
Parliaments across the UK. I hope that hon. Members will agree that our
proposed annual report on the post office

continue to provide details of the geographic spread of the national
network of post offices, broken down as appropriate. It is unnecessary
for separate, duplicative reports to be produced for the Government
bodies proposed in the amendment. I therefore suggest that hon. Members
withdraw new clause 9 and agree that clause 4 should stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000243">&#160;</a>

and 35 all deliver possible means of further scrutiny of the
legislation, because we are concerned that the detail about
mutualisation is not as good as we would like. We have also brought
viability to the Committee’s attention and discussed it at
length. We have discussed trying to get more Government business
without seeing any sign of it and the worry that commercial business is
not taking off. We are disappointed that no post bank was proposed in
the latest announcements, and we are, of course, worried that the IBA
will not be given a proper 10 or 15-year
opportunity.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000244">&#160;</a>

in that way, because I know that she has with her a copy of our policy
statement, which details a lot of the Government services that we

potential for the Post Office to become an umbrella organisation to
provide an end to the electronic Criminal Records Bureau application
service. There are other examples in relation to Jobcentre Plus and
national insurance number applications, the provision of an identity
verification and registration service that would enable public sector
employees to access multiple Government services and so on. I assure
the hon. Lady that we intend to put a huge amount of effort into
ensuring that Government services and pilots to explore those ideas are
taken
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000245">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Well, indeed, but anybody who is running a post
office will want to know where the bankable contracts are. They want to
see contracts stating exactly how much they are going to get for each
type of transaction, because they have to take into consideration the
time that those transactions take. They have to run their businesses,
so they need proper business contracts. There is a lot of talk and
suggestion, but, at the moment, none of that can be taken home by the
post office network and
banked.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000246">&#160;</a>

was that great American film producer, Sam Goldwyn, who said that an
oral agreement is not worth the paper that it is written on. The
remnants of a three-year agreement from the Government is like Faustus
being tempted by Mephistopheles. In the process of creeping
privatisation, three years is as nothing. I say three years because
that might be the remnants of an existing IBA—just long enough
to tempt in the short

almost every business and profession, there are certain phrases,
senses, words and initials the mere mention of which will cause
everyone to nod sagely. Outside that business or profession, these
words, so sacrosanct to the insider, will have absolutely no resonance.
For example, there is the IBA, which is the internal business agreement
by which Royal Mail is required to take all its post office counter
services from Post Office Ltd. The harsh fact is that, once the current
internal business agreement ceases to apply, Royal Mail will be free to
use any partner to supply post
offices.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000256">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One
third of Post Office Ltd’s revenue comes from Royal Mail.
Without that revenue, Post Office Ltd would be unable to keep many post
offices open. That is why the new clauses that we have
tabled—new clause 4, which suggests 15 years, and new clause 3,
which suggests 10 years—are absolutely critical to the survival
of the post office network. With the very greatest of respect to Moya
Greene, it is no good simply having fine words. Those fine words need
to translate into a proper bankable contract—a proper agreement.
Other countries manage to get round these things and put agreements
into their legislation, but the real difficulty here is an intense
obstinacy not to enshrine in legislation protection for

                        <p>Therefore, I cannot see
why the Secretary of State would act unreasonably with such operations.
That takes us back to this morning’s debate on amendment 31, and
I genuinely seek the Minister’s guidance about what the word
“reasonably” adds to the Bill. Will he give us an example
of what information he thinks would be reasonable and what he would
consider unreasonable? Will he tell us what other assistance the
Secretary of State may seek that would be reasonable, and to the same
extent, what would be unreasonable? Is that word in the Bill because he
envisages the current, or future, Secretary of State acting
unreasonably? Will the Minister say what added value there is to the
Bill with the inclusion of “reasonably” in its current
location?<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000315">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This is a probing amendment relating to the
Secretary of State’s powers to acquire information or assistance
from a company, such as Royal Mail or Post Office Ltd, in connection
with making the transfer scheme. I assume that the intention is for the
amendment to remove “reasonably” to give the Secretary of
State wider discretion in respect of what he might require. The
Secretary of State may perhaps at times wish that he could act
unreasonably, but he is always under general a public law obligation to
act reasonably in taking all decisions, so including
“reasonably” in the clause would simply clarify the
status quo—albeit that clarification is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000316">&#160;</a>

him to worry about. “Reasonably” is a standard inclusion

                           </strong> I am grateful for the Minister’s response.
However, there is a public law obligation on the Secretary of State to
act reasonably, so it is strange that the Minister has gone in for a
level of double scrutiny in this instance, when he has refused all
other kind offers of different levels of scrutiny in other parts of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000318">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not for a moment think that, given the way in which the clause is
written, any Secretary of State would ask for unreasonable information.
I should have thought that any information that they may ask for, or
any assistance that they may have asked for in relation to this matter,
would be reasonable and could not therefore be unreasonable. I take the
Minister’s contribution as an attempt to clarify the situation
and as a double level of scrutiny, which we have tried to install in
the Bill at various levels, so I am certainly not going to move that we
remove this double level of scrutiny, especially when it has come from
the Minister’s own fair hand.<a class="bkMark" name="10112358000319">&#160;</a>
