<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we commence, I remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments, including those that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.

<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Regulations imposing a duty on newspaper publishers</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 1, leave out lines 5 to 16 and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1) The Secretary of State shall within one year of the passing of this Act make regulations requiring local authorities to ensure than an increasingly greater proportion of newspapers and magazines produced shall be collected and recycled.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I start by saying what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Brien. I hope that we make swift progress. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) for promoting the Bill. We all share the same objectives; if we disagree, it is only about how they can be achieved.

<P>
The Newspaper Publishers Association and the Government have been engaged in dialogue over a number of years and have set voluntary recycling targets. In 1991, only 28 per cent. of newsprint was being recycled and a target of 40 per cent. was set. We now recycle 52 per cent. of newsprint, which is a 78 per cent. increase. That has had a tremendous impact on the industry, but we must be practical.

<P>
I have always preferred taking a voluntary approach rather than legislating and imposing penalties. That is why I propose deleting subsections (1) and (2). Pushing up the percentage of newsprint to be recycled can cause problems. At the moment, 80 per cent. of recycled material produced in United Kingdom mills is used by the industry and the other 20 per cent. is exported. If we increase that percentage, we shall need more mills. It has been suggested that another one could be built in Aylesford in Kent, but the requirements needed to meet those higher targets are not necessarily in the gift of newspaper publishers. Many others have a part to play. That is the reason for the amendment.

<P>
The Committee may wish to know that the draft heads of agreement between the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the newspaper publishers would increase the recycled content to 70 per cent. by 2006. That agreement is important, because there is not much gap between the percentages set out in the Bill and those of the voluntary agreement. However, the Bill would allow a little more flexibility than the voluntary agreement. The latter would proceed only if the Bill did not. The newspaper publishers and others are keen to continue with their voluntary agreement, and they believe that they and the Department can sort out whatever problems may arise.

<P>
Many details of the draft heads of agreement remain to be worked out, but I believe that it would be a better solution. I hope that the Minister can tell us about the benefits of such an approach compared with the slightly more prescriptive approach suggested by the hon. Member for Pendle. Although the hon. Gentleman's heart is in the right place, the Bill could cause problems for the industry.

<P>
We have been given figures on the costs of the Bill. Some of them are a little unrealistic, but an additional cost to newspaper publishers of £600 million has been suggested. Forcing people to use recycled newsprint has a cost that may apply not only to consumers, but to the industry. That may affect more marginal newspapers and magazines. Britain is blessed with a wide variety of publications, but the prescriptive approach adopted in the Bill might put at risk one or two of the more marginal ones.

<P>
I shall be interested to hear the views of the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) and of the Minister, which I am sure will help the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice </B>(Pendle): I oppose the amendment. First, however, I should like to wish you a good morning, Mr. O'Brien. It is reassuring to see you in the Chair, because I know that you have a long-standing interest in and commitment to environmental and waste management issues. Perhaps more than most people, you would like more of the materials that we use in our everyday life to be recycled rather than diposed of in landfill sites. That is what my Bill is all about.

<P>
I am in a strange position, as the Bill has arrived in Committee after passing through Second Reading unopposed. It has enormous support and has been championed by Friends of the Earth, which has given me a tremendous amount of help on the details. More than 300 hon. Members have signed an early-day motion in support of the Bill in this Session. Sixty local authorities, including that of the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms), support the Bill. It is also supported by industry bodies such as the Independent Waste Paper Processors Association, Waste Watch and the Community Recycling Network.

<P>
The background to the Bill was discussed exhaustively last Wednesday in Westminster Hall in a debate initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Taylor). Important contributions were made by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) and others. I do not need to explain all the background details again as they are already on the record.

<P>
The amendment would shift responsibility for the collection of increasing quantities of newsprint to local authorities. I suspect that many Labour Members would strongly oppose the transfer to local authorities of responsibility for recycling. Such an approach is contrary to the principle of polluter pays, which is supported by all parties. The amendment would impose on local authorities a burden to collect paper without any guarantee on the market for it. Local authorities are already facing problems in trying to sell their collected newsprint, so I believe that the proposed mechanism could be a retrograde step.

<P>
As the hon. Member for Poole said, his approach contrasts with subsections (1) and (2), which would provide local authorities with much-needed money for the increase in recycling by making newspaper and magazine publishers responsible for ensuring that a proportion of old newspapers and magazines were recycled at the end of their life. Similar provisions apply to packaging companies under the regulations that implement the EU directive of packaging. The Government's advisory committee on packaging recommended in its July 1998 report that newspapers should be covered by obligations on producers to collect and recycle. Similar producer responsibility approaches are being followed for an increasing range of goods. Proposals for cars are progressing in Europe with Government support and there are similar proposals for electrical goods. The approach in the Bill has proved popular with local authorities and 70 have signed up to it.

<P>
The hon. Member for Poole mentioned in passing the draft heads of agreement that the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the newspaper publishers have apparently struck up in the past 24 hours. I know little more than he does and I wait for the Minister to enlighten us about the details. It is laudable that the newspaper publishers have moved so far, but the agreement is still only a draft and is not mandatory. That brings us back to where we started: should we adopt a voluntary approach that relies on good intentions?

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> If the Government were to conclude a more detailed agreement, would the hon. Gentleman consider withdrawing the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> I wait to hear what the Minister says, but I intend to allow the Bill, as amended, to continue to Report stage. The Government could table amendments then if they wished. I have no intention of withdrawing the Bill at present.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): We welcome the intention of the Bill and are happy to support it in Committee. While the primary intention of the Bill's promoter clearly relates to landfill, recycling brings about subsidiary benefits of a broader environmental nature, including the saving of carbon emissions and reductions in energy use. An implied-or perhaps explicit-criticism made by the Newspaper Publishers Assoication is that newsprint imports might be attracted into the UK market. The landfill problem might not be solved, but there would still be net benefits to the environment.

<P>
The newspaper recycling market is volatile. It has been a cause of concern and pain for 20 or more years to those of us who have sometimes had garages full of newsprint that we could not get rid of, while at other times ridiculously high prices have been paid. One benefit of the Bill and of any stronger agreement to emerge from the negotiations that have been mentioned would be the evening out of irregularities in that volatile market.

<P>
I support what the hon. Member for Pendle said about the producer paying. I presented the Retail Packing Recycling Bill, which is a parallel attempt to make packaging sold over the counter the retailer's responsibility in many instances. That principle is a key element of developments in the broader sphere of pollution control, the chemical industry and a range of major industries and is an appropriate basis for the Bill.

<P>
As to the relative merits of clause 1 and amendment No. 4, I remind the hon. Member for Poole that according to the Newspaper Publishers Association, the relevant recycled content was 28 per cent. in 1991, 40 per cent. by 1996 and 52 per cent. by 1998. The Bill makes more modest proposals. Although the publishers might not be happy with where it places the obligation, the targets in clause 1 would become more onerous than current reality only in 2015. We should not pay undue attention to the more extreme concerns.

<P>
The Bill is good in general terms. Clause 1 sets realistic targets and it places the responsbility where it should be. I wish it a speedy passage.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) on his Bill. It provided a welcome stimulus to our negotiations with the Newspaper Publishers Association, the details of which I shall outline in a moment.

<P>
The Government support the underlying objective to increase the recycling of newspapers and magazines in the United Kingdom. Some 1.4 millions tonnes of waste newspapers are landfilled each year. That is unacceptable and we are anxious for the situation to change. Increasing the recyling of newspapers and magazines could have a considerable impact, not only on the amount of waste landfilled, but on the viability of local collection infrastructures. However, we are far from convinced that a legislative approach is right.

<P>
The Bill's targets take no account of the practical contraints on recycling activity and recycled content, including the key issues of mill capacity in the UK and increases in circulation. Both are outside the control of newspaper and magazine publishers, but it is widely accepted that they can have significant impact on the ability to achieve targets. For that reason, we prefer the voluntary approach. If offers the flexibility to respond to changing circumstances in a way that legislation, especially primary legislation, cannot. Those who are sceptical of the voluntary approach should remember, as the hon. Member for Poole, said that it has paid off in the past decade. In 1991, 28 per cent. of newsprint was recycled. That figure is now about 52 per cent. Let no one say that, properly managed, the voluntary approach does not work. It does and we expect that to continue.

<P>
We have been working with the Newspaper Publishers Association to develop an agreement. Those negotiations are now successfully concluded. Newspaper publishers have agreed to commit themselves to the following targets: 60 per cent. recycled content by the end of 2001, which is more substantial than the target proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle; 65 per cent, recycled content by the end of 2003, which is the same target as in the Bill; and 70 per cent. by the end of 2006, which is also the same as in the Bill. However, the Bill goes further than the agreement by setting a target of 80 per cent. recycled content by 2010, but there is nothing to stop a higher target being set after a review.

<P>
The agreement acknowledges that even with the firm intention of newspaper publishers, there may be factors beyond their control. The targets will therefore be subject to review next year and to a further review at the end of 2003. The reviews will take into account the following factors. First, they will take account of the availability of additional reprocessing capacity, which depends on whether a decision to increase investment is reached this year. Secondly they will have regard to the growth in consumption of newsprint, which is currently about 2.5 per cent. Thirdly, the quality of recycled newsprint will be considered. Quality is especially important if the production process has been hindered-you will be aware, Mr. O'Brien, that newsprint must contain a particular amount of fibre to be usable-or if the produced has been damaged. Finally, the reviews will cover any uncompetitive pricing of recycled newsprint by suppliers, which would arise if the cost of recycled material greatly exceeded that of virgin material.

<P>
The reviews will be conducted on the basis of an understanding that the objective of the agreement is to achieve high and rising recycled content of United Kingdom newspapers and a reaffirmation by newspaper publishers of their commitment to continue to achieve the most stringent targets compatible with any newly arising factors that may be beyond the industry's control. Publishers and the Government will carefully monitor the amount of recycled content. My Department will establish its own system of validation so that we will not have to depend solely on figures provided by the industry. The voluntary approach has produced dividends so far and I am confident that it will continue to do so.

<P>
In the light of the outcome of the negotiations, which were stimulated by the Bill, and our clearly stated preference for a voluntary agreement, we cannot support the Bill on Report. Today's discussion may be a little academic in that respect, but I welcome the opportunity provided by this debate to explore in more detail some of the aspects of the Bill about which we are concerned and to explain further our approach. For sceptics of the voluntary approach, I should add that we do not rule out the possibility of legislation if the voluntary agreement fails. Even without the Bill, it would be open to us to achieve its objectives through the existing producer responsibility powers contained in the Environment Act 1995.

<P>
The aim of the amendment appears to be to shift from newspaper and magazine publishers to local authorities the responsbility for carrying out the Bill's requirement to increase the collection and recycling of newspapers and magazines. It provides for two separate sets of targets; the first concerns the collection and recycling of newspapers and magazines, while the second relates to the recycled content of newspapers. The Government are not convinced that it is necessary to place two separate obligations on newspaper and magazine publishers in order to achieve the objectives of the Bill. Our view has always been that the targets in subsection (3) for the recycled content of newspapers represents the better fit with the core activities of newspaper and magazine publishers. That is why our voluntary agreement with the publishers focuses only on those targets.

<P>
However, the amendment represents a move away from the principle of producer responsibility, which underlies our approach to the increase of newspaper recycling. Local authorities have a clear part to play in our strategy for tackling waste and their role will be made clear when the strategy is published, which will happen shortly. Those who produce the materials that become waste also have a role. We share my hon. Friend's wish to focus on the role of producers in dealing with waste newspapers and magazines. We do not wish to shift the emphasis to local authorities. To place such an additional burden on them would also have significant expenditure implications, which would be difficult for them to meet from existing budgets. The lack of collection infrastructure reflects that. There is a technical problem in that the amendment would remove the power of the Secretary of State to make regulations covering the recycled content targets set out in subsection (3). That would go further than even the hon. Member for Poole intended. In view of that, I must ask him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am glad that the Minister spent time addressing the amendment. It was tabled principally to engender debate; as we all appreciate, Second Reading took only a few seconds. The debate has been useful. What the Minister said was interesting and, on that basis, I shall shortly beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> I have a few general observations on what the Minister told us. I am gratified that he considers my Bill to be a spur to action. It was unfortunate that the agreement was concluded less than 24 hours before we met in Committee. The ink is not dry on the agreement and I do not have a piece of paper telling me what is in it. The Minister alluded to several issues and I would like to pick up on one or two of them.

<P>
The Minister noted that several issues would be considered in the two reviews. One of them was mill capacity. My hon Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw) got very excited about that last Wednesday in Westminster Hall. One of the factors to be taken into account, according to the draft heads of agreement between the Department and the NPA, is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The availability of additional reprocessing capacity, which is dependent on whether a decision to increase investment is reached this year.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not sure what that means. The publishers will decide by the end of the year whether to increase reprocessing capacity. Is the decision linked to the provision of any lubricating cash grant from the Government? I would be interested to know.

<P>
The other issue concerns the famous waste strategy. I have listened to Ministers promise on three or four occasions in the past month that the strategy would be published ``shortly''. That was the exact formulation that I heard from my hon. Friend the Minister. It would be helpful if he could firm up a publication date-the strategy is clearly germane to the debate.

<P>
<B>Mrs Helen Brinton </B>(Peterborough): I am pleased that my hon. Friend has introduced a useful and timely Bill and has mentioned the waste strategy. It would be opportune for me to mention that I put in a formal question yesterday, for response on May 2nd, regarding the date on which the Government would publish their waste strategy. I look forward to the reply that I will get.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I will try to help on those points. It is true that mill capacity is central to the ability of publishers to recycle. The decision is primarily one for the private sector; it might want to consider the agreement that we have reached as a factor in calculating whether there is a sufficient basis for expanding recycling. Aylesford Newsprint has plans for investment. Lubricating cash from the Government, to use the phrase of my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle, is always a possibility, but I am not in a position to announce any today. The same goes for the waste strategy. That will be published soon, although I am unable to announce when, so my hon. Friends will have to contain themselves for a little longer, frustrating though that might be.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 1, leave out lines 17 to 29 and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) Newspaper publishers shall be required, in close co-operation with the government, to continue to achieve stringent targets compatible with factors beyond the control of the industry.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 26, leave out from ``regarding'' to the end of line 29 and insert `-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the definition of the publications to which the requirements apply;<P>

<P>
Government Amendment No. 2.

<P>
Amendment No. 3, in clause 2, page 2, line 14, leave out subsection (2)

<P>
New clause 1-Offences and penalties-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. Any person who fails to comply with section 1(2), 1(3) or 2 shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable-<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum; or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> When the Minister read out the heads of agreement, he mentioned certain topics that should be taken into account in meeting targets. The included the availability of additional reprocessing capacity, which is dependent on whether a decision to increase investment is reached this year. That is important, because there is little point in increasing recycled use if we have to import from abroad, which will not help us to reduce the amount that goes into landfill. The growth in consumption of newsprint, currently about 2.5 per cent. a year, is also dependent to some extent on the growth of the economy. That can vary, but it is a material fact in our ability to meet targets.

<P>
The quality of recycled newsprint available is another important factor-in particular, whether it significantly hinders the production process and damages the product. There are concerns that some of the fibre produced is unsuitable for the machinery and there are already problems with providing sufficient capacity to de-ink some newsprint. The uncompetitive pricing of recycled newsprint by suppliers is another factor. It would be unfair to make newspaper producers pay through the nose for their product as a result of having to meet a prescriptive target.

<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> I oppose amendment No. 5, which would require the Government and the industry to meet targets set in consultation. That takes us to the heart of the Bill. I know that the Minister, in conjunction with the industry, reached an agreement yesterday, which sets targets that I described earlier as laudable. The NPA deserves a pat on the back, but the question remains of whether the agreement is binding and whether it will deliver the targets set out in the Bill.

<P>
Some caveats have been mentioned, including mill capacity, the anticipated growth in newsprint consumption and the technical difficulties that might arise from manufacturing newspapers from an ever-increasing quantity of material. We must also consider whether the market could be destabilised by the uncompetitive pricing of recycled newsprint by suppliers. The industry knows which way the wind is blowing. The industry-in conjunction with the Government, if help is forthcoming-will be prepared to expand existing mills or construct new facilities. The NPA said as much recently. The International Institute for Environment and Development issued an interim report in June 1999 to the Newspaper Publishers Association. I have not seen the whole of it-indeed, I do not think that the NPA has released it. I have no doubt that the Bill will spur the industry into action, because there is money to be made. The paper is there and can be recycled. If there is an increase in capacity, lost of objectives can be satisfied simultaneously. I hope that the Committee rejects amendment No. 5.

<P>
Amendment No. 1, which I have tabled, makes it clear that regulations made under the Bill should cover the definition of the publications to which the Bill applies, the calculation of the minumum recycled content and the monitoring processes. I do not intend my Bill to ensnare publications such as church magazines and school newspapers. That would be absurd, although I hope that they are printed on recycled paper. Monitoring processes are very important, as are the definitions of how recycled content is calculated. The amendments offer the flexibility to change the processes if circumstances change, perhaps with the advent of more advanced monitoring processes or better communications. I hope that the Committee supports the amendment.

<P>
Amendment No. 3 and new clause 1 would apply the offences and penalties specified to persons who contravene the recycled content targets in subsection (3), the producer responsibility targets in subsection (2) or the labelling requirements in clause 2(1). In the Bill as printed, the penalties apply only to those who contravene the labelling requirement. That clear lacuna would be corrected by the new clause. I hope that the Committee will support my amendments and my new clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The amendments are all linked to the targets for the recycled content of newspapers. Amendment No. 5 would make some of the subsequent amendments unnecessary. I have already mentioned the Government's concern that the targets in the Bill might prove impossible for newspaper publishers to achieve, through no fault of their own. I therefore have some sympathy with the amendment. However, I do not see how the proposed text would work in practice. The concept of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>stringent targets compatible with factors beyond the control of the industry<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would need to be carefully defined-although it may not be possible to arrive at any definition. Such difficulties are the reason why we have sought a voluntary agreement with the newspaper publishers rather than legislating. In view of our concerns about the practicality of the amendment, I hope that the hon. Member for Poole will withdraw it.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 relate to matters that should be dealt with in regulations made under the Bill. Amendment No. 2 was tabled by the Government. We propose that the definition of recycled fibre should be included in regulations. That reflects our more general concern about the absence of properly defined terms in the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Pendle clearly shares our concerns, because in amendment No. 1 he proposes that the publications covered by the Bill should also be defined in regulations. That would give scope to ensure that the newsletters and magazines published by many voluntary organisations, which he referred to a moment ago, will not be caught by the Bill. We welcome that and we also welcome in principle the proposals that the methodology for calculating the recycled content should be placed in regulations. However, amendment No. 1 does not cover all the detailed definitional issues raised by the Bill. We wish to consider the proposal further, with a view to bringing forward more comprehensive amendments on Report, should that prove necessary. On that basis, I ask my hon. Friend not to press his amendment.

<P>
The proposals in amendment No. 3 and new clause 1 to set out in the Bill the enforcement arrangements and the penalties for non-compliance seem to be an improvement on the previous approach of covering such matters in regulations. However, we have reservations about the new clause. I shall outline our views on clause 2 later, but we do not support the linking to a criminal penalty of the obligations that the Bill would place on publishers. That would be disproportionate to the likely benefit of the Bill. While we would like to give further consideration to amendment No. 3, which would remove the penalty form clause 2, I do not support new clause 1.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
