<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> We turn to clause 20 in chapter II, which deals with exclusion or restriction of access. The first two amendments in the group relate to clause 20, and the third and fourth relate to clause 21. Their purpose is to enable exclusion or restriction of access to part of the land in question, as well as its totality. All members of the Committee will agree that we must make the Bill as workable as possible. At the same time, we must maximise the benefit to those who own and occupy the land, and those who seek access for recreational purposes. The amendments go to the heart of that aim.
<P>
We contend that closure of part of an area of access land ought not to count as closure of the entire area. The Bill should be so structured that it is in the interests of the owner or manager of the land to keep open as much land as possible for as long as possible. As such, the definitions of closure should encourage landowners to change the nature of access, but in a way that will not necessarily forfeit one of the precious 28 days of closure time that the Bill will grant.
<P>
Members of the Committee will be aware that we shall discuss the 28-day limitation and other limitations in due course, so I shall not go into that now. However, even if we assume that those limitations will endure, the Bill could be changed in a way that would increase the quantum of access land available, and the period for which it is available. In that respect, we are at one with the Government. The Minister said several times that he wants the Bill to be flexible. The amendments would introduce a new element of flexibility that would encourage landowners to allow greater access for longer periods.
<P>
As a practical example, where access to a moor is restricted because burning or shooting is taking place on a small part of it, it might be possible to grant access to the rest. Clearly, it would be unfortunate and unnecessary to close hundreds of acres of access land where only a relatively small area was needed for burning or shooting. The amendment recognises that land mapped as access land should be closable in part as well as in whole. As such, the amendment facilitates an interpretation of the Bill that will encourage opening and co-operation.
<P>
We seek greater clarity by eliciting the Under-Secretary's views on this suggestion, and we also seek greater flexibility. Landowners should be encouraged to allocate their 28 days—or whatever limitation is decided on—in a way that that will not seem onerous. They should be allowed the flexibility to manage land in a sensible way, while allowing the maximum degree of access. I trust that the Under-Secretary will accept that the amendment would increase the quantum of access, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> We share the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) that landowners should have the flexibility to close or restrict access to land as circumstances require. As he suggests, that might mean that different parts of an estate would need to be closed on different days, for example, when shooting takes place on different parts of a moor on consecutive days. Equally, while one parcel of land might need to be closed for a few days, perhaps for heather burning, there would be no need to close the rest of the estate. We see no reason why an entire estate should be closed simply to allow land management activities to take place in one small part of it.
<P>
We share the hon. Gentleman's concerns, and we have ensured that they are reflected in the Bill. Chapter II generally refers to the restriction or exclusion of access to any land. That can therefore already apply to any area or parcel of land subject to the provisions of chapter II. An owner of land, or anyone with a right to apply for a direction under chapter II, need not seek to close or restrict access to all land within his control. It is both sensible and reasonable to provide this flexibility in the Bill and we believe that the provision will help to ensure that land management needs are met. The Bill already achieves the objective that the hon. Gentleman seeks, and I therefore invite him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that explanation. I want to tie him down on some specific issues, to ensure that we are talking about the same thing.
<P>
If only 300 acres of a 1,000-acre grouse moor were shot over at any one time, there would obviously be no need to close or restrict access to the remaining 700 acres while the shoot took place. Would it be possible to apply the provisions of the Bill to parts of the land involved, so that, in that example, three sections of the moor might each be closed for 28 days while the rest of the land remained open? Could each of the three sections count as a separate area of land, under the 28-day provision?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes, that is precisely what we are saying. We are probably at one on this issue. The Bill already does what the hon. Gentleman wants it to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> In that case, I am very grateful for the Under-Secretary's reassurance, which I am happy to accept. That is precisely what we sought to achieve, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 20 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 21</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exclusion or restriction at discretion</center></H4>
of owners and others
 Mr. David Heath (Somerton and Frome): I beg to move amendment No. 476, in page 11, line 32, after `authority', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and to any other entitled person in respect of that land'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 21 deals with the arrangements for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Exclusion or restriction at discretion of owner and others.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Under-Secretary could assist the Committee by explaining the qualifications that will enable one to become an entitled person in the context of the clause, because
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any other person having an interest in the land and falling within a prescribed description<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
could cover a wide multiplicity of personages. If they are all to have the right of closure, it is inevitable that there will be competing claims. At the very least, there should be a requirement for any notification to the relevant authority in accordance with the regulations to be made available to other people who have an equal claim on the land by virtue of their interest in it. Amendment No. 476 addresses exactly that issue.
<P>
There is a view that the entitled person in this context should be the primary user of the land, whether that be the owner or someone who has an agricultural tenancy or shooting rights, where that is the primary use of the land. The clause could create confusion and lead to conflicting claims. That is not in the interests either of people who want to use the land for recreational purposes or for those who gain their living from the land. The Bill should, therefore, provide for a system that deals with all entitled people on the same basis.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> As I have learned to expect, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) has proposed an interesting amendment. It has prompted us to think again about whether those who will have absolute discretion to restrict or exclude access should be expected or, indeed, required to inform more people than just the relevant authority—that is, the Countryside Agency or the Countryside Council for Wales or, in the case of a national park, the national park authority. I should explain that the purpose of the requirement for notice in clause 21(1) is to ensure that any discretionary closures or restrictions are properly notified to the relevant authority in order for them to have effect.
<P>
I understand and share the hon. Gentleman's wish to ensure that those with interests in the land are informed of actions that may affect them. That is a perfectly reasonable principle. The proposal that those entitled to use discretionary closures should be obliged to notify any other entitled person of their intention to exclude or restrict access is, therefore—at first sight—attractive. However, we need to be clear about the circumstances in which such a requirement would be justified. For example, the issue is likely to arise only if the 28 days had been apportioned between different people. That could happen, of course, if there were separate shooting rights, for example in a case in which the 28 days has been apportioned between a tenant farmer and someone holding separate shooting rights. I am not persuaded that there will be a need for the farmer to tell those with shooting rights that the land will be closed to the public. To those with shooting rights, it would not matter when the land, or part thereof, was closed by the farmer. Similarly, it is difficult to see why a tenant farmer would need to know that people were not allowed onto the land for a period because shooting was taking place. Of course, I am not against communication. There is nothing to prevent the different parties from informing each other, and we would expect that to happen often, in practice—for example, one party might agree to look out for people who breach the closure.
<P>
On balance, I am not persuaded that we need a provision along the lines suggested by the hon. Gentleman. As I have said, we wish to apply a light touch, in terms of the burden on those who will administer the system of closures, but equally, we wish to avoid adding what might be a significant burden for landowners and others who wish to close the land or otherwise restrict access under their discretionary entitlement. We certainly, and here I agree with the hon. Gentleman, wish to encourage good practice, but we believe that that should be achieved through the agreement of the parties concerned rather than by compulsion. Again, we sympathise with the objectives of the amendment. We strongly support good practice, but believe that it is over-bureaucratic to make it compulsory. On those grounds and having listened to the argument, I ask the hon. Gentleman to seek to withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I hear what the Minister says. He has done me the credit of saying that the amendment raises some interesting points, as I believe it does. I certainly do not want to introduce an over-bureaucratic system and I am wary of any regulation that requires people to notify a large number of other people of what they intend to do, because it is so easy to find that one is guilty of an error of omission rather than of commission. That is why I drafted the amendment with some care.
<P>
However, a difficult situation could arise in relation to apportionment, with which I am not sure that subsection (5) deals. It makes assumptions about the way in which apportionment will work. I have difficulty in understanding the precise mechanism by which disputes would be settled. If there were no clear agreement about the apportionment of the prescribed closures, it would be a matter of great importance to more than one entitled person—as the clause puts it—to the land to know what closures another entitled person was making on the same piece of land, because it might severely restrict their ability to operate their business in an orderly way.
<P>
I do not know whether, before I sit down, the Minister can help me on how he sees that subsection working in this instance and how one would deal with a dispute between interested parties, but surely sharing information about intention is the first step in resolving any dispute. It would be the worst thing in the world if, after the Bill was passed, somebody applied for a closure and that conflicted with the views of another interested party, who had no knowledge about it, on what should happen on the same piece of land, and one ended up with an unholy dispute. The Minister looks as if he may be about to intervene. It would be helpful if he did.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am always prepared to assist the hon. Gentleman, but on this occasion I am not sure that I can go further than what I have said. I accept that there are occasions when it is clearly important that there is communication between the parties to ensure that others with an interest in the land are properly informed. However, should one require by statute that on all such occasions communication between the parties should be compulsory? It is the balance between those approaches that is so difficult to strike.
<P>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument, but on balance, because it is not a black-and-white issue, we believe that it should be left to good practice and should not be made a compulsory requirement in every case, when it is often unnecessary and would not have effect, but would be a substantial extra burden.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his intervention. I am not sure that he has made things terribly clear for me, but I am sure that that is because of a lack of understanding on my part rather than a lack of clarity on his.
<P>
We may need to look again at who is an entitled person. Will a register be kept for each portion of land showing who the entitled people are who may or may not have rights of closure on that land? Will it be available for public inspection so that all parties are aware of those who have an entitlement or a claim to entitlement on that land? I leave that to the Minister to ponder. We may need to return to it at a later stage. However, for the moment, we need not go further into the quicksands of that debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 436, in page 11, line 34, leave out `access'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 437 to 449, 452 and 456.
<P>
The amendment, and those that are grouped with it, will permit directions to be made in anticipation of land becoming access land. There may be some areas —perhaps only a few—where public access to land needs to be restricted from the start. The. amendments will enable the necessary directions to be in place before the right of access commences. Similarly, individuals or organisations who wish to dedicate access over their land, using the powers in clause 16, may wish to ensure, for example, that annually recurring restrictions are in place to protect sensitive plants during the spring, before they execute the instrument of dedication.
<P>
The amendments will achieve that purpose by enabling directions to be made in respect of any land, rather than access land specifically, and landowners to give notice of their intention to exclude or otherwise restrict access to any land in the exercise of their discretion under clause 21. Amendments Nos. 441 and 444 will introduce new subsections 22(4) and 23(5) to ensure that the relevant authorities do not need to act on applications where there is no likelihood that the land will become access land.
<P>
That may sound somewhat esoteric. It may help if I discuss some of the conditions to which the amendment might apply and give three examples. The first involves the situation in which a conclusive map has not been issued but a provisional map shows the land to be access land and a direction is required to be effective from day one. The second example involves the situation in which the statutory right of access of a kind that is specified in clause 15 is likely to be terminated or revoked, and restrictions are required to be in place when the right of access under the new regime kicks in. For example, the landowner may revoke a deed of dedication under section 193 of the Law of Property Act 1925, or the local authority may terminate an access agreement under part V of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The third example involves the situation in which the Secretary of State for Defence revokes military byelaws over training lands, but requires continued restriction of public access under clause 26.
<P>
The power will be used on relatively few occasions, but the matter is important enough for us to propose amendments to deal with it. I hope that Committee members agree to the amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or, if the land is closed for the purposes of shooting, does not exceed forty'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> We come now to a matter that has caused considerable concern among many people who have interests in the land that will be designated as access land.
<P>
The clause allows exclusions to be effective for a period of 28 days. We assume that that derives from the permitted development order figure of 28 days. If that is not so, I assume that the Minister will explain where it came from. However, the figure's origin is relatively immaterial—what matters is whether it is sufficient. Amendments Nos. 283, 216 and 217 examine various aspects of that issue. Much of what I say will also apply when we debate the next group of amendments.
<P>
It is appropriate to begin by considering the kinds of activities that, when they take place on access land, will require the land to be closed off in order to enable them to take place or to ensure the safety of the public, possibly including walkers. Shooting has frequently been mentioned, and clearly some access land will be prime grouse-shooting country. It is commonplace for shooting to take place on parts of a moor for two days a week throughout the season. When we debated the issue of parts of a moor in relation to clause 20, the Minister's response was helpful. Perhaps that will be constructive in finding a solution to this problem. A period of 28 days is not adequate to cover the total length of time that could be required for conventional grouse shooting—especially if it takes the form of walking up behind dogs rather than driven shooting, which may take place a little less frequently.
<P>
Many other activities may be involved. For example, heather burning, which takes place on many moors, is generally recognised to be an essential aspect of the management of the moor—not only for grouse, but for all the fauna that live on the land. Bracken spraying from the air is another commonplace activity that has to take place. Deer control—of red deer or, as is more likely in England and Wales, roe deer—requires not only non-disturbance, but regard for the safety of walkers.
<P>
Farming activities, such as lambing or calving, are also necessary. Some hill breeds of cows can be particularly vicious towards uninitiated walkers who encounter them on the moor when they are calving. Stock gathering may happen two, three or four times a year for the purposes of marking or drafting for market, for example.
<P>
A great deal of activity may take place on some access land, and I have grave concerns about the inadequacy of the 28-day period. For example, in terms of shooting, the British Association for Shooting and Conservation has pointed out that 32 days of closure, on average, would be required for a grouse moor and 40 days for pheasant and partridge shooting, which might take place on lower ground.
<P>
Before I move on from the subject of shooting, I remind the Minister that in some parts of the country it is a critically important part of the local economy. It has been estimated that expenditure on shooting in the United Kingdom amounts to some £653 million a year and that about 26,000 full-time jobs are dependent on it. In addition, as we have discussed, gamekeepers often manage large areas of land that is designated for conservation or landscape purposes, including SSSIs and so on.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): My hon. Friend seems to presume that sport shooting does not count as land management under clause 22. If that is his presumption, what does he think about the culling of red deer hinds, which clearly constitutes land management, but also involves shooting?
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely right to point that out. We shall consider land management later and I have tabled amendments to try to ascertain what it is under the Bill. I do not include shooting under land management, but I referred to deer control as part of what I am discussing. Deer control often takes place later in the year, but on the same land as grouse shooting.
<P>
Amendment No. 283 would extend the 28-day period to 90 days. The Minister may say that that is wholly unacceptable, but the principle that we are trying to establish is that 28 days is equally unacceptable if there is not to be a deleterious effect on all those with an ordinary interest in access land.
<P>
Another aspect relates not to the various activities that I have described, but to a landowner wanting to use the land for another activity that is not covered by the Bill. For example, I have visited some hills in Derbyshire, which will be designated open country where paragliding is a common activity. If the owner wants to allow a paragliding or hang gliding weekend when the thermals are suitable, he should have the right to do so, and should be able to charge for the privilege of access for that purpose if he so wishes. That is another activity that will need to be covered by the 28-day period because there is a safety issue. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for walkers to be in the vicinity when hang gliding or paragliding taking place. Those two recreational activities are mutually exclusive.
<P>
Amendments No. 216 and 217 adopt a slightly different approach, which is to increase the period to 40 days if the land is closed for shooting. If land were not used for shooting, 28 days would be adequate, but if shooting does take place 28 days would not be adequate and 40 days would be required. That approach in the amendments would ensure the continued, unparalleled management of some of our upland areas by enabling the generation of resources to help it to happen. If the Bill discourages or prevents landowners from shooting activities—I hope that it will not—the impact would be on that piece of land because the income that is used to manage it would be lost. I hope that the Government will not miss the crucial point that land management is cyclical. Shooting generates considerable resources, much of which is ploughed back into managing the land so that it will continue to generate resources in years to come.
<P>
Another aspect that I want to raise relates to what happens now. The Government have often said that there is already access to parts of the country and that there are footpaths all over open land—or what will be classified as open land. I have witnessed on numerous occasions the fact that, if access is restricted to linear footpaths, it is easier for landowners to deal with the necessary closures or diversions when the relevant activities are taking place. For example, a couple of stewards who are posted on footpaths on each side of the area in which a shoot is taking place simply say to people who are approaching, ``I would prefer it if you did not walk up this path for the next hour or so because shooting is taking place nearby.'' With open access, on the other hand, people could appear from any quarter of a moor, or from any part of the circumference of the area in which an activity is being carried out, making it impossible to inform people that they may be running risks if they go on to that land. That critical matter needs to be dealt with properly.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary does not suggest that we are taking the landowners' side in this important matter, or trying to damage or jeopardise the Bill's aim of securing greater access. We are not. We want to strike the right balance between the rights of walkers, which is what the Bill is all about, and the rights of landowners, farmers, shooting tenants and everyone else who has an interest in the land. That is the central point of this and the next group of amendments, which we shall discuss presently.
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that the proposals would involve the ability to close off part of the land, which is a step forward, and he gave a helpful explanation, but that is not enough to stop me from pursuing the matter. The Government should recognise that 28 days will not be adequate in some cases. The activities that I described will take place at different times of the year on the same land and, occasionally, 28 days will not be enough.
<P>
Some of the activities that I described are weather dependent. We should not say, ``There is a set number of days, and an activity should be squeezed in here or there.'' The wind may be blowing in the wrong direction, or it may be pouring with rain, and one may not be able to burn one's heather on the allocated day. We have not discussed the regulations that will be made under clause 30, but if they require one week's or one month's notice, the necessary number of days may not be accommodated. The landowner or farmer may not know what he is going to do until he wakes up on a particular morning and sees that the weather is appropriate for the activity that he has in mind. The number of days that is specified should accommodate such factors. I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> This crucial group of amendments has caused much concern outside the Committee. The Minister must decide whether the 28-„day period provides sufficient flexibility for proper farming activities to be carried out on the land in question. I considered whether it would be helpful to table further amendments in this context, but I decided that a Dutch auction about the number of days would not be helpful. I am not convinced that the 90-day period, which was proposed by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice), is the right answer. However, I ask the Minister to justify a 28-day exclusion, which I suspect would be inadequate in many cases to deal with proper agricultural practice. It is especially difficult to see how a double lambing could be accommodated in that time. Furthermore, if there are competing interests on the same land, such as shooting and sheep, as soon as one takes a bite out of the 28 days, the other activity would become impossible.
<P>
The Minister might say that that is accommodated by clause 22, which we shall discuss in due course, and that the ability of the authorities to respond to pressure from farmers or landowners in those circumstances would accommodate such a request, and that might be the case where there is good will on all sides. The trouble is that those who run farm businesses on their land need to be certain that they will have scope to undertake their proper agricultural activities and they do not want to be bound by a decision taken by a bureaucracy, which, however well intentioned, might not be fully acquainted with their circumstances. A period of 28 days is too tight a straitjacket. I remain to be persuaded by the Minister that there is a reasonable rationale behind that figure, other than the fact that it is used in other legislation, as the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and I suspect is the reason.
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): I agree entirely with those remarks about the 28-day exclusion. That period is clearly insufficient, bearing in mind that the lambing period on any normal farm is likely to be from 56 to 90 days in order to try to catch the various markets. The in-bye land and the ffridd land in Wales is vital at lambing time when the lambs are released on to new grass. Therefore, it is crucial that the period should be extended. I, too, am curious about the 28-day period, which does not seem to make much sense in agricultural terms. I know that the Minister will say that landowners can apply for a further extension under clause 22, but when we know that it is patently insufficient, should we not think about extending the maximum from the outset? The last thing that farmers want is to have to rush back and forth to ask for extensions; they want to get on with their farming and to try to catch the markets, and 28 days is not enough. Twice that amount of time would perhaps be more appropriate, although I am not sure about 90 days. I know that the Minister will say that it will be possible to apply for an extension, but should the occupier have to apply for extensions when we already know that the 28-day period is insufficient?
<P>
Hitherto, we have not referred to the danger to wildlife from exclusions of 28 days. Many species of ground-nesting birds on the highlands, such as the curlew, stone curlew, golden plover and others, will undoubtedly take far longer than 28 days to lay two clutches of eggs and rear their chicks. In some cases, that will take from late May to mid-August, which is far longer than 28 days. Given that the Government would not accept the reasonable amendment to limit a dog's leash when there are already problems with a dwindling bird population, I hope that they will reconsider the amendment because I am quite sure that 28 days is not long enough to protect upland birds in the nesting season.

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I wholeheartedly supported the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire in support of the amendments. However, I am concerned by the contribution from the Liberal Democrat and the Welsh nationalist Benches—if that is the correct expression. Those may serve to divert the debate in a way that would make it possible for the Minister to ignore my hon. Friend's comments. The thrust of the hon. Members' remarks was that the 28 days would apply to land management, making it easy for the Minister to say that they do not understand the Bill. The Bill explicitly excludes land management from the 28 days. The 28 days are an addition to lambing and other land management activities. The Minister shakes his head. I may have misunderstood the clause in which case I apologise in advance.
<P>
Under clause 22, it will be possible for a farmer to have a specified exclusion period every year—for example, for lambing on the hills. That could be for a period of three or six months—however long is needed—for every year without re-application. [Interruption.] I apologise if I have misunderstood the clause as the mutterings in the Committee suggest that I have. Surely the 28 days are in addition to legitimate land management pursuits. Therefore the primary purpose would be for recreational purposes, not for land management purposes, particularly, in this case, in regard to shooting.
<P>
It is important that we consider carefully the importance of a shooting estate. It is too easy for Labour Members to see shooting as the prerogative of the very rich, and therefore not worth their consideration. However, the economic viability of many areas depends on shooting, and the Government should recognise that, for the purpose of managing a shooting moor, 28 days is inadequate.
<P>
In that context, it would be useful if the Minister were to define precisely the nature of land management, which is one of the most loosely defined concepts in the Bill. Does land management—as I mentioned in my earlier intervention—include the cull of red deer, hinds in particular, which is usually carried out in the cold months of January and February? If land management includes the culling of red deer, that would be in addition to the 28 days, which would otherwise be used for the management of the grouse moor crop, which might take place subsequently. That distinction is important. Some may argue that some types of rough shooting—for example, the shooting of vermin—would also constitute land management. The distinctions between game shooting and sport shooting and land management is important in the context of the 28-day period.
<P>
If I have misread the clauses, forgive me. In responding to the debate it would be useful if, rather than concentrate on legitimate land management activities covered by clause 22, the Minister concentrated on those things which, from my reading of the clause, are not land management and operation of a shooting moor.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Clause 21 deals with exclusion from access for up to 28 days without giving any reason, and clause 22 is about land management. It is important that we do not stray too far and that we stick to the relevant clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Clearly, this is an important set of amendments. The Government accept that there may well be a need to restrict access from time to time for short periods to ensure that access does not interfere with certain uses of land, such as shooting. Giving owners the absolute discretion to restrict or exclude access for up to 28 days each year without needing anyone's approval—whatever those 28 days are used for—fully meets all reasonable needs. I shall argue the case at more length, but to prevent people from sitting on the edge of their seats as they wait to see if I come up with another figure, I will tell them now that I will not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Does not the hon. Gentleman wish to hear the wider case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I do wish to hear the Minister justify the wider case, but I also want to clarify something. He said that it will be open to eligible people, such as owners, to close land without regard to anyone else, but that that will be subject to regulations made under clause 30(1)(a), which could relate to the amount of notice that they have to give. That will affect how far ahead they have to plan and place constraints on them. It is not an unfettered right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman is conscientious. He is correct. There will be a limited restriction.
<P>
It would not be reasonable to extend the limit to 90 days. Indeed, the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) got carried away with his own eloquence. Not content with three months, he suggested six months. We could just think of a number and double it, but 90 days is the proposed period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The right hon. Gentleman said that I want to extend the 28-day period to three or even six months. I was referring to the period of land management in clause 22, which is different from 28 days. His assertion is wrong. We suggested 90 days which is, of course, three months.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Whether it is land management in clause 22 or discretionary closure, the fact remains that 90 days, or the 180 days that the hon. Gentleman suggested, is out of proportion to the Bill's aims. The effect of amendment No. 283 on public access to open countryside is obvious. With the exclusion of weekends and bank holidays, the discretionary powers alone would allow land to be closed for up to four and a half months each year. People could be barred from access land for almost every weekday of the summer. That would frustrate the purpose of the legislation and result in a system of such restricted access that the new right would not operate in practice. Opposition Members forswore a desire to undercut the Bill's motive but, even with an objective and fair approach, amendment No. 283 is downright contrary to its purpose. There is no question of accepting it.
<P>
We must not forget that, in addition to the right of discretionary closure or restriction, landowners can still apply to the appropriate authority for restrictions or closures for reasons of land management or safety. That should not often prove necessary, but it provides a further safeguard for the livelihood of landowners without unnecessarily curtailing the new right of access. If the Opposition are sincere about not wishing to frustrate the aim of the legislation, I would hope that they will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Will the Minister respond to my point on the 12 or 14-week nesting period of grounds nesting birds? This is not part of a smoke-and-mirrors operation to ruin the Bill, but I am worried about the future of the birds and their habitat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> We have discussed dogs, and I recognise that there is a real issue. The Bill specifically provides that they must be on leads whenever they are in the vicinity of livestock, which is not just sheep. I am determined to enforce that.
<P>
As for amendments Nos. 216 and 217, commercial shooting is one of the few activities that might not be compatible with public access to open countryside. People who manage moors might want to exclude or restrict access to such land. I am not persuaded, however, of the need for an increase in the number of days available for closure as of right for land used for shooting. I listened carefully to the remarks made by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, but I disagree with him on this matter. My understanding is that grouse moors are unlikely to sustain shooting even for 28 days, let alone for 40 days. I accept that shooting may occur for more than 28 days on some large estates, but shooting is unlikely to cover the whole of such estates. There is nothing to prevent closures on particular parts of an estate.
<P>
It is important to remember that the Bill gives landowners considerable flexibility in the use of the 28 days. The exclusion or restriction of access applies to any area or parcel of land—whether large or small—rather than to an entire landholding. The landowner or entitled person will be permitted to exclude access to any area as long as the total number of days on which the public are excluded from that particular area does not exceed 28 days in any one year. Those involved in grouse moor management will therefore be able to close or restrict access to different parts of their land for up to 28 days each. That makes a considerable difference to the understanding of what is involved in 28-day discretionary disclosures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Minister is right; it does make a difference. I reflected on that in my own remarks, and picked up on the Under-Secretary's comments on the matter. The ability to close off parts of an area helps landowners and goes some way towards meeting our concerns; it would be churlish not to admit that. However, I should like to return to the number of days on which shooting may occur. The Minister is right that a large-scale driven grouse moor will not sustain 28 days' shooting in a year. Indeed, nobody would expect to be able to shoot that many times on the whole moor.
<P>
However, there are many other forms of grouse shooting. It is common for a small group of three, four or five people to use dogs to flush out the birds in front of them. Such groups can also use pointers or setters to mark the location of the bird before it is flushed. Such activities can occur on almost every day of the season and can, of course, occur on different parts of the moor. The Minister will say that the parts issue will therefore come into play in respect of them. I am trying to say, however, that one will not know in the morning which part it will be, as its location will depend on the direction of the wind, the time of day and many other factors. All sorts of considerations come into play in deciding where to go on a particular day and in deciding where the birds might be. Any gamekeeper will support that statement. That is my difficulty with the parts issue. If a decision is not made until the morning in question, I am not sure how any regulatory requirements can be met.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point, which is perfectly fair. He is saying that one cannot allocate different parts of an estate in a nice, convenient and mathematical way in order to maximise the use of different parcels to get the most out of 28 days. I accept that, but it does not mean that one cannot get a great deal more out of the provision from the fact that it applies to small parcels and not to entire estates. The argument that it is highly restrictive might apply if only one day of use of a small parcel would count as one day for the whole estate, but that is not the case. Although such use will not be mathematically maximised, I believe that the Bill optimises the benefit to landowners, and there is good evidence to suggest that it will meet their reasonable needs.
<P>
5.30 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> For the avoidance of any doubt on this issue, because the ability to anatomise the land into parcels is important, will the parcels of land be defined by the owner or the entitled person and not by any other person? In other words, can such a person identify an area of land, irrespective of natural features or anything else on the map, as the land to which a restriction will apply for that particular day?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I think that that is correct if I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly. I repeat. One can close a parcel of land, however large or small, for up to 28 days. [Interruption.] I am grateful to receive confirmation of what I was saying. One can close a parcel of land so long as that particular parcel of land is not closed or restricted for more than 28 days in any one year. There is no limitation on the way in which the owner or other entitled person can divide up the land for the purposes of closure in order to gain the greatest benefit from the 28 days. To request more days' closure, unreasonably presupposes an inherent conflict between access and land management. I do not accept that assumption. One needs to keep a sense of proportion. I take the point about dogs. I feel strongly on that issue, as does the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. However, responsible access on foot will not generally have a serious impact on most land management activities. 
<P>
The Government believes that a power to exclude or restrict access for up to 28 days in any one year as of right is more than adequate, and that an increase is not justified. Bearing in mind that this provides much more leeway for the owner than might be apparent on first sight, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B> Mr. Paice:</B> The Minister has attempted to allay our concerns, and, to a certain extent, with his reference to the ability to close off parcels of land, he has done so. But the practicalities of doing that will be harder than he believes. We shall perhaps examine that when we come to the regulations issue under clause 30, and at a later date, when the regulations are promulgated, when we shall see how we will get round the problem of notice. There is not only a matter of informing the authorities, but also of informing the walker. We have already discussed that issue and we will probably discuss it again. The question is how to inform the walker that a parcel of land is being closed off, perhaps on the very day of closure. The Minister has not fully taken into account the practicalities.
<P>
The Opposition went for a larger number of days to cover every eventuality. I want to disabuse the Minister of the idea that we are seeking to negate the impact of the Bill. I myself said that 90 days was not an absolute figure. Nor did we intend that it be added to every weekend, which is how the Minister arrived at four and a half months. There was never any intention, for example, to close a moor for four and a half months. I do not understand why he said that.
<P>
The other issue is land management, as raised by my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire. The Minister's response suggested that the activities that might come under the definition of land management would be covered by the 28 days. Some of them would be. However, to suggest that ordinary land management or farm management can be carried out at the same time as unfettered access is allowed stretches credulity. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy referred to lambing, which certainly takes longer than 28 days. I shall say again in a moment that it certainly does not stop at weekends. The other aspect is the gathering of livestock. I assure the Minister that the task of gathering sheep off the hill is a hard enough at any time; to have to do it with walkers all over the place would make it impossible. Those are several reasons why 28 days is not adequate.
<P>
We shall obviously want to reflect on the matter and on the responses that we receive from Ministers to the amendments that we are shortly to debate, because they will affect how the needs and requirements of landowners will fit with the obligation to allow access. For the moment, Mr. Malins, we shall not pursue the subject. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made, No. 438, in page 12, line 5, leave out second `access'.—[Mr. Meacher.]

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The amendments follow on from those that we debated a moment ago. Amendment No. 284 would partly remove the number of days on which entitled persons may exclude or restrict access. That is suggested for the same reasons that we discussed on the earlier amendments. I imagine that the Minister will want to ensure that 28 days is still adequate.
<P>
The amendments deal also with the illogicality that all Saturdays and Sundays, Christmas day, Good Friday and all bank holidays should be excluded. In other words, the Bill suggests that all the rights of the owner, occupier or shooting tenant should be held in abeyance for those days. That is absurd. I made the point earlier that things must often be decided on the spur of the moment. One does not know what the weather will do; the only day when it is dry enough to burn heather may be a Sunday. If a landowner has just suffered three or four weeks of wet weather, it is entirely unreasonable to suggest that he should forgo one dry day simply because it is a Saturday or Sunday. The weather does not know which day of the week it is, and that one dry day may the only day for a long time that is convenient for that activity, or the other activities that we discussed earlier, including gathering sheep.
<P>
More important, however, is the fact that some things are best done at weekends. I am glad that the Minister accepts that shooting is a critical activity on some land. It often takes place on Saturdays or on bank holidays, although not on Sundays. That leads me to amendments Nos. 373 and 334, which deal with the problem in different ways. Saturdays are a prime day for shooting because, for the vast majority of the population, it is a leisure day. I expect that the Minister will want to exclude restrictions on access on Saturdays for precisely the same reason. I presume that walkers will want to walk on the same day that shooters will want to shoot. It is therefore unreasonable to suggest that they should not be able to do so on that day.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Helen Brinton </B>(Peterborough): Walking is, of course, a social and family activity. Often, the only time that families have the chance to walk or ramble together is at the weekend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am tempted to say so what. Many other activities are social. Of course I realise that families often go walking together. I hasten to add that families also go shooting together. The hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) laughs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice </B>(Pendle): I am allowed to laugh.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The hon. Gentleman is allowed to laugh, but he displays the utter ignorance that that laughter show—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. No sedentary interventions, please.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The fact is that families do go shooting. I do, and my sons often come shooting with me; indeed, my wife accompanies me. It is quite commonplace for shooting parties to contain several members of families.
<P>
That sort of intervention demonstrates the absolute blindness with which some Labour Members address the matter. They do not understand that such activities are just as much a part of many people's social calendar—as is walking—as they are an economic activity. I contend that the opportunity to do those things is important, particularly on Saturdays and bank holidays, but less so on Sundays, although lamb management is still needed on Sunday. I do not understand why the Government seem to think those activities should be excluded.
<P>
Finally, we return to lamb management and lambing. Sheep will not stop lambing simply because it is Saturday or Sunday—or even the Easter weekend. The last weekend in April is a peak lambing period. If farmers cannot close the land, walkers will interrupt the lambing.
<P>
Subsection (6) is a questionable provision. It severely hampers the ability of landowners and others with an interest in the land to use it for their purposes, while endeavouring to ensure that walking is allowed. We have no desire to stop walkers using the land, but their use must be commensurate with that of others who have an interest in the land. There should be equal opportunity. In my view, subsection (6) tilts that balance too far in one direction. I hope that the Minister will agree that at least Saturday should be removed, but preferably the whole provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): I have some sympathy with the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. First, I can see that the provision would allow an intervention in the normal commercial exploitation of a property owner's rights. The examples given are not necessarily ones that I would have chosen, never having shot, but I can imagine a landowner choosing to allow part of his or her property to be used for motorcross events or other leisure activities, such as outdoor rock concerts, that would require the exclusion of the public for safety reasons, or seeking to charge access for such an event and so not being able to allow individuals to walk across the land.
<P>
Such events are likely to be held at weekends or on bank holidays. They are rare, and I would not wish to make them a major objection to the provision. However, the Bill is straightforwardly inflexible on the subject. It allows no possibility of running such events on weekends or bank holidays. I shall listen with interest to what the Minister has to say in reply to the debate. I hope that he will bear in mind that the land could be put to a variety of legitimate uses. They may cater for minority interests, which have been pursued harmlessly, intervening little with the pleasure of walkers, but which might now be completely banned.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I wish to speak to amendment No. 477. I presume that the Government have included a weekend and bank holiday exclusion in the clause because they are trying to deal with landowners who wish the Bill ill. Such landowners want to wreck provisions for walkers and prevent open access to their land by allocating their specified days on Saturdays and Sundays. I understand why the Government want to deal with that, but the Bill as drafted errs in the other direction, and that is regrettable.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) rightly said, recreational activities often take place on a Saturday or Sunday, but there is another very important issue. As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire noted, agricultural activities do not simply stop at the weekends, although it would be blissful for many of my farmer constituents if they did. They would love not to have to get up on a Saturday or Sunday morning during, say, the lambing period. It would be nice if all the ewes knocked off on Friday until the following Monday morning, but they do not. The Bill must be sufficiently flexible to cope with such realities.
<P>
As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, one need only consider what happens every Easter, which, although it is a moveable feast, falls within the lambing period. Under the Bill, there will be a four-day block in which closure for the perfectly sound reason of lamb management will not be permitted unless one applies through clause 22 procedures. That is an onerous requirement for landowners. As we all know, farming changes from day to day—it is not an exact science, particularly when one is dealing with livestock. To some extent, one must go with the flow and be able to take decisions on livestock management at short notice.
<P>
The amendment recognises the Government's legitimate intentions, but it would add a little flexibility. It would specify that it would be inappropriate for a landowner to close land through the clause's discretionary power for more than four Saturdays and Sundays in each calendar year. That would allow the recreational events that the hon. Member for South Derbyshire postulated to take place, while allowing the sheep farmer to close land in the lambing period and go about his normal business without wrecking walkers' access to the countryside.
<P>
I commend my amendment to the Minister. If he does not like its wording or the precise prescription that I have put forward, he should at least recognise the case for flexibility. If people are to be allowed to use their land in the most effective and sensible way without preventing proper access, something other than the provision in clause 22 is needed. I ask the Minister to consider that matter carefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Clause 21(6) disturbs the balance that the Minister has been so careful to reiterate time and again. The clause will allow people to manage their land sensibly by excluding access for 28 days. On the other hand, subsection (6) will bizarrely prevent people from excluding access on a Saturday—that is particularly important—a Sunday or various other public holidays. There are many reasons why reasonable people who manage land might want to exclude the public for a block of time. That period might be only four or five days if sheep were lambing; it might be a longer period if a rare bird was nesting and breeding, or a particular flower was in bloom. In my constituency, we have some very rare fritillary meadows, and it is important to keep people off them for up to seven days. However, if that period were to occur over a Saturday or Sumday, or over another of the specified holidays, the landowner could not enforce that closure. The owner could, in those circumstances, apply under the clause 22 procedure, and I am sure that the Minister will pray that in aid when he replies However, the problem with that procedure is that it is administratively cumbersome and involves a subjective judgment by someone else.
<P>
It seems reasonable that a person who owns or has an interest in land should be free to exercise his judgment as to when he wishes to exclude the public, as there may be good reasons for so doing. I hope that the Minister will think again, because subsection (6) is one of the more unfortunate measures in the Bill. I have followed the deliberations on the Bill in a spirit of reasonableness, but this subsection does not fit easily with the balance to which the Minister has been so careful to allude on so many occasions.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> To pick up on the last words of the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), this is very much a question of balance. I appreciate the force of the argument put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire as well as by Opposition Members. In drafting the clause, we considered carefully the nature and extent of any limits on discretionary closures. It is a matter of striking a balance between the needs of those managing the land and the need to avoid unnecessary restrictions on those exercising the right of access. I shall try to explain why we have reached this judgment.
<P>
When we issued our ``Framework for Action'' document, we proposed that landowners should have the right to close their land or otherwise restrict access for 28 days, mainly for land management purposes, but with perhaps up to 12 of those days being for any reason. As hon. Members will be aware, there is no such split in the Bill between the days available for land management and those available for other reasons. That is because, on further reflection, we believed that it would be simpler to permit landowners to close their land, or to restrict access, for up to 28 days each year for any reason without making any such distinction.
<P>
The ``Framework for Action'' document also indicated that provision would be made to ensure that access was not restricted unreasonably at peak times, which leads nicely to the first amendment in this group. Amendment No. 284 would, in theory, allow access land to be closed for more than half of all Saturdays and Sundays and almost all bank holidays. I accept that that would be the worst-case scenario, but it could not be ruled out. The possibility of large tracts of land being out of bounds every weekend throughout the summer cannot be reconciled with our aim of giving people more opportunities to walk in hitherto no-go areas. I hope that the hon. Gentleman would agree that that would not strike a reasonable balance between the interests of walkers and land managers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I would be grateful if the Minister would explain how he arrived at the conclusion that our amendment would lead to closures on more than half of Saturdays and Sundays as well as all bank holidays. Given the 28-day rule, which we have already debated—and which the Government will stand by—it would involve only two days more than the number of Saturdays or Sundays in a half year. There are 26 Saturdays in a half year, or 26 Sundays, or eight or nine bank holidays. Either the 28-day rule will apply or it will not. The most that it could be is 28 Saturdays or 28 Sundays, which is less likely anyway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> If I said Saturdays and Sundays, I was wrong. The hon. Gentleman is right: it is Saturdays or Sundays. I apologise. It was a slip on my part.
<P>
To be fair, Opposition Members have proposed other more reasonable amendments. Amendment No. 373 would, for example, give landowners the automatic right to close their land on Saturdays, but not on Sundays or public holidays, while amendment No. 334 would provide for closures as of right on Saturdays for the purpose of shooting. Amendment No. 373 would still allow owners intent on frustrating access—we cannot rule out the possibility that there may be a few of those—to close the whole of their land or key parts of it for any reason on alternate Saturdays throughout the year. The effect of amendment No. 334 would be similar, but only in relation to land used for shooting. In this case a notification procedure would presumably be needed to inform the relevant authorities where land was used for shooting. I am not convinced that we should pursue the idea of further notification and authentication processes, given that we wish to apply a light touch and avoid extra layers of bureaucracy.
<P>
Amendment No. 477, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, again reflects a genuine attempt—I pay him a tribute here—to balance flexibility for land managers with the need to avoid unjustified restrictions on access. It would, however, give land managers the opportunity to close, as of right, their land or parts of it for longer continuous periods up to four weeks without needing to seek prior approval. I am not sure that we can justify providing in the Bill for shutting open countryside to the public for a whole month without giving any reason.
<P>
We wish people to feel reasonably confident that access land will be open at least at weekends. My hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Mrs. Brinton) made the point that that is when people want to use the countryside, as we all know, but I understand the force of the argument that it is also the time when shooting families may wish to have a family outing or that owners may wish to use their land for their own purposes. I accept that there is a conflict. My problem is to find a way of reconciling the two views that does not severely or drastically undermine the purpose of the Bill for the majority of people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does the Minister accept that, if the clause remains in the Bill, certain people will never again be able to shoot on their land on a Saturday, for reasons of safety?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I would have to look at the implications of that. My immediate reaction is that that is not the case, but I shall return to that point rather than try to give an off-the-cuff response.
<P>
Nothing that we propose to do to limit the days when landowners can automatically close their land will affect their right to apply to the countryside bodies or national park authorities for further closures on any day of the year, where they have legitimate reasons for doing so, for example for land management.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> This is perhaps something that we need to deal with on clause 22, but it might be helpful if the Minister gave am indication of the Government's thinking in this respect. What lead time does he conceive of there being for an application under clause 22, which he is praying in aid here, for a closure over a weekend in exceptional circumstances associated with lambing, another agricultural activity or shooting? How quickly would the authorities turn around an application and, therefore, how far ahead would a landowner or user have to think or be prescient about, for example, weather conditions?
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The relevant authority should deal with an application extremely quickly, but it would not be right to specify the time scale in the Bill. It is another matter that should be worked out on the basis of best practice. Applications should be made as early as possible—the relevant authority will decide whether sufficient notice has been given if an application is made at the very last minute. It is not for me to specify how many hours that might be.
<P>
I accept that the 28-days' discretion gives landowners a simple way to close their land for any reason, without seeking approval. However, I would expect that a landowner who had genuine reasons to restrict access to his or her land on peak days of the year would be sufficiently motivated to seek closure from the decision-making bodies and that those bodies would assess the application carefully, as well as quickly. It is a difficult issue, and it is impossible to find a resolution of this dilemma that is entirely satisfactory to all parties. We have to make a judgment. We have thought long and hard about it, and our judgment is that we have got it right in the Bill.
<P>
I would ask the hon. Gentleman, in the light of that explanation, and taking account of the Government's considerations in putting the Bill forward, to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Minister has tried to be conciliatory, and the Government have thought long and hard about the issue and about how to strike a balance that, as he said, is impossible to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Satisfactorily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Yes.
<P>
The Bill creates an uneven balance and is tilted too far in favour of the walker. The Minister said that he does not want the purpose of the Bill to be frustrated by malevolent landlords—nor do I. However, it is interesting that, although the Minister believes that there may be such landlords, he is much less willing to believe that there may be walkers who are in the same category. No group in society is entirely pure, and there will be those in all categories with whom we disagree, be they landowners or walkers. I share the Minister's view that we should not allow people to frustrate the Bill's purpose by using the provisions unreasonably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my hon. Friend recall the Minister's saying that he did not think that there would be any diminution in the value of the land? Would not the prevention of shooting on a piece of land on a Saturday be obvious proof of the diminution of the value of the land?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend, who is a chartered surveyor, has put his finger on an important point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> In that case, perhaps I could answer it. It is not the case that the Bill would prevent shooting on Saturdays. The hon. Member for Cotswold knows the answer to his own question—he gave it earlier. The landowner will be able to apply for a direction closing land or restricting access on Saturdays under clause 22, which deals with land management closures. That is the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question. The issue of loss of value will not arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> That is a helpful intervention. What the Minister is saying—and it is not the interpretation that I would have made—touches on the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire that shooting is a land management issue. If clause 22 applies to shooting, as the Minister said, it becomes a land management issue, which certainly applies to pest control and deer control, I would not have thought that it would normally apply to grouse shooting, for example, but I am happy to accept the Minister's assurance that it does. The Minister looks glum. Perhaps he is hoping that he was right and that he will not regret his words. We take them at face value and if he is right, it will make a difference.
<P>
My only other point is that clause 22 will involve rigidity and bureaucracy, which the Minister seems in every other respect to want to minimise. He is saying that landowners would have to go through a bureaucratic process under clause 22 to put the exclusion in place so that shooting could take place on a Saturday or any other day.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Derbyshire made an important and valid contribution and rightly referred to other activities that could take place on access land.
<P>
On the lambing issue, which is central to such land, it seemed from what the Minister said that under clause 22 a farmer would be able to apply for an annual exclusion of 40 days, 42 days, six weeks or whatever period he chose, including weekends, to cover the lambing season on ffridd land or in-bye land to which the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy referred. The landowner could say that he lambs on a piece of land every year during the second half of April and May and that he wants it excluded. That is my interpretation of what the Minister said about land management and exclusions, but we can return to the matter when we come to clause 22.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is inconsistency between what the Minister said about that and his assertion that very few applications would be required under clause 22? He said that the original 28-day exclusion would cover most circumstances, but the two issues cannot be equated—either exclusion will be necessary for lambing and, we have now been told, for shooting, or it will not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The problem is not just the 28 days because the weekend issue compounds it. If the 28-day period were increased, it would not cover the problem of ewes not calling a halt on Friday night. There will be innumerable applications under clause 22 and some will be less worthy than others. That is inevitable if encouragement is given to use of the clause. The Minister made it clear that he does not envisage clause 22 being used to a great extent, but I fear that he will be proven wrong.
<P>
My intention was to seek a vote on amendment No. 373, because it covers a key issue, but in the light of the Minister's intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold when he appeared to say that shooting is a land management issue and will be covered under clause 22, it might be churlish to pursue that. I am hoping that the Minister is right in what he said and that on reflection he will not have to return to the Committee and apologise again for misleading us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> Although we shall soon turn to the question of what is a land management issue and what is not—and I shall listen to carefully to that discussion—it does not deal with my objection about leisure-based activities that are part of the commercial purpose of the person who owns the land. I take the point that was made by the hon. Member for Cotswold about the potential income issues involved in someone choosing to pursue on their land a leisure business activity that requires exclusion but is not a land management activity. I cited a couple of examples, including the promotion of a rock concert, which might fit that bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> As I said earlier, I had been having second thoughts about seeking to divide the Committee on amendment No. 373. However, the hon. Member for South Derbyshire has persuaded me that the Minister has not responded to his points and that there are other valid reasons why Saturday should be an allowed day for exclusion under the 28-day rule. I therefore intend to press amendment No. 373, and look forward to the hon. Gentleman's support.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Clause 22 was mentioned several times during the previous debate. As some of the background is clearly understood, I shall not take up the Committee's time by repeating it.
<P>
Amendment No. 374 would prevent the applications of those with an interest in the land from being turned down because of the free 28 days. I believe even more strongly now, having reflected on the previous debate, that two issues arise here. The first concerns the 28 days, which is a relatively free opportunity for landowners to close their land, although it is not entirely free because of the regulations that will be promulgated; the second is the more restrictive provisions of the clause, even given the Minister's comments about its scope and the term ``land management''. Therefore, the land management issue should be viewed separately from the 28 days, not only for that reason, but because of the Saturday, Sunday and bank holiday issue.
<P>
The Bill would allow the relevant authority to discriminate against a person who sought closure for, say, heather burning, on the ground that he had not used up his 28-day quota. As such work must often be undertaken on the spur of the moment according to the weather, it is perhaps unrealistic to expect the 28-day quota to be used, if the regulations require—I know that I am speculating—a period of notice that it would be impossible to give. Therefore, at certain times of the year it should be possible to close anyway.
<P>
Amendment No. 375 addresses the point of contention in the previous debate: what is land management? The amendment gives a list. It is not intended to be an exclusive list, because hon. Members will have noted paragraph (f), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>other activities considered by the access authority to be appropriate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, it is intended to identify the key areas, such as all activities carried out for the purposes of agriculture and the conservation or improvement of the natural flora of the land. That may involve protecting orchids, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold referred earlier, or various other ways of protecting or improving. Earlier in the Committee's proceedings the re-seeding of heather moorland was mentioned. It is essential that people stay away for a considerable time while the land re-establishes itself. The list also includes the control of invasive plants. I have already mentioned the aerial spraying of bracken, a terribly invasive and damaging plant on moorland, which is also very bad for wildlife. Pest control is self-explanatory. The list also includes the management of the land for purposes of shooting or stalking.
<P>
It does not include the rock festivals to which the hon. Member for South Derbyshire referred. I am not sure how we can address that issue now, as even he seems to have backed off it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> I did not want them to be restricted on Saturdays.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The hon. Gentleman will have to hold his rock festivals on Monday to Friday, assuming that it is not a bank holiday Monday or Good Friday However, I suspect that that will have a deleterious effect on attendance.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 375 is clear. It is an attempt at defining the phrase ``management of the land'', so that we understand what it means. Unusually, nowhere else in the Bill is land management or management of the land defined, although there are other examples and on an earlier group of amendments we spent some time considering what cultivation meant. The list is intended to be comprehensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman help me on one point? In paragraph (f) does the hon. Gentleman mean ``relevant authority'' rather than ``access authority''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> If the Government are sympathetic to the amendment, I should be more than happy to accept that that might be more appropriate. That is a valid comment and I should be happy with that alternative wording. A little optimism is bursting within me at the thought that the Under-Secretary is considering such a small issue . The fact that he even read the amendment to the last line is something.
<P>
I shall dampen my optimism until I have heard his response. We have made a serious attempt to deal with the matter, which has been discussed by many organisations. The Country Landowners Association and the National Farmers Union both support the principle and believe that we need to establish what land management means. I hope that the Under-Secretary looks favourably on the amendment, even if the odd word in it is inappropriate. I hope that the Government agree with the intention that lies behind amendment No. 375, which seeks to define ``management of the land''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I refer the Committee to page 9 of the notes on clauses, which are not very helpful. However, I am sure that the fact that this is not the first time that notes on clauses have not been very useful has nothing to do with those currently on the Government Benches.
<P>
Paragraph 36 on page 9 of the notes on clauses states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Exclusions or restrictions for the purposes of land management, the prevention of fire, the prevention of danger to the public, nature conservation, heritage, defence or national security may be for a fixed period or may take place at a time to be determined by a designated person.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 37 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The authority must take into consideration the use made or intended to be made by the applicant of his discretionary power to exclude or restrict access for up to 28 days.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I regret to say that I think that the Minister was wrong to say that family operations such as lambing will come within the Bill's ambit. I hope that he is right but, with respect, I do not think that he is. The Under-Secretary has every opportunity to come to his rescue.
<P>
Proposed new paragraph (a) in amendment No. 375 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>activities carried out for the purposes of agriculture.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that provision were added to the Bill, the Minister would appear to be in the clear, although he might have to take appropriate action subsequently. I am sure that the Government will give due consideration to this important amendment. My interpretation of the Bill suggests that the Minister is wrong in this regard. If he is, I am sure that the matter will be considered subsequently. The amendment appears to clarify the position—if it were agreed to, a better definition of land management would be added to the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I have just received some late post, which is not entirely legible.
<P>
The amendments would introduce into the Bill a definition of land management. The proposed definition is, in some respects, rather narrow. Although it would allow access authorities to sanction other activities, the amendment might cast doubts on the possibility of closures for, for example, motor racing, war games, training racehorses or waste processing activities, which we heard about earlier.
<P>
The Government's intention is that the concept of land management should be treated flexibly and should be capable of taking into account less common or new forms of land management activity. We want clause 22 to function as a flexible tool that can respond to the legitimate—I stress that word—needs of land managers. Indeed, the expression ``land managers'' is generic—land managers are restricted to managing not agricultural land but land that is used for a wide variety of purposes. We expect the expression ``land management'' in the clause to be interpreted in the same open way. The clause is vital to, and exists to protect, the interests of those involved in managing land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> I have a lot of sympathy with what my hon. Friend is saying. He mentioned motor racing as a possible example of land management with which he has some sympathy. In essence, the management of land for a commercial, or any other, purpose seems the probable definition in his mind. Perhaps he could give some further relevant examples.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The main point is that we want the clause to be interpreted as flexibly as is necessary, and we do not want it to be confined by an amendment that attempts to define it. Once one tries to establish what a clause means, one necessarily excludes factors that one cannot immediately call to mind. As I said, the clause is intended to serve and protect the interests of those involved in managing land. It will be for the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales to draw up criteria to illustrate activities that would be included under the term ``land management''. I know that the agency will wish to consult on those criteria with, among others, the National Countryside Access Forum, which represents key land management interests.
<P>
I do not want Opposition members of the Committee to run away with the idea that land management should be used as an excuse for wholesale closure of, or restrictions on, access land. I want to place on record the Government's firm view that the new statutory right of access is not—I stress, not—generally incompatible with land management. One has to pinch oneself from time to time during these discussions to recall that we are talking about people who walk across uncultivated open countryside. We firmly believe that, with relatively rare exceptions, responsible access can happily co-exist with effective land management, as it already does in many parts of the country. Nevertheless, we recognise that there may be a few cases where walking can pose problems. Commercial shooting or motor sports are perhaps two examples, but even those activities must be undertaken for a relatively limited number of days each year. Those are precisely the sort of circumstances in which we would expect the 28 discretionary days to be used in the first instance. Moreover, such activities would not necessarily justify complete closure of the land; other measures or restrictions may be more appropriate. Closure of land to all access should be seen as a last resort.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire asked whether landowners will be able to use the 28-day period as they wish. To avoid any misunderstanding, I should emphasise that, in deciding whether to direct additional closures, the countryside bodies will be able to take into account the way in which a landowner has used the 28-day period. It is important to bear that in mind. A landowner will normally be expected to use most or all of the 28-day period for land management purposes before being allowed to close land under the clause.
<P>
A great deal has been said about access in relation to lambing. Such evidence as there is suggests that responsible access presents little in the way of a problem. I accept that dogs accompanied by walkers are likely to be more of an issue if they are not kept, as they should be, under tight control. However, the Bill specifically provides that they must be kept on leads when in the vicinity not only of sheep, but of livestock. There are already plenty of examples of rights of way crossing land that is used intensively for sheep farming.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Perhaps I can assist the Under-Secretary. Dogs, on leads or otherwise, are extremely difficult to put up with during lambing periods. The ffridd land—the in by land, in English—is the land on which young lambs are turned out for the first time. If they are disturbed on the in by land, they will never make it to the heath, because they will not know their cynefin—that is the Welsh word for it; I am not sure of the English translation—
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Hefting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. It will be impossible to accommodate the lambs at any point if they have been confused or disturbed in any way. That is important, and I ask the Under-Secretary to reconsider the matter. The mere presence of a dog is detrimental, however responsible 99 per cent. of dog owners might be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I accept that the hon. Gentleman is making a serious point, which is important to the livelihoods of many of his constituents and others. However, I repeat that access already exists on thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of acres where lambing takes place. We accept that keeping dogs on leads during lambing is an important issue as is the issue of dogs, full stop. We are not entering completely new territory in this respect. Where responsible access has already been used, it has not generally led to problems. In areas of open countryside that are used for grazing sheep, lambing often takes place on enclosed, intensively grazed land that is excluded from the right of access. In such cases, the issue will not arise—although I recognise that in some parts of the country lambing may take place in marginal areas that fall into the definition of access land.
<P>
In conclusion, we do not support the proposals to define land management in the suggested form. Any definition of land management would tend to be exhaustive and exclusive of other possibilities, which would work against the interests of those whom the clause is intended to serve. I should add, however, that the relevant authorities will not be able to make a direction under clause 22 if it is possible to make a direction for the same purpose under clauses 23 or 24—that is, for the purposes of avoidance of fire risk, safety, nature conservation or heritage preservation.
<P>
We want the definition of land management to be capable of covering activities concerned with effective management of the land. I hope that members of the Committee agree that land management restrictions should be sought and approved only where there is good cause. The amendment would not be helpful, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the way in which he addressed the amendment, but I remain somewhat puzzled. He said that the Government want the definition of land management to be as broad as possible, which is music to our ears and allays many of our concerns. However, he coupled that with the statement that they do not want it to be used as an excuse for wholesale closure. Those two remarks appear to conflict with each other. He is encouraging people to assume that there is a wide definition of land management that will cover many elements, while at the same time vigorously flagging up the fact that the Government do not intend it to be used for wholesale closure.
<P>
During the previous debate, the Minister of State used clause 22 to avoid accepting the amendments that we tabled to clause 21 about the 28-day period and Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays.
<P>
The Government cannot have it both ways. The Minister cannot, on the one hand, say that if they need to close land on a Saturday, for example, they can use clause 22, when, on the other, the Under-Secretary says that the provision is not to be used for wholesale closure. I sense some conflict there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We are saying that shooting can possibly be carried out under the clause, but that, in considering whether to allow an application, account will be taken of the use that has been made over the previous 28 days.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that. That is a slightly different aspect that I was about to come to. If the definition is to be as broad as the Under-Secretary is implying, I am happy not to pursue our phraseology, which, as I have said many times in the Committee, may not be perfect. We do not have the Government's resources to get the wording absolutely right.
<P>
I was interested to hear the Under-Secretary say that, with responsible access, there is no problem. I agree, but the purpose of this and of other clauses is to deal with those who are irresponsible. The Minister referred to irresponsible landowners—that was not his phrase, but it was what he meant—but, equally, there are irresponsible users of access, and we must allow for both when we consider these provisions. I fear that, as a result of the Under-Secretary's comments, we may open the door to a large number of speculative applications for closure under the clause, but that is the risk that he has decided to run.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary is not suggesting that, under the clause, the 28 days must be used up before a person can make an application. As both Ministers have said that the clause can be used to address the problems of Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays, it is unrealistic to expect somebody to have used all their 28 days up on the other five days of the week. However, it makes sense that the person applying under the clause should be able to make a case that they could not accommodate the need in less than 28 days.
<P>
The Under-Secretary is busy scribbling. I do not know whether he wishes to respond before I conclude my remarks. I know that the Minister will go away and double-check that his earlier interpretation was right.

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I have another bit of late post. It is not necessary for the landowner to have used all his 28 days. It will be possible to look at the way in which he proposes to use them. Is that helpful?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> That is indeed helpful. I am glad that the Under-Secretary decided to intervene at the last possible moment. On the strength of that constructive intervention, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> I wish to speak briefly to this little group of amendments in my name.
<P>
We have had a long debate about what constitutes land management. A few moments ago the Under-Secretary said that the clause and land management could not be used as an excuse for keeping people off land. Walkers and those who enjoy the countryside fear that landowners will rush to use clause 22 as a simple way of keeping people off land.
<P>
Amendment No. 460 would oblige the relevant authority, when making a direction to close access land for the purpose of land management, to have regard to the matters set out in the amendment, including,
<P>

Amendment No. 459 covers the possibility that access may be restricted by a direction for land management reasons to specified routes or ways, providing only linear access. If that were to happen, which the Bill apparently allows, it would be restricted to a maximum period of 28 days. Under clause 25, a direction could be made to close access land for land management reasons for an indefinite period or, at least, a long period. The intention in the amendment is to tie the clause down to ensure that it is used for its proper purposes.
<P>
The other amendments are consequential upon amendments Nos. 460 and 459.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his concern to ensure that the relevant authorities take proper account of the interests of walkers, which is the purpose of the Bill. I hope that I can convince him that his amendments are not necessary for that purpose. If, as he suggests, landowners rush to exploit clause 22, they may find that they are wasting their time.
<P>
One of the underlying principles behind chapter II is that public access should not be restricted or excluded unless it is necessary to do so. Our intention is that the Bill should open up extensive areas of open country and registered common land to walkers and it would be absurd if the new opportunities were frustrated by unjustified closures or restrictions on access. Accordingly, each of the clauses permitting the making of directions provides that the relevant authority, when making a direction, must satisfy itself that the exclusion or restriction is necessary to the extent provided by the direction for the purposes specified. If the authority is not so satisfied, it must either decline to make the direction or make a different direction, which does satisfy the test.
<P>
Amendment No. 460 would require the relevant authority to test whether a direction is necessary by additionally having regard to the overall right of access and the avoidance of unreasonably restricting access for long periods or to extensive areas of land. Those matters must already be at the forefront of the decision-making body's mind. The purpose of part I of the Bill is to provide for public access and the only effect of a direction under chapter II is to limit that access in terms of time and extent. The relevant authority cannot act without being guided by the very factors to which the amendment refers.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 459 and 462 would require that any restrictions under clauses 22 and 24, which confined walkers to paths, should last no longer than 28 days in each year. Again, my hon. Friend mentioned his concern to ensure that directions under chapter II are not used as a ruse to introduce linear rather than area access. Of course, that is not the Government's intention, but we recognise that there may be circumstances in which it is necessary for walkers to keep to paths on certain sensitive sites, and at particular times of the year. In rare cases, such restrictions may be needed throughout the year.
<P>
Under the amendment, linear access could not be imposed on more than 28 days in each year, so it could reduce public access. Therefore, the only realistic alternative might be to exclude access entirely and I am sure that that is not my hon. Friend's intention. Again, I can reassure him that such long-term linear restrictions are likely to be few. In each case where such restrictions are imposed, the relevant authority will need to be satisfied that they are necessary for the intended purpose. Where they are intended to endure continuously or intermittently for more than five years, clause 25 and clause 26(4) will impose an obligation to review the direction after each period of five years.
<P>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving me the opportunity to make that clear, but I should also be grateful if he would withdraw his amendment. Mr. Prentice: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Amendment made: No. 441, in page 12, line 38, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) Where an application under this section relates to land which is not access land at the time when the application is made, the relevant authority shall not give a direction under this section unless they are satisfied that it is likely that the land will be access land during all or part of the period to which the application relates.'.—[Mr. Meacher.]<P>

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I want to examine with the Minister one small part of the clause—subsection (3)(b), which refers to:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the extent to which the applicant has exercised or proposes to exercise that right.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I want to probe the Minister about what that means. Let us imagine that 12 August fell on a Saturday and the owner of a grouse moor applied under the clause for closure of that land on that day, which is extremely important to the commercial activities of some grouse moors. Is the clause intended to enable the relevant authority to bargain in this matter by saying, ``We will grant your wish to close that land on one or more Saturdays, but you may now use your 28-day period only as a 10-day period''? I suspect that that might happen.
<P>
In a previous debate on the clause, the Minister said that if the authority is not satisfied it may make a different direction. That seems to imply that the authority would say, ``We're not satisfied that the application is reasonable, but if you reduce your right to exclude the land for 28 days under clause 21, we might be minded to grant the application.'' I wonder whether that is the sort of plea bargaining that the Minister had in mind in clause 22(3)(b).
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I do not propose to get involved in plea bargaining or negotiations on specific days; all that we can hope to do is lay down some general principles. Clearly, in the example that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, it might be possible for the relevant authorities to take into account the inability of the applicant to use his 28 days on a Saturday or Sunday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> That is what worries me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman ought not to be worried because I am making a point that is helpful to him. Perhaps I have not explained it as clearly as I should.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Amendment made: No. 442, in page 12, line 40, leave out `access'.—[Mr. Meacher.]
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 478, in page 12, line 42, leave out `, by reason of any exceptional conditions of weather,'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 479, in page 13, line 1, leave out `anything done, or proposed to be done' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`any operation being carried out, or proposed to be carried out'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 480, in page 13, line 1, after second `done', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or exceptional conditions prevailing'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I do not argue with the purpose of the clause. It is a helpful clause and I am glad that it is in the Bill. However, there are some specific applications of words in the clause that I would like to explore.
<P>
The first phrase is in line 42:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>by reason of any exceptional conditions of weather.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I query the use of that phrase because of the explicit reference to exceptionality. The clause will be open to challenge. A simple condition that the relevant authority may require closure for the purposes of fire prevention should be sufficient.
<P>
As the Minister knows, we have had a succession of hot, dry summers and there is every indication that that will continue. It may be due to global warming—I do not know. It may be that what is considered to be exceptional weather now may not always be so; it may become normal for a particular time of year. It would be sufficient for the purposes of the clause that, where the relevant authority has assessed that there is a risk of fire and a need for closure for a specific period, the authority does not then have to show, if challenged, that the weather conditions are exceptional, in order to support its view that there is a fire risk. I may be nit picking, but the Bill should not be open to unnecessary legal challenge.
<P>
Amendment No. 479 deals with the second reason for closure under the clause, specifically the protection of the public from what may be going on on the land. The difficulty lies with the use of the word ``done'', which is slightly ambiguous about timing and does not necessarily imply an operation that is contemporaneous with the closure. The form of words in the amendment makes it absolutely clear, beyond peradventure, that the closure is associated with an operation that is either taking place at the time of a closure or is proposed for the time of an anticipated closure. I want to improve the clarity of the Bill, not to obstruct it in any way, and ensure that there is no ambiguity.
<P>
Amendment No. 480 adds the phrase ``or exceptional conditions prevailing''. The Minister may be able to tell me whether there is another provision that covers this issue; I suspect that there is not. I have in mind cases in which there is a need to close land for public protection purposes that is not covered by the other circumstances described in the clause. I am thinking, for instance, of the very exceptional circumstances of the Chernobyl fallout, where there may have been sound, public safety reasons for closing areas of high land to access. Yet there may not be provision in the Bill to enable that to be done. To take another example, in the case of communicable zoonoses of various kinds, there may be public health or animal health reasons for preventing access to a certain area of land over a certain period. Again, that does not seem to be provided for in the Bill. That is the purpose of the three amendments—to aid clarity of the clause.
<P>
To avoid a stand part debate, I shall close with one last question that I hope you will consider to be in order, Mr. Malins. It relates to the qualification of subsection (1)(a) by subsection (4). If there is an overwhelming need to close land for fire purposes, the landowner should not have to use his period of 28 days: it should be completely off ration in terms of the 28-day quota. Yet it would appear that, under subsection (4)(b), the relevant authority would take that into account. That seems to be wrong. I may have misinterpreted the provision. It would assist the Committee if the Ministers made it clear whether they intend subsection (4) to qualify subsection (1)(a).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I propose to suspend the Committee until half-past eight. If a Division in the House is in progress at half-past eight, we shall sit as soon after that time as exactly coincides with 15 minutes from the start of the Division. For example, if the Division starts at 20 minutes past seven, we shall meet at 25 minutes to eight, and so on. Meanwhile, the Room will be locked.
